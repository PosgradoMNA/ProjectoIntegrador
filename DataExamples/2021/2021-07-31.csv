The 29-year-old American diver won the bronze medal in the women's 3m springboard at the Tokyo Summer Olympics on Sunday finishing with a score of 343.75. First place went to China's Tingmao Shi while Shi's teammate Han Wang won silver.

Fellow Team USA member Hailey Hernandez finished the event in ninth place.

With her medal Palmer becomes the first American woman to place in the event since Kelly McCormick did so in 1988.

Speaking to reporters during a press conference after her victory Palmer discussed having to adapt her training amid the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States last year — when the Games were delayed until this summer.

""Our pool was shut down during that time I had a friend who had a barbell and some weights"" Palmer said. ""We lifted weights in her neighborhood during the time we couldn't be in the pool … my coach was there every step of the way through the shutdowns and I'm very grateful for her to continue pushing us during that time.""

Palmer also spoke about competing in the synchronized diving event ahead of her individual competition and how that intro to the pool in Tokyo helped ease her into Sunday's final.

""Competing on this stage has been a lot of pressure for me but I think competing in synchronized really helped calm my nerves"" she explained.

Chinese diver Shi Tingmao won the women's 3m springboard gold at the Tokyo Olympic Games.

TOKYO Aug. 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese diver Shi Tingmao won the women's 3m springboard gold at the Tokyo Olympic Games here on Sunday claiming her second gold at the Tokyo Olympics.

The reigning Olympic champion had a convincing lead from the first round finishing with 383.50 points 34.75 points ahead of her compatriot Wang Han who finished second.

It is Shi's fourth Olympic gold medal after the women's synchronised 3m springboard win at Tokyo 2020 with Wang days before and two from the same events five years ago at Rio 2016.

The gold must mean so much to Shi as she cried after the final dive.

""I was nearly going to give up because of the postponement of the Games. I even feared to go to the training ground. Now I am grateful for my faith and stick to it"" said Shi.

Shi became the oldest Olympic gold medallist in the women's 3m springboard event at 29 years and 335 days.

Shi said:""Age is not a problem. It depends on how eager you are for the gold. I want the gold and I made it. I am going to get some good sleep.""

""It feels good to finish all my events today. Paris 2024? If China needs me. We will see"" said Wang Han.

Palmer improved on her 15th place finish in preliminaries by climbing up the leaderboard to fifth in the semis. Her final two dives a forward piked 3 1/2 somersault in Round Four and a forward piked 2 1/2 somersault with two twists in Round 5 were her highest marks of the Tokyo Games.

Hernandez punched her ticket to the final by nailing a tucked 2 1/2 somersault in Round 3 and staying cool under pressure during her final two dives. Though her third dive was not the most difficult her score tied for the fourth highest of the round. The 18-year-old did not expect to compete in Tokyo and instead had planned to dive at the Junior National Championships in Indianapolis. Now she'll advance to an Olympic diving final three years ahead of schedule.

Unsurprisingly two Chinese divers sit at the top of the rankings heading into the final round. Reigning Olympic champion Shi Tingmao and Wang Han qualified to the individual competition in the 1-2 spots just days after winning gold as a pair in the women's synchronized 3m springboard final.

Canada's Pamela Ware finished fourth in preliminaries and looked to be a lock for finals until she failed to complete a dive in Round 5 and finished in 18th. The country will still have a chance at a medal though as Jennifer Abel replicated her third-place finish from preliminaries."

Abbott acknowledges report Buffalo Bills considering relocating to Central Texas,"AUSTIN Texas (CBSDFW.COM) – Could there be a third NFL team in the Lone Star State? It appears Texas Gov. Greg Abbott at least acknowledges the idea.

According to a report from ESPN writer Seth Wickersham the Buffalo Bills are looking into potential relocation spots including Austin amid negotiations for a new stadium.

The idea of Austin or another city as a possible destination could be seen as a “threat” according to Wickersham.

In a tweet the Texas governor reacted to news of the report with a simple emoji of eyes glancing to the left. Abbott has not said what he thinks of the possibility.

Bills ownership is currently seeking approval for a $1.5 billion stadium in Orchard Park that is taxpayer-funded newspaper The Buffalo News reports.

According to the newspaper the team made it clear to government negotiators that there are other cities that would be ideal landing spots for the NFL franchise but there have been no “overt threats” to leave New York.

A spokesperson for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told The Buffalo News that the governor “is committed to the Bills staying in Buffalo as demonstrated by the state’s contribution to the recent $130 million investment in the current stadium.”

While AI cannot replace clinical studies as a vital step in safe drug development it can help focus resources onto the most promising compounds which accelerates processes reduces risk of failure and cuts costs. AI-based drug-discovery applications use machine learning to identify candidates and predict their interactions in vivo enabling the research team to better prioritize their efforts.

Once a product is ready to move from bench to bedside AI can help select sites and support the process of identifying the right patients for a clinical trial. A world leading analytics provider in healthcare has seen enrolment rates to clinical trials increase more than 20% and automatic processing of adverse drug reactions in 70% of cases.

AI isn’t just being used in early research and to plan clinical studies. Natural language processing (NLP) is also increasingly finding its way into medical applications. NLP can be used to search analyze and interpret large amounts of patient data. Data sources can be as diverse as discussions in public health forums social media posts or electronic health records. For example large pharmaceutical companies already gained a label expansion for the drugs partially based on NLP analysis. Data for the analysis was sourced from electronic health records and three databases containing post-marketing reports of real-world use of the drug in male patients. Real-world evidence is also supporting clinical studies. By serving as a synthetic control arm it’s especially useful in the case of rare conditions where traditional patient recruitment would take too long. Speeding up the clinical trial benefits both patients and drug developers.

Considering the huge impact that AI can have on R&D and the large investments made by pharma companies it’s surprising that pharmaceutical companies are generally hesitant adopters. A 2019 review paper found that just 18 AI-related patent applications had been submitted by the top 20 pharma companies (by revenue) in recent years compared to thousands by technology companies.

Michael Biltz is managing director of Accenture Technology Vision  where he leads the enterprise’s annual visioning process to focus on how technology will impact the way we work and live.

The world has just witnessed one of the fastest work transformations in history. COVID-19 saw businesses send people home en masse leaning on technology to maintain business as usual. Working from home once the exception rather than the rule became responsible for two-thirds of economic activity as an estimated 1.1 billion people around the world were forced to perform their daily jobs remotely up from 350 million in 2019.

As we explain in the 2021 Accenture Technology Vision report this transformation is just the beginning. Looking ahead where and how people work will be much more flexible concepts with the potential to bring benefits to employees and employers alike. In fact 87% of executives Accenture surveyed believe that the remote workforce opens up the market for difficult-to-find talent.

These benefits will only be fully realized if enterprises adopt a strategic approach to the future of work. Think back to a few years ago when the bring your own device (BYOD) trend was in vogue. Faced with demand from workers to use their own devices in the enterprise setting businesses had to think through new policies and controls to support this model.

Employers must now do the same thing but on a much bigger scale. BYOD has become “BYOE”: Employees are bringing their entire environments to work. These environments include a broader range of worker-owned tech (smart speakers home networks gaming consoles security cameras and more) and their work setting. One person may have a home office set up in a shed in their garden another may be working from the kitchen table surrounded by their family.

The workplace reimagined

Looking ahead the BYOE-style of work won’t be limited to employees’ homes. People will be free to work from anywhere and they will want to work in the environment that’s best for them — whether that’s the office home or a hybrid mix of the two. This is something leaders must accommodate rather than fight.

Indeed leaders can rethink the purpose of working at the warehouses depots factories offices labs and other locations that make up their businesses. They should consider carefully when it makes sense for people to be at certain sites and with certain people. They will thereby be able to optimize their operations.

A few years from now the organizations that succeed will be the ones that resisted the urge to race everyone back to the office and instead rethought how their workforce operates. They will have put in place a robust strategy for change that includes the adoption of technology enablers like the cloud AI IoT and XR. But more importantly this will outline how their reimagined workforce model can support and enable their people and how this can be reflected in the corporate culture.

Enabling the new

The first step toward this future requires gaining visibility into the employee experience. With BYOE the employee experience has never been more important but it has also never been harder to monitor. Workplace analytics will therefore be critical to understanding how employees’ environments are impacting their work and finding insights that can improve their experience and productivity.

Security is another primary enabler. Businesses need to accept that their employees’ environments are a permanent part of their enterprise and adjust them accordingly. IT security teams will have to do more than ensure that a worker’s laptop is secured with the latest firewall patches and consider the worker’s network security and the security of all devices linked to that network such as baby monitors and smart TVs.

Once the technology analytics and security foundations are in place businesses will be better positioned to unlock the full value of BYOE: operating model transformation. When companies go virtual-first they have new opportunities to integrate emerging technologies into the workforce. With a virtual-first BYOE strategy for example businesses can have a warehouse full of robots doing the physical work coupled with offsite employees safely monitoring and overseeing strategy.

Cultural change is key

Success in BYOE will also come down to culture. The enterprise must accept that the employee environment is now part of the “workplace” and accommodate people’s needs. This will be a large slow-to-emerge cultural shift but there will be quick wins too.

Take the disconnect between in-person and remote workers as an example. So much is currently tied to geography but the future will be all about balance. Workers in different roles will benefit from the work environment best suited to their needs. However without careful implementation the approach could lead to a divided workforce where in-office and remote workers struggle to collaborate. Quora is already looking to overcome this challenge by requiring all employees who are attending meetings regardless of whether they’re home or in the office to appear on their own video screen.

Reimagining the organization for BYOE is a moving target and best practices are still emerging. But one thing is already clear: You can’t afford to wait. To attract the best talent and keep employees engaged start planning now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXNpbmRpYS5jb20vYmxvZy9zdG9yeWJvYXJkMTgvc3Rvcnlib2FyZC1leGNsdXNpdmUtbWVldC1vZ2lsdnlzLWdsb2JhbC1jZW8tYW5keS1tYWluLXRoZS1vdXRzaWRlci1zY3JpcHRpbmctdGhlLWFkLWFnZW5jeXMtdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Storyboard Exclusive: Meet Ogilvy's Global CEO Andy Main The 'outsider' Scripting The Ad Agency's Transformation,"Andy Main Global CEO Ogilvy

“The one thing I did when I walked in (to make some friends in Ogilvy because I didn’t have any) was give everyone all 15000 employees my WhatsApp number. And I just went on a listening tour” says Andy Main. From his home in Colorado US the global chief executive officer of Ogilvy shares his experience of stepping into traditional ad agency territory at exactly this time last year.

In the thick of a pandemic in 2020 the Scottish-born executive took the topmost job at WPP Group-owned Ogilvy after over two decades with management consultancy giant Deloitte. In short Main was what advertising insiders call 'an outsider'. In his last role he was chief executive of Deloitte Digital where through key acquisitions he brought in creative firepower that the firm needed to take on the big ad holding companies namely WPP Omnicom IPG Dentsu and Publicis Groupe.

Many saw Main's arrival in Ogilvy as evidence of the seriousness of WPP and its CEO Mark Read's intent to transform the legacy agency into a future-fit organisation. In an exclusive interaction with Storyboard Main tells us why and how he's shaking things up.

(Edited for length and clarity)

Q. You took over the reins of Ogilvy at an extraordinary time. Tell us how that went for you and how Ogilvy’s transformation agenda looks in action? My focus has been on ensuring we take the best of Ogilvy protect it and build on it. That means keeping creativity at the centre of everything we do and enabling our creativity to spread its wings particularly into technology and data.

Our aspiration is to be the world's leading creative partner and platform for growth and impact for our clients businesses. To do that we structured Ogilvy around five business groups - Growth & Innovation Advertising PR & Influence Experience and Health. And we practice what’s called borderless creativity. It doesn't really matter where you happen to be or how you happen to think let's make the world borderless to advance growth and impact for our clients.

A lot of people go around talking about integration. Agencies and consultancies have integration departments and disciplines. But we have a different perspective. We talk about the intersections. Integration means you're putting together something that is fixed and known. But when you think about intersections it talks about how you bring talent and capabilities to explore and discover value at intersections of many different topics. That is allowing our minds to be free and when you map that with creativity you get an amazing Ogilvy in the marketplace. That's really what we brought to market very quickly. To have accomplished that feels very exciting to me personally.

Q. The last few years have been difficult for advertising companies across the board a situation made worse by the pandemic. How did Ogilvy fare this past year in terms of business? How did you deal with losing the American Express account which was an over half-century old creative relationship with Ogilvy?

We are a growing business and we've actually won lots of new accounts. For example Absolut Hyatt Enterprise Holdings TCS Pernod Ricard and Deutsche Bank. Our teams in India played a huge role in making that happen. Our wins have actually outnumbered our losses. We did extremely well at Cannes Lions with one Titanium eight Grand Prix and a raft of gold silver and bronze. The creative spirit and DNA of our business is alive and well.

I have transformed and will continue to transform Ogilvy into a growth-oriented business with a growth mindset. This industry is making an amazing comeback and Ogilvy is very well positioned to capture more than its fair share of the market as it comes back in full force.

Q. You are shaking things up in global leadership. You brought in Liz Taylor from Leo Burnett as global chief creative officer a position Piyush Pandey held till recently. Now he is chairman global creative in addition to his role as executive chairman of Ogilvy India. Devika Bulchandani is running the North American operations. Stacey Ryan Cornelius is global CFO and Kim Johnson is the new global CEO of Health. Tell us what was going on in your head when you reconfigured Ogilvy’s leadership.

I had to change certain members of the Ogilvy global leadership team. That's quite honestly why I was brought in. We're doing what we're doing to transform the business in a positive way. But it was very important to me to have diversity at the top.

We have more women and people of colour at Ogilvy’s leadership than ever before. (Liz Taylor is the first woman to hold Ogilvy's top creative position.) Because we have that dynamic leadership the thinking and the decisions we make and the mindset we have basically ripples throughout our organisation to all levels.

I've also been careful to make sure that many leaders from the last several years are also part of our global leadership team because we couldn't have had that much change in our business. That would be very risky. We've got a solid balance of new leadership and leadership that has been around for several years. This blend is helping Ogilvy be super duper competitive.

Q. You spent 21 years at Deloitte before joining Ogilvy last year. Traditional agencies typically get their leaders within the family. WPP flipped the script this time. What do you think the move signalled to clients competition and the industry in general?

That creativity is the source of innovation. I came from a wonderful and successful business. But when you come to Ogilvy it’s clear the creativity is there for everyone to see. My move was basically an indication that it is much harder to scale creativity than it is to scale technology. I can acquire a lot of technology to accompany an already scaled creative business. That in a summary is the message that was delivered to the market with that move.

We actually operate in a unique space between consultancies and agencies. When you compare us to consultancies we have so much more creative prowess. When you compare us to other agencies we've got much more substance insights and industry knowledge. It’s such a powerful combination. We've got great creativity and amazing speed to value. That's really our secret sauce.

Q. But the consultants can just buy great creativity. You did that at Deloitte with the Heat acquisition. Accenture Interactive acquired Droga5. So what happens to the USP of the likes of Ogilvy?

Quite honestly there’s been a slowdown in the consultants’ focus on creativity in the last few years. In many cases there's tissue rejection of the creative assets using the already in place consulting assets because you have a creative mindset meets a consulting mindset. It's like riptides in the ocean where there's competing forces in play. It creates a lot of swirl and unnecessary energy.

If I had to put my point of view on it I just don't think the consulting businesses have scaled creativity nearly fast enough to compete against the likes of Ogilvy on the creative scale. It's just a really hard thing to do to scale creativity and it's an easier thing to do to scale technology. Ogilvy is going to do both. That's what we're out to accomplish.

Q. Let’s dial back to July 2020. Did you feel like an outsider at all when you joined the agency?

I honestly didn't. I think my feeling of not feeling like an outsider started from the very first day I learned about the Ogilvy opportunity. I've had great admiration and love for the Ogilvy brand over many years. I don’t want to say even for a minute that I am comparable to David Ogilvy but in many ways I feel a spirit-connection to him.

David Ogilvy was also born in the UK and moved to the United States. He has Scottish heritage. I was born and raised in Scotland. I think he used to sell gas stoves around the doors in Scotland as one of his first jobs. I used to sell potatoes around the doors in Scotland as one of my first jobs. (Laughs)

If I had a chance to have a Scotch with him—he was quite fond of Scotch so am I—I think we'd have a bond around just being curious people being inventive and wanting to take things to the next level and not being satisfied with what you've got.

When I was introduced to the Ogilvy team over a year ago I promised to future-proof the business over the next few years. That was one of my commitments to the team. Ogilvy is an amazing heritage brand and a business that has not been merged with any others. So it's like a thoroughbred brand and that's just a wonderful thing to be able to represent.

Australia has inoculated the third-lowest proportion of its population of any OECD nation with only 18 per cent of over-16s fully vaccinated.

Eighteen months after Australia’s first case of coronavirus was reported in Victoria and seven months since the Pfizer jab became the first vaccine approved for the country Australia’s national vaccination program continues to be confusing at best and a shambles at worst.

“We’ve got hundreds of doses that we know are about to expire soon and we just can’t find anybody to take it.”

“The federal government at that stage had been telling people ‘Well if you just wait you can get the vaccine of your choice’ so people were just waiting until they could get Pfizer. We were throwing out vials and vials of the vaccines.”

“I was literally walking the halls to see if anybody wanted it” Clements says.

It was late June and the Townsville-based doctor was visiting the outback town of Julia Creek to help the local GP and see how vaccinations were tracking. He found a fridge filled with unused vials. A lack of demand from patients meant the batches were about to expire.

Four months after Australia’s COVID-19 vaccination program began Michael Clements paced the halls of a medical clinic in north Queensland trying to recruit patients willing to be inoculated with AstraZeneca.

Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.

In January last year nine days after China confirmed the sequence of COVID-19 University of Queensland professor Paul Young received an email that would galvanise his team. For months scientists at the university had been working on an exciting new technology. Called a “molecular clamp” it promised to make vaccine development faster and more agile.

What went wrong is a mixture of bad luck politics poor procurement decisions and mixed messages about the safety of one of the rollout’s key vaccines: AstraZeneca. According to Grattan Institute health program director Stephen Duckett Australia’s vaccine strategy has been among “the worst in the world”.

And there have been many missed targets. Prime Minister Scott Morrison who once insisted the vaccine rollout was “not a race” now concedes the program is at least two months behind schedule.

Meanwhile hundreds of millions of dollars have gone to consulting firms for advice that remains shrouded in secrecy and to ad agencies for campaigns that have either run before vaccines were available or have been a flop.

AstraZeneca ran into reputational issues with the very rare risk of a blood-clotting side-effect. The UQ vaccine did not make it past phase one trials where it turned up some false positive HIV results mainly because the vaccine’s signature “clamp” technology contained an HIV protein.

According to Morrison at the time the UQ candidate and AstraZeneca would put Australia “at the top of the queue if our medical experts give the vaccines the green light”. But both failed to pay off as planned.

Stung by criticism over the early unavailability of personal protective equipment and even hand sanitiser due to our reliance on suddenly shaky international supply chains the federal government was desperate to have its vaccine supplies manufactured on home soil.

This untried technology would form half the initial backbone of Australia’s entire vaccine strategy. The other half involved AstraZeneca based on a more traditional technology much of which was to be produced in Melbourne by biotech firm CSL.

Young’s team took up the challenge and produced a vaccine candidate. The Morrison government ordered up big taking an initial 51 million doses.

On January 21 2020 an official from the global vaccine-development body the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations emailed the university to ask if their invention might be used to create a new COVID vaccine.

“This is another crucial step in our effort to develop manufacture and distribute a vaccine in record-breaking time” Trump declared.

Under the agreement – now one of six secured by the US with various manufacturers – the government would pay $1.95 billion for Pfizer to produce and deliver 100 million doses of a vaccine once it was approved by America’s drug regulator. Another 500 million doses would be delivered shortly afterward through the Trump administration’s aptly titled procurement strategy Operation Warp Speed.

On a hot July afternoon in Washington DC four months before last year’s US presidential election Donald Trump stood at the lectern in the James Brady briefing room of the White House and announced a new deal to secure the nation’s supply of coronavirus vaccines.

“We were devastated” Young says now of the government’s decision to dump the UQ project last December. “We argued at the time that there may be some value in going forward to phase two and three of our trials and then making a decision but the window of opportunity to progress wasn’t taken.”

Others have presented a different view. According to ABC Coronacast host Norman Swan three unnamed sources told him that Pfizer had wanted to use Australia as a global example for its vaccine rollout but in that July meeting a Department of Health representative had demanded access to the company’s intellectual property and haggled over the cost.

“We were interested in talking to them about potentially purchasing that vaccine but that was it” Schofield told a Senate hearing in June. “No numbers or details were put on the table.”

When the company and officials from the Department of Health sat down according to the government’s Lisa Schofield assistant secretary of Canberra’s vaccine taskforce Pfizer presented “a preliminary view of where they were up to and what they were thinking”.

Twelve days before Trump’s “historic announcement” Pfizer had met with the Morrison government. The US pharmaceutical giant which had partnered with German firm BioNTech to deliver the Comirnaty vaccine had written to the government two weeks earlier requesting a meeting.

On the other side of the globe in Australia things were not moving so fast.

Whatever the truth the US Canada Japan and Britain all struck agreements with Pfizer in July and August 2020. It wasn’t until November last year that Pfizer signed contracts to supply 10 million doses to Australia in 2021 – enough to fully vaccinate only five million people. They were meant to be rolled out in the first three months of the year.

The first doses of Pfizer arrived on February 15 with Prime Minister Scott Morrison receiving his first jab on February 21 alongside an aged care resident. That same month the company agreed to supply 10 million more doses in mid-2021. Then in April the order was doubled again meaning in the final quarter of this year 20 million more Pfizer doses will arrive on Australian shores.

Duckett believes the government’s procurement decisions at a time when other countries were investing heavily in a broader range of vaccines paved the way for the slow response to the pandemic.

But other decisions taken early have also contributed to the slow rollout. The Commonwealth kept a tight rein on the process and initially limited the role of the states. Doses went to the wrong places. There was confusion around aged care centres where contractors offered vaccines to residents but left the vast majority of staff unvaccinated. Since then staff vaccinations has been made compulsory but by this week only 28 per cent of staff had been fully vaccinated while 48 per cent had had their first shot. Of 18600 residents living in 2600 aged care homes that the Commonwealth is responsible for 83 per cent are now fully vaccinated and all have been offered a vaccination. But even that rollout came months late.

“It’s been a trainwreck” says Duckett a former federal health department secretary “a complete shemozzle”.

University of Sydney immunisation researcher Julie Leask is more sympathetic believing Australia will eventually achieve high COVID-19 vaccine coverage even if the rollout has been slow and problematic.

“Our expectations were sky-high and to some degree unrealistic because new vaccine rollouts are always complex” she says. “It certainly has been mired in federal government failures. But it’s been a problem of supply – we don’t have enough Pfizer – combined with the safety issue around the use of AstraZeneca vaccine.”

Limboland

These factors have helped create a perfect storm for the latest wave of COVID-19. Australia is now in a period of limbo with the highly contagious Delta variant resisting contact tracing and the lingering threat of further lockdowns until more people are inoculated. On Friday Morrison announced more details of a four-stage plan. We will be in a supression phase - fast lockdowns - until we reach 70 per cent fully vaccinated and 80 per cent vaccinated before we begin to treat COVID-19 as an illness to manage rather than suppress. We are months away from those targets.

Last week as NSW declared a “national emergency” after community transmission continued to soar despite a month in lockdown Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged other states to divert their allocations to help NSW drive down COVID cases. Faced with outbreaks of their own Victoria and South Australia declined. Morrison supported their decision.

Few were surprised by the reluctance of the states to share their doses with NSW. After all the impact of the Commonwealth’s decision not to order enough Pfizer vaccines had already hit home in Victoria when the state had been forced to halt the number of people getting their first doses of the drug to ensure there was enough supply for people who needed their second jab.

By that stage Victoria had been plunged into its fourth lockdown in 15 months but had only been getting a weekly allocation of 71370 doses of Pfizer. It was a turning point in state-federal relations: the limited supply meant that when eligibility for vaccine was extended to 40 to 49-year-olds many people were unable to make phone bookings for their first dose and those who walked up to mass vaccination hubs were turned away. It wasn’t until June 14 – the day the state announced a pause in first doses – that a further 105300 doses were allocated by the Commonwealth.

As Victorian Deputy Premier James Merlino would later put it: “The 800-pound gorilla in the room that we have failed to mention today is the fact that we’re in this position because our vaccination program has not delivered what we were told it was going to deliver.”

A clot in the system

Two weeks ago Andrew McLeod and his wife Julie sat in a COVID mobile clinic in tropical north Queensland where they had just received their second jab of Pfizer.

The couple both aged in their mid-60s had the option of taking AstraZeneca but chose not to – partly because of what they’d read in the media about the rare risks involved and partly because their own GP had advised them against it.

“My wife is a chronic asthmatic and so I spoke to my doctor to ask what we should do” he tells The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald. “She’s a great doctor – 36 years old and a real gem – and she basically told us: ‘If I were you I’d hang out for the Pfizer’.”

They’re not alone. The latest figures from the Bureau of Statistics show that one-third of people aged 50 to 69 and a quarter of people aged 70 and over – who have been eligible to get vaccinated since March – were not getting jabbed because they are waiting for a different vaccine.

Part of the problem has been the changing advice on AstraZeneca by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) which makes recommendations to the government on how the vaccines should be administered.

On April 8 ATAGI lowered the preferred age for AstraZeneca shots and recommended Pfizer as the vaccine of choice for under-50s (the advice on AstraZeneca followed Britain’s lead; the UK later revised its guidelines so anyone over 40 was believed safe to get AstraZeneca).

On June 17 the age threshold changed again in part due to global nervousness this time to under-60s. And by June 28 there was another shift when Morrison made a surprise announcement and suggested that Australians under 40 should speak to their GP about getting the AstraZeneca jab contradicting ATAGI’s earlier advice.

This led to Queensland’s chief health officer rebuking Morrison’s intervention bluntly declaring: “I do not want under-40s to get AstraZeneca. It is rare but they are at increased risk of getting the rare clotting syndrome.”

The confusion has fuelled vaccine hesitancy despite the overwhelming safety of the drug which has been enthusiastically used around the globe. Indeed this week as NSW’s outbreak continued to worsen ATAGI revised its advice yet again stating that anyone over the age of 18 in greater Sydney should consider getting the drug while Morrison practically pleaded with Australians to increase their take-up.

“The Pfizer doses of course are increasing but the AstraZeneca is there – and that gets us to our goal a lot faster” he said.

Australians’ willingness to close borders lock down and follow the rules have led to low rates of COVID-19 but have arguably also resulted in vaccine complacency.

“It’s very important to put into perspective here that our death rate is virtually unmatched by anybody other than New Zealand and a few other countries” Health Minister Greg Hunt told The Age. Sydney University last week published a study showing lockdowns – predominantly led by the state governments – have saved 48000 lives.

The Commonwealth denies it failed to build up a broad portfolio of vaccines saying it has secured five agreements that together provide 195 million doses. On top of the Pfizer deal for 40 million doses and AstraZeneca backing them up are the Moderna and Novavax vaccines (Novavax trials have shown it is very effective but it is not yet approved for use anywhere in the world). Half a million Moderna doses will be available per week from October. It means the government’s suite of vaccines will be more than enough to cover the whole adult population. And from August almost 4000 pharmacists will join GPs in providing jabs starting firstly with AstraZeneca.

Nonetheless Hunt is under intense pressure with some – including former PM Kevin Rudd – having called for him to resign and laying the blame directly at the feet of the Morrison government.

“We’ve got a fully blown national emergency on our hands because Scott Morrison failed to secure enough vaccines to protect the Australian people” says Labor’s opposition spokesman Mark Butler. “World’s best practice is to have four to six vaccine deals – Labor was calling on the Government to do this last year.”

Hunt defends the program and turns any discussion about past failures to focus on where we are now. He is particularly belligerent about Norman Swan’s accusations his health department turned away Pfizer in mid-2020 describing this as “false”.

“People say ‘Why didn’t you spend more on Pfizer?” But there was no more available” says Hunt with mass deaths across Europe and North America and producers in those countries focused on their own sick citizens.

“The US and Europe were prioritising themselves – and I don’t mean that critically” says Hunt. “The company said to us ‘Our doses in Australia will help you but they will save lives as soon as they are put into arms in Europe and North America’.”

Here come the consultants

The lack of vaccines might be a defining feature of Australia’s vaccine strategy but it is not the only concern.

An Age and Herald analysis of government tender documents reveal that since last June hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on COVID-related contracts with big consulting firms and ad agencies making many millions from the rollout. Yet much of their work remains shrouded in secrecy.

Accenture was awarded $7.3 million to develop a software solution to track and monitor vaccine doses but the full extent of its data or the true costs involved has not been released despite growing calls for a breakdown of vaccination rates across Australian suburbs and towns.

“We had hoped to have higher overall levels of vaccination … but the rates we’re achieving on a weekly and daily basis are certainly the marks we had hoped to be hitting.” Prime Minister Scott Morrison

The Australian arm of McKinsey and Co was paid $2.2 million in March to give advice on how to manufacture mRNA vaccine – the same technology used to create the Pfizer jab. However the Industry Department declined to make McKinsey’s work public citing commercial sensitivity. Similarly the Health Department declined a request to release $1.8 million worth of research the bureaucracy paid to Sydney company FiftyFive5 into public sentiment towards vaccinations.

And more than $33 million was also spent on five advertising contracts in a year – most of which was paid months before Australians were able to be vaccinated when the rollout formally began in March.

Yet questions linger about the benefits of the ads. In the UK celebrities such as Elton John actor Elizabeth Hurley and comedian Lenny Henry joined forces with the nation’s health service to encourage more people to get vaccinated while in the US ads featured former presidents Barack Obama George W Bush and Bill Clinton getting the jab.

Australia’s public relations efforts – including an ad featuring former deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth and an awareness campaign calling on people to “arm yourself” against COVID19 – have been viewed as lacklustre in comparison. There has been some feeling within the government that without enough supply it’s not really worth advertising.

Dr Nick Coatsworth from the government’s COVID-19 ad campaign.

And then there’s the mixed messaging about vaccine safety fuelled in part by ATAGI but also by sensationalist media coverage and social media.

Allen Cheng the softly-spoken professor who recently stepped down from his role as Victoria’s deputy chief health officer admits that the messaging has been “difficult” for the advisory group which has “very carefully tried to craft the wording that we use” – but this has often been lost in translation.

“The best example of that is when we talk about the threshold for 50: we were very careful to use the term ‘We prefer people to get Pfizer’ and added that people should have autonomy and make up their own mind” explains Cheng who sits in the advisory group alongside experts such as Associate Professor Nigel Crawford the head of Immunisation at the Royal Children’s Hospital and Infectious Diseases Physician Professor Michelle Giles.

“The problem is people might read three lines of a newspaper story or hear us on the news and it doesn’t quite capture the nuance or tone.”

We don’t set targets ...

While the road out of COVID continues to be slow Cheng says the vaccination program is gradually scaling up “and with increasing supply hopefully a lot of the problems will start to go away”.

Scott Morrison is also optimistic. Asked if he stood by his new target to have every eligible Australian vaccinated by the end of the year the PM replied: “That absolutely remains our goal by the end of the year and we have the supplies to achieve that.

“We had hoped to have higher overall levels of vaccination … but the vaccination rates we’re achieving on a weekly and daily basis are certainly the marks we had hoped to be hitting by about this time of the year.”

The latest federal figures suggest almost 12 million doses have been administered with 3.65 million Australians receiving their second jab. On July 1 just 8 per cent of Australians aged over 16 had received two doses of a vaccine; by Thursday this week it had risen to 18 per cent.

The government is also considering how to manufacture mRNA in Australia – the cutting-edge technology used for Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both of which need to be imported from overseas. However experts say this could take between one to three years and would require considerable funding.

Back in Brisbane Professor Paul Young is optimistic. Seven months after the Morrison Government abandoned the University of Queensland’s vaccination trial researchers are working on a “2.0” version of their clamp technology after data trials confirmed the first version despite the false positive HIV results was indeed safe – and potentially effective.

While the new vaccine is a long way off he hopes it will play a role in fighting COVID19 in years to come when the disease is embedded in the community much like influenza.

But there’s a broader opportunity for the country too Young says as the vaccine rollout has exposed a glaring gap in Australia’s domestic manufacturing capability.

“The great irony in Australia is we have an amazing wealth of expertise in infectious disease research but science isn’t translated as well or as rapidly as it could be because we don’t have the infrastructure within the country to do that” he says.

“On the back of this pandemic we could actually establish a new biomedical industry. It’s a fantastic opportunity – we just need investment.”",,,,,,

Since the late ‘80s Adobe has been offering advanced photo editing software. The programs we use now look a lot different than they did back then. Adobe constantly updates its offerings with new features and apps. While we appreciate the constant stream of new editing toys to play with the Adobe lineup has gotten somewhat convoluted. In an effort to serve legacy users and newbies the company has ended up with a weird selection of options from which to choose. What’s the difference between Adobe Lightroom vs Lightroom Classic? The answer may not be immediately apparent. But don’t worry we can help you break down the situation

Best Adobe photo editor for most people: Lightroom CC

Best Adobe photo editor for old school shooters: Lightroom Classic

Best Adobe photo editor for mobile workflow: Lightroom Mobile

Best Adobe photo editor for in-depth mobile editing: Photoshop Express

What is Adobe Lightroom?

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of separating Adobe’s individual offerings let’s take a step back and look at the big picture. Way back in 2006 Adobe introduced a program called Photoshop Lightroom. Photoshop itself had grown into a massive goliath packed with awesome features that photographers just didn’t need when tearing through a memory card worth of images. Adding a fun bubble texture is an amusing thing to do when you’re slacking off at work but it’s not useful for actual photo editing.

Lightroom has had a similar goal from the start: Manage your photography workflow. That includes importing and sorting your photos editing then exporting final versions. Apple’s Aperture offered similar features which made editing large groups of photos much easier than slogging through Adobe Bridge to organize images and then importing them one at a time to Photoshop.

In Lightroom you can edit one photograph from a whole set and then easily apply those settings to the rest of the collection. That can save a huge amount of time during a big edit especially if you’re in a studio situation in which the lighting doesn’t change much. It’s a huge time saver.

The modern flavors of Lightroom aim to satisfy the same need. The tools interface and even the underlying architecture have changed considerably over the years however. Adobe gradually added local adjustment options improved profiles preset compatibility and hardware acceleration.

Adobe Lightroom vs Lightroom Classic split

In 2017 Adobe introduced a new version of Lightroom called Lightroom CC. It was much different than the previous version. Adobe built it for maximum synergy across different platforms. Lightroom CC ties tightly into the company’s Creative Cloud which means you’d get a similar editing experience on a desktop smartphone or tablet. Adobe also took this opportunity to do away with perpetual licenses. You had to subscribe to Creative Cloud if you wanted Lightroom now.

In order to make it compatible across platforms Adobe had to cut into Lightroom’s features and alter its interface. After all the original Lightroom assumed you had access to a keyboard and mouse which made cramped sliders and dense UI easy to navigate. That’s not true when you’re poking your finger onto a relatively tiny phone screen.

In order to keep its legacy users happy Adobe kept the old version of Lightroom around but switched its name to Lightroom Classic. It’s technically called Lightroom Classic CC but I have literally never heard or read anyone call it that.

What Adobe photo editor should you use?

Here’s where things get sort of interesting. The answer will differ depending on who you ask. To find the answer you’ll have to weigh several aspects of your editing process. How much do you care about cross-platform compatibility? How much time have you spent getting used to the old interface? How inclined are you to go on Adobe’s support forums and get angry when the company slightly changes a setting that only a handful of people actually use? Let’s start the journey of self-discovery that will land you on the best Adobe photo editor.

Keeping it old school

For seasoned Adobe users (including myself) the new Lightroom can’t compete with the dense feature-set you get from Lightroom Classic. We spent more than a decade working with these tools and they became automatic. Opening Lightroom Classic feels like stepping into an old pair of slippers if slippers could make your computer fans spin up louder than a space shuttle getting ready to take off.

Adobe has roped some of its cloud integration into Lightroom Classic but it feels very limited. Cross-platform support is spotty. And even if the images you’re working on are easy to find in your library you might find yourself frustrated when the iPad version lacks something you’re looking for like the advanced library functions.

If you have huge Lightroom catalogs bringing them into the new software can be slightly stressful. Lightroom CC would prefer you keep all your stuff in the cloud so it can sling it out to any device you want to work on. Lightroom Classic can do that in some fashion with smart previews but your catalog and archive ultimately belong on a PC (and your backups).

Best Adobe photo editor for old school shooters: Lightroom Classic

Import your photos through the program’s interface to quickly sort and edit them. You can do some local adjustments (like healing blemishes) and other more niche tasks like making photo books. Classic also allows for easy compatibility with preset packs and third-party plug-ins that work through Adobe’s API.

Long live the new Lightroom CC Flesh

If you have no sentimental (or muscle memory) ties to the old Lightroom you’re probably better off starting fresh with Lightroom CC. As stated above Adobe built Lightroom CC with cross-platform editing at the front of mind. That kicked off the Adobe Lightroom vs Lightroom Classic battle that rages today.

If you fire up Lightroom CC on your computer it will offer an extremely similar experience to what you’d get on an iPad or smartphone. You get the same access to your entire catalog of images and you can even sync your presets into the interface so they show up anywhere you have the program installed.

Lightroom CC offers a much more streamlined interface. You won’t find a dense stack of adjustments looming along the side of the UI like you will with Classic unless you go looking for it.

Old heads may not want to hear it but the new Lightroom interface really does make a lot of sense once you get used to it. You can find almost everything you needed from the Classic platform and you can relearn the shortcuts.

Best Adobe photo editor for most people: Lightroom CC

Born in 2017 this new version of Lightroom offers a streamlined UI that makes much more sense in terms of modern software. Catalog management makes all of your photos available in the cloud so you can step away from your computer and pick up your edit on a smartphone or tablet without missing a step. Because the software is newer overall you may also discover that it’s just generally faster than Lightroom Classic for most tasks.

You get the same raw file support and camera compatibility as you would with Classic which people often get wrong.

Going mobile

If you’re willing to make the leap into the current generation of Creative Cloud software this is where you’ll notice a huge advantage. Interoperability between Adobe products really makes creative work simpler for people with multiple devices. That is of course assuming you can find your way through the companies confusing offerings. What the hell is Adobe Capture: Creative Kit? I don’t know.

If you’re looking for photo editing however you really only have two places you need to look.

Best Adobe photo editor for mobile workflow: Lightroom Mobile

Open Lightroom on your mobile device and it will look familiar. You can only access all of the features if you have a Creative Cloud subscription (more on that in a moment) but you get basically the full Lightroom experience on iPads smartphones tablets and anything else you can get installed on.

The app is available for iOS and Android. For some reason it has slightly different names on each platform which makes it extra confusing. What’s the difference between iOS’s “Adobe Lightroom: Photo Editor” and Android’s “Adobe Lightroom: Photo Editor & Pro camera?” Nothing.

Stay in your lane

If you’re planning on using Lightroom Mobile to any real extent it’s best to use the desktop version that matches. It’s the best way to ensure that your presets work the same way and everything shows up as you’d expect it to in your library. I’ve used Lightroom Classic in conjunction with Lightroom Mobile and it’s clunky.

Lightroom Mobile also gives you access to the company’s built-in camera functionality. Now that smartphones offer raw photo capture you can get an entire photography workflow out of your smartphone.

What the heck is Adobe Photoshop Express?

While we’ve been playing in the Lightroom Sandbox for the entirety of this guide I want to take a minute to bring Photoshop Express into the mix.

There have been numerous interactions of mobile Photoshop through the years but Photoshop Express shows off the advantages you get by upgrading off of the Lightroom Classic platform. Photoshop Express allows you to dig into more robust edits on your mobile device. If you’re on the Creative Cloud platform your work is already in the cloud. You can just pull it up from your library and get to work on your phone or tablet.

This isn’t a competitor to the Lightroom software. It’s a companion. Don’t choose one or the other. Download both.

Best Adobe photo editor for in-depth mobile editing: Photoshop Express

The desktop version of Photoshop is the best photo editor full stop but Adobe’s mobile version has come a long way over the years. You can do one-click auto edits or use the AI-powered tools to dig deeper into your photos. It’s a surprisingly satisfying experience.

FAQs

Q: Which is better Lightroom or Lightroom Classic?

Like most direct comparisons this comes down to preference more than anything. Objectively speaking however Lightroom is built on newer architecture and has a much better grasp on Adobe’s overall Creative Cloud system so it’s probably the best place to start for someone coming in cold. The fight between Adobe Lightroom vs Lightroom Classic will rage on for a while.

Q: Is Lightroom CC the same as Lightroom Classic?

As good as Adobe is at making image editing software it sucks at naming them. Lightroom CC refers to the new version of the software that debuted back in 2017. Lightroom Classic refers to the updated version of the previous software. Lightware Classic’s full name is technically Photoshop Lightroom Classic CC but you will sound ridiculous if you call it that.

Q: How much is Adobe Lightroom?

Both versions of Lightroom reside in Adobe’s Creative Cloud subscription service. You don’t have to pay the $50+ for the whole suite of apps however. The $10 monthly Creative Cloud Photography option offers Lightroom CC Lightroom Classic and Photoshop as well as some other features for just $10 per month. Some people still hate paying a subscription fee but Lightroom used to cost $300 and Photoshop used to cost more than $700 so it still seems like a pretty good deal on our end.

A last word on Adobe Lightroom vs Lightroom Classic

If you’re bought into the Adobe ecosystem you’re probably already using the $10 monthly Creative Cloud Photography subscription.

The two biggest groups who have moved are young adult children moving back with their parents and the elderly moving in with their adult children. The sandwich generation has been especially stressed as they may now be caring for both adult kids and aging parents1. Not only can the transition of living together be taxing on your relationship with one another; marriages partnerships and relationships with involved loved ones can suffer too.

Since early 2020 52% of 18- to 29-year-olds are living with their parents. This is more than the peak during the Great Depression.2 According to a recent Pew Research survey more than 30% of those people moved because of financial difficulty caused by unemployment. Another 14% moved because colleges closed their campuses.3

According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University in 2016 5.3 million adults aged 65+ (11%) lived in another person's household with 3.4 million living with their adult children.³ This number has increased during the pandemic as people have been navigating concerns about the health and safety of their aging parents who are at higher risk for negative outcomes from contracting COVID-19. Additionally financial strain has caused adult children to become the caretakers of their aging parents.

There are challenges on both sides when adjusting to living under one roof. Here are some of the common difficulties families are experiencing:

Conflicts About Power and Control: Who's in Charge?

When a young adult moves back home they feel like they’ve lost their independence. Like it or not parents often view their kids as children no matter how old they are. This can lead to regressing back to old behaviors and relational patterns. For example a parent can feel responsible for their adult child and feel inclined to manage and monitor their daily living choices and activities. When young adults are put in this position they feel disrespected causing relationship conflict.

Acknowledge and recognize that even though the young adult will always be your child they are adults. This requires a big shift in the parent-child relationship. As you develop mutual respect for one another you can let go and allow the adult child to be responsible for themselves without micromanaging or enabling them.

When a parent moves in with an adult child it can feel like a role reversal. Aging parents may struggle with feelings of loss while adult children are in a state of overwhelm. Again acknowledge all parties are grown adults deserving respect.

It is important to realize and respect that it is the primary homeowner who is in charge of the rules of the household. Proactive and honest conversations that are mutually respectful need to occur so that everyone is clear on expectations.

Boundary Challenges: What rules and limits need to be established?

Using assertive communication that is respectful direct and clear set boundary limits when it comes to:

Physical space : Which spaces of the home are private or shared?

: Which spaces of the home are private or shared? Rules of the house: What are the rules regarding cleanliness in common spaces noise limitations curfew policy on guests or substance use?

What are the rules regarding cleanliness in common spaces noise limitations curfew policy on guests or substance use? Finances: Who is going to pay for what and what do you determine to be a loan or a gift?

Who is going to pay for what and what do you determine to be a loan or a gift? Division of Labor: Who is responsible for cleaning grocery shopping or doing chores like laundry?

Who is responsible for cleaning grocery shopping or doing chores like laundry? Privacy: Can the adult child have their partner over? Can the parent just walk into the adult child’s room because it's their home? What are each person's needs?

Can the adult child have their partner over? Can the parent just walk into the adult child’s room because it's their home? What are each person's needs? Time: Is this a permanent or temporary living arrangement? If temporary for how long and what is the exit plan?

Communication Problems: How can we resolve our differences?

There’s a range of emotions that come with a new living arrangement including grief and loss. For everyone involved there is some loss of independence freedom and privacy. Being financially dependent on another can lower feelings of self-worth. Likewise being financially responsible for another can lead to resentment. Be prepared for communication challenges a period of adjustment and some potential conflict. To effectively communicate and resolve conflict:

Practice empathy. Put yourself in the shoes of the other person and imagine how they might feel. Verbalizing empathy allows people to feel heard known understood and connected. It can diffuse conflict as once people feel heard they may not become increasingly defensive or aggressive to get their message across.

Earlier this year IBM (IBM 0.53%) claimed to have developed the world's first 2nm chip technology. That sounded like a remarkable achievement since Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 4.53%) -- the world's most advanced chipmaker -- only started mass producing 5nm chips last year.

But investors shrugged and the news was quickly forgotten just like IBM's introduction of the world's ""first"" 7nm chip in 2015 and 5nm chip in 2017. Meanwhile IBM's stock declined more than 10% over the past five years as it struggled to expand its higher-growth cloud businesses rapidly enough to offset the sluggish growth of its legacy software hardware and IT services divisions.

Let's take a look back at Big Blue's chipmaking breakthroughs why investors were indifferent to those milestones and whether or not these announcements actually matter to the company's future.

IBM's oft-overlooked chipmaking business

IBM once designed and manufactured PowerPC CPUs which emerged from the AIM (Apple IBM and Motorola) alliance in the 1990s. The AIM alliance introduced PowerPC as an alternative chip architecture to challenge Intel's (INTC -0.80%) dominance of the CPU market.

The alliance collapsed in the mid-2000s after Apple switched its Macintosh computers from PowerPC CPUs to Intel's CPUs. But IBM continued to design new Power chips and the architecture lived on in the OpenPOWER foundation -- an open source consortium that counts IBM Alphabet's Google the Chinese server maker Inspur and the Russian server maker Yadro as its platinum members.

IBM manufactured Power chips until 2014 when it agreed to pay GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion to take over the unprofitable unit. It also agreed to exclusively use GlobalFoundries to produce 22nm 14nm and 10nm chips for its own hardware. However GlobalFoundries gave up on developing 10nm and 7nm chips after AMD its former parent company outsourced its most advanced chips to TSMC instead.

GlobalFoundries' decision sparked a lawsuit from IBM which had expected the foundry to manufacture 10nm and 7nm Power chips for its Power System servers. That clash caused IBM to abandon GlobalFoundries and outsource the production of its newer Power chips to Samsung instead.

Today IBM's Power CPUs are mainly confined to its Power Systems business one of the three main pillars (along with its IBM Z mainframes and storage systems) of its Systems business. IBM generated $6.98 billion in revenue or 9% of its top line from its Systems business last year.

Why IBM's chip advancements are largely meaningless

IBM's creation of a 2nm chip would be significant if it could mass produce and sell them on its own or install them into its own Power systems. But IBM doesn't manufacture its own chips anymore it already shares its chip designs with other companies through the OpenPOWER consortium and its most advanced 7nm Power chips are produced by Samsung -- which certainly can't mass produce 2nm chips yet.

In other words IBM's 2nm chip is just a lab experiment. IBM claims that compared to modern 7nm chips its 2nm chips can boost performance by 45% at the same power levels or deliver 75% more power at the same performance levels. It also claims its chips are slightly denser than TSMC's upcoming 3nm chips which are scheduled for mass production next year.

But shortly after IBM revealed is 2nm chip TSMC fired back with a report detailing its own theoretical breakthrough with 1nm chips. However TSMC doesn't expect to actually hit that milestone anytime soon -- it plans to mass produce 2nm chips in 2023 but anything beyond that is uncharted territory.

So what should IBM's investors focus on?

IBM's development of a 2nm chip sounds impressive but it ultimately means nothing. Instead of being distracted by that flashy headline IBM's investors should focus on three main things.

First they should see if its cloud revenue which rose 19% to $25.1 billion last year and accounted for over a third of its top line continues to rise. Second they should see if IBM's renewed focus on hybrid cloud deployments and AI services -- accelerated by its takeover of Red Hat two years ago -- will feed that growth and widen its moat against the public cloud giants.

Lastly investors should focus on IBM's upcoming spin-off of Kyndryl which will remove the slow-growth managed infrastructure services division from IBM's core business. That move could streamline the ""new"" IBM and enable it to aggressively expand its hybrid cloud and AI businesses -- but it could also result in lower dividend payments in the future.

Keeping track of these three things will help investors determine if IBM's stock is undervalued at 12 times forward earnings. Anything else including its claim of creating the world's smallest chip is just noise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3RyYWN0aWZ5LmNvbS9wL2phc29uLW9wcGVuaGVpbS1uZXQtd29ydGjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jason Oppenheim Net Worth: Career History of 'Selling Sunset' Star,"Reality TV costars Jason Oppenheim and Chrishell Stause have gone from Selling Sunset to selling tabloids with gossip magazines raving over the duo’s PDA. Just days after the news of Jason and Chrishell’s relationship made headlines the paparazzi caught them sharing a kiss while on vacation in Rome Italy.

“Chrishell and I became close friends and it has developed into an amazing relationship” Jason said in a statement to Entertainment Tonight on July 28. “I care about her deeply and we are very happy together.” You may know Chrishell from her roles on All My Children and Days of Our Lives or perhaps from her marriage to This Is Us star Justin Hartley. But how much do you know Jason?

Jason Oppenheim has racked up a net worth of $50 million between his law and real estate careers.

It’s safe to say Jason is set for life. He has a fortune of $50 million according to Celebrity Net Worth. Jason’s Oppenheim Group bio details his career history: He earned his undergraduate degree and his law degree from UC Berkeley and then started working for the law firm O’Melveny & Myers where he represented the former CEO of Enron Corporation in a criminal and civil trials. He also represented the company Advanced Micro Devices in a monopolization suit against Intel Corporation.

“I have always been an analytical thinker and a career in law seemed like a logical progression” he told Swagger Magazine in 2020. “That’s what the law represents — intellectual argument advocacy for your client and critical thinking.”

Jason eventually ditched law for a real estate career and followed a five-generation family tradition that began when his great-great-grandfather started one of Los Angeles’ first real estate companies in 1889 as Jason’s bio touts. “Getting into the real estate industry during the Great Recession was not easy” he explained to Swagger. “Many agents were dropping out at the same time I was just starting my career. I made a bet and relied on my passion determination and grit to get me where I am today.”

He has more than $1 billion in closed real estate sales.

Jason’s bio also boasts impressive statistics about his real estate carer. He has closed sales of more than $1 billion for example and has active listings of more than $300 million. Those listings include a $100-million property as well as the largest home in Hollywood Hills.

According to The Tab Jason has worked with celebrities like Chloë Grace Moretz talk show host Ellen DeGeneres basketball star Kris Humphries actor Orlando Bloom rocker Rob Zombie actress Dakota Johnson singer Nicole Scherzinger and Tinder co-founder Sean Rad.

A young woman from Alabama who vanished in Europe two years ago has finally been found her family says.

Nicole Denise Jackson 23 left her Birmingham area home for Germany at the end of 2018 and eventually stopped answering calls and texts. Her family hasn’t heard from her in two years.

On Friday a private investigator finally found her.

“Nicole has been located” the family told WBRC . “She’s safe and in good health. She has been verified by the State Department in person.”

Ms Jackson who is a singer allegedly moved to Germany to study music – and her family later learned to be with a man she’d met online. After she got there she continued speaking with her family for about a year occasionally sending a “Happy birthday” text or some other perfunctory communication.

Then around Christmas of 2019 she went silent.

“I know this is not like her’’ Ms Jackson’s older sister Ela Vaughn told AL.com in July. “When I say no one has talked to her I mean no one.”

In July Ms Vaughn and her father Antonio Jackson hired a detective to find Ms Jackson and also prepared to travel to Munich to look for her themselves.

The detective got to her first. Digging through Ms Jackson’s emails the P.I. managed to identify the man Ms Jackson was living with and contacted his employer and landlord.

Before long Ms Jackson – apparently aware her family was looking for her – walked into a State Department outpost and showed proof of her identity.

However she still hasn’t spoken to her family.

“She’ll reach out to us when he’s ready’’ Ms Vaughn told AL.com . “I feel a whole lot better. She will eventually reach out. I know she will.”

Ms Vaughn still doesn’t understand why her sister stopped communicating with their family but says the important thing is that she’s alive.

“I’m more at peace. I’d still like to hear her voice’’ Ms Vaughn said. “I’m happy to know our prayers have been answered. She’s safe and she’s OK.”

The Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ) has a number of compelling reasons to consider it as a long-term investment.

It's one of the larger exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with net assets almost $2.1 billion.

This investment is provided by BetaShares one of the biggest providers of ETFs in Australia.

But size is not one of the key factors why it could be worth considering Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF.

Here are three to think about:

Diversification

The S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) is dominated by two industries: financials and resources. Within that there are a few sizeable businesses including Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) Westpac Banking Corp (ASX: WBC) BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) and Rio Tinto Limited (ASX: RIO).

But the Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF is very different. It has 100 non-financial businesses in its portfolio. Resources don't feature in the portfolio either. Almost half of the portfolio is classified as 'information technology' with another 19.7% in 'communication services' and 17.3% in 'consumer discretionary'.

But those classifications may not be exactly what you're thinking. Amazon and Tesla count as consumer discretionary businesses whilst Alphabet (Google) and Facebook count as communication services businesses.

Not only can an investor get exposure to 100 businesses outside of the ASX but those underlying earnings are being generated from right across the world. Think how many countries there are where people can use Google Search. Facebook is also in most countries in the world. And so on.

High-quality businesses

But this ETF isn't just about diversification for the sake of being different.

Many of the businesses in the Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF portfolio are among the best if not the best at what they do.

Apple is one of the global leaders in smartphones computers and the extra services it offers. Microsoft is very strong in numerous categories like office software cloud computing and gaming. Amazon has online retail cloud computing and so on.

However there are quite a few great companies in there not just the 'FAANG' shares.

PayPal is a huge player in the payments and online retail space. Adobe has a number of important offerings.

Broadcom Qualcomm Texas Instruments Intuit Moderna Applied Materials Advanced Micro Devices Intuitive Surgical Zoom and so on.

There are so many quality names in the portfolio that are generating strong profit growth and creating very powerful economic moats.

Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF's strong returns with a reasonable fee

Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF has an annual management fee of 0.48%.

The portfolio of quality names has produced sizeable returns over the shorter-term and longer-term.

However it's important to note that past performance is not an indicator of future performance.

Over the last 12 months the ETF has seen a net return of 31.6%. Since inception in May 2015 Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF has delivered an average return per annum of 22.5%.

However investors will have to wait and see what the next few years of returns looks like."

Part 1 was an overview of the fundamentals and regulations. This installment part 2 is on sample preparation. Part 3 will cover method development optimization and best practices and part 4 discusses method validation for regulated bioanalysis. This section provides an overview of sample preparation fundamentals best practices and modern trends. A sample preparation method development case study illustrates these practices and concepts.

Many factors need to be considered when developing sample preparation methods for bioanalysis. For a more in-depth discussion on sample preparation techniques the reader is referred to textbooks on general applications in chromatography (1) pharmaceutical assays (23) and bioanalysis (4). Modern trends and practical aspects in sample preparation can also be found in numerous articles on “Sample Prep Perspectives” in the LCGC North America column by Douglas Raynie (5). Sample matrix compounds chemical properties instrumentation and desired limits of quantitation (LOQs) all affect method development decisions for liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis of complex physiological samples. Multiple options exist for sample cleanup from more simple methods like filtration pass-through solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid-liquid or supported liquid extraction (LLE and SLE) to more complex methods like hydrophobic interaction and mixed-mode ion-exchange SPE with bonded silica or polymeric sorbents. This paper aims to review emerging trends in sample preparation of biological samples such as blood urine and tissues and sample preparation options based on their characteristics. Chemical properties such as the octanol–water partition coefficient (log P) and the acid dissociation constant (pK a ) that affect sample preparation and method development are discussed. Automation strategies are summarized. A case study on sample preparation method development and experimental design for a drug in plasma is presented.

Method Development Considerations

First the desired compounds their required LOQs and the instrumentation used for analysis should be determined. Will the method be a sensitive quantitative method or a qualitative screen? Are there any relevant metabolites that need to be included? How much of the specimen is available? What is the stability of the analytes in and out of the matrix?

Knowing the properties of the biological matrix is important to determine the type of sample preparation required. For example urine blood or tissues all have components that can cause ion suppression or enhancement and can foul the LC column and LC–MS instrumentation (4).

Matrices

Whole blood is a commonly analyzed matrix. It is about 80% water. The remaining 20% is primarily red blood cells (43%) plasma (50%) proteins fats and sugars. Plasma is mainly composed of proteins like albumin lipids and globulins. Lipids and phospholipids in plasma can cause ion suppression and build-up on LC columns resulting in clogging and reduced column lifetimes. Analytes can be bound to red blood cells or plasma proteins. Many analytes are bound to red blood cells that must be lysed during sample preparation for accurate quantitation. Water acidic or basic buffers (ammonium chloride trichloroacetic acid zinc sulfate perchloric acid) freezing or centrifuging can lyse red blood cells. Acidic buffers or organic solvents (trichloroacetic acid phosphoric acid formic acid zinc sulfate methanol ethanol isopropanol) can disrupt plasma proteins (46).

Urine another commonly analyzed matrix is about 95% water. The main interferences that should be removed from urine during extraction are salts urea pigments and creatinine. Many drugs and metabolites are enzymatically glucuronidated to aid in excretion from the body. These glucuronides can be measured directly but they usually do not ionize well and are more polar than their non-conjugated “free” drug or metabolite counterparts. Hydrolyzing conjugated metabolites to the “free” drug or metabolite increases sensitivity and simplifies method development. Hydrolysis can be done with acid or base but these are not very selective and usually require a pH adjustment prior to extraction. Enzyme hydrolysis with a natural or recombinant beta-glucuronidase enzyme is more selective. However using an enzyme introduces proteins to your urine sample that should be removed before analysis (7).

Tissues require extensive sample clean-up. Commonly analyzed tissues include liver brain heart and umbilical cord. Tissues contain blood vessels arteries veins muscles and other solid components. Tissues cannot be analyzed directly. They need to be homogenized and the analytes of interest extracted followed by sample preparation to remove inferences. Homogenization can be done with a blender bead mill tissue grinder or bead ruptor. Samples can be homogenized in the presence of aqueous or organic solvent until they are liquified. The homogenate is usually centrifuged and the supernatant is extracted for additional clean-up prior to LC–MS analysis (8).

Analyte Properties

Knowing the physicochemical properties of the target analytes can help determine the sample preparation procedure. Information on the structure functional groups polarity pK a  log P and stability is beneficial for selecting the appropriate approach and extraction parameters.

The log P indicates an analyte’s hydrophobicity. Analytes with a negative log P are more soluble in an aqueous solvent or more hydrophilic. Conversely analytes with a positive log P are more soluble in an organic solvent or more hydrophobic. This is an important consideration when developing LLE SLE or hydrophobic interaction SPE methods. The distribution coefficient log D provides information on the solubility and hydrophobicity of ionized compounds (9).

Knowing the functional groups of the molecule can help determine whether it is an acid or a base. For instance acidic drugs might have a sulfonic acid carboxylic acid or aromatic sulfonamide as part of their structures. Similarly basic drugs might have phenols imides aliphatic amines aromatic amines or heterocyclic amines as part of their structures. Amphoteric compounds contain both acidic and basic functional groups and have both a positive and a negative charge under certain pH conditions. Knowing a compound’s functional groups can aid in choosing possible sample preparation options (4).

The negative log of the acid dissociation constant or pK a  is the pH where a functional group of an analyte is 50% ionized and 50% neutral (non-ionized). This value is particularly important when developing sample preparation methods as the pH of the sample should not be near the analyte’s pK a  because the compound would be in two different ionization states. An analyte is usually fully charged or fully neutral two units away from its pK a . This phenomenon is defined by the Henderson-Hasselback equation (2). For example for a weak base with a pK a of 8 the analyte would be 100% positively charged two units below the pK a (pH 6 or lower) and 100% neutral two units above the pK a (pH 10 or higher). Similarly for a weak acid with a pK a of 6 the analyte would be fully ionized and negatively charged two units above the pK a (pH 8 or higher) and neutral two units below the pK a (pH 4 or lower). For LLE SLE and hydrophobic interaction SPE compounds should be neutral. For mixed-mode ion-exchange SPE compounds should be charged (10).

Many resources are available to research compound properties. Chemicalize (11) is a website that provides compound information like log P pK a  log D chemical structure solubility and other properties. It does require a paid subscription. The Human Metabolome Database (12) is a free service with information for many drugs and metabolites. Pubmed and Google Scholar are resources for peer-reviewed publications. Multiple reference books can also be used to research compound properties for example Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man (13).

Sample Preparation Options

Figure 1 shows sample preparation techniques organized by increasing selectivity and increasing sample cleanliness. Sample preparation options can be selected based on assay requirements and analyte properties. Table I summarizes SPE product offerings from several manufacturers categorized by sample preparation options and sorbent chemistries. This is not meant to be an all-inclusive list merely a sampling of what is available. The reader is encouraged to visit the company’s website for updated and detailed information. An overview of sample preparation options is described briefly below.

FIGURE 1: Selectivity vs. sample cleanliness using different sample preparation techniques.

Dilute and shoot methods simply diluting the sample and centrifuging prior to analysis yield the dirtiest samples. There is no clean-up involved and all matrix components are still present in the sample which can cause ion suppression or enhancement. Particulates can clog the LC column and contaminate the MS source.

Filtration of dilute and shoot samples can remove particulates from the sample. Samples can be passed through a syringe or vial filter or a filter plate for particulate removal prior to LC–MS analysis. These are usually 0.2 μm filters made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). An inline filter is usually placed pre-column and can capture any particulates that would otherwise build up in the LC system. These filters should be changed frequently as retained particulates accumulate and can leach out due to increased backpressure. LC guard columns can be used before the analytical column to retain components and increase LC column lifetime.

Protein removal is used for blood or plasma samples. This can be done manually or in a 96-well plate or cartridge. A crash solvent (such as acetonitrile or methanol) is added to the sample for a manual crash. Samples are mixed and centrifuged and the supernatant is collected. A protein removal plate or cartridge removes proteins and filters the sample. The crash solvent is usually added first then the sample is added mixed and vacuum or positive pressure is applied to collect the crashed sample. The precipitated proteins are retained while the rest of the sample flows through. Protein removal using manual plate or cartridge protocols only removes proteins which are not the only endogenous component that cause matrix effects or interferences when performing LC–MS/MS quantitation (414).

Phospholipid depletion plates or cartridges are a simple pass-through SPE for plasma samples. This technique removes both proteins and phospholipids using a protocol similar to protein removal (add crash solvent add sample mix and pass through sorbent). Precipitated proteins are retained by a filter and phospholipids are retained by scavenger chemistry.

Dual mode extraction is a pass-through SPE technique that uses a hygroscopic salt layer and a scavenger chemistry to retain salts urea creatinine and pigments from urine samples. Residual hydrolysis enzyme is also retained.

QuEChERS a dispersive SPE stands for “Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and Safe.” The extraction is done in a conical tube. Sample and acetonitrile are added to the tube. The tubes are then shaken buffering salts are added and the tube is centrifuged. The supernatant is transferred to a separate tube for evaporation reconstitution and analysis. This technique is popular for food and environmental analysis but is sparingly used with biological samples. It is a laborious manual process that cannot be easily automated (15).

LLE involves adding a water-immiscible organic solvent to an aqueous sample. The two phases are mixed and separated usually by centrifugation. Analytes of interest partition into the organic phase while most matrix components remain in the aqueous phase. Analytes should be hydrophobic with a log P >1 and neutral for optimal results. This is a selective cost-effective technique that yields clean extracts. However emulsions may be present that make separating the layers difficult. Increased variability can result as it is difficult to collect the entire organic layer. This is also a labor-intensive technique (16). LLE can also be used to partition interfering materials into the organic layer while the aqueous layer is collected for analysis.

SLE is analogous to LLE but with significant workflow advantages. Aqueous samples are loaded onto the sorbent (commonly refined modified diatomaceous earth) and a water-immiscible solvent is added to elute the analytes of interest. The aqueous layer remains absorbed on the sorbent while the organic solvent flows through. No emulsions are present and SLE can easily be automated. Like LLE this technique works best when analytes have a log P >1 and are neutral (17). The aqueous layer cannot be collected as it remains absorbed on the SLE material.

Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE)

SPE methods are the most selective and yield the cleanest extracts. However they are the most expensive and labor-intensive. A typical method includes conditioning and equilibrating the sorbent usually with an organic solvent followed by an aqueous buffer to prepare the sorbent to receive the aqueous sample. Next a pretreated sample is loaded followed by wash steps. An aqueous wash removes water-soluble interferences. A second wash using an organic solvent or an aqueous-organic solvent solution (for example 50:50 water:methanol or water:acetonitrile) can be added to remove more non-polar interferences. Controlling the pH and optimizing solvent strength ensures the analytes of interest remain bound to the sorbent while interferences are removed. Lastly compounds are eluted from the sorbent and the eluent is usually evaporated and reconstituted before analysis. Sorbents can be silica or polymer-based. Polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PSDVB) polymeric sorbents are stable across the entire pH range. Many manufacturers modify the hydrophobic polymer with hydrophilic functional groups to make it water-wettable so the conditioning and equilibration steps can be eliminated.

Hydrophobic interaction (reversed-phase) SPE methods rely on the partitioning of the analytes between the hydrophobic sorbent and extraction solvent for retention and elution similar to reversed-phase LC separations. The non-polar interactions are not as strong as ionic retention mechanisms so the strength of any wash step containing an organic solvent must be carefully controlled so that target analytes are not eluted during sample clean-up. Washes with only 5–10% organic solvent are common for more hydrophilic analytes. Stronger organic wash solutions can be used for more hydrophobic compounds. This technique can be used for non-ionized hydrophobic analytes like steroids or acidic and basic analytes at a pH where they are neutral. Very hydrophobic charged compounds may also be extracted.

Mixed-mode ion-exchange SPE products are reversed-phase sorbents modified with an ionic functional group. Analytes are retained by nonpolar and ion-exchange interactions. Ion-exchange is a stronger retention mechanism than hydrophobic interaction so a stronger organic wash can be used to produce cleaner extracts for ionized compounds. Strong cation- or anion-exchange sorbents have a strong acid or base (such as sulfonic acid or quaternary ammonium) as functional groups. These are charged over the entire pH range. These mixed-mode sorbents work well for weak bases or weak acids respectively. Analytes of interest should be charged during sample load by pretreating the sample using the pH rule of 2 described previously. The charge is then “turned off” during elution. Retention and elution are controlled by modifying the pH of the sample. Weak cation- or anion-exchange chemistries have a weak acid or base as functional groups (carboxylic acid or primary/ secondary amine). They are used to extract strong bases or strong acids respectively. Strong acids and bases are charged across the entire pH range in solution so retention and elution are controlled by modifying the pH of the sorbent. The sorbent is charged during load and neutral during elution (18). Figure 2 is a flow chart to help determine which SPE sorbent is best based on whether an analyte is acidic basic or neutral.

Automation and Robotics

The ultimate goal of most bioanalytical assays is the delivery of accurate and reliable quantitative results. While no two samples are exactly alike optimized sample preparation procedures can minimize sample variability and produce cleaner extracts for more robust bioanalysis assays. Given the inherent variability with manual sample preparation procedures compounded by operator skill level many laboratories have embraced automation and robotics to enhance laboratory productivity reduce labor costs and increase assay reliability.

Over the last twenty years advancements in technology have resulted in the development of reliable automated instruments for the bioanalytical laboratory. Automation has quickly become the foundation of the modern laboratory including highly customizable multifunctional liquid handlers to smaller task-focused products. Automated workflows translate to less manual intervention higher reproducibility and labor savings.

Robotic platforms with multifunctional fully automated liquid handling abilities are prevalent in larger high-throughput laboratories with heavy workloads. They are highly customizable for simple transfer steps and may be programmed for entirely hands-free sample preparation procedures. Most are fitted with multichannel pipetting arms which are adaptable to both individual test tube workflows and high-throughput assays in 96- or 384-well-plates. Table II describes some common automation platforms categorized by instrument complexity functionality and vendor. The Fluent platform by Tecan and the Biomek i-Series systems from Beckman Coulter are some of the more complex yet versatile instruments on the market today. Integration with an end-user database or laboratory information management system (LIMS) allows these devices to provide added benefits beyond just sample handling. For example analytical results can be linked to sample handling procedures providing a clear reliable chain of custody. This is important in regulated laboratories or when bioanalytical testing bears legal implications.

Table II lists common sample preparation automation platforms by instrument complexity functionality and vendor. Fully automated systems provide high reproducibility and limited analyst intervention but these conveniences do carry a considerable price tag. Besides the initial capital expense these devices may require the use of vendor-specific consumables specialized training to operate and costly service contracts to maintain the investment. Another practical concern with fully automated platforms is the high reliance on a single all-in-one instrument. This model can produce considerable pinch points should the instrument fail or require extensive maintenance. As a result many laboratories find it necessary to purchase duplicate systems to avoid significant delays in productivity. However a simpler alternative to this issue is to acquire smaller task-focused robotic devices.

Sample preparation is a challenging step of any bioanalytical workflow. Variability and imprecision may significantly influence the quality of results. Smaller devices of moderate complexity also exist in addition to fully automated robotic platforms. These task-focused platforms enhance reproducibility minimize manual interventions and provide high-throughput solutions. These devices typically employ an adaptable stage suitable for column or plate-based extractions a positive pressure manifold and either a multichannel pipetting arm or solvent dispensing line (see Table II). The Biotage Extrahera is an automated sample preparation instrument which uses a positive pressure manifold and an eight-channel pipetting arm to execute many different extractions. These include filtration protocols pass-through SPE SLE and robust traditional SPE methods. Tecan also offers a solution for standalone sample preparation with the Resolvex A200. This instrument offers positive pressure processing with a multi-solvent dispensing line and is suitable for 96-well plates or 1 mL narrow-bore columns. Manual manipulation may be required for initial sample transfers evaporation or post-extraction concentration. These platforms focus on the sensitive extraction steps hence the task-focused nature of their operation. Unlike the all-in-one devices these units are typically available at a fraction of the cost to purchase operate and maintain. They are also more user-friendly to program. They possess significantly smaller footprints aimed at conserving laboratory space. When cost becomes a driving factor many laboratories further reduce the role of automated robotics to supplement some core functionalities with manual devices.

Features included on automated devices of both high and moderate complexity exist as standalone products from multiple vendors (refer to Table II). Multichannel pipets are available with manual or semi-automated functionality for initial sample transfers or the addition of buffers reagents and solvents during the sample extraction. Positive pressure or vacuum manifolds can accommodate both cartridge and plate formats. The Positive Pressure Manifold 2.0 from UCT is one of several manual devices on the market. This unit is a 48-position device that can accommodate 1 3 and 6 mL extraction cartridges. Manual concentration systems are available for both plates and cartridges requiring only an electrical outlet and a source of clean nitrogen for operation. The Biotage TurboVap LV is a small but efficient sample evaporator accommodating various standard test tubes and vials and offer programmable methods for semi-automated operation.

Modern Trends for Sample Preparation in Bioanalysis

Bioanalytical assay development has evolved with the development of new chemistries and polymeric SPE sorbents. While traditional sample types and extraction methods exist novel products and approaches are being introduced to streamline and enhance routine analysis. Some new products focus on handling complex chemical extractions while others aim to simplify analyses using low specimen volumes. Bioanalytical assays are trending towards less invasive collection devices and alternate matrices like tissue extracts.

The most common and traditional technology for the clean-up of bioanalytical samples involves chemically modified silica products. Common issues with these products include channeling in the silica bed premature drying and moderate retention. In addition bonded silica phases are often not stable at high and low pH running the risk of hydrolysis of the bonded phase at low pH and dissolution of the silica backbone at high pH. The solution has been the introduction of mixed-mode polymer extraction chemistries. Most of these products are manufactured using a PSDVB backbone which may be modified with various functional groups to facilitate ion-exchange and hydrophobic interactions. As a result the retention mechanism is typically stronger than silica particles and the polymer backbone is more resistant to channeling and premature drying during extraction procedures. This translates to simpler and easily automated extractions capable of delivering rapid and cleaner eluates for analysis.

Limited specimen volume is a commonly encountered issue for many bioanalytical assays. For example clinical neonatal tests for acylcarnitine may be supplied with as little as 50 to 100 μL of the sample because collecting specimens from newborns is a delicate task (19). Additionally some laboratories may need to perform several different types of analysis on a single sample such as serum for steroids xenobiotics and electrolytes. In many cases specimen volumes are limited. High purity extraction solvents are expensive so minimizing the waste of these materials is paramount. One trending solution to these problems is the use of micro-elution SPE products. The first option is loosely packed sorbents with selective chemistries fitted into narrow but hollow plastic tips. The typical bed volume is 0.5 to 5 mg. These are then fitted into a 96-well-plate for high throughput workflows. The resulting extraction protocol requires lower specimen volume and reduced solvent use typically 50–100 μL for washes and 30–50 μL for elution. Eluates can be concentrated for increased sensitivity or diluted eliminating the evaporation step.

A second micro-elution format uses a dispersive pipet extraction (DPX) a technology approach consisting of loosely packed SPE resins inside individual pipet tips. These tips may be fitted to manual pipets or fully automated liquid handlers. The extraction process involves introducing samples retaining analytes and removing interferences by multiple aspirate-and-dispense steps to utilize a dispersive SPE technique. Compounds of interest are eluted with conventional solvents. This approach is highly adaptable and yields reasonable recoveries (20) yet samples with higher viscosities such as blood and tissue may prove challenging to manage with dispersive pipet extractions.

Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) uses a fiber-coated frit incorporating an SPE extraction phase with an affinity for the analytes of interest. Here exposing the fiber to liquified samples results in a partitioning of analytes from the sample matrix to the extraction phase. The extraction requires no solvent and analytes are concentrated on the fiber. The fiber can be placed in a small amount of solvent for desorption and LC–MS analysis. This technology is ideal for gaseous liquid and solid samples stemming from field-based applications such as environmental studies. Applications of SPME in high-throughput bioanalysis with moderate recovery and reproducible data have been published (21).

In addition to novel chemistries and products the use of alternate matrices and collection devices have altered approaches to bioanalytical method development. One highly intriguing approach involves bloodspot analysis. Small drops of blood may be collected onto thin paper-like sampling devices with a mere prick of the finger. Once at the laboratory these blood spots may be subjected to further chemical extractions digestions or washes targeting the analysis of numerous xenobiotics or endogenous biomolecules. Volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) is a novel approach that permits collecting a fixed volume of whole blood using a sampling device with a porous hydrophilic tip to collect small accurate and precise blood volumes. The blood in the device is dried for storage or transport. These samples can be extracted with an appropriate solvent which can undergo further sample clean-up by LLE SLE or SPE (22).

The advancement of technology improves the quality of bioanalytical analysis while reshaping applications by introducing new products and novel sampling techniques. Choosing an automated platform is no simple task. Throughput needs budgetary restrictions and LIMS compatibility are the primary considerations. Regardless of the workflow design an automated or manual solution is available for sample preparation to ensure accurate and reproducible results.

Method Development Case Study for a Weakly Basic Drug in Plasma

Sample preparation method development begins by researching analyte properties. Our hypothetical drug is a weak base with a primary amine. A deuterated internal standard (IS) is available. Using calculated values from Chemicalize.com the molecule has a log P of 2.1 and a pK a of 8.2. The desired LOQ is 10 ng/mL and the desired plasma volume is 200 μL. Once our LC–MS/MS method is optimized and sensitivity is established we can begin our extraction experiments.

Based on the matrix and analyte properties sample preparation options are phospholipid depletion/protein removal (because the matrix is plasma) LLE or SLE (since the analyte is hydrophobic) and mixed-mode strong cation-exchange SPE (as the analyte is a weak base). Sample preparation method development should not be done at the LOD or LOQ or using a single data point. Instead spiked samples should be prepared and extracted in duplicate or triplicate at a single concentration 5 to 10 times the LOQ in this case 50 to 100 ng/mL. Include an extraction blank (EB reagents with no specimen) and negative control (NC analyte-free matrix with only IS added). Averaged area counts from triplicate extracts are compared to a no matrix “unextracted” standard (UNX analyte and internal standard in reconstitution solvent) at the same concentration as the extracted sample to calculate the process efficiency. Once the best sample preparation method is determined linearity external QC positive and negative specimens recovery matrix effect and process efficiency (23) are evaluated using the final optimized method conditions.

Phospholipid depletion involves minimal method development. Different ratios of the specimen to crash solvent can be scouted. Some products recommend the addition of an acid to increase the recovery of more polar analytes. Acetonitrile usually provides cleaner extracts than methanol but either solvent can be used. Figure 3 shows an example of a 96-well plate (a “plate map”) configured to evaluate different conditions for phospholipid depletion using acetonitrile. Variables are three different crash solvent to plasma ratios (3:1 4:1 and 6:1) and the addition of 1% formic acid to the crash solvent. Samples are extracted and analyzed in triplicate at 50 ng/mL (5x the desired LOQ) with an EB NC and UNX.

FIGURE 3: A 96-well plate configured to evaluate phospholipid depletion and protein removal SPE for a hypothetical weakly basic drug in plasma.

LLE or SLE works best if the analyte is neutral. The primary amine would be neutral 2 units above its pKa (pH 10.2 or higher). Pretreating plasma 1:1 with 0.5 M ammonium hydroxide will neutralize the primary amine for partitioning into the water-immiscible solvent. Figure 4 shows a plate map to scout four different elution solvents using SLE. Spiked samples at 50 ng/mL are analyzed in triplicate with an EB NC and UNX.

FIGURE 4: Plate map to evaluate four different elution solvents using supported liquid extraction (SLE) to extract a weakly basic drug in plasma. Load and elution volumes are dependent upon SLE capacity. This experiment uses a 400 μL SLE+ plate.

The analyte must be positively charged for polymeric mixed-mode strong cation-exchange SPE. The weakly basic drug would be charged at a pH <6.2. Pretreating plasma 1:1 with 0.1 M pH 5 ammonium acetate buffer or 2% formic acid will accomplish this. However 2% formic acid will also disrupt plasma proteins if protein binding is a concern.

Figure 5 shows a plate map for triplicate samples pretreated with 2% formic acid. Our analyte should be retained by cation exchange which means a 100% methanol or acetonitrile wash will provide the best cleanup. In this case we will scout a 50% methanol and a 100% methanol wash and three different elution solvents: 88:10:2 dichloromethane: 2-propanol: ammonium hydroxide (DCM:IPA:NH 4 OH) 98:2 methanol:NH 4 OH or 98:2 acetonitrile:NH 4 OH.

FIGURE 5: Plate map to scout two organic washes and three elution solvents to extract a weakly basic drug in plasma using polymeric mixed-mode strong cation-exchange SPE. Volumes are dependent upon sorbent bed mass. This experiment is set up for a 10 mg plate.

The load and wash steps are collected to analyze for troubleshooting if low or no recovery of the target analyte is observed. If the analyte is in the load step it was never retained. If the analyte is in a wash step the wash was too aggressive and became an elution solvent. If it is not in the load wash or elution fractions it was retained on the sorbent and never eluted possibly decomposed evaporated or was “stuck” to the elution vial or collection plate due to non-specific binding.

Elution can be done with a single fraction of solvent or two smaller aliquots. Improved recovery and better precision are usually seen with two fractions of elution solvent (2 x 0.5 mL) compared to a single application (1 mL).

Scouting sample preparation options using plate maps can generate simple experiments that investigate the effects of a few variables or use more of the plate to evaluate more options. The plate map in Figure 4 for example could be modified to evaluate the ammonium acetate pretreatment an additional wash (like acetonitrile in addition to methanol) or additional elution solvents.

Process efficiencies for each sample preparation option are reviewed and the best option is selected for further development. Calibrators patient specimens casework samples proficiency testing samples or other external QC are analyzed and then recovery matrix effect and process efficiency are determined prior to full method validation (23).

Developing a new extraction method can seem daunting at first. However knowing about the compounds in the panel the matrix the specifics about the extraction technique and the use of plate maps can make the method development process faster and more efficient.

The US-based Cleaningmamabee account on Tik Tok specializes in product overloads which involves mixing together large amounts of cleaning solutions in various places in her house much to the delight of her 1.1million followers.

ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) is the feeling of a tingle-like sensation in the head neck spine and even legs that make people feel sleepy and relaxed and can be triggered by certain noises and visuals.

But while some might find it calming to watch her swirling colourful chemicals around the toilet bowl one of her latest concoctions has led to a backlash from followers for wasting products and 'harming the environment'.

Tik Tok star Cleaningmamabee who clogs her toilet with cleaning products has sparked outrage with her 'dangerous and wasteful' ASMR videos

The social media star who has 1.1million followers specialises in prduct overloads which involves mixing together large amounts of cleaning products

In the video entitled 'Orange and Lavender Collab' the TikTok star showed her fans the enormous amount of products she planned to use.

She then blocked off the toilet with a Scrub Daddy sponge to stop the water touching the product and began piling in a range of different orange and purple products.

The products and colours all blended in together creating interesting patterns before she sprayed a thick layer of cleaning foam on top.

Not content with that she continued to layer on top this time opening up several pots of Comet and Ajax power and pouring the whole lot inside the bowl.

In one of her latest videos titled 'Orange and Lavender Collab' she added an enormous amount of products into the toilet bowl before whipping them up into a paste and then adding more colour and product

Before long the toilet was full to the brim with various products and wearing a pair of rubber gloves she stuck her hand in the bowl and began mixing it all together.

She eventually made a thick purple-coloured paste in her hands and adding more and more products - much to the shock of some viewers.

The cleaning fanatic admitted that she worried the water may pour over the rim of the toilet when she flushed it.

She said she began to panic as the water rose and whipped out a brush to unblock the toilet writing: 'This was the moment I knew I effed up.'

The buyer’s market that had been awash with sensibly-priced offerings only a few months earlier had turned into an unseemly scramble for vans ‘at any price’ that made the worst excesses of the Harrods sale seem genteel.

With only hours remaining before I was due to undertake an ‘essential’ road trip to Greece (and after almost as many hours of searching) I finally found a van on ‘Gumtree’ that hadn’t been snapped-up. It was 70 miles away and being sold by a builder who had owned it for an entire 10 days. Just 15 years old and with a mere 179000 miles on the clock all of its dashboard warning lights glowing brightly a broken engine mount and a price tag of £2100 – what could possibly go wrong?

Most popular Brendan O’Neill What is the anti-Israel Eurovision protest really about?

In the event and contrary to what I had been led to expect after reading many ‘expert’ internet reviews my plain white Vauxhall Vivaro proved to be more than up to the job lugging me and a full ‘payload’ (as we haulage types call it) 2500 miles to Corfu and back without incident.



But while the Vivaro (affectionately known in this household as ‘the Wuss Van’ on account of its WU55 registration) is undoubtedly a loyal and thoroughbred workhorse the thing that I grew to like about it most during our Greek Odyssey was the fact that I could pull-over wherever I pleased climb in through the side door and bed down for the night – something that proved invaluable last year when the Covid situation made the availability of overnight accommodation decidedly patchy.



Although I have no wish to reduce the Wuss Van’s useful payload through the addition of built-in bunks cookers fridges cutlery drawers and other domestic paraphernalia this minimalist ‘home on wheels’ certainly made me understand why camper vans have become so popular – and now there’s a whole new way of taking to the road in one thanks to the arrival of an outfit called Justkampershire.com.

A VW T2 Bay available for hire

The venture is the brainchild of VW camper fans Mark Reynolds and Karl Moss the former being the MD of of Hampshire-based VW parts sales and repair business Just Kampers – which he founded in 1989 – and the latter being a camper-loving entrepreneur with a background in e-commerce. By combining their skills the pair have developed an on-line platform that enables camper owners to list their vehicles as being available for would-be adventurers to rent with the aim of bringing the two together in a mutually beneficial arrangement that could be described as the camper van equivalent of Air B ‘n’ B.

To make the service as easy to use as possible the Justkampershire.com site allows renters to select the area from which they wish to travel and see nearby vans on offer based on the relevant dates of travel. It’s also possible to search by specific van type and to ‘filter’ that by price and amenities.

Once the vehicle and location have been settled on it’s a simple matter to fill in the required paperwork online to arrange insurance and to check the hirer’s driving licence status and other credentials.

‘We’ve kept everything online to make booking as simple as possible and to give van owners the peace of mind that their vehicle is properly insured and being driven by someone they can trust’ explains Moss. ‘We realised that there are many people who like the idea of a camper van holiday but don’t necessarily wish to own a van – and there are also plenty of owners who are keen to make some money from their vans when they are not using themselves. Which in many cases is for the majority of the year.’

Although the site was inspired by the founders’ enthusiasm for the VW marque any type of camper may be listed from the smallest ‘micro’ camping car to the most luxuriously-appointed ‘RV’ at locations from northern Scotland to the tip of Cornwall and anywhere in between (London included).

Justkampershire.com also includes overviews of the UK’s different regions giving typical weather patterns popular tourist sites and places to pitch.

But if you’re looking to spend a week in Devon in a white Vauxhall Vivaro with no facilities other than a radio and cd player I might just consider a private deal for the Wuss Van.

Airbnb rentals are no longer just for cheap rooms apartments or homes.

The platform is now selling stays in several high-end properties some of which cost over R200000 per night.

Although Cape Town has the highest number of pricey properties Limpopo hosts the most expensive property on a per-night basis.

Here are the priciest properties listed on Airbnb in each South African province.

Airbnb is no longer the domain of budget room rentals in mid-level homes and apartments. The room apartment and home rental platform now hosts some of the country's most exclusive private residences that you can - in most cases - rent directly from the owner.





Although it's still possible to rent a fairly decent room apartment or home in South Africa for under R1000 per night there are a surprising number of homes villas penthouses and sprawling estates that go for well over R100000 per night - many with two- or three-night minimum stays. And with wealthy international tourists still unable to easily travel to South Africa given Covid-19 restrictions some of the country's most exclusive game lodges now allow you to book their properties directly on the platform - though some come with hefty fees you might be able to avoid if you book direct.





Unsurprisingly the Western Cape has the highest number of homes on the platform that fetch over R100000 per night - there are at least 14 listings that meet this requirement mostly along the Atlantic Seaboard.





More surprising are the provinces that now top the list. North West Northern Cape and Limpopo all of which have lavish properties listed on Airbnb that cost roughly R200000 per night - and some of which have a two- or three-night minimum stay.





Here are the most expensive properties currently listed on Airbnb in each province:





Johannesburg

The Houghton (R55000 per night)





Gauteng's high-end Airbnb rental market is significantly cheaper than that of the Western Cape's. A one night stay in the Houghton Hotel penthouse costs around R55000 per night and is about as pricey as it gets for a mid-year stay in the province. For this you'll get ""all the mod-cons"" including a splash pool butler security and views of a Jack Nicklaus golf course and Joburg's skyline. The penthouse has four bedrooms that can sleep up to eight guests.





Mpumalanga

Fitzpatrick's at Jock (R59595 per night plus R19351 in fees)





This three-roomed lodge at Jock Safari Lodge in the Kruger National Park is among the most expensive Airbnb rentals in Mpumalanga. The home has a minimum two-night stay at just under R60000 per night which together with the service fee puts the cheapest stay here at around R140000. For this six guests can appreciate a variety of high-end private game lodge facilities such as swimming pools and decks with views over the surrounding bush.





North West

Molori Safari Lodge (R210000 per night plus R94000 in fees)





Molori Safari Lodge in Madikwe costs a staggering R210000 per night - and that's before you've added the R94500 surcharge for ""occupancy taxes and fees"" for the minimum three-night stay. This puts the cheapest possible stay at the lodge at around R724500 or R241000 per night. The lodge has seven bedrooms that can sleep a total of 14 guests. Molori has appeared not to have spared any expenses in the design of the lodge. According to the property description ""rich hardwood heated floors and smooth boarded decks lead the eye from indoors to out to a mirror-calm infinity pool which will entice you for a lantern-lit dip."" The property also comes with access to gourmet chefs a gym sauna and hot tub as well as access to game drives in the surrounding reserve.





Northern Cape

Tarkuni Villa (R198646 per night)









Tarkuni Villa is located in the popular Tswalu Private Game Reserve. At just under R200000 per night for up to 10 guests and a two-night minimum stay it's comfortably the most expensive property in the Northern Cape. According to Tswalu Tarkuni Villa is ""a truly elegant jungle home"" that ""mixes chandelier lighting and state of the art tech features with rugged exposed wood natural stone and a free-flowing open-air environment"". If you can tear yourself away from the terrace guided safaris and bush walks are included in the price. A helicopter flip to the top of a local mountain for a picnic lunch is however not.





Limpopo

Cheetah Plains (R225400 per night plus R4432 in fees)





Three luxury villas at Cheetah Plains in the Sabi Sands Game Reserve are among the most expensive Airbnb rentals in South Africa. Each currently costs R225400 per night for up to eight people and have a three-night minimum stay that will push the total minimum bill up above R600000. The lodges also have additional fees of between R2224 and R4432. Features at individual lodges differ but include the likes of heated pools double rain showers private chefs outdoor bomas and indulgences like manicures and massages. Guides are also on hand to take guests for regular game drives in electric vehicles that are equipped with heated seats.





Cape Town

19 on Clifton (R177889 per night)





Cape Town has at least ten homes available for rent that'll cost you more than R100000 per night - even in the city's offseason. But the five-bedroom ""villa"" called 19 on Clifton is among the most expensive at an eye-watering R177889 per night. You'll also need to factor in the property's five-night minimum stay which pushes your total minimum bill up to R889446. According to the description the home is a ""French-inspired seaside villa decorated with light wood tones elegant marble and floor-to-ceiling windows wherever possible"". There's also a farmhouse kitchen swimming pool hot tub home cinema room wet bar wine cellar poker table two formal dining areas and a private chef.





Free State

The relaxant and homely guesthouse (R12699 per night plus R2062 in fees)





The Free State is devoid of rentals with costs that rival those of its neighbouring provinces. Although a few villas along the Vaal hover around the R10000 per night mark it's this 16-person guest house in Bloem that appears to be the priciest vacation rental in the province. The seven bedrooms have a total of 22 beds and share three bathrooms. According to the description it's a property ""styled to the comfort and taste of those who enjoy majestic surroundings"". The guest house allows pets and smoking and includes access to the garden and an outside braai.





KwaZulu-Natal

Prince's Grant (R52578 per night)





This villa in KwaZulu-Natal can sleep up to 13 guests in four bedrooms and promises guests a ""prime location with magnificent breaker ocean and forest views"". Its two-night minimum means that the cheapest stay here will cost just over R105000. For that guests get direct access to the beach and lagoon as well as several other activities included at the golf estate including canoeing fishing tennis squash and golf.





Eastern Cape

Sarili at Shamwari (R71400)





The most expensive Airbnb stay in the Eastern Cape is in Shamwari Private Game Reserve. Sarili Private Lodge costs R71400 per night - with a two-night minimum stay - and claims to offer ""a private oasis for families groups and friends"". According to the description the lodge has ""majestic views of the Bushman's River and the grassy plains but also offers supreme comfort magnificent sunsets and a wildlife experience that you'll never forget"". Included in the price are all meals select local drinks and guided game drives and bush walks."

A public-private partnership led by Harvard and MIT the center seeks to foster partnerships between academics biopharma and medical leaders to accelerate the production and delivery of new treatment technologies to patients. Previously known as the Massachusetts Center for Advanced Biological Innovation and Manufacturing since its formation in late 2019 it also received a new name on Thursday: Landmark Bio.

Landmark Bio began construction on its facility at the Arsenal on the Charles in Watertown on Thursday where it plans to open offices and labs at the start of next year according to a press release. It signed a lease on the facility in January after raising $76 million in funding.

Zheng — who has more than 25 years of leadership experience at major pharmaceutical companies including Amgen and most recently as Chief Technical Officer at Orchard Therapeutics — started her new position at Landmark Bio in March of this year.

In Thursday’s release University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 — who also serves as the chair of Landmark Bio’s board — said Zheng brings experience and expertise “at the perfect time” to her new role.

“As a leader with broad and deep industry expertise and an impressive record of achievement in technology development and global clinical development Ran comes to this role at the perfect time” Garber said.

He added that the start of construction of the facility is only the beginning of efforts to “innovate” and “support” the creation of biological therapies.

“The facility will ease key bottlenecks in the development of some of the most promising approaches to therapy today” Garber said.

Led by Zheng Landmark Bio plans to recruit more than 100 experts in emerging biotechnologies such as cancer immunotherapy and CRISPR/Cas9 editing.

“I am very excited to join the Landmark Bio team and collaborate with the extraordinary scientists physicians and entrepreneurs who are in the forefront of biological innovation” Zheng said in the release.

“We have a unique opportunity to harness the power of mission-driven collaboration and help turn today’s cutting-edge research into tomorrow’s breakthrough therapies and shape the future of human health” she added.

The facility’s initial areas of focus will include cell and gene therapy gene editing and messenger RNA products — all promising biotechnologies with the potential to treat and cure life-threatening diseases such as cancer Parkinson’s and Alzheimer's. In particular the use of mRNA in the clinical setting has come into the spotlight in the last year with the successful development of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

The center will house manufacturing space for clinical trial products innovation and development labs quality control services and offices and meeting spaces according to the release.

Landmark Bio will partner with several Harvard Medical School affiliates including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Boston Children’s Hospital Brigham and Women’s Hospital the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. The center will also collaborate with the state government through the Massachusetts Life Science Center.

In the release Massachusetts Housing and Development Secretary Mike Kennealy said state leaders and Massachusetts Life Sciences Center are “committed” to supporting the center’s “immense potential” in innovation.

“The Commonwealth has long recognized the power of public-private partnerships to unlock new opportunities that create jobs spur economic development and strengthen burgeoning areas of our economy such as biomanufacturing” Kennealy said.

“The Baker-Polito Administration and the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center are committed to ensuring we build a strong foundation for future growth and collaboration to advance the immense potential that this endeavor can contribute to the Massachusetts innovation ecosystem” he added.

The tech industry in China has had quite a turbulent week. The government is upending its $100 billion private education sector wiping billions from the market cap of the industry’s most lucrative players. Meanwhile the assault on Chinese internet giants continued. Tech stocks tumbled after Tencent suspended user registration sparking fears over who will be the next target of Beijing’s wrath.

Incisive observers point out that the new wave of stringent regulations against China’s internet and education firms has long been on Beijing’s agenda and there’s nothing surprising. Indeed the central government has been unabashed about its desires to boost manufacturing and contain the unchecked powers of its service industry which can include everything from internet platforms film studios to after-school centers.

A few weeks ago I had an informative conversation with a Chinese venture capitalist who has been investing in industrial robots for over a decade so I’m including it in this issue as it provides useful context for what’s going on in the consumer tech industry this week.

Automate the factories

China is putting robots into factories at an aggressive pace. Huang He a partner at Northern Light Venture Capital sees three forces spurring the demand for industrial robots — particularly ones that are made in China.

Over the years Beijing has advocated for “localization” in a broad range of technology sectors from enterprise software to production line automation. One may start to see Chinese robots that can rival those of Schneider and Panasonic a few years down the road. CRP an NLVC-backed industrial robot maker is already selling across Southeast Asia Russia and East Europe.

On top of tech localization it’s also well acknowledged that China is facing a severe demographic crisis. The labor shortage in its manufacturing sector is further compounded by the reluctance of young people to do menial factory work. Factory robots could offer a hand.

“Youngsters these days would rather become food delivery riders than work in a factory. The work that robots replace is the low-skilled type and those that still can’t be taken up by robots pay well and come with great benefits” Huang observed.

Large corporations in China still lean toward imported robots due to the products’ proven stability. The problem is that imported robots are not only expensive but also selective about their users.

“Companies need to have deep technical capabilities to be able to operate these [Western] robots but such companies are rare in China” said Huang adding that the overwhelming majority of Chinese enterprises are small and medium size.

With the exceptions of the automotive and semiconductor industries which still largely rely on sophisticated imported robots affordable easy-to-use Chinese robots can already meet most of the local demand for industrial automation Huang said.

China currently uses nearly one million six-axis robots a year but only manufactures 20% of them itself. The gap coupled with a national plan for localization has led to a frenzy of investments in industrial robotics startups.

The rush isn’t necessarily a good thing said Huang. “There’s this bizarre phenomenon in China where the most funded and valuable industrial robotic firms are generating less than 30 million yuan in annual revenue and not really heard of by real users in the industry.”

“This isn’t an industry where giants can be created by burning through cash. It’s not the internet sector.”

Small-and-medium-size businesses are happily welcoming robots onto factory floors. Take welding for example. An average welder costs about 150000 yuan ($23200) a year. A typical welding robot which is sold for 120000 yuan can replace up to three workers a year and “doesn’t complain at work” said the investor. A quality robot can work continuously for six to eight years so the financial incentive to automate is obvious.

Advanced manufacturing is not just helping local bosses. It will eventually increase foreign enterprises’ dependence on China for its efficiency making it hard to cut off Chinese supply chains despite efforts to avoid the geopolitical risks of manufacturing in China.

“In electronics for example most of the supply chains are in China so factories outside China end up spending more on logistics to move parts around. Much of the 3C manufacturing is already highly automated which relies heavily on electricity but in most emerging economies the power supply is still quite unstable which disrupts production” said Huang.

War on internet titans

The shock of antitrust regulations against Alibaba from last year is still reverberating but another wave of scrutiny has already begun. Shortly after Didi’s blockbuster IPO in New York the ride-hailing giant was asked to cease user registration and work on protecting user information critical to national security.

On Tuesday Tencent stocks fell the most in a decade after it halted user signups on its WeChat messenger as it “upgrades” its security technology to align with relevant laws and regulations. The gaming and social media giant is just the latest in a growing list of companies hit by Beijing’s tightening grip on the internet sector which had been flourishing for two decades under laissez-faire policies.

Underlying the clampdowns is Beijing’s growing unease with the service industry’s unscrutinized accumulation of wealth and power. China is unequivocally determined to advance its tech sector but the types of tech that Beijing wants are not so much the video games that bring myopia to children and algorithms that get adults hooked to their screens. China makes it clear in its five-year plan a series of social and economic initiatives that it will go all-in on “hard tech” like semiconductors renewable energy agritech biotech and industrial automation like factory robotics.

China has also vowed to fight inequality in education and wealth. In the authorities’ eyes expensive for-profit after-schools dotting big cities are hindering education attainment for children from poorer areas which eventually exacerbates the wealth gap. The new regulatory measures have restricted the hours content profits and financing of private tutoring institutions tanking stocks of the industry’s top companies. Again there have been clear indications from President Xi Jinping’s writings to bring off-campus tutoring “back on the educational track.” All China-focused investors and analysts are now poring over Xi’s thoughts and directives.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Canadian Brent Fikowski and Australian Tia-Clair Toomey started Friday in first place overall with 322 and 397 points respectively. With the absence of five-time CrossFit Games champion Mat Fraser — who would usually be dominating the leaderboard by this point — the men’s race was closer than ever. Just 9 points separated Fikowksi and Justin Medeiros in second. Toomey sat 57 points ahead of Haley Adams.

Event 5 was the only known event on Friday morning but by the end of the day athletes had competed in five scored events making waves on the leaderboard as we look ahead to Saturday.

Event 5



4 rounds for time:

4 rope climbs 20 ft.

500/400-m SkiErg

42-ft. sandbag carry 150 | 200 lb.

Time cap: 15 min.

Men

The men took the field first at the Alliant Energy Center. In the first heat Australian Royce Dunne set the time to beat in the forearm-demanding triplet of rope climbs SkiErg and heavy sandbag carries. Dunne crossed the finish line at 12:01.53 which was good enough for third in the event after the last heat had had its way with the challenge.

The final heat was a battle of Canadians as overall leader Fikowski and 2018’s second-fittest Man on Earth Patrick Vellner finished the final round’s SkiErg at nearly the same time. But it was Vellner who persevered continuing to advance past his unfortunate Event 1 finish as he won the event grabbed 100 points and climbed to fourth overall.

“Every now and then you get a little slow-ball pitch for the tall guys” Vellner said after the event. “The sandbag — when you're a bit longer you can link the hands and you don't have to squeeze your chest so much. So I think the bigger athletes finally got a break on that one.”

Men’s Event 5 Results

Patrick Vellner - 11:49.00 Brent Fikowski - 12:01.27 Royce Dunne - 12:01.53

Women

Former rock climber and 2018’s second-fittest woman on Earth Laura Horváth established herself as the woman to beat in Heat 2. With a solid grip on the rope the erg and the sandbag Horváth led the heat throughout.

Though she was followed by Gabriela Migała — Horváth’s training partner — in second Horváth had an enormous lead which she never relinquished. She started Friday by earning her fourth career CrossFit Games event win and 100 points. The win bumped Horváth up to fifth overall heading into Events 6/7.

“I’m so very excited I can't wait to do the next event” Horváth said after her victory. “I’m really pumped for this weekend.”

Women’s Event 5 Results

Laura Horváth - 11:41.55 Gabriela Migała - 11:56.87 Haley Adams - 12:03.29

Events 6/7



5 rounds for time of:

250-m run

1 clean

Women: 165 | 175 | 185 | 195 | 205 lb.

Men: 245 | 265 | 285 | 305 | 315 lb.

Time cap: 7 min.

5 rounds for time of:

250-m run out of the Coliseum

1 clean

Women: 210 | 215 | 220 | 225 | 230 lb.

Men: 325 | 335 | 340 | 345 | 350 lb.

Time cap: 8 min.

Events 6 and 7 took athletes back to the Coliseum for a clean ladder — historically a crowd favorite. Always finding ways to add twists to classic events CrossFit Director of Sport Dave Castro announced that a short run outside the Coliseum would accompany each round of heavy cleans and that Event 7’s lifts would be substantially heavier than Event 6’s.

Select athletes in each heat wore a Whoop device allowing spectators to watch their heart rates throughout the event. The athletes who excelled in the events seemed to have one thing in common: composure.

Men: Event 6

The roars of the crowd in the Coliseum at the Alliant Energy Center could almost be heard across campus as Event 6 went down. The men were up first.

2020’s fifth-fittest man on Earth Jeff Adler set the time to beat in Heat 2 (5:45.01) — and it would be good enough for first overall after two more heats. The man who came the closest to catching Adler was the younger Panchik brother Saxon in Heat 4 who finished the event in 5:46.56.

Notably Vellner and Fikowski failed to lift the final 315-lb. bar in Event 6 and succumbed to the time cap.

Men’s Event 6 Results

Jeffrey Adler - 5:45.01 Bayden Brown - 5:46.56 Travis Mayer - 5:51.30

Women: Event 6

Heat 4 was stacked with the top 10 women. Toomey was favored to win and she did just that cruising to victory with a time of 5:43.17.

Toomey who looked relaxed throughout the entire event said that composure was part of the plan.

“I just knew 205 wasn’t going to be a super challenging weight but it’s also a weight you can't second-guess” Toomey said after the event. “As long as I didn’t get that heart rate up too high I knew I could go for it straight away. The plan executed perfectly.”

Women’s Event 6 Results

Tia-Clair Toomey - 5:43.17 Kristi Eramo O’Connell - 5:45.88 Kristin Holte - 6:07.08

Men: Event 7

Event 7 was déjà vu for the athletes — with one exception: The barbells were much heavier.

Guilherme Malheiros of Brazil shone in Heat 3 finishing in 4:51.61 to take over the top spot in the event. No one from Heat 4 could catch him and he earned 100 points and an event win. Brazil’s CrossFit National Champion was pumped.

“Man it’s my second time competing here in the Coliseum” he said. “I knew that this would be a good workout for me. With this amazing energy everyone just cheering and yelling I just did my job. (The crowd) helped me a lot … it’s very good to be here.”

“I’m not here to play” Malheiros added. “I’m here to compete.”

Justin Medeiros who finished sixth in Event 6 and seventh in Event 7 climbed to the top spot on the leaderboard after the duo of events followed by Fikowski in second and Saxon Panchik in third.

Men’s Event 7 Results

Guilherme Malheiros - 4:51.61 Jeffrey Adler - 4:59.78 Alex Vigneault - 5:23.83

Women: Event 7

Toomey looked solid in Event 6 — she looked rock solid in Event 7.

She led the event followed closely by Laura Horváth in second and Amanda Barnhart in third. But Toomey never slowed on the runs and her sound technique and swift transition times helped her sweep the pair of events and earn 200 points a 29th career event win.

“It’s an honor to be actually rubbing shoulders against the great” Toomey said of Fraser who also boasts 29 career Games event wins.

Highlights for Toomey?

“Getting to compete in front of a great crowd and do what I love.”

Women’s Event 7 Results

Tia-Clair Toomey - 4:44.93 Laura Horváth - 4:57.22 Gabriela Migala - 5:13.84

Event 8

For time:

Navigate the handstand-walking course

Time cap: 5 min.

Every year athletes get inverted at the CrossFit Games.

Walking on your hands has become a commonplace skill in competitive CrossFit — so much so that Castro’s had to come up with ways to make the high-skill gymnastics movement even more challenging.

In 2020 we saw handstand sprints. In 2021 Castro presented athletes with a complex down-and-back handstand-walking obstacle course consisting of ramps stairs and parallette bars.

Men

With a 5-minute time cap Event 8 was a quick one. In Heat 3 perennial Games athlete and fan favorite Scott Panchik who's been struggling with a knee issue set the early time to beat at 2:05.21. Panchik’s time would stand even after the top 10 men took on the course.

In Heat 4 Justin Medeiros donned the overall leader’s jersey. The rookie-turned-phenom took methodical breaks throughout the course and won the heat with a time at 2:15.33 taking second overall in the event and extending his lead on the rest of the field.

“The goal was to be consistent and have no failed attempts” Medeiros said afterward.

“Listen to this crowd!” Medeiros added. “Everyone is so awesome and so fired up. I feel like it's my rookie year again here in the Coliseum. The crowd’s support for me is unreal.”

After Event 8 Medeiros totaled 668 points and held a 45-point lead over second-placed Fikowski.

Surprisingly Vellner a former gymnast struggled with the course finishing in 3:56.28 for 16th in the event.

Men’s Event 8 Results

Scott Panchik - 2:05.21 Justin Medeiros - 2:15.33 Samuel Cournoyer - 2:19.58

Women

Danielle Brandon stole Heat 3. Brandon — who has been secluded in every event — made quick work of the obstacle course finishing in 1:43.91 for an event win the second of her career.

The final heat was a race between Haley Adams and Brooke Wells who are both notorious for being great on their hands. Both athletes sailed through the course taking second and third respectively in the event.

Laura Horváth has been haunted by handstands in the past. Inverted movements have always been a weakness for the athlete. But today Horváth finished the obstacle course in 3:39.12 good enough for 12th overall.

Event 9

21-15-9:

Echo bike (cal.)

Snatch 75 | 105 lb. (short bars)

Time cap: 8 min.

Event 9 featured a classic CrossFit rep scheme: 21-15-9. Athletes closed out the day with a lung-burning couplet of snatches and calories on the Echo bike. The event begged athletes to leave it all out on the floor.

Men

In Heat 1 Chandler Smith put on an impressive performance of grit and stamina as he raced through the final event of the day. Opting for muscle snatches throughout most of the event Smith smoked the heat finishing in 3:39.77.

But “the professor” Brent Fikowski was on a mission in Heat 2. Looking for his first event win Fikowski used his height to his advantage banging out calories on the Echo bike and making quick work of the snatches. Fikowski took the event win with a time of 3:31.25 but he said he’s just having fun.

“It’s been 20 months since I competed in person and being an athlete my whole life … I’m just grateful to be competing again” Fikowski said after the win. “It’s been a long road to get here and I’m just really happy.”

“I have an amazing support staff with my coaches my wife my parents are here … I want this to be my favorite CrossFit Games and I’m doing that regardless of my finish” he added.

Barnhart’s confidence was evident throughout the event.

“We do a ton of Assault bike sprints at CompTrain” she said. “I was really prepared for this one.”

Medeiros is putting up an incredibly consistently performance for such a young competitor showing shades of retired five-time champion Mat Fraser who Medeiros trained with before the games.

The 22-year-old American burst onto the scene last season in his rookie campaign finishing third at the scaled down Covid-19 bubble 2020 CrossFit Games which were held at a ranch in Aromas California.

Justin Medeiros looks like he could potentially bypass an entire generation of CrossFit athletes on the way to his first title.

Medeiros has 949 points and has finished outside the top 10 in only two events (15th and 11th). He is holding off a pair of Canadian veterans who are surely chomping at the bit given Fraser has now retired.

Patrick Vellner who many had tipped to win the games this season after Fraser’s retirement has won two events and sits in second with 907 points. After Vellner is none other than fellow countryman Brent Fikowski who sits in third with 888 points. He does not have an event win but “The Professor” is known for charging late in competitions.

In the women’s competition it already feels like a done deal as four-time defending champion Tia-Clair Toomey is running away with the division. The Australian has 1145 points and her closest competitor is Laura Horvath with 939 points followed by Kristin Holte who has 834.

Can Canadian Patrick Vellner catch Justin Medeiros? Photo: CrossFit Games

Toomey famously trained with Fraser for a few years clearly soaking up his winning mentality and could match him in terms of overall titles and ignite the debate as to who is the greatest CrossFit athlete of all-time.

Toomey has a staggering seven events wins out of 12 events and is on a mission as there are reports she will consider retiring after these games.

In the team division which was axed last season due to the Covid-19 pandemic it is none other than former four-time champion Rich Froning and his CrossFit Mayhem team leading the way. The four-person squad (two men and two women) have 947 points with their closest competitor CrossFit Oslo with 773.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL3Nwb3J0LzMzOTIxNDQvd2hhdC1oYXBwZW5lZC1icm9va2Utd2VsbHMv0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vc3BvcnQvMzM5MjE0NC93aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkLWJyb29rZS13ZWxscy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What happened to Brooke Wells?...,"ATHLETE Brooke Wells suffered an injury during the 2021 CrossFit games.

Wells had to withdraw from the competition after being evaluated by medical professionals.

What happened to Brooke Wells?

Brooke Wells suffered an arm injury during round six of the one-rep max event.

The event challenged participants with 190 pounds overhead.

It is unclear what injury Wells suffered but she was seen holding her arm and could be heard screaming for help as she stumbled off of the platform.

Event staff rushed to help Wells and covered her arm as she was escorted from the Alliant Energy Center in Madison Wisconsin.

CrossFit released a statement regarding Wells’ event participation saying: “Individual athlete Brooke Wells has been medically withdrawn from competition.

“Wells has been cleared for release by the CrossFit medical team and is returning to her accommodations.”

Has Brooke Wells competed in CrossFit events before?

Wells has competed in seven other CrossFit Games throughout the years.

Her best finish to date was at the 2020 Games where she came in fifth overall.

She placed ninth in the worldwide 2021 CrossFit Open ahead of more than 90000 other athletes.

The athlete qualified for the 2021 Games after placing third at the Granite event behind her teammate Toomey-Orr and Haley Adams.

She was in sixth place overall prior to her injury.

What did people say about Brooke Wells’ withdrawal from the 2021 CrossFit games?

Prior to Wells’ injury she had shared a photo on her Instagram about her participation at the games.

She posted a photo climbing a rope captioning it: “climbing into Saturday of the CrossFit Games!!! 🐒 working hard & having fun 😝.”

Amid the announcement of her injury her followers took to the comments section to wish her a speedy recovery.

One follower wrote: “sending all the love during this tough time brooke!!! always so excited to watch you do your thing —you did so great! can’t wait to see the comeback next year 🤍”

Another commented: “I hope you get better soon and youre not in too much pain!”

A third wrote: “love you brooke!! hope you’re doing okay 🤍.”

Wells has yet to address her injury to the public.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXMuY3Jvc3NmaXQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvcnVuLWZhc3QtbGlmdC1oZWF2eS1tZW4tYW5kLXdvbWVuLXRha2UtZGF5LTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Run Fast Lift Heavy: Men and Women Take on Day 3,"Day 3 of the 2021 NOBULL CrossFit Games individual competition kicked off on Saturday morning at the Alliant Energy Center in Madison Wisconsin.

Tia-Clair Toomey and Justin Medeiros sat atop the leaderboard with 861 and 744 points respectively. Hungary’s Laura Horváth and Canada’s Brent Fikowski were not far behind in second and Norway’s Kristin Holte and Canada’s Patrick Vellner sat squarely in third. In the first round of athlete cuts the field was narrowed to 30 men and 30 women after Friday’s Event 9.

Competitors faced a packed day of events only one of which was fully released this morning: Event 10 a couplet of long runs and toes-to-bars. A second round of athlete cuts loomed after the event when the individual rosters would shrink to 20 men and 20 women further tightening the race for the title of Fittest on Earth.

Event 10

On the women’s side the two 1.5-mile runs of Event 10 lent to the strengths of 2013 Games champion Samantha Briggs and Holte who is known for her endurance. The event had a total of 90 toes-to-bars but as acknowledged by CrossFit Games commentator Chase Ingraham “this is a running event.”

Aerobic-capacity coach Chris Hinshaw agreed.



“This workout is incredible. It’s the combination and the rep scheme” Hinshaw said. “With 30 reps they have to go unbroken. If they’d programmed 50 they would’ve broken it up and it would’ve created a completely different stimulus. The toes-to-bars are gonna tax the hip flexors and running is all about your hip-flexor capacity. Those toes-to-bars are gonna make that run tough.”

Briggs aka “the engine” got out to an early lead on the first run and was first to get back to the second set of toes-to-bars. The race for the win got tighter from there as Kristi Eramo O’Connell and Emily Rolfe crept up and eventually overtook Briggs.

Emily Rolfe during Event 10

Eramo O’Connell and Rolfe went rep for rep on the final set of toes-to-bars and a sprint to the finish saw Rolfe earn her first event win of the competition. Eramo O’Connell took second and Haley Adams came in third.

“I knew the third lap was gonna be the decider” Rolfe said after the event.

Eramo O’Connell who sat in sixth overall after the second-place finish was laser focused heading into the remaining events of the day.

“I try to stay in my own lane” she said. “It’s good to know where other competitors are but if you don't listen to your body you might push too far. … We all put the training in. Trust in your training and give it everything you've got.”

Latvia’s Uldis Upenieks and Australia’s Bayden Brown led the men on the first run in Event 10. Close behind were Medeiros and Jason Smith of South Africa.

Former water-polo player Lazar Đukić of Serbia moved into second on the final run and overtook Brown on the last set of toes-to-bars to earn his first career Games event win and pick up 100 points.

Notably Fikowski who is speculated to be contending with a hamstring issue struggled with both the run and the toes-to-bars throughout the event which would normally be in his wheelhouse. Fikowski finished in 26th place.

Event 11

Event 11 brought back the infamous pegboard which was first seen at the 2015 Games when it tripped up many of the top athletes.

Danielle Brandon dominated Heat 1 racking up 226 reps over the 11-minute AMRAP of pegboard ascents dumbbell overhead squats and double-unders with a heavy rope.

But Toomey was on a mission to overtake the record of CrossFit Games event wins at the time held by five-time Games champion Mat Fraser (29). She looked strong and steady throughout the event and completed 231 reps for the win and a new record: 30 Games event wins to her name.

Notably Haley Adams who sat in fourth place before Event 11 received two costly no reps on the pegboard. Adams finished the event in 14th place and fell to fifth place on the overall leaderboard 29 points out of podium contention.

A far cry from 2015 when many women were unable to climb the pegboard even once the top women of 2021 completed nine or 10 ascents apiece.

“All of us are evolving as athletes and people within such a new sport so it’s super exciting to see what the future holds” Toomey said after the win.

Medeiros came into Event 11 with an 87-point overall lead. The 22-year-old athlete has delivered an impressive performance so far and was showing no signs of slowing — until Event 11. A few bobbles on the pegboard and stumbles on the heavy rope left Medeiros toward the back of the heat. He finished the event in 16th.

Cole Sager during Event 11

It was Cole Sager in Heat 1 who delivered a near-flawless performance — with a huge smile — in Event 11. The former NFL draft pick had a great Day 3 with a fourth-place finish in Event 10 and a win in Event 11. Relieved that he survived the athlete cuts Sager thanked the crowd and said he’s excited for what’s to come.

“Now we just dig in and we just run our race” he said. “I’m really looking forward to the rest of the day and tomorrow.”

Medeiros still held a 62-point lead heading into Event 12.

Event 12

Event 12 brought out the heavy barbells and challenged athletes to a 1-rep-max snatch. The weight started at 160 lb. for women and 260 lb. for men. Athletes had a 20-second window to lift and if they were unsuccessful they’d participate in a tiebreaker of 3 squat snatches for time at 145 lb. for women and 225 lb. for men. When 10 athletes remained the event moved to a single-platform format and athletes got an extra 10 seconds to lift the progressively heavier weights.

On the women’s side the battle came down to Toomey who has a background in Olympic weightlifting and two-time Games champion Annie Thorisdottir. Both women successfully lifted the 200-lb. bar but failed at 205 lb. They took on the tiebreaker where Toomey outworked Thorisdottir for her 31st career event win.

Thorisdottir was thrilled after the second-place finish.

“I didn’t expect to hit that heavy of a weight to be honest … but it felt amazing” Thorisdottir said. “Just this atmosphere — you’re guaranteed to hit some good weights.”

“I feel like I'm gaining full control of my body and my mind again” Thorisdottir added about competing after having her first child last August.

The men were up next. With each weight jump the field was narrowed as the totality of the weekend’s events began to add up and fatigue set in.

After several rounds of tiebreaks the battle was between Brazilian Guilherme Malheiros and Australian Royce Dunne. The event would end at the 305-lb. bar. Dunne — despite making three attempts in the 30-second window — could not hit the lift but Malheiros’ perfect technique served him well and he swiftly snatched 305 lb. to earn his third event win of the competition.

Gui Malheiros during Event 12

“I asked for a gift yesterday and I prayed for a win” Malheiros said afterward. “I’m just opening the doors for more athletes to come from Brazil. It means a lot to me.”

The mandate covers all campus staff as well as market regional and divisional employees who work in multiple facilities Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said in a memo Friday. A spokesman couldn’t immediately say how many of the retailer’s 1.5 million-person U.S. workforce will be affected.

Walmart separately told its frontline store and warehouse associates Friday to don masks again and doubled the cash incentive it’s providing for employees to get vaccinated to $150.

“The pandemic is not over and the delta variant has led to an increase in infection rates across much of the U.S.” McMillon said in the memo. “We have made the decision to require all campus office associates and all market regional and divisional associates who work in multiple facilities to be vaccinated by October 4 unless they have an approved exception.”

Walmart will be closely watched by other corporate leaders grappling with the myriad challenges of getting white-collar employees safely back into offices while also looking after their frontline employees in stores factories and distribution centers. This week Alphabet Inc.’s Google said it will require workers coming back to its offices be vaccinated and Apple Inc. has delayed its return-to-office to October and began urging store workers to wear masks again.

Within minutes of Walmart’s announcements rival grocer Kroger Co. said it would encourage even vaccinated staff and customers to wear masks in stores. Retail locations have become the inadvertent battlegrounds for the broader cultural and political brouhaha over mask-wearing with some confrontations between staff and customers becoming violent over the past year.

For big employers extending vaccine mandates from office workers to frontline staff will be difficult. At Albertsons Cos. the vaccination rate of store workers is running close to the national average Chief Executive Officer Vivek Sankaran said this week. That’s about 60%.

But it’s not just corporate titans making moves: The 230-person public-relations consultant BerlinRosen has implemented a vaccine requirement for any employee wanting to enter its three offices according to Chief Operating Officer David Levine.

Walmart’s CEO said there’s a “small percentage” of employees who can’t get vaccinated due to medical or religious reasons and the spokesman said they “must follow all social distancing standards wear a mask while working and receive weekly COVID-19 testing provided by Walmart.”

If Walmart employees claim a medical or religious exemption but don’t receive approval they will be suspended for a set time period in order to receive the vaccination. If employees still decline inoculation they’ll be fired.

Employees at the company’s Bentonville Arkansas campus — which is in the midst of a complete architectural overhaul that won’t be complete until 2025 — have been gradually coming back to offices with the intention of returning to pre-pandemic staffing levels after Labor Day. Now though McMillon said he might need to adjust that timing.

Walmart’s new mandate will be applied to all new hires in the affected locations the company said. Management is also limiting business travel to mission-critical trips which could dent the resurgence of air travel if its policy is followed by other big companies.

The tool has faced scrutiny from lawmakers and some employees inside Amazon who said they were worried that it led to unfair treatment of African-Americans. Amazon has repeatedly defended the accuracy of its algorithms.

When Amazon announced the pause in June it did not cite a specific reason for the change. The company said it hoped a year was enough time for Congress to create legislation regulating the ethical use of facial recognition technology. Congress has not banned the technology or issued any significant regulations on it but some cities have.

The primary suppliers of facial recognition tools to police departments have not been tech giants like Amazon but smaller outfits that are not household names.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYXdzLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYmxvZ3MvaW5kdXN0cmllcy9mc2ktc2VydmljZXMtc3BvdGxpZ2h0LWZlYXR1cmluZy1hbWF6b24tZWtzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FSI Services Spotlight: Featuring Amazon EKS | AWS for Industries,"In this edition of the Financial Services Industry (FSI) Service Spotlight monthly blog series we highlight five key considerations of the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) including achieving compliance data protection isolation of compute environments audits with APIs and operational access and security. Each of the five areas will include specific guidance suggested reference architectures and technical code that can help streamline service approval of EKS in its environment which may need to be adapted to your specific use case and environment.

Amazon EKS gives you the flexibility to start run and scale Kubernetes applications in the AWS cloud or on-premises. EKS helps you provide highly-available and secure clusters and automates key tasks such as patching node provisioning and updates. AWS customers include JPMorgan Chase  who uses EKS to run their risk calculations; Fidelity who uses EKS for their Platform-as-a-Service; and Snap Intuit GoDaddy and Autodesk who trust EKS to run their sensitive and mission critical applications.

EKS runs upstream Kubernetes and is certified Kubernetes conformant for a predictable experience. You can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to EKS without needing to refactor your code.

The security and compliance of Amazon EKS is assessed as part of multiple AWS compliance programs. Amazon EKS is compliant with:

AWS leverages the AWS shared responsibility model and customers need to ensure workloads running in the AWS Cloud are using the appropriate security controls to meet their compliance needs and security posture. AWS customers are responsible for their security in the cloud. They control and manage the security of their content applications systems and networks. AWS manages security of the cloud providing and maintaining proper operations of services and features protecting AWS infrastructure and services maintaining operational excellence and meeting relevant legal and regulatory requirements.

Amazon EKS has several different deployment methodologies where the level of shared responsibility in the Kubernetes stack shifts to AWS as the Kubernetes cluster become more managed. AWS Fargate with EKS for example would shift more management responsibility such as worker node OS management to AWS. This blog will focus on EKS with self-managed worker nodes which provide customers with the most flexibility and ability to manage lower level components in their Kubernetes clusters. The shared responsibility model when running EKS with self-managed worker nodes is outlined in the following diagram:

Figure 1: Shared responsibility model when running EKS with self-managed worker nodes

The EKS control plane is located in an AWS managed Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) (the right side of the diagram). Amazon EKS runs a dedicated (single-tenant) Kubernetes control plane for each cluster. The control plane infrastructure is not shared across clusters or AWS accounts. The control plane consists of at least two API server instances and three etcd instances that run across three Availability Zones within a Region. The customer is responsible for managing the Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies on the EKS clusters.

Data Protection with EKS

Encryption is a commonly used mechanism to protect data in transit and at rest. Customers should consider encryption a best practice for all workloads whether they are highly sensitive or not.

Data in Transit

Amazon EKS clusters’ Kubernetes management API is available via Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.2 and higher only. When managing EKS clusters through AWS API endpoints encryption of data in transit is provided by TLS 1.0 or higher. We recommend using a minimum of TLS 1.2 which is configurable within your TLS clients.

EKS clusters integrate with Network Load Balancers (NLB) to provide encryption of data in transit for all communication with the applications deployed onto EKS from outside the cluster. Regulated workloads demand end-to-end encryption for data in transit in the entire application stack and TLS can be used for encryption of data in transit between Kubernetes ingress controllers and the pods they target. Customers can use service mesh communication technology like AWS AppMesh to ensure services are encrypted in transit between EKS services running on the same or different EKS clusters using mutual TLS (mTLS)  without the need to add encryption into your applications code or configuration.

Data at Rest

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) makes it easy for you to accomplish data at rest by creating and managing cryptographic keys and controlling their use across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications. We recommend customers use AWS KMS in EKS environments to provide a defense in depth style approach to security. AWS KMS supports CloudTrail for audibility and can automate yearly key rotation with a customer managed AWS KMS key (formerly known as CMK) to meet compliance requirements.

Amazon EKS allows customers to use AWS KMS to encrypt Kubernetes secrets stored within your Kubernetes clusters to help protect them from unauthorized access by using envelope encryption with your KMS keys. AWS KMS may also be used to encrypt the Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes Elastic File System (EFS) and FSx for Lustre filesystems used by EKS clusters. Container images can be encrypted and stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

Isolation of compute environments with EKS

Amazon EKS service API

EKS service APIs are accessible over the internet in regionally specific URLs. The EKS service API is used for actions like creating/deleting EKS clusters and scheduling cluster version upgrades. The EKS service API permissions use AWS IAM for access management.

The aws eks commands from the AWS CLI and the eksctl tool call the Amazon EKS service API. kubectl commands call the Kubernetes cluster management API.

Amazon EKS has two compute components: Control plane nodes and Worker nodes.

Control plane nodes

Kubernetes control plane nodes are managed by AWS and are hosted in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) that are protected by the AWS global network security procedures described in the Introduction to AWS Security whitepaper.

Customers can choose to expose the cluster management API endpoint of the EKS cluster over the internet with an allow list of CIDR blocks to only allow connections from approved network locations or with a private IP address inside of a customer managed Amazon VPC. When configured to use a VPC customers can use security groups (SGs) and network access control lists (NACLS) to control connectivity to the EKS cluster endpoint. EKS clusters can be deployed with both an internet facing and a private VPC API endpoint.

Private EKS cluster API endpoints can be accessed from on-premises via AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN Gateway or from an Amazon VPC via Amazon EC2 Bastion Host or AWS Cloud9 IDE.

Worker nodes require access to the EKS cluster endpoint to communicate with the Kubernetes control plane. We recommend deploying the EKS cluster API with an in-vpc private API endpoint as that simplifies the connectivity. See this blog for details on various ways to configure the Amazon VPC to run EC2 worker nodes for your Kubernetes cluster managed by Amazon EKS.

Worker nodes

EKS worker nodes run in a customer managed Amazon VPC where the customer has full control over the network. The customer has control over what their workloads running on their EKS worker nodes can access over the network. Customers can control what can be accessed using Amazon VPC network security controls such as SGs NACLs and routes.

Customers have full control over traffic between pods running on their EKS nodes via Kubernetes configuration. In Kubernetes Pod to Pod traffic is open by default. Following is an example network policy configuration which restricts all communication between pods.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: default-deny namespace: default spec: podSelector: {} policyTypes: - Ingress - Egress

Amazon VPC Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin for Kubernetes assigns an IP address from your Amazon VPC to each pod. CNI allows for better separation of worker nodes and pod traffic by configuring a second ENI in a different VPC CIDRs. Kubernetes network policies operate at layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model. Network policies use pod selectors and labels to identify source and destination pods but can also include IP addresses port numbers protocol number or a combination of these. Policies should be designed to restrict network traffic only to what is required by the workloads and pods running. Customers can use Calico which is an open source policy engine from Tigera that works well with EKS and can provide layer 3 – 7 network security when operated with Istio. Network Policy such as deny from other namespaces provide a layer of isolation between workloads running on the same cluster.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: namespace: default name: deny-from-other-namespaces spec: podSelector: matchLabels: ingress: - from: - podSelector: {}

Customers can also leverage Security Groups on Pods on Nitro enabled EC2 instances to grant access to other AWS resources through IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA). IRSA provides fine-grained roles at the pod level rather than the node level using AWS IAM by way of OpenID Connect (OIDC). By default the Amazon EC2 instance metadata service (IMDS) provides the credentials assigned to the node IAM role to the instance and any pod running on the instance. It is a best practice to remove access to these credentials from pods and provide pods with least privilege access through network policies.

At the pod level example:

apiVersion: policy/v1beta1 kind: PodSecurityPolicy metadata: name: restrictive spec: privileged: false allowPrivilegeEscalation: false hostnetwork: false

Note: Pod Security Policy (PSP) is deprecated as of Kubernetes 1.21 and is being removed in Kubernetes 1.25.

AWS recommends that customers implement policy as code to place guardrails and improve maintainability on network and security policies as a best practice. In planning for the future customers should evaluate replacements like Gatekeeper to replace Pod Security Policy (PSP).

Automating audits with APIs with EKS

AWS Config monitors the configuration of resources and allows customers to monitor their AWS resources for compliance to their security requirements. AWS config comes with rules for EKS built-in and also allows customers to provide their own custom config rules. We recommend customers enable the built-in config rules to make sure their clusters are not publicly accessible and that Kubernetes secrets are encrypted using KMS keys.

Calls to the Amazon EKS API are logged in AWS Cloudtrail create a trail to record activity for a specified amount of time to meet compliance requirements.

Customers can specify which logs from EKS clusters are sent to AWS Cloudwatch where they can be viewed or downloaded. AWS recommends that customers enable logging on all EKS clusters control plane.

Customers can use the following CLI command to turn on all cluster logging

aws eks update-cluster-config \ --region <region-code> \ --name <prod> \ --logging '{""clusterLogging"":[{""types"":[""api""""audit""""authenticator""""controllerManager""""scheduler""]""enabled"":true}]}'

Logs sent to CloudWatch include:

Kubernetes API server component logs ( api ) – Your cluster’s API server is the control plane component that exposes the Kubernetes API. For more information see kube-apiserver in the Kubernetes documentation.

AWS Audit Manager allows customers to simplify auditing their AWS environments. Audit manager automates the collection of evidence for audits and can capture relevant Cloud Trail logs and AWS config history of EKS clusters for use in audits. AWS Audit Manager could be used to capture all the Cloud Trail logs for the ‘createCluster’ and ‘updateClusterConfig’ actions to show the configuration history of your EKS clusters. This may be useful when attempting to prove compliance over time with PCI DSS control 1.3 to ensure that card holder systems are restricted from the internet.

The following screenshots illustrate the configuration of a custom control’s data source for a custom compliance framework in AWS Audit Manager. This control records Amazon EKS ‘createCluster’ and ‘updateClusterConfig’ actions which could prove that the EKS cluster control plane has never been configured to accept connections directly from the internet.

Operational access and security with EKS

AWS customers in the financial services industry require detailed logging and assurance of access of critical data. Customers can review third-party auditor reports such as the AWS SOC 2 Type II report ISO 27001 and others in AWS Artifact.

Control plane access

Amazon EKS uses IAM to provide authentication to your Kubernetes cluster but it still relies on native Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization. This means that IAM is only used for authentication of valid IAM entities. All permissions for interacting with your Amazon EKS cluster’s Kubernetes API is managed through the native Kubernetes RBAC system.

When EKS clusters are created the role or user that was used to create a cluster is granted the system:masters entitlement which provides full administrative access to the Kubernetes cluster. Customers have full control of their EKS cluster configurations and can specify which IAM roles or users have administrative access to their EKS clusters with Kubernetes configurations. The following example grants the system:masters entitlement to the IAM roles listed:

apiVersion: v1 data: mapRoles: | - userarn: <arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/exampleCICDRole> username: <CICD> groups: - <system:masters> - userarn: <arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/exampleops-user> username: <ops-user> groups: - <system:masters>

AWS recommends creating the cluster with a dedicated IAM role and regularly audit who can assume this role. This role should not be used to perform routine actions on the cluster and won’t appear in the ConfigMap. Instead additional users should be granted access to the cluster through the aws-auth ConfigMap for this purpose. After the aws-auth ConfigMap is configured the role can be deleted and only recreated in an emergency / break glass scenario. This can be particularly useful in production clusters in reducing administrative access. Customers can leverage an existing identity provider and identity management lifecycle through an OIDC configuration to manage user access to a cluster reducing AWS IAM needs.

Worker nodes access

Customers can also restrict the Amazon EKS worker nodes to the instance types that are built on The AWS Nitro System. Nitro System is a collection of AWS-built hardware and software components that enable high performance high availability and high security. The Nitro System’s security model is locked down and prohibits interactive access reducing the possibility of human error and tampering. The list of EC2 instances that are built on the Nitro System can be found here.

Conclusion

In this post we reviewed Amazon EKS and highlighted key information that can help FSI customers accelerate the approval of the service within these five categories: achieving compliance data protection isolation of compute environments automating audits with APIs and operational access and security. While not a one-size-fits-all approach the guidance provided can be adapted to meet your organization’s security and compliance requirements and provide a consolidated list of key areas to focus on for Amazon EKS.

The inbuilt voice assistants are great for education and keeping the kids amused but there’s a worry that kids could stumble on something inappropriate if left to their own devices with Amazon’s voice assistant.

You can’t supervise them 24-7 so how can you strike the right balance between keeping them safe and letting them benefit from Alexa’s expertise?

This is where Amazon Kids on Alexa comes in. The free-to-use service lets you restrict when Alexa can be accessed the Alexa skills that can be used and even blocks explicit lyrics when listening to Amazon Music  Apple Music or Spotify .

Initially launched in the US in September 2020 Amazon Kids on Alexa has now been made available in the UK as well.

What is Amazon Kids on Alexa?

As we’ve already mentioned Amazon Kids on Alexa is a free-to-use parental controls service that when switched on lets you set time limits on when and for how long the smart speaker can be used.

It also allows pausing access to the device at any point - ideal if you want the kids to concentrate on eating dinner rather than interacting with a voice assistant.

It comes built-in to the new Echo Dot Kids smart speaker which is priced at $59.99 / £59.99 (around AU$80) and is available with either a tiger or panda theme. However if you have an existing Echo smart speaker in your home including an Amazon Echo (2020)  Amazon Echo Dot (2020) and even the Amazon Echo 1st generation you can enable Amazon Kids on Alexa through the Alexa app.

If your child has a subscription to Amazon Kids+ which offers unlimited access to child-friendly audiobooks apps games and tv shows this can also now be used on any Amazon Echo smart speaker - although only content that’s audible rather than visual will be available.

We spoke to Amazon and a representative confirmed that Amazon Kids on Alexa and Amazon Kids+ doesn’t work on Amazon’s line of smart displays  such as the Echo Show 5 (2nd generation) and the Echo Show 10 . Amazon told TechRadar it wasn’t able to reveal if this will change in the future.

Amazon Kids on Alexa offers more than just the ability to set use limits. When we activated Amazon Kids we noticed Alexa’s tone softened and the language it used was more child-friendly.

For example when we asked Alexa to tell a joke when Amazon Kids was enabled it responded with a joke that would “tickle your funny bone”.

There were plenty of age-appropriate stories and jokes on offer and Alexa was also able to provide spelling definitions and even answer some mathematics questions for us when Amazon Kids on Alexa was switched on although it can also do this in normal mode.

Crucially however voice purchasing was disabled by default - so no more remembering to toggle this option in the Alexa app when the kids are around.

Amazon Kids on Alexa also does an effective job at preventing tracks with explicit lyrics being played. We requested a track loaded with swearing from Fatboy Slim album ‘We’ve Come A Long Way Baby’ and were impressed to find it wasn't possible.

However we were able to play plenty of explicit-language free friendly tracks from Kylie Minogue Justin Timberlake and even some Disney records.

Voice calling is enabled so children can use an Echo smart speaker to communicate with other Amazon smart speakers in the home or call their friend’s that have an Echo speaker (as long as their friend is assigned as an approved contact by you through the Alexa app)

Finally using the Parent Dashboard which can be accessed through the Alexa app or on Amazon’s website we were able to restrict the apps and Alexa skills that could be used when Amazon Kids was enabled so ensuring kids can’t mess with smart home gadgets or  as well as review the skills that had been used while Amazon Kids on Alexa was enabled.

How do I turn on Amazon Kids on Alexa?

To switch on Amazon Kids on Alexa open the Alexa app on your phone or table and select the 'Devices’ tab. Tap Echo & Alexa then select the devices you want to install the parental controls on.

Choose the settings icon from the top right-hand corner and then select ‘Amazon Kids’ from the options displayed. Move the slider to the on position.

From here you can add a profile for each child to your household if they don’t already have any Amazon devices. As well as adding the name and selecting an icon you’ll also need to add their date of birth so age-appropriate content and responses are given.

If they ‘own’ (well have control of) Amazon devices the profile will show up automatically so you just need to select it from the list given.

Only one child can use an Echo with Amazon Kids enabled at a time however you can easily switch the profiles in the Parent Dashboard.

Once Amazon Kids is enabled in the Alexa app you’ll still need to ask Alexa on the device itself to open Amazon Kids otherwise it’ll behave as though there are no parental controls

We also tried asking Alexa on the device to turn off Amazon Kids and revert back to normal mode just in case any cheeky children thought they couldn’t circumnavigate the parental controls but handily Alexa just says it can’t help and to ask a grown-up

If you’re a grown-up and you want to revert your Amazon Echo smart speaker into its full non-child friendly state you’ll have to disable it in the app",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vNzExNDA3L2hvdy10by11c2UtYW1hem9uLW11c2ljLW9mZmxpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Use Amazon Music Offline,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vNzExNDA3L2hvdy10by11c2UtYW1hem9uLW11c2ljLW9mZmxpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9hbWF6b24tZWNoby1zaG93LTUtMm5kLWdlbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) review,"The Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) isn’t much of an upgrade compared to the original but it’s still a compact and capable bedside smart display with a built-in camera and Alexa.

Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen): Specs Price: $84.99

Size: 5.8 x 3.4 x 2.9 inches

Display: 5.5-inch 960 x 480-pixel touchscreen

Camera: 2-MP

Speakers: 1 x 1.7-inch 4 Watt

The Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) is as cute compact and capable as its popular predecessor. But it’s arrived in a more saturated smart clock market with more of the best smart displays to compete with than ever.

Now the $84.99 Echo Show 5 is rivaled by the Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen)  as well as an in-brand alternative and one of best smart home devices  the Amazon Echo Dot with Clock . The new Echo Show 5 is cheaper than Google’s latest smart display and has a real screen — unlike the Echo Dot with Clock — but it can’t track your sleep nor does it have a 3.5-mm audio line out.

So what it's party trick? In this Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) review you’ll find a slightly better camera and an ever-growing arsenal of Alexa skills. You’ll also see why the first-ever Kids Edition Echo smart display might be the real star of the show.

Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) review: price and availability

The Amazon Echo Show 5 costs $84.99 and is available now in three colors: Charcoal Glacier White and Deep Sea Blue. You can usually find it for less with the best Amazon deals on the Echo suite of devices so be sure to check often for discounts.

In addition to the Echo Show 5 we tested the Echo Show 5 Kids Edition ($94.99) comes in a greenish Chameleon color and is a clever bedside clock for your children. It also includes a 1-year subscription to Amazon Kids Plus ($2.99/month thereafter) and a 2-year replacement policy if your child happens to break it.

Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) review: Design and display

The overall look of the 5.8 x 3.4 x 2.9-inch smart display is mostly the same compared to the first-generation Echo Show 5 though the camera setup is visibly different. It’s a subtle improvement but the new model has a 2-MP lens housed in a square component rather than a circular one. You’ll still find a physical shutter for privacy though.

Amazon’s wedge-shaped fabric-swathed smart displays are pretty basic at this point. I like how the company redesigned the Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen) and Amazon Echo (4th Gen) earlier this year. I’m not saying an orb-shaped smart display is sensible — I just would’ve liked to test something a little more aesthetically different for the Show 5 and Amazon Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen).

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Guide) (Image credit: Tom's Guide) (Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Still the 5.5-inch 960 x 480 display is functional letting you see the time weather or collection of your photographs at a glance. It’s not big enough to enjoyably watch something on Amazon Prime though. For $15 more the Nest Hub has a 7-inch display while for $45 more the Echo Show 8 has a 8-inch display. You could also opt for the $90 Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet if watching video is your priority.

Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) review: Smart home features

If your interest lies in smart home features the Echo Show 5 is a better option than an Amazon tablet. You can use either the device’s display or the microphones to access the best Alexa skills  though the former method lets you see all the best Alexa compatible devices in your home in a combined interface.

It takes just a few taps to turn on Philips Hue lights  for example. You can manage your devices individually or assign them to Alexa routines for advanced home automation.

Like many Echo speakers (and certain Ring products) the Echo Show 5 supports Amazon Sidewalk. Sidewalk is a Wi-Fi sharing protocol that will let things like keyfinders connect to the cloud through Amazon devices via a low-power long range network.

Additionally the Echo Show 5 offers Alexa Guard my favorite Alexa service overall. Amazon’s assistant will notify me if the display’s microphone recognizes the sound of a smoke alarm or glass breaking. While not as comprehensive as some of the best DIY home security systems it is a less expensive alternative.

Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) review: Camera and video calling

With a device as small as the Echo Show 5 I didn’t expect to appreciate the camera quality or video calling options. Besides isn’t everyone sick of video chats at this point? I almost wish this smart display took a cue from Google and ditched the camera altogether. If you really need an apparatus for calling loved ones there are better options like the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) that rotates on its base to keep you centered. The latest Echo Show 8 has an auto-framing feature and 13-MP lens too.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

I could see the camera being a perk for the Kids Edition though. Not only can parents dictate who is (and isn’t) safe to video call but children won’t mind the 2-MP camera quality. It’s not a noticeable improvement from the original’s 1-MP camera but the fun filters and stickers compensate well enough.

Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) review: Audio

The Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) sports the same speaker hardware as the first-generation model. The single 4-watt speaker doesn’t make the Show 5 one of the best Alexa speakers  but it delivers acceptable audio. Similarly to the Echo Dot’s sound the Show 5 is fine for listening to a morning newscast or playing ambient sounds for sleep. Just don’t expect it to bring the bass to your next dance party.

Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) review: Verdict

Among the company’s smart displays the Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) isn’t our favorite. For a few bucks more you could get a smart display with several added features and for a few bucks less you can get one of the best smart speakers that’s also a bedside clock.

But if you’re in search of a screen that saves nightstand real estate and helps navigate your smart home there’s not another display that strikes the same balance of size and features as the Echo Show 5. I’ll still say the Kids Edition is the stronger sell providing a stationary Amazon Fire tablet alternative that doesn’t need to be recharged all the time. And that comes with warranty."

Denso and Honeywell Aerospace



American Airlines and United Airlines have both committed to flying electric vertical takeoff and land aircraft or eVTOLs.

The helicopter-like electric aircraft aim to fly over highway traffic without onboard pilots.

Startups and aerospace giants are still deciding on how they'll get the public to accept the new technology.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

United Airlines became the first major US airline to place an order for electric take-off and land aircraft better known as eVTOLs in February and its early adoption kicked off a trend in the industry. American Airlines soon followed with a $1 billion preorder with Vertical Aerospace for up to 250 eVTOLs.

Behind these high-profile orders is an industry of startups dedicated to making the dream of true air taxis a reality even though countless hurdles stand in the way. Helping them along however are aerospace giants like Honeywell Aerospace that are developing the systems to power the aircraft.

The reality of eVTOLs flying paying customers according to companies like Joby Aviation and Volocopter will arrive as soon as 2024. It's a timeline that Stéphane Fymat vice president and general manager urban air mobility and unmanned aerial systems at Honeywell Aerospace told Insider is ""realistic"" and that if not by 2024 at least by the end of the current decade.

But the questions remain who will fly them and who will fly on them? The compact flying machines are a brand-new technology that are often smaller than helicopters powered solely on battery power and intended to be flown autonomously with no pilot.

Volocopter's electric takeoff and land aircraft.

It's a proposition that will be entirely new to most travelers and Honeywell is already thinking about how to overcome hurdles in public perception starting with putting pilots in the aircraft. While autonomous flying without any onboard pilot is the goal of most eVTOL companies Fymat believes the first aircraft will need pilots to make customers feel comfortable.

""Consumer acceptance comes down to a few things in my mind it comes down to a sense of control and trust"" Fymat said. ""If we went immediately automatically to completely autonomous air taxis with no pilot onboard passengers would have no sense of control.""

But with a resurging pilot shortage that the pandemic merely painted over it hasn't been decided whether certificated pilots will be at the controls or rather trained ""operators."" In either case Honeywell is making cockpits that are easy to use as possible.

Fymat says eVTOLs will incorporate ""simplified vehicle operations"" in cockpit designs to make them ""simple intuitive aesthetic"" and ""cool."" The goal is to both enable a ramp-up of pilots or operators while hopefully easing the minds of flyers.

Honeywell is already leading the charge on advanced cockpit systems including multi-touch display screens and voice-controlled cockpits. Dassault Aviation's new Falcon 10X is powered by Honeywell avionics and designed to eventually fly with only one pilot during cruise flight once regulations allow.

If flyers can understand what they're looking at in the cockpit they may be more amenable to the idea of flying on the aircraft. Under the hood however will be existing fly-by-wire technology that's used on commercial airliners and makes dangerous maneuvers like high-bank turns or stalls nearly impossible.

Simplified however doesn't mean unsafe as safety will be paramount to the success of the new mode of transport. Many aerospace firms are choosing to comply with European Union Aviation Safety Agency certification requirements that have become stricter than the FAA's in the wake of the Boeing 737 Max scandal.

The public will soon become accustomed to eVTOLs as these startups near the finish line and begin to fly their products just as the public has accepted small drones delivering packages as Fymat pointed out and autopilot on airplanes.

And for those on the ground they'll barely notice the aircraft shuttling passengers above.

""These things when they take off the design target is as quiet as your dishwasher at home"" Fymat said. ""And then when they're flying overhead you don't hear them.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9za3l3ZXN0LXByb2ZpdC1hbWVyaWNhbi1hbGFza2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SkyWest Records Quarterly Profit Amid New Alaska And American Deals,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9za3l3ZXN0LXByb2ZpdC1hbWVyaWNhbi1hbGFza2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZGRpbmcuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMS8wNy8zMS9idXp6LXJlZGRpbmctYWlycG9ydC1wcmltZWQtcmVhbGx5LXRha2Utb2ZmLWhlcmVzLXdoYXRzLW5leHQvNTQzNTU2NDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Buzz: Redding airport primed to really take off.

At 4:21 p.m. Austin police were dispatched to the scene of an American Airlines flight where two men were throwing punches on a plane parked at the gate.

Viewer video shared with KEYE shows two men actively exchanging blows while passengers and flight crew attempted to intervene.

Urgent calls to ""clear the aisle!"" and ""return to your seats immediately!"" can be heard echoing throughout the cabin as one passenger adamantly repeats ""stop it's not worth it!""

This is the first time on record that renewables were the second-largest generator of electricity in the U.S.

Renewables overall increased 9% between 2019 and 2020. About half of US clean energy now comes from solar and wind and the other half from hydroelectric power.

Wind generation increased by 14%.

Solar rocketed up even more with utility-scale solar projects of 1 megawatt or more growing by 26%.

Small-scale solar such as rooftop installations like the one we have increased by 19%.

The Clean Power Association says that America put in 26 gigawatts of renewables electricity plants in 2020 — 80% more than in 2019 — bringing total US renewables capacity to 170 gigawatts.

In the US some 78% of all new electricity generation was from wind and solar which are clearly the future of the American grid.

American renewables beat out coal now only 19% and nuclear at 20%. Coal is dirty and expensive and coal power plants have been replaced in droves by wind farms and by natural gas. It was the largest generator of electricity in the US until 2016 and has gone into a tailspin because renewables and natural gas are much cheaper.



h/t EIA

Natural gas which is only half as carbon intensive as coal is now the leading generator of electricity in the US at some 40%.

Coal electricity generation fell 20% from 2019 to 2020.

Between renewables and nuclear 41% of American electricity generation is now low-carbon or no-carbon.

While the increase clean gigawattage is impressive in American terms China added 136 gigawatts of new renewables capacity in 2020 dwarfing the US effort. This massive lead that China has in wind and solar translates into advantages in manufacturing distribution and sales of equipment like solar panels. The US for all that it is finally making some strides is going way too slow if it wants to be a leader in these industries and if it wants to do its part to keep global heating below an extra 3.6 degrees F.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL29waW5pb24vY29tbWVudGFyeS8yMDIxLzA4LzAxL3RoZS10ZXhhcy1ibGFja291dHMtd2VyZS1jYXVzZWQtYnktYW4tZXBpYy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWZhaWx1cmUv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL29waW5pb24vY29tbWVudGFyeS8yMDIxLzA4LzAxL3RoZS10ZXhhcy1ibGFja291dHMtd2VyZS1jYXVzZWQtYnktYW4tZXBpYy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWZhaWx1cmUvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Texas blackouts were caused by an epic government failure,"This op-ed is part of a series published by The Dallas Morning News Opinion section to explore ideas and policies for strengthening electric reliability. Find the full series here: Keeping the Lights On.

As the postmortem of the blackouts that slammed the state back in February continues it’s apparent that Texans narrowly averted a catastrophe that could have resulted in what biologists call a mass mortality event.

At about 2 a.m. on Feb. 15 the Texas grid came within four or five minutes of a systemwide failure that could have plunged nearly the entire state into a blackout at a time when temperatures were plunging it was snowing sideways and the roads were impassable. Recovering from such a failure and executing what’s known as a “black start” could have taken the Electric Reliability Council of Texas days or even weeks. Had that occurred Winter Storm Uri would have killed thousands even tens of thousands of people.

As it was the February snowpocalypse likely cost the state some $200 billion according to estimates by economist Ray Perryman and the final death toll according to an analysis by BuzzFeed News could be as high as 700.

The February blackouts should have been a neon-bright wake-up sign for the state’s politicians and regulators that the structure of the Texas energy grid is deeply flawed and that fundamental changes are needed. Alas the Legislature and Gov. Greg Abbott have largely kicked the electric can down the road. That’s a mistake.

The electric grid is the Mother Network. Our most important networks including food delivery and storage communications and GPS depend on the electric grid to deliver cheap abundant and reliable flows of energy 24/7/365. A prolonged electricity outage due to extreme weather or malicious actors would have dire effects on Texas and because the state provides much of the country’s food and fuel it would also short-circuit much of the American economy.

I’ve been obsessing about ERCOT and the causes of the blackouts since February when my wife Lorin and I who live in central Austin were blacked out for about 45 hours. The government failed us and there are three things government needs to do to assure that the state has reliable and affordable electricity.

Before going further a caveat: The blackouts were the result of several interconnected factors and failures. Thus there are no simple or quick solutions particularly when it comes to a system as complex as the electric grid. That said the blackouts were caused by flaws in the way the state’s electricity market was designed and how it has evolved since it was deregulated two decades ago. And that leads to my first point.

The blackouts were due to government failure of epic proportions. The most obvious example of government failure was the decision by the Public Utility Commission to set the clearing price of electricity in ERCOT at $9000 per megawatt-hour — and to leave it at that extremely high level for several days despite the fact that it did not bring more generation into the market.

Advertisement

The result of that blunder: Texas electricity consumers were overcharged by roughly $26.3 billion. The burden of paying for those costs will fall most heavily on regular Texans who will see surcharges on their utility bills for years to come to pay down the bonds the state is issuing to spread out the cost of those overcharges.

Second deregulation wasn’t a boon for consumers. That conclusion is controversial but studies have shown that Texans paid more for the electricity they used than they would have in a regulated market. A recent Wall Street Journal analysis estimates that Texans paid $28 billion more for home electricity in the 20 years of deregulation than they would have if they had only been charged the average regulated rate for the rest of the country.

The deregulation of the Texas electricity sector opened up the utility sector — an industry that is at root a power-plant-poles-and-wires business — to “retail electric providers.” In a flash entrepreneurs could get into the electricity game with no hard assets or knowledge of how the electric grid works required.

One hundred and forty years ago we had Thomas Edison. Deregulation gave us Griddy.

The deregulation of the electricity sector resulted in a market in which the buck doesn’t stop anywhere. Under the old regulated utility model when big companies owned all of the components of the grid there was accountability. After the blackouts all we’ve seen is finger-pointing. That’s not a bug; it’s a feature of a market that’s so complex that no one understands how it really works. As Ed Hirs of the University of Houston has noted “The 1876 pages of regulations and rules contained in the ERCOT Nodal Protocols apparently mean nothing.”

Deregulation distorted the type of generation that was added to the ERCOT grid. Over the past two decades the generation capacity added to the grid wasn’t built for reliability or resilience it was built to collect subsidies.

Since 2006 about $66 billion was spent building wind and solar capacity in Texas. Over that same time period according to a recent report by Bill Peacock of The Energy Alliance Big Wind and Big Solar collected roughly $22 billion in subsidies of one kind or another including state tax breaks and federal tax credits. But when the ERCOT grid was on the brink of collapse on Feb. 15 that $66 billion was worth next to nothing. There was no solar production and of the 31000 megawatts of wind capacity installed in ERCOT only about 5400 megawatts or roughly 17% of that capacity was available when the grid operator was shedding load to prevent the state’s grid from going dark.

The $66 billion spent on wind and solar resulted in big changes in the state’s generation capacity. Between 2006 and 2020 the amount of electricity generated with wind went up by about 20% and coal-fired generation fell by about the same amount. Meanwhile thanks to booming population growth and increased electricity demand in the Permian Basin electricity use was soaring.

Advertisement

Over that same time according to the Energy Information Administration electricity use in Texas jumped by about 67 terawatt-hours per year far more than any other state in the country. (For comparison North Dakota which had the second-largest demand growth over that time frame saw electricity use rise by about 10 terawatt-hours per year.)

The surge in electricity demand put more strain on the ERCOT grid which was not maintaining enough reserve generation capacity that is standby generation that can be utilized during peak times. Making matters worse no new dispatchable capacity is being built. Instead ERCOT is adding more weather-dependent generation. About 24000 megawatts of solar and 11000 megawatts of wind capacity are slated to be added to the ERCOT grid between now and 2023. Thus over the next two years the amount of renewable capacity in Texas will nearly double.

So what must happen to assure reliability and resilience?

First and foremost the state must step up its oversight and regulation of the energy sector. The electric grid and natural gas grids have merged. The February blackouts proved again that the electric and gas grids are deeply intertwined and interdependent.

Advertisement

Since 2001 when Enron went bankrupt the amount of natural gas consumed by the U.S. electric sector has more than doubled. Despite that fact the two grids are not being regulated to assure that they are singing from the same hymnal. During the February blackouts some gas infrastructure froze. Some gas processing plants and pipelines had their electricity cut off. That in turn reduced the amount of fuel available to produce power when electricity was needed the most.

In the wake of the 2011 winter storm the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation issued a report that warned about the “interdependency of the electric and natural gas industries” and urged “regulatory and industry bodies to explore solutions to the many interdependency problems which are likely to remain of concern in the future.” It’s well past time for state regulators to heed that warning.

Second the lavish federal tax incentives for wind and solar energy production — the production tax credit and the investment tax credit — should be eliminated immediately. Between 2010 and 2029 those tax credits will cost the federal treasury about $140 billion.

Designed to stimulate nascent industries the production tax credits and income tax credits have become blatant examples of the crony corporatism that is undermining the integrity of the electric grid. The subsidies reward weather-dependent generation at the cost of dispatchable generation. In 2015 Congress agreed on a five-year phaseout of the PTC. After that deal was struck Sen. Charles Grassley an Iowa Republican and alleged deficit hawk said “As the father of the first wind-energy tax credit in 1992 I can say that the tax credit was never meant to be permanent.”

Advertisement

But the PTC keeps getting extended including yet another extension granted last month by the Internal Revenue Service. For years Big Wind and Big Solar have claimed that they can produce the cheapest electricity. It’s time for them to prove it.

Third the Texas Legislature will have to pass measures that incentivize companies to build and maintain plants that can be dispatched during times of peak demand. Those incentives should include provisions for on-site fuel storage at power plants. This was one of the recommendations put forward by ERCOT in its 60-item “Roadmap to Improving Grid Reliability” report that was released on July 13.

During the February disaster the most reliable power plants were the ones that had on-site fuel: the coal and nuclear plants. Thus the state should give incentives for fuel storage near power plants. For instance diesel fuel can be stored easily and relatively cheaply. That fuel could be used in turbines or quick-start reciprocating engines like the ones made by outfits like Caterpillar Cummins and Wärtsilä.

In summary the mistake made by Texas regulators was to treat electricity as a commodity. That’s wrong. Electricity isn’t like sneakers or hot dogs. Electricity is a critical service. The grid is the backbone of modern society a complex and delicate machine that connects all of our homes and businesses to each other. Without reliable power modern society falls apart.

The February blackouts were the result of a government failure to properly manage our most important network. If Texas’ elected officials don’t fix the problems in ERCOT more blackouts and even cost burdens for low- and middle-income Texans are certain.

And I’m here to report that I think I’ve figured out a big reason behind this phenomenon: electric cars are inherently anti-American.

I know that sounds like a shitpost designed to get people fired up but I want you to hear me out before you jump to the comments to tell me I’m foolish.

Electric cars ask us to change a lot of deeply-held beliefs that we as Americans hold both when it comes to our cars specifically but also when it comes to our lives in general. EVs ask us to be patient. They ask us to be quieter. They ask us to drive shorter distances — and maybe even drive a little slower on the way there. They ask us to buy a car not so much for ourselves as for the world at large.

That’s not to say that I believe every American is a bumbling boisterous oaf — but our cars are an extension of ourselves. You can learn a lot about someone based on the cars they drive. We hold deeply ingrained stereotypes about the kind of people who drive certain cars. Think about the fact that there’s a common perception that people who drive lifted trucks are compensating for something or that they’re a generally uncaring person (something I myself am guilty of). Think about the fact that Brian Griffin driving a Toyota Prius in Family Guy riffs on the stereotype that the only people who drive fuel-efficient hybrid cars are self-absorbed hippie liberals trying to virtue signal. That’s why minivans are the butt of jokes the vehicle equivalent of a pair of frumpy mom jeans or why sports cars like Corvettes have become the vehicle of wealthy Boomers experiencing a midlife crisis or why I cringe any time I see a BMW in my rearview mirror.

Advertisement

And whether or not those stereotypes are true for every single person who drives those kinds of vehicles those perceptions influence how we ourselves drive how we treat other people on the road or how other people treat us.

Now that I’ve had the opportunity to drive more press cars I’ve really started to notice this. Behind the wheel of a Dodge Charger Hellcat I felt invincible and I kind of wanted to flex on everyone else in their boring ol’ SUVs — but even when I wasn’t speeding around people still drove around me more aggressively than they do in my daily drivers. Behind the wheel of a gray Hyundai Kona however I felt like I was just another drop in the bucket and no one really went out of their way to cut me off or tailgate me. And I didn’t really want to push the limits in that car. That’s not what the Kona is made for.

I bought my first car a zippy red Mazda 2 because it was cute and had a little bit of presence but because it could also be fairly nondescript if I wanted it to be. That reflected who I was at the time; I was still painfully shy with my personality occasionally bubbling over but just as quickly hidden away. Now with the big blue Suburban I have a vehicle that reflects my growing self-assurance in who I am along with the demand for a little bit of respect. My husband meanwhile drives a Cadillac ATS because he’s a bitchy old woman trapped in the body of a 29-year-old man.

Part of this comes from the fact that Americans have long defined themselves via the automotive industry. We’ve prided ourselves on power speed and mechanical growth and we’ve done that in all industries. We’re a nation that believes we are the best and we’re very proud and vocal of that. We developed our nation around the rapid growth of the personal car and that includes everything from the roads we drive to the foods we eat to the jobs we have. And the personal car has become as important to the definition of our personalities as the clothes we wear or the music we listen to.

Advertisement

Electric vehicles have come in to entirely challenge those notions. Suddenly we’re being asked to buy a car less because of how perfectly it’s tailored to us but because of how it will benefit the people around us. We’re learning that our battery may not be large or powerful enough to transport us from the out-of-the-way place we chose to live to the city where we work. We’re learning that we can’t just hop out on the big open American road and go without having to think about where we’ll get our power — and we’ll have to wait to charge up. We won’t be able to rev our engines at stoplights to intimidate the person next to us or feel our cars in our bones or do motor repairs at home. EVs will entirely transform the American relationship to the vehicle.

Of course one company has really changed the scope of the conversation regarding EVs: Tesla. Tesla has done a pretty good job at transforming an EV from the butt of a joke to a desirable status symbol — but the company also comes with its own baggage that has really polarized the Tesla name. Now you either love Tesla and all the connotations it comes with or you’re suspicious of what it’s peddling which doesn’t do much to help the EV cause.

Advertisement

Now I’m not making this argument to say that we need to reject the concept of electric cars entirely because I love EVs. I’m saying it because we can use this as a way to reframe our understanding of electric cars and the way we present them to the general public because I just don’t think appealing to everyone’s larger sense of humanity is going to work in a country conditioned to prioritize the individual. This is an opportunity to reframe the way we present and market EVs to the American public in an effort to encourage a more widespread electric adoption.

There are ways we can capitalize on the unique features of EVs. Why aren’t we marketing the instant torque of an electric motor which lets you jump away from a stop sign faster than that ICE you’re having a little friendly competition with? Why aren’t we really emphasising the Jeep Wrangler 4xe’s electric capabilities that you can save for the trail which means you can experience the beauty of America’s natural landscape without disturbing the land around you? Why are we offering tax incentives but not free or discounted at-home charging systems that let you cut out the middleman and save money by charging at home?

Advertisement

There will of course still be obstacles. It’s understandable that people would worry about public charger availability slow charging times battery efficiency and model variety — and while these things will evolve with time that evolution is going to be slow unless we stoke the fires of interest in consumers. There’s no benefit to developing this new type of vehicle unless we know people are going to buy them. And to do that we need to revolutionize the way we talk about and market EVs.

No more vague press release language about mobility. No more only-urban-drivers-will-want-this. Show Americans how electric vehicles can enhance their current relationship with cars while still providing them with the American exceptionalism we want to see in our vehicles. Show us how an EV will make us a badass show us how an EV can seamlessly become a part of our life and make it easier for that to happen. Then we’ll be ready to have the serious electric conversation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFtZXNjb25jYS8yMDIxLzA3LzMxL2FtZXJpY2FzLWFnaW5nLWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLWdldHMtYy1taW51cy1vbi1pdHMtcmVwb3J0LWNhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America's Aging Infrastructure Gets C-Minus On Its Report Card,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2021/07/31/americas-aging-infrastructure-gets-c-minus-on-its-report-card/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFtZXNjb25jYS8yMDIxLzA3LzMxL2FtZXJpY2FzLWFnaW5nLWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLWdldHMtYy1taW51cy1vbi1pdHMtcmVwb3J0LWNhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

I'd normally never step into a Saks Fifth Avenue. The Amex Platinum has me trying new things. (Photo by Joseph Hostetler/The Points Guy)

The secret: Splitting payments at the cash register

Let me first say that I don't belong in Saks Fifth Avenue. Stores like that make me uncomfortable: Business casual shirts with $400 price tags; burlap scarves that could pay a month's rent. Maybe it's the miles and points lobe of my brain but it seems like a waste.

My wife and I visited Waikiki in May. We decided we'd duck into Saks when we spotted it on Kuhio Ave. It was our first time in such a place and we felt immediate unease at the helpfulness of the staff. They were so obsequious that I didn't know if I was meant to tip them. My wife tried on some shorts and the employee helping us never left our side from that point endlessly reaffirming how fantastic we'd look in every article our hands touched. She was extremely nice but we did spend about 40 extra minutes walking around pretending to shop so she didn't know we had strayed from our social/financial boundaries.

My wife and I both have Amex Platinum cards. That means we collectively can get up to $100 in Saks credits every six months by splitting tender at checkout. If you and a partner or travel buddy are in the same situation this is an easy way to get $100 off a single item (instead of just $50). That opens up many more possibilities — though it still takes sifting to find a desirable item around that price.

She eventually found me a shirt on the 40% off the rack that she liked. After the discount the shirt cost $99.27 (remember the goal was to get as close to $100 as possible).

At the register I asked for the bill to be split into two payments. I put $50 on my Amex Platinum and the $49.42 on my wife's. The Saks Fifth Avenue credit doesn't require any minimum spending — it'll basically just reimburse the first $50 you spend directly with Saks.

After purchasing a Saks bag for 15 cents we're just 58 cents away from maxing out our Saks credits. (Photo by Joseph Hostetler/The Points Guy

Our Saks credits have since replenished so now it's my wife's turn to spend $100. Just be aware that you can't split tender online at the Saks website -- you'll have to be at a brick and mortar unfortunately.

Note: I have heard that a good use for these credits is chocolate. I've never purchased chocolate from Saks Fifth Avenue but it does seem like an easy and fun way to spend your $50 credit biannually. I'm curious to hear how you all spend your credits!

Bottom line

The Amex Platinum comes with a ridiculous amount of statement credits — $1400+ every year in fact. And while the card's $50 Saks Fifth Avenue credits are easy to use it's not a lauded benefit because Saks is such an expensive store to begin with.

If your household has more than one Amex Platinum cardholder you can much more easily find a decent free item from Saks by splitting your payment at the cash register between two cards. My wife and I combined our credits to buy one article of clothing off the fire sale rack giving us a $100 value. I do not say I ""saved $100"" because there's not the slimmest chance I'd have stepped into that store without the prod of the Amex Platinum.

Still it's a nice little bonus for having a card that saves me $1000+ annually anyway. You can read our super easy-to-follow guide of Amex Platinum benefits to see what I mean.

Launched in April 2021 the organization is on a mission to address the systemic barriers faced by the Black community when it comes to building wealth. NinetyToZero developed an action plan for corporations to diversify their workforces and to ensure that there are venture capital pathways for Black-owned businesses. The nonprofit’s partners include the Children’s Defense Fund the ACLU American Express Goldman Sachs McKinsey & Company Lord Abbett Green Thumb Starbucks and the Robin Hood Foundation. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and The Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania are also partners of the organization.

Curry says addressing the widening racial wealth gap is imperative. “Uncovering solutions and creating opportunities is something I’m profoundly committed to. Bridging the racial wealth gap is one of the biggest challenges of our generation” he said in a statement according to the news outlet. “We are setting a concrete approach that every organization can take to initiate meaningful progress now.”

Organizations like NinetyToZero are needed. Research shows white families have nearly 10 times the wealth of Black families.

“The one thing I did when I walked in (to make some friends in Ogilvy because I didn’t have any) was give everyone all 15000 employees my WhatsApp number. And I just went on a listening tour” says Andy Main. From his home in Colorado US the global chief executive officer of Ogilvy shares his experience of stepping into traditional ad agency territory at exactly this time last year.

In the thick of a pandemic in 2020 the Scottish-born executive took the topmost job at WPP Group-owned Ogilvy after over two decades with management consultancy giant Deloitte. In short Main was what advertising insiders call 'an outsider'. In his last role he was chief executive of Deloitte Digital where through key acquisitions he brought in creative firepower that the firm needed to take on the big ad holding companies namely WPP Omnicom IPG Dentsu and Publicis Groupe.

Many saw Main's arrival in Ogilvy as evidence of the seriousness of WPP and its CEO Mark Read's intent to transform the legacy agency into a future-fit organisation. In an exclusive interaction with Storyboard Main tells us why and how he's shaking things up.

(Edited for length and clarity)

Q. You took over the reins of Ogilvy at an extraordinary time. Tell us how that went for you and how Ogilvy’s transformation agenda looks in action? My focus has been on ensuring we take the best of Ogilvy protect it and build on it. That means keeping creativity at the centre of everything we do and enabling our creativity to spread its wings particularly into technology and data.

Our aspiration is to be the world's leading creative partner and platform for growth and impact for our clients businesses. To do that we structured Ogilvy around five business groups - Growth & Innovation Advertising PR & Influence Experience and Health. And we practice what’s called borderless creativity. It doesn't really matter where you happen to be or how you happen to think let's make the world borderless to advance growth and impact for our clients.

A lot of people go around talking about integration. Agencies and consultancies have integration departments and disciplines. But we have a different perspective. We talk about the intersections. Integration means you're putting together something that is fixed and known. But when you think about intersections it talks about how you bring talent and capabilities to explore and discover value at intersections of many different topics. That is allowing our minds to be free and when you map that with creativity you get an amazing Ogilvy in the marketplace. That's really what we brought to market very quickly. To have accomplished that feels very exciting to me personally.

Q. The last few years have been difficult for advertising companies across the board a situation made worse by the pandemic. How did Ogilvy fare this past year in terms of business? How did you deal with losing the American Express account which was an over half-century old creative relationship with Ogilvy?

We are a growing business and we've actually won lots of new accounts. For example Absolut Hyatt Enterprise Holdings TCS Pernod Ricard and Deutsche Bank. Our teams in India played a huge role in making that happen. Our wins have actually outnumbered our losses. We did extremely well at Cannes Lions with one Titanium eight Grand Prix and a raft of gold silver and bronze. The creative spirit and DNA of our business is alive and well.

I have transformed and will continue to transform Ogilvy into a growth-oriented business with a growth mindset. This industry is making an amazing comeback and Ogilvy is very well positioned to capture more than its fair share of the market as it comes back in full force.

Q. You are shaking things up in global leadership. You brought in Liz Taylor from Leo Burnett as global chief creative officer a position Piyush Pandey held till recently. Now he is chairman global creative in addition to his role as executive chairman of Ogilvy India. Devika Bulchandani is running the North American operations. Stacey Ryan Cornelius is global CFO and Kim Johnson is the new global CEO of Health. Tell us what was going on in your head when you reconfigured Ogilvy’s leadership.

I had to change certain members of the Ogilvy global leadership team. That's quite honestly why I was brought in. We're doing what we're doing to transform the business in a positive way. But it was very important to me to have diversity at the top.

We have more women and people of colour at Ogilvy’s leadership than ever before. (Liz Taylor is the first woman to hold Ogilvy's top creative position.) Because we have that dynamic leadership the thinking and the decisions we make and the mindset we have basically ripples throughout our organisation to all levels.

I've also been careful to make sure that many leaders from the last several years are also part of our global leadership team because we couldn't have had that much change in our business. That would be very risky. We've got a solid balance of new leadership and leadership that has been around for several years. This blend is helping Ogilvy be super duper competitive.

Q. You spent 21 years at Deloitte before joining Ogilvy last year. Traditional agencies typically get their leaders within the family. WPP flipped the script this time. What do you think the move signalled to clients competition and the industry in general?

That creativity is the source of innovation. I came from a wonderful and successful business. But when you come to Ogilvy it’s clear the creativity is there for everyone to see. My move was basically an indication that it is much harder to scale creativity than it is to scale technology. I can acquire a lot of technology to accompany an already scaled creative business. That in a summary is the message that was delivered to the market with that move.

We actually operate in a unique space between consultancies and agencies. When you compare us to consultancies we have so much more creative prowess. When you compare us to other agencies we've got much more substance insights and industry knowledge. It’s such a powerful combination. We've got great creativity and amazing speed to value. That's really our secret sauce.

Q. But the consultants can just buy great creativity. You did that at Deloitte with the Heat acquisition. Accenture Interactive acquired Droga5. So what happens to the USP of the likes of Ogilvy?

Quite honestly there’s been a slowdown in the consultants’ focus on creativity in the last few years. In many cases there's tissue rejection of the creative assets using the already in place consulting assets because you have a creative mindset meets a consulting mindset. It's like riptides in the ocean where there's competing forces in play. It creates a lot of swirl and unnecessary energy.

If I had to put my point of view on it I just don't think the consulting businesses have scaled creativity nearly fast enough to compete against the likes of Ogilvy on the creative scale. It's just a really hard thing to do to scale creativity and it's an easier thing to do to scale technology. Ogilvy is going to do both. That's what we're out to accomplish.

Q. Let’s dial back to July 2020. Did you feel like an outsider at all when you joined the agency?

I honestly didn't. I think my feeling of not feeling like an outsider started from the very first day I learned about the Ogilvy opportunity. I've had great admiration and love for the Ogilvy brand over many years. I don’t want to say even for a minute that I am comparable to David Ogilvy but in many ways I feel a spirit-connection to him.

David Ogilvy was also born in the UK and moved to the United States. He has Scottish heritage. I was born and raised in Scotland. I think he used to sell gas stoves around the doors in Scotland as one of his first jobs. I used to sell potatoes around the doors in Scotland as one of my first jobs. (Laughs)

If I had a chance to have a Scotch with him—he was quite fond of Scotch so am I—I think we'd have a bond around just being curious people being inventive and wanting to take things to the next level and not being satisfied with what you've got.

When I was introduced to the Ogilvy team over a year ago I promised to future-proof the business over the next few years. That was one of my commitments to the team. Ogilvy is an amazing heritage brand and a business that has not been merged with any others. So it's like a thoroughbred brand and that's just a wonderful thing to be able to represent.

With the victory the USA clinched its seventh Gold Cup title and second-straight victory vs. Mexico in a tournament final after also defeating its regional rival in the inaugural Concacaf Nations League Final on June 6 with an almost entirely different squad.

In winning its ninth-straight game the USA registered its fourth-straight shutout and fifth in six Gold Cup matches only conceding a penalty kick goal in the second group stage game vs. Martinique. For his efforts anchoring the defense goalkeeper Matt Turner won the Golden Glove as the tournament’s best goalkeeper. The USA has now won the Concacaf Gold Cup in 1991 2002 2005 2007 2013 2017 and 2021.

The archrivals entered the match having conceded just one goal each with both posting four shutouts through their first five games and neither side budged through 115 minutes in the championship match. Mexico dictated play for much of the first half but could not break through a disciplined and disruptive collective defensive effort from the U.S.

Anchored by goalkeeper Matt Turner and Robinson at center back the USA defense continued to play lights out keeping a clean sheet vs. Mexico. Robinson and Turner are the only two U.S. players to play every minute of all six matches at the Gold Cup. Turner denied Mexico’s Rogelio Funes Mori on three occasions in the first half alone including a fantastic diving save early on.

The USA weathered the early pressure and had its own chance to take the lead 26 minutes in. Sebastian Lletget picked off a defensive clearance and found Paul Arriola inside the box but Mexico goalkeeper Alfredo Talavera came out to cut off Arriola’s angle forcing his shot to hit off the right post.

The second half was more even with both sides creating half-chances during swinging momentum shifts. However again and again the final ball was just off in a hard-fought battle that saw 51 fouls called - including 31 on the USA – and the USMNT also blocking seven shots.

The USA had the last word in extra time scoring the game-winner in the 117th as Robinson headed in Kellyn Acosta’s free kick to clinch the USA’s second trophy of the summer. It was the USA’s third-straight game-winner to come with less than seven minutes to play and marked the latest USMNT goal in USA-Mexico history.

The USA now shifts its focus to the start of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying next month. The USMNT begins its quest for Qatar on Sept. 2 at El Salvador plays Canada on Sept. 5 in Nashville and closes the FIFA window on Sept. 8 at Honduras.



GOAL SCORING RUNDOWN:

USA – MILES ROBINSON (KELLYN ACOSTA) 117th minute: Mexico’s Edson Alvarez was shown a yellow card following a challenge on Nicolas Giaocchini near the left touchline. Acosta took the ensuing free kick sending a dangerous ball into the box for Miles Robinson. The defender beat Alvarez in the air to head in the game-winner from seven yards out for his third career international goal. USA 1 MEX 0

KEY DEFENSIVE PLAYS AND SAVES:

USA - MATT TURNER 11th minute: Mexico had the game’s first clear chance but Matt Turner was up to for the test. Jesus Corona sent in a corner from the right finding Rogelio Funes Mori unmarked just beyond the penalty mark. Funes Mori put a solid header on frame towards the right post but Turner dove quickly to his left and pushed the ball wide with a strong left-handed save.

MEX - ALFREDO TALAVERA 74th minute: Kellyn Acosta whipped a dipping free kick from the left side into the six where Gyasi Zardes could not connect but kept the ball alive. It fell to Paul Arriola who got a shot off at the doorstep but Talavera threw himself forward blocking the shot from close range with his back as he fell to the ground.



ADDITIONAL NOTES:

Gregg Berhalter made four changes to the squad from Thursday’s semifinal against Qatar inserting defenders George Bello and Reggie Cannon midfielder Eryk Williamson and forward Gyasi Zardes.

Tonight’s Starting XI had an average age of 24 years 236 days. It’s the second-youngest USMNT lineup in a tournament final coming in behind the squad that began the Concacaf Nations League win against Mexico on June 6 (24 years 206 days).

Appearing in his third straight Gold Cup Final Paul Arriola captained the USMNT for the second time tonight. He first wore the armband in the 1-0 quarterfinal win against Jamaica on July 25.

Reggie Cannon started his second-straight Gold Cup final while Gyasi Zardes appeared in his third-straight.

Midfielder Kellyn Acosta was the only starter who also started last month’s Concacaf Nations League Final triumph against Mexico on June 6 in Denver. Both Reggie Cannon and Sebastian Lletget came off the bench in that match.

Acosta appeared in his 14th consecutive match for the USA tonight. He’s the only player to appear in each of the USA’s 13 games in 2021.

The USMNT is 26-6-3 in 35 matches under Gregg Berhalter and 11-1-0 in the Gold Cup. Berhalter is now tied with Steve Sampson (26-22-14; 52 games) for fifth in wins among USMNT head coaches.

China uses a “nine-dash line” citing maritime records from dynastic times to claim about 90% of the 3.5 million-square-kilometer South China Sea that other governments value for fisheries and undersea fossil fuel reserves. The nine dashes cut into some nations’ exclusive economic zones.

The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration issued a decision July 12 2016 rejecting China’s claims as lacking a basis in international law. China dismissed the ruling then and it did the same again in July this year.

Five other Asian governments that dispute China’s wide-ranging nine-dash line lack the military force or economic clout to require that China’s compliance with the arbitral ruling while the court itself lacks police powers. At the same time the rival states accept development aid investment and trade from China which has Asia’s biggest economy along with the strongest armed forces.

China offered money to some maritime rivals after the arbitral verdict to keep the sovereignty issue at bay analysts said at the time.

Neither the arbitral ruling nor anyone’s reaction to it will change China’s stance on its nine-dash line so countries are raising the issue cautiously to stay on Beijing’s good side said Shahriman Lockman senior foreign policy and security studies analyst with the Institute of Strategic and International Studies in Malaysia.

“I think it’s a very calculated thing that they have to do” Lockman said. “You say some things that are not pleasant to Chinese ears but at the same time don’t push it too hard.”

To not raise the ruling at all would imply support for Beijing's claims scholars have told VOA in the past.

China continues to upset rival maritime claimants by landfilling islets in the contested sea between Hong Kong and Borneo for military use. It periodically sends vessels into the exclusive economic zones of the other countries. The Philippines filed the arbitration case in 2013 after China pressured Filipino vessels a year earlier to leave a shoal in the contested sea after a long standoff.

Brunei Malaysia Taiwan and Vietnam call all or parts of the same waterway their own. Claimant governments look to the sea for its fisheries undersea fossil fuel reserves and marine shipping lanes. Malaysia for one quietly supports the 2016 verdict but has been “careful not to annoy China” Lockman said.

China’s official Xinhua News Agency called the world court ruling illegal null and void citing a spokesperson in the Chinese Embassy in London on July 27 to rebut comments from the British defense secretary. The arbitration five years ago violated the “principle of state consent"" and the court issued an award “in disregard of law” the news agency said.

Foreign affairs officials in Vietnam the Philippines and the United States among other countries made statements this month in support of the arbitral ruling and international law. A Philippine activist group said on its website that “militant” fishing operators had stormed the Chinese consulate in Metro Manila to mark the ruling’s anniversary.

The Philippine government statement is a repetition of the arbitration court’s ruling five years ago without moving the needle forward according to Jay Batongbacal international maritime affairs professor at the University of the Philippines in Quezon City. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte spent his first two years in office from 2016 befriending China in return for infrastructure development aid the scholar noted.

Duterte’s Cabinet has openly criticized China since March of this year over 220 Chinese fishing vessels that had moored at a disputed feature in the Spratly Islands.

“This year it’s a very different tone as well but they’re still trying to balance a friendly tone because of the pandemic and their need to get vaccines from China” Batongbacal said. The Philippines agreed in December to take China’s Sinovac Biotech vaccines for COVID-19.

Undersea oil drillers such as Malaysia and Vietnam may still cite the arbitral ruling to defend any challenges to exploration in their 370-kilometer-wide maritime exclusive economic zones overlapped by the nine-dash line Lockman said.

China’s rejection of the court ruling followed by acquiescence by its neighbors ultimately widens a schism between Beijing’s own legal boundaries and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) said Alexander Vuving professor at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii. The court used the convention as a basis for its 2016 ruling.

“The ruling and China’s rejection of the ruling signifies a struggle for international order” Vuving said. “The struggle for international order is actually hiding in plain sight. We have the clash between UNCLOS and the Chinese nine-dash line.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbmV3cy9rZXZpbi1kdXJhbnQtc3VycGFzc2VzLWNhcm1lbG8tYW50aG9ueS1mb3ItbW9zdC1wb2ludHMtaW4tdXMtb2x5bXBpYy1oaXN0b3J50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kevin Durant surpasses Carmelo Anthony for most points in U.S. Olympic history,"SAITAMA Japan (AP) — Kevin Durant had been just ordinary so far in these Olympics.

That’s probably not good enough for gold.

Not on this U.S. men’s basketball team an unproven and for now still unspectacular group.

Durant is the top scorer to ever wear the red white and blue a player who has been unstoppable on the international stage from the moment he arrived.

“It’s literally our third game of all us together” guard Jrue Holiday said “but we knew KD would come in and do what he was supposed to do do what he always does.”

And just what the U.S. needs.

The Americans are still learning each other and the international game with differences from the NBA in the way it’s played and officiated.

Durant has already mastered it. And now he can teach this group.

He doesn’t try to be a vocal leader relying more on the way he plays and practices to set an example for his teammates.

Sure the three-time Olympian shared some stories about the opening ceremonies or his other experiences to some of the newcomers but he’s not about to talk their ear off about how to play what he calls a simple game.

“It’s basketball at the end of the day” said Durant who has played for the U.S. as well as anyone who had ever done it — if not better.

He now has 354 points in his 19 Olympic games (18.6 per game) surpassing the 336 that Carmelo Anthony scored in his four Olympics.

But Durant hadn’t been sharp yet in Japan shooting just 4 for 12 in the opening loss to France and scoring 10 points in both games.

“I think it was just a matter of time” Holiday said.

U.S. officials weren’t sure of their chances at the world basketball championships in 2010 after none of the veterans from the 2008 Olympic gold medalists opted to play and left the Americans with a number of players in their early 20s.

Durant averaged 22.8 points and won tournament MVP honors as the Americans won gold and he never slowed down once he made the Olympic roster two years later.

He scored 156 points in 2012 and 155 in 2016 finishing both tournaments with 30 points in the gold-medal game.

Though it would become a blowout the Americans were trailing early into the second quarter Saturday before Durant heated up. His 3-pointer with 6:18 remaining broke Anthony’s record and he followed by hitting another on the next possession.

He kept rolling into the third quarter and by then his teammates had loosened up after their uneven start and surged into the quarterfinals with ease.

Durant is still a long way from the top scorers in Olympic history. Brazil’s Oscar Schmidt scored 1093 points and Andrew Gaze of Australia had 789. Both of them appeared in five Olympics.

But Durant views himself as far more than a scorer anyway. He finished with eight rebounds and six assists both team highs and also a blocked shot that started a fast break while playing inside for an undersized U.S. team.

In his first season back from a ruptured Achilles tendon that forced him to miss a season Durant had to do it all for the Brooklyn Nets at the end of the playoffs. Even though Kyrie Irving and James Harden were both injured in the series Durant carried the Nets to a Game 7 against eventual champion Milwaukee in the second round. He had 49 points and a triple-double in Game and 48 in Game 7.

He won’t have to score that much on this U.S. team but he’s ready to do whatever is required.

“I’ve had a lot asked of me for every team I played for since I was 8 years old” Durant said.

“I feel like I have to be prepared to do everything single thing on the court.”

That might just be what it takes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zb2NjZXIvdXMtYnVpbGRzLW1vbWVudHVtLWZvci13b3JsZC1jdXAtcXVhbGlmeWluZy1ieS13aW5uaW5nLWdvbGQtY3VwLTI0MTE2NTAv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3NvY2Nlci91cy1idWlsZHMtbW9tZW50dW0tZm9yLXdvcmxkLWN1cC1xdWFsaWZ5aW5nLWJ5LXdpbm5pbmctZ29sZC1jdXAtMjQxMTY1MC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US builds momentum for World Cup qualifying by winning Gold Cup,"The Americans’ extra time victory over Mexico in the Gold Cup final Sunday at Allegiant Stadium gives them optimism heading into World Cup qualifying this fall.

The U.S. men’s national team will never forget the sting of defeat from its 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago on Oct. 10 2017 that kept the Americans from qualifying for the 2018 World Cup.

Still that feeling felt a lot further away Sunday night.

The Americans are heading into their next attempt at World Cup qualifying this fall with a lot more optimism and momentum after their 1-0 extra time victory over Mexico in the Gold Cup final at Allegiant Stadium. They have won eight straight — including two in a row against their toughest regional rival — and appear to have discovered some extra grit depth and resolve that will help them through their difficult schedule.

“Qualifying is everything right now” U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said. “That’s our focus. This tournament is in the past and now we shift toward qualifying. We know it’s going to be grueling but we think the player pool has matured and it’s been battle-tested.”

The U.S. has undergone a major reset since that night against Trinidad and Tobago.

Only two players from that match — forward Paul Arriola and midfielder Kellyn Acosta — were on the Gold Cup roster. Berhalter has welcomed fresh faces and given them opportunities to prove themselves before the most challenging test of his tenure.

That continued into the Gold Cup.

The U.S. decided not to bring many of its European-based players to the tournament so they could rest for a busy 2021-22 schedule with their club and national teams. That meant lots of usual starters — such as Chelsea’s Christian Pulisic Juventus’ Weston McKennie Borussia Dortmund’s Gio Reyna RB Leipzig’s Tyler Adams Barcelona’s Sergino Dest and Manchester City’s Zack Steffen — were unavailable.

Instead the U.S. relied on players almost exclusively from Major League Soccer. It gave Berhalter the opportunity to try some young unproven guys in key roles and see how they held up.

They did pretty well. The Americans conceded only one goal during the Gold Cup and none during the run of play. They started their second-youngest lineup ever against Mexico and still won.

Their youngest-ever lineup came June 6 in Denver against Mexico in the Nations League final another extra-time victory for the U.S.

“We’ve got a lot of young guys that are willing to fight for each other and fight for this country and prove that the United States is a country that has to be taken seriously” center back Miles Robinson said. “I’m really excited for this group.”

The key for Berhalter’s squad is to carry over the momentum into its first World Cup qualifying match Sept. 2 at El Salvador. It will play 14 games against seven regional foes and need to finish in the top three to guarantee a spot for Qatar 2022.

The Gold Cup showed that Berhalter will have plenty of options when building his lineups. He will need them because the U.S. plays three matches in the span of a week four times.

Acosta was excellent and showed he deserves to be included as a squad player. Robinson who scored the winning goal Sunday made his case for a starting spot.

The Americans also stood tall knowing they weren’t favored and that most of the announced crowd of 61514 was cheering for Mexico. They scratched and clawed to keep the game close and were rewarded with a goal in the 117th minute.

If they show the same fight this fall they have a good chance of flipping the page from one of the most embarrassing defeats in their history.

“Really proud of the group” Berhalter said. “When you look at the game today we did not stop. It was relentless from us. And that was a mark of a good team.”

I was scanning the horizon from the observation tower where my colleagues and I conduct our research at Mushara water hole. Wind had deterred elephant families from visiting the water hole earlier—it interferes with their efforts to keep tabs on one another vocally—but with the air now still our first customers of the day had finally appeared.

Judging from how many trunks were stretched high sampling the air the group was itching to break cover and run for the water. The young males were particularly anxious to get going. Not only were they thirsty but they had a lot of sparring to catch up on. As winter wears on the environment dries out and elephants have to venture farther from water to find enough to eat. Several days may pass before they can return to the water hole for a drink and a reunion.

I could see why this group was holding back however. Another elephant family was amassing in the southeastern forest and heading our way and the adult females were wary. They stood with their feet firmly planted ears held straight out as they sniffed what little remained of the prevailing wind for any potential danger. Not only would exiting the security of the forest expose the family to predators but an encounter with a higher-ranking elephant family could result in an aggressive interaction. For the youngsters in the group however more families meant more opportunities to play. So after thoroughly assessing the clearing the matriarch gave the word with a rumble and an ear flap and the family began its approach to the water.

Play provides an environment for experimenting with risk.

Late afternoon is my favorite time of day during our field season in the austral winter—the air cools fast as the sun sinks low in the sky painting the elephants a radiant pink. My colleagues and I stand in the observation tower with a celebratory drink in hand our binoculars trained on the horizon hoping for a sunset visit like this one from one of our beloved resident families. During these daily visits I always learn a new lesson about elephants—particularly when they play.

I have witnessed the important role of play in calf development and family politics by watching members of my favorite elephant groups frolic at this water hole at sunset. These often chaotic observations inspired me to want to understand more about how animals play and what advantages this behavior might confer not just to elephants but to all social creatures including humans. It turns out that play like other forms of interaction has rules of engagement. And it is essential for developing the physical and cognitive faculties that animals need to survive and reproduce.

Rules and Regulations

People tend to think of play as an activity one engages in at one's leisure outside of learning important skills needed to succeed later in life such as hunting mating and evading predators. But although playing is fun for all involved—and fun for those who are watching—play behaviors evolved as ritualized forms of survival skills needed later in life providing the opportunity to perfect those skills.

Engaging in play allows animals to experiment with new behaviors in a protected environment without dangerous consequences. The unwritten code of conduct surrounding play lets them explore many possible outcomes.

Animals learn the rules of engagement for play at a very young age. Among dogs the bow is a universal invitation to engage in silliness that triggers the same bowing down and splaying of the front legs in the receiver of the signal—inevitably followed by chasing and pretend biting. Chimpanzees and gorillas motivate others to romp by showing their upper and lower teeth in what primatologists refer to as a play face which is comparable to human laughter.

When a young male elephant wants to play with another male of similar age he holds his trunk up and presents it to the other as an invitation. Most often his next move would be to place his trunk over the other's head which in adults signals dominance but in calves is guaranteed to precipitate a spirited sparring match. These encounters run the gamut from gentle shoving to intense headbutting and pushing back and forth with trunks entwining and tusks clacking. The fun continues for seconds to minutes for youngsters; for older teens and young adults it can go on much longer. The sparring matches provide bulls with the opportunity to test their fighting ability so that they might successfully compete for a female when they reach sexual maturity and enter the hormonal state of musth around the age of 25.

When a young male elephant is feeling particularly adventurous he may venture far away from Mom's protection to invite a distant relative to spar. If his foray takes him too far away or if a spar turns unexpectedly rough the brave calf will lose his nerve and often will run quickly back to Mom's side with ears flapping and trunk yo-yoing as he retreats.

Occasionally an older sister will oversee a play bout between youngsters. These ever watchful siblings form part of an extended caretaking network that facilitates play but its members also will intervene if a calf crosses an invisible bloodline and gets deflected with a trunk slap by an overly protective high-ranking mother.

Forms of Play

Scholars of animal behavior recognize three main categories of play. The first is social play which is any kind of antic that involves others. The second is locomotive play—including running walking jumping and pouncing—which facilitates lifelong motor skills. In prey species locomotive play helps to perfect predator-avoidance tactics such as the springbok's “pronking” high into the air while running as a herd and landing in unpredictable spots. In elephants it hones predator-avoidance skills as well as strategies for escaping an aggressive suitor or a competitor looking to inflict a mortal wound. Conversely young predators such as lion cubs use locomotive play to sharpen their hunting ability. Chasing and tripping littermates and then giving them a good chew on the spine or throat are rehearsals of the skills needed to catch prey animals and dispatch them by severing their spinal cord or choking them.

Many species including our own engage in the mock-fighting variety of locomotive play which allows them to test their strength in a safe environment where everyone understands the rules. A playful spar in elephants is just like an arm wrestle between human peers. When play becomes more elaborate and determined it turns from an arm wrestle into something akin to martial arts allowing both participants to practice skills and develop innovative solutions that could help them avoid mortal combat later in life. Play fighting also provides opportunities to test boundaries gauge who can be trusted and learn important body language.

How often in our own families do grudges of older generations get put aside because of bonds forged by the next generation through play?

The third main category of play is object play which incorporates objects from the environment into the cavorting. For an elephant this object might take the form of a stick or branch that the elephant explores carries or throws with its trunk. In captivity elephants enjoy playing with balls or hauling inner tubes around for fun. Alternatively the object could be another animal such as a zebra or giraffe that offers an irresistible opportunity for a chase. In one case a four-year-old male calf named Leo taught his baby brother Liam just how fun such a chase can be leaving Liam scrambling to keep up with Leo's charge as a giraffe made a quick escape.

Two other forms of play have been documented only in great apes including humans. One of these game playing combines social locomotive and object play. Sports such as soccer field hockey lacrosse and polo are examples of traditional games that became formalized as sports with specific sets of rules (among nonhuman great apes only captive individuals raised in human contexts play formal games). The other variety of play that appears to be unique to great apes is make-believe. For example a wild chimpanzee may carry around a small log pretending it is an infant. A human child might play with an invisible toy or set up an invisible barrier that they want adults to acknowledge.

Not Just Fun and Games

Play provides an environment for experimenting with risk. When a lion cub deliberately gives up some control over its body it puts itself at a disadvantage allowing others to succeed in pouncing on it. Marc Bekoff of the University of Colorado Boulder and his colleagues have proposed that play increases the versatility of movements used to recover from a loss of balance and enhances the ability of the player to cope with unexpected stressful situations. The goal is not to win but to improve skills sometimes by self-handicapping.

Once a cub has been tackled by its littermates roles might reverse such that a littermate handicaps itself allowing the other cub to tackle it in return. Self-handicapping is risky and requires trust but it is a great way to develop strength and agility. It is also an important exercise in building cooperation. In the Sawtooth wolf pack raised by Jim and Jamie Dutcher in the Sawtooth Mountains in Idaho the dominant wolf would slow down to allow a close companion that happened to be a subordinate to catch up and tackle him. In elephants on a number of occasions I have seen older male calves crouch down to allow a much younger calf to spar with them. This is akin to an older brother handicapping himself during an arm wrestle by not using all of his strength to let his little brother win.

Being silly is another important aspect of play one that gets us outside our comfort zone and forces us to test new strategies. Silliness in our movements behavior and even language helps us think much more broadly and creatively. Problem-solving derived from the silliness of play has been demonstrated in many species and even in robots. When mechanical engineer Hod Lipson of Columbia University gave his artificial-intelligence robots a chance to play—by dancing around in random movements—they outperformed other robots when challenged with the unexpected. The positioning information garnered from moving around randomly led one robot to come up with creative solutions for maintaining its balance after losing a limb.

Likewise when sea lions play in the surf they often project themselves high into the air midway down the face of monster waves like those that roll into Santa Cruz. These are just the kinds of behaviors needed to avoid an attack by a great white shark—their primary predator apart from killer whales and humans.

Play also builds trust. Thomas Bugnyar of the University of Vienna in Austria and his colleagues found that ravens pretend to cache highly valued food items and then watch how other ravens respond apparently to determine whom they can trust. Learning how to differentiate competitors from likely reliable collaborators early on has obvious advantages whether one wants to gain allies or build a coalition within a group—or repair broken relationships.

Families Reunited

“Incoming from the southeast!” I called out from the Mushara tower as my elephant field team narrowed in on what looked like a dusty line of pinkish-gray boulders amassing on the edge of the clearing one afternoon during our 2018 field season. The search for identifying features began. A missing tusk a notch in the bottom of the left ear or a V-shaped cut in the top of the right ear would give the family away. Whoever identified the elephant family first would get an extra sundown drink.

That day the incoming family turned out to be the Actors. It was our first sighting of the group that season and we were excited to see a new addition to the family: high-ranking Susan identified by her daggerlike left tusk had a new male calf Liam. And low-ranking Wynona who was missing her left tusk had her two-year-old calf Lucy in tow. We had been following the contentious dynamic between these two mothers very closely over the years particularly during the 2012 season when each had a calf—Leo and Liza respectively.

Susan had relentlessly tormented Wynona all the way up to the end of her pregnancy aggressively charging her whenever she got close to the water to drink. The tension was so high that when Wynona broke away from the family to give birth surrounded by her daughter Erin and their calves I worried for her baby's life if a reunion were to take place. Sure enough there was no fanfare and no reunion that we witnessed to present her new baby to the rest of the family. I assumed then that Wynona's days as a member of the Actor family were numbered.

As predicted Wynona did separate from the larger family and became the matriarch of her own core family. It went on like that for four years until the arrival of Wynona's newest baby Lucy in 2016 yet again changed the dynamic of the larger extended family group. Play appeared to be an important contributing factor in reuniting the family.

Lucy's older sister Liza had been a shy baby who stuck to her mom and her very close relatives. Wynona timed her movements to avoid too much overlap with the larger family group when they went to Mushara water hole to drink. They tended to be one day behind or ahead of the Actor family usually behind. On the rare occasion that they did overlap just at the end of the extended family visit Liza did not stray to interact with the larger family. And who would blame her? Susan was right there with a quick jab with her dagger tusk or a trunk slap whichever was more convenient making it clear that the low-ranking babies had no place on the playground with royalty. There was hardly a chance for calves of Wynona's small but growing family to get to know members of the extended family.

Lucy changed all that. From the start she was quite the extrovert. Maybe being born into a very small family made her all the more curious and excited by the opportunity to engage with the extended family on the infrequent occasion of their overlapping. And she was not deterred by the admonishments of high-ranking moms within the extended family much to the seeming annoyance of the ever watchful Susan.

Now the two-year-old Lucy knew just how to run through adults' legs and out of trunk's reach navigating potential minefields and dodging her mom's attempts to rein her in. She behaved more like Susan's calf Leo who was her older sister Liza's contemporary. When we scored Leo's distance from his mom at the water hole he always had a much higher score than Liza. We had assumed that was attributable mainly to his sex and the male elephant's early experiments with independence. But the arrival of Lucy showed us that the story was not that simple.

Lucy spent a lot of time a great distance away from her mom and played with calves of mothers of all ranks. When it came time to leave the water hole and go in separate directions as dictated by the prevailing family politics Lucy made that impossible. She was so busy playing with other calves that there was no extracting her leaving Wynona no choice but to modify her behavior.

Instead of continuing on her premeditated departure route in the opposite direction from the Actor family Wynona her eldest daughter Erin and their calves turned around and followed the rest of the family so that Wynona did not risk losing her new calf. There was no guarantee that the other mothers would protect Lucy much less allow her to suckle as that would mean fewer precious nutrients for their own calves. But by 2018 Wynona was fully reintegrated into the Actor family whether she wanted to be or not.

Every time I see this dynamic unfold it makes me smile. How often is it the case in our own families that grudges of older generations are put aside because of the bonds forged by the next generation through play?

Play should be on our daily agenda. Smiling and laughing are contagious behaviors that facilitate bonding are curative and most important do not have to take up much time. The next time you feel like you are too busy to play a frivolous game at work or you don't want to face that family reunion make the time and muster the will. You might be surprised at the outcome whether it be a better idea for a pitch meeting or the dissolution of a long-standing barrier between you and a contentious relative thanks to a good giggle.

Our highly adaptable and innovative nature is rooted in play. I am grateful to my favorite elephant Wynona and her daughter Lucy for reminding me that there is always something new we can learn from it—and that we are never too old to internalize those lessons. A good romp can pay off in ways I hadn't anticipated. It forges new bonds reunites divided families improves coping skills and overall health and facilitates cooperation and innovation. Given all these benefits how could we afford not to play?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50ZnJlYWtpbnJvYm90LmNvbS9lbnQvamVmZi1kYW5pZWxzLWFtZXJpY2FuLXJ1c3QtdHJhaWxlci5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,See Jeff Daniels Protect His Family In The American Rust Trailer,"Jeff Daniels is back with the first American Rust trailer.

The trailer for Jeff Daniels’ show goes into depth about its characters. It highlights how the murder affects the town and its protagonist. The personal ties to the case become complicated for the chief as he finds the murderer. Including the pressure from the town someone has to answer for these crimes giving a glimpse of the small-town politics that will come into play.

Besides Jeff Daniels and Maura Tierney the new series will include Bill Camp (The Queen’s Gambit) Rob Yang (Succession) David Alvarez (West Side Story) Mark Pellegrino (Supernatural) and Alex Neustaedter (Colony).

Dan Futterman will act as the showrunner of the crime drama. Futterman has produced shows like the American remake of Broadchurch with Gracepoint The Looming Tower (which also starred Jeff Daniels) and Capote which he wrote too.

Directing the Jeff Daniels series will be John Dahl (Yellowstone) Darnell Martin (Law & Order: Criminal Intent) Craig Zisk (Brooklyn Nine-Nine).

Jeff Daniels will go beyond starring in the Showtime series by acting as an executive producer. Along with him will be Michael De Luca (The Baby-Sitters Club) Dan Futterman Paul J. Martino (Inside Game) Kate O’Connell (Narcos) Adam Rapp (The Looming Tower) Elisa Ellis (Invasion) Brian McGreevy (Hemlock Grove) and Lee Shipman (Hemlock Grove). In addition Jonathan Shoemaker (Jessica Jones) will act as a co-producer.

American Rust is based on the book of the same name by Phillip Meyer. Writing the script for the adaption of the Jeff Daniels show will be Jaquen Castellanos (The Affair) Dan Futterman Brian McGreevy and Lee Shipman. It will make for the debut of Amanda Pellegrino.

The series will be the only credited work from Jeff Daniels. Last year the actor was in the Showtime miniseries The Comey Rule with Holly Hunter (The Big Sick) Michael Kelly (House of Cards) and Jonathan Banks (Breaking Bad). The Emmy winning star also appeared in Adam with Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad).

In his career that started back in the ’80s Jeff Daniels has gone off to win two Emmies. His first win was in Aaron Sorkin’s (The Trial of the Chicago 7) The Newsroom with Emily Mortimer (Mary Poppins Returns) John Gallagher Jr. (10 Cloverfield Lane) and Alison Pill (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World). The second was in the Netflix miniseries Godless with co-stars Jack O’Connell (Skins) Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey) and Scoot McNairy (Narcos: Mexico). Between those wins he has been nominated for The Looming Tower and two other nominations for The Newsroom in 2014 and 2015.

American Rust with Jeff Daniels will hit Showtime on September 12.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wOC8wMS9rYXRocmluZS1uZXJvLWNoZWNrLW91dC1hc2NlbnQtbHV4dXJ5LWxpdmluZy1hbWF6aW5nLXZpZXdzLzUzODQ0ODEwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kathrine Nero: Check out the Ascent luxury living with incredible views,"A twisting blue and white tower stands apart from the rest of the natural colored office buildings that dot Covington’s riverfront.

Its curved lines and color palette mimic the trusses of the area’s most famous bridge the Roebling Suspension Bridge. It’s familiar and foreign at the same time.

And that’s exactly the point.

The Ascent at Roebling’s Bridge built in 2008 is arguably the most recognizable building on either side of the river. Though most of us have seen the Daniel Libeskind classic from the outside few of us have had the opportunity to see what it’s like inside.

So when I got the chance to check out one of the crown jewels of this architectural gem there was no arm twisting needed.

Entering the lobby you’re greeted by a two-story art piece made of mylar so large it had to be assembled right there on site. Trina Wesley Creative Manager for the building’s owner Corporex explains more than a half a million dollars’ worth of art dot the public spaces.

Residents get amenities in addition to the enviable address. “You can reserve a driver to get a ride home from the airport. And there’s a 24-hour concierge” she says. “There are also guest suites for company paying a visit.”

Not a mention a coffee bar a movie screening room a pool and a fitness center that includes a massage room and sauna. A library opens up to a beautiful outdoor space that overlooks its namesake bridge – and just a few steps away there’s a wine cellar with storage for residents’ special bottles.

“High rise buildings usually have common spaces but few with this much space or amenities” says Heather Harris Corporex senior VP of sales and marketing. She spent much of her life in New York City so she knows luxury high rises.

OK Kathrine. Let’s get to the penthouse already.

There are 70 total residences that range in price from $599000 to $1.5 million and yes a few are on the market.

Unit 1101 is one of five penthouses in the building even though it’s not on the top floor. The Ascent is 14 floors on one side 22 on the other. This unit takes up the entire 11th floor and has almost 360-degree views of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky.

Yes the views are unparalleled. The design is modern but comfortable. But what struck me is the spaciousness. That’s not usually the first adjective used in high-rise living even luxury high rises. There are two master bedroom suites a sleek kitchen with a coffee bar that opens up to a large dining area and living room plus an office. And the walk-in closet is the size of the bedroom that my daughters share.

This is the view you wake up to from one of two bedrooms.

The larger balcony is partially shaded by some of the large swooping blue beams visible from street level. It brings the architecture of the building inside the home and reminds you of the bridge that’s just a stone’s throw away.

They're calling it the ""Megadrought.""

Seven years ago in this space I profiled the drought that was baking California (and the companies working to combat it). It was California's worst drought in 500 years experts said at the time. But seven years later the worst has gotten even worse with 95% of the state experiencing ""severe drought"" conditions and 86% ""extreme.""

Things have gotten so bad that California's State Water Resources Control Board may vote on Aug. 3 to cut off water access to Central Valley farmers. Fires are breaking out across the parched state; the crowdsourced #FireMappers map shows literally dozens of blazes including the Dixie Fire which reached ""megafire"" status on Friday. No wonder the American Geophysical Union now says this seemingly endless drought is the most severe ""in the last 1200 years.""

And yet if you look at a map you'll see a very big (indeed an ocean-sized) potential solution to California's drought problems -- if only we can get the salt out.

The desalination solution

Through desalination oceanic salt water can be transformed into potable fresh water in either of two ways: You can boil it let the salt precipitate out and collect the condensation. Or you can filter the saltwater through a membrane to remove the salt.

It can be an expensive process. A gallon of potable water produced through desalination costs about twice what it costs to provide water from other sources. And yet this cost of desalination has fallen by half over the past 30 years -- meaning it's an increasingly viable solution. What's more when you consider the losses from not investing in desalination: California lost $5 billion in agricultural revenue from crops not grown during the last big drought from 2014 to 2015. That same $5 billion could have built five new desalination plants to help prevent the next drought.

In California nearly a dozen such desalination plants are already in operation (and 10 more are planned). The Carlsbad Desalination Plant -- still under construction when I last wrote about this drought -- has now been up and running for five years. Filtering 50 million gallons per day it's the largest desalination plant in the Western Hemisphere and supplies 7% of San Diego County's water.

Poseidon Water the company that built the Carlsbad plant is now planning to open a similar-sized plant in Huntington Beach -- albeit at a higher price. Carlsbad cost $1 billion but the Huntington Beach plant could cost $1.4 billion.

Seven desalination companies to invest in

Speaking of which investors looking to support (and profit from) the growing use of desalination technology to cure California's chronic droughts might want to start their search with Poseidon Water; according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence it's a subsidiary of the giant Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP 0.23%). With a $16 billion market capitalization but only $193 million in trailing profit Brookfield may not look like an attractive investment at first glance. But the company generated more than $1 billion in positive free cash flow (FCF) last year -- giving the stock an attractive valuation of 16 times FCF. Adding to the attraction Brookfield currently pays a generous dividend yield of 3.7%.

Brookfield is based in Bermuda and foreign companies tend to dominate the water desalination field. France's Veolia Environnement (VEOEY -0.03%) is the world's biggest desalination company having built more than 1950 reverse-osmosis desalination plants in 85 countries -- including the huge desalination plant in Sydney Australia that supplies 15% of that city's water. France's Suez Environnement (SZEVY) is No. 2 -- and earns a massive 23.4% EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) margin on its water business.

Among U.S. companies General Electric Company (GE -2.46%) remains one of the world's biggest suppliers of water treatment equipment. On Catalina Island southwest of Los Angeles GE built a 150000-gallons-per-day desalination plant for Southern California Edison a division of Edison International (EIX 0.17%). GE says the desalination process costs between $3 and $6 per 1000 gallons and that 70% of that cost is for fuel to operate the plants. However solar-powered desalination has the potential to cut that cost.

Speaking of energy costs you might also consider Energy Recovery Inc. (ERII 0.43%) which derives 77% of its revenue from reverse-osmosis desalination services. Through efficient operation the company says its flagship PX Pressure Exchanger ""saves water desalination customers approximately USD $2 billion annually in energy costs.""

Finally Ecolab (ECL -0.03%) based in Saint Paul Minnesota owns Aquatech International a Pennsylvania company specializing in water purification technology. It's a small subsidiary within a big company but still the 10th-biggest desalination company in the world. And it's part of Ecolab's largest and most profitable division (""global industrial"") where it contributes to that division's powerful 18.5% operating profit margin.

All of this goes to show: Even if drought poses a big problem in California desalination can be one (very profitable) way to solve it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMS8wNy9zdGlsbHdhdGVyLWFtYW5kYS1rbm94LWNhc2Utc2ltaWxhcml0aWVzLW1hdHQtZGFtb24tbW92aWUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amanda Knox and Stillwater: What's real and invented in the Matt Damon movie.,"If you’ve heard anything about Stillwater a new movie that opened this weekend it’s probably that it’s loosely based on the events in the Amanda Knox case—Knox herself wishes she had been left out of it—and that it stars Matt Damon. Those two facts might initially seem in conflict with each other: I don’t think Damon would make any casting director’s wish list for the role of a female college student who’s been charged with killing her roommate being that he is both male and 50 years old. (Will Hunting no more!) Indeed instead of focusing on the student in such a scenario Stillwater centers on her father and that’s Damon character. That choice is the first big tell that that the film isn’t a straightforward adaptation of real-life events but it doesn’t stop there. The differences between Knox’s case and Stillwater run deep—here’s an inventory of the most major points where real life and fiction diverge including some spoilers if you haven’t seen the movie.

Biographical Details

Amanda Knox is from Seattle where she came from a middle-class family and attended the University of Washington. Her parents divorced when she was a child and both remarried. Stillwater gives Allison Baker (played by Abigail Breslin) a less stable and therefore more dramatic backstory: She’s poor from rural Oklahoma and was primarily raised by her grandmother because her mother died by suicide and her father Bill (that’s Damon) had substance abuse and legal problems.

Knox’s father Curt Knox who worked in finance spoke to the media about his daughter’s case but he was not a cloak-and-dagger figure and her lone lifeline so the Bill Baker character is basically a whole-cloth invention. Once again the added-in details about his past heighten the drama: Bill is a high school dropout who works on oil rigs but when we meet him he’s recently laid off and has been working shifts in construction and tornado cleanup to get by. He’s a bit of a heartland stereotype: He’s a man of few words (and when he does speak he says “ma’am” a lot). He wears a baseball hat and jeans everywhere prays before meals has a tattoo of an eagle on his arm owns guns and insistently only speaks English despite spending a significant amount of time in Europe in connection with his daughter’s case. Though all of this seems to scream “Trump supporter” the movie avoids stating the character’s political views: When another character asks him who he voted for in the U.S. presidential election he says he didn’t vote at all on account of being a felon. Bill and his daughter aren’t usually at odds but due to his unreliability over the years she doesn’t trust him.

The Crime

In November 2007 Meredith Kercher’s body was discovered in her apartment in Perugia Italy. Kercher had been on exchange from a university in her native England to study there that fall and living with another exchange student Amanda Knox an American. Knox was eventually charged with the murder along with her then-boyfriend an Italian student named Raffaele Sollecito and Rudy Guede a local man who was acquainted with a man Kercher was dating.

Stillwater switches out Perugia for Marseille France where American student Allison was charged with murdering Lina a young woman of Arab descent with whom Allison both lived and was romantically involved at the time of her death.

Stereotypes and Tabloid Charges

Knox garnered an enormous amount of media attention worldwide: She was dubbed a femme fatale and nicknamed “Foxy Knoxy” and all sorts of outlandish theories were spouted during the ensuing frenzy like the one that the killing was part of one of her and Sollecito’s drug-fueled sex games. Echoing the way tabloids speculated wildly about Knox’s sex life in Stillwater it’s implied that the media seized on Allison and Lina’s same-sex relationship as a salacious detail. There’s additional tension in Allison’s nationality: Despite her not actually coming from a family of much means she’s considered privileged because she’s a white American university student.

Other Suspects

The majority of the media attention focused on Knox and Sollecito in the Italy case but there were a few other notable people who were investigated. When Knox initially questioned by police about the case she implicated Patrick Lumumba her boss at a bar where she worked part time. He was arrested but was released after a short time and Knox blamed fingering him on manipulation from Italian authorities. More importantly Guede was arrested as a potential subject a few weeks after the murder. Guede had fled to Germany after the body was discovered but was extradited back to Italy.

In Stillwater Allison says that the night Lina was murdered she had drinks with a man named Akim who then stole Allison’s purse and killed Lina. When the movie begins Akim has never been found but Allison believes tracking him down and testing his DNA could exonerate her. In both cases a foreign white woman accusing a nonwhite man of the crime heightens tensions; in the movie many doubt Akim exists at all.

Trials and Prison Sentence

In Knox and Sollecito’s first trial in 2009 they were convicted of murder and sexual violence among other charges and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison respectively. They won a 2011 appeal and were released after spending four years in prison. The legal saga still wasn’t over: In 2013 an Italian court reversed the acquittal. They were cleared again seemingly once and for all in 2015. Guede whose fingerprints and DNA were found at the crime scene opted for a fast-tracked trial and was convicted in 2008. He was initially given a sentence of 30 years but it was reduced over time and he was eventually released in 2020 and told he could finish his sentence through community service. Guede is now the sole person convicted of the murder.

In the film a gravestone places Lina’s death in 2014 and when we meet her Allison has been in prison for five years with four more to serve. It is clear she has been through an appeals process as well because when Bill consults Allison’s lawyer about a potential new lead involving Akim she urges the Bakers to drop it and make peace with the sentence. Bill seeks to find Akim because there was unidentified DNA at Lina’s murder scene an echo of the other evidence in the Knox case.

Supporting Their Daughters

The Knox family initially used airline miles vacation time and sick time to find a way for at least one family member to be in Italy to be with Amanda and attend her trial at every possible moment and there were times when they lived there for stretches. Paying for living arrangements as well as her legal fees left her family in bad shape financially. Amanda’s parents also had their own brush with the law while in Italy: At one point Amanda’s mother and father were charged with slander for alleging that police abused their daughter while interrogating her about Kercher’s murder.

Like the Knoxes Bill Baker visits his daughter in prison in Marseille frequently so much so that the staff at the hotel where he stays know him well. Over the course of the film he ends up moving to Marseille permanently for a time. Allison’s grandmother is in poor health and unable to visit so Bill is all she has. It is clear that Allison’s case has put a strain on their already-strapped family. In the movie it is mentioned that Bill once punched a journalist over frustration with the case and how his daughter was being treated.

Time in Prison

While Amanda Knox was in prison she kept busy in a variety of ways which she wrote about in her 2013 memoir: She studied Italian kept a diary exercised hung out with the toddler child of another inmate as well as the prison’s chaplain and she helped fellow inmates by writing and translating for them.

We know less about how Allison spent her time in prison but it comes up that she used to work in the library and no longer does as the events of the film begin. It’s unclear if she worked on improving her French while in prison or came into it with a good command of the language but she can read and write in the language and by the time she gets a parole day to spend away from prison her French is good enough to impress the woman Bill is living with and her daughter.

Knox has said she considered suicide while in prison; in the movie Allison attempts to hang herself after the conditional day release.

Falling in Love With a Local Hot Lady

There is no public record of Curt Knox falling in love with a local hot lady while spending time in Italy to visit his daughter and support her during her trial. In contrast much of the plot of Stillwater is devoted to Bill Baker meeting and falling in love with a local hot lady while staying in Marseille for his daughter and her case.

Happy (?) Ending

After a four-year ordeal in Italy upon her release from prison Amanda Knox got a hero’s welcome back to the United States in 2011. Allison is also eventually released after some questionable heroics from Bill and receives a town fair upon her return to Oklahoma. I won’t tell you the final twist but given how much it veers away from the Knox story it probably won’t come as a surprise that the movie’s ultimate resolution is a little more dramatic than what happened after Knox came home.",,,

According to new research report - HD Map for Autonomous Vehicles Market by solution LOA usage vehicle type services and region – global forecast to 2030 by MarketsandMarkets the market is estimated to be $ 1.4 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 31.7% during the forecast period.

In addition increasing R&D activities related to HD maps by leading HD map suppliers and several startups will further fuel the growth of HD Maps for the Autonomous Vehicle Market. However high investment costs and slow adoption rates in developing countries are considered the major restraints for this market.

Some of the key players in the HD Maps for Autonomous Vehicles Market include TomTom HERE Technologies Waymo NVIDIA Baidu Dynamic Map Platform NavInfo and Zenrin. According to the research firm these players have long-term supply contracts with leading automotive manufacturers and autonomous vehicle technology developers. In addition these companies have adopted the strategies of new product developments acquisitions agreements collaborations expansions joint ventures partnerships and supply contracts to gain traction in the HD map for the autonomous vehicle market.

Adoption in the passenger mobility segment

Personal mobility is estimated to be the largest segment of the HD map for the autonomous vehicle market by usage type due to the higher volume of semi-autonomous vehicle sales. Most semi-autonomous vehicles are used for personal transportation.

MarketsandMarkets states that OEMs such as Honda Nissan General Motors and Mercedes-Benz promote the use of HD map and use it to develop its Level-2 and Level-3 semi-autonomous vehicles.

Commercial mobility

The commercial mobility segment is projected to be the fastest-growing because of the high demand for ridesharing services predominant usage of autonomous vehicles for ridesharing and robo-taxi services and growing partnership between ride-sharing companies and HD map providers.

The transportation of goods by autonomous vehicles helps minimise the cost of delivery. E-commerce companies primarily drive the delivery of goods by autonomous vehicles. According to companies like Continental 80% of all business-to-consumer deliveries will be done by driverless cars in the future. OEMs autonomous vehicle technology providers and logistics/transportation companies such as Pony.ai FedX and Ford are involved in testing autonomous last delivery vehicles worldwide. For example in June 2021 Ford and Hermes a consumer delivery company in the UK started testing autonomous vehicles for delivery. HD mapping companies can focus on developing HD maps and other related solutions for the commercial mobility segment as it can provide high growth opportunities especially for new entrants observes the research firm.

Largest and the fastest

According to MarketsandMarkets the HD map market for Level-2 and Leven-3 semi-autonomous vehicles is estimated to be the largest market and the market for Level 4 and Leven-5 autonomous vehicles is expected to be the fastest-growing market during the forecast period.

The semi-autonomous vehicle segment dominates because of the demand for features such as Co-operative Adaptive Cruise Control Highway Autopilot Auto Lane Change and Hands-free Auto Parking. Other factors include stringent laws concerning autonomous driving and more semi-autonomous vehicles on the road than autonomous vehicles during the forecast period. Rapid advancements and the decreasing cost of ADAS components and solutions are expected to spur the growth of the HD map market for semi-autonomous vehicles. For example ZF unveiled its coASSIST Level-2+ driving system in 2020 with a price range of $ 1000. Such affordable ADAS solutions would increase the penetration of major ADAS features in a standard ADAS package the report states. In addition ZF offers copilot a scalable ADAS solution for Level-2+ to Level-4 driving systems which was co-developed with NVIDIA. These affordable ADAS solutions would significantly boost ADAS adoption and the demand for HD maps for semi-autonomous vehicles.

Continuous improvement

The continuous improvement in HD map technology is also a significant factor boosting the growth of the market. In addition increasing investments for the development and testing of Level-4 and Level-5 technologies will drive the HD map market for autonomous vehicles adds the report.

Asia Oceania to grow faster

According to MarketsandMarkets the Asia Oceania region is projected to be the fastest-growing HD map market for autonomous vehicles during the forecast period. Asia Oceania region comprises countries such as China Japan India and South Korea. The factors that could contribute to the region's growth are the presence of leading HD map providers such as AutoNavi NavInfo and Momenta and the changing regulations concerned with autonomous driving.

MapmyIndia is the leading HD mapping solution provider for the Indian market which serves top companies such as BMW Ford Hyundai etc. The growing technological advancements and economic activities in China have increased the demand for semi-autonomous vehicles. The partnerships of the top HD mapping companies in this region such as NavInfo and Momenta with leading companies like HERE Ambarella and Analog Devices can also boost the growth of the HD map market in Asia Oceania the research firm noticed.

The popular investment firm sold 63643 shares estimated to be worth about $43.7 million in the Elon Musk-led company on a day Wood said Tesla will follow Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in capturing the lion's share of the sector's profits.

Wood compared Tesla with Apple in an interview with RealVision and suggested a huge inefficiency in analyst research behind Tesla as reported by Markets Insider.

“We believe that the reason there's such a big inefficiency in Tesla's valuation is the short-term time horizon of analysts and the wrong analysts following it” Woods said as per the report.

Square just bought it for $29 billion,"New York CNN Business —

Jack Dorsey’s Square (SQ) is spending $29 billion on an Australian buy now pay later firm — a massive purchase that will help his company build out its global payments empire.

Square — the financial payments company known for its popular Cash App — said it plans to merge Afterpay with its existing apps. That will give “even the smallest of merchants” the ability offer buy now pay later services at checkout among other offerings.

The acquisition is Square’s largest ever.

Afterpay was founded in 2015 and launched in America in 2018. It’s best known for its buy now pay later offerings — a service that allows customers to divide retail and online payments into installments.

Such offerings have grown in popularity as a way to reach younger consumers and keep up with the rapid shift to online shopping in the pandemic. Payment analysts have pointed to the trend as particularly popular among Millennials and Generation Z who are wary of taking on credit card debt.

Afterpay meanwhile is among the most prominent companies in the space. Square says 100000 merchants globally use the platform and that it has more than 16 million customers.

Square said it expects the all-stock deal to close in the first quarter of 2022. The acquisition is not only Square’s largest ever but it’s also the largest acquisition of an Australian company ever — according to data from Refinitiv.

Dorsey who serves as Square’s CEO in addition to Twitter (TWTR)’s said Square and Afterpay have a “shared purpose.”

“We built our business to make the financial system more fair accessible and inclusive and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles” he said in a statement. “Together we can better connect our Cash App and Seller ecosystems to deliver even more compelling products and services for merchants and consumers putting the power back in their hands.”

Afterpay co-CEOs Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar said the move “marks an important recognition of the Australian technology sector as homegrown innovation continues to be shared more broadly throughout the world.”

“By combining with Square we will further accelerate our growth in the U.S. and globally offer access to a new category of in-person merchants and provide a broader platform of new and valuable capabilities and services to our merchants and consumers” they said in a statement.

Square has been in acquisition mode this year. Back in March it agreed to acquire a majority stake in Jay-Z’s streaming music service Tidal for $297 million. And in July it acquired frontline employee platform Crew though details of the purchase were not available.

The Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ) has a number of compelling reasons to consider it as a long-term investment.

It's one of the larger exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with net assets almost $2.1 billion.

This investment is provided by BetaShares one of the biggest providers of ETFs in Australia.

But size is not one of the key factors why it could be worth considering Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF.

Here are three to think about:

Diversification

The S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) is dominated by two industries: financials and resources. Within that there are a few sizeable businesses including Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) Westpac Banking Corp (ASX: WBC) BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) and Rio Tinto Limited (ASX: RIO).

But the Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF is very different. It has 100 non-financial businesses in its portfolio. Resources don't feature in the portfolio either. Almost half of the portfolio is classified as 'information technology' with another 19.7% in 'communication services' and 17.3% in 'consumer discretionary'.

But those classifications may not be exactly what you're thinking. Amazon and Tesla count as consumer discretionary businesses whilst Alphabet (Google) and Facebook count as communication services businesses.

Not only can an investor get exposure to 100 businesses outside of the ASX but those underlying earnings are being generated from right across the world. Think how many countries there are where people can use Google Search. Facebook is also in most countries in the world. And so on.

High-quality businesses

But this ETF isn't just about diversification for the sake of being different.

Many of the businesses in the Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF portfolio are among the best if not the best at what they do.

Apple is one of the global leaders in smartphones computers and the extra services it offers. Microsoft is very strong in numerous categories like office software cloud computing and gaming. Amazon has online retail cloud computing and so on.

However there are quite a few great companies in there not just the 'FAANG' shares.

PayPal is a huge player in the payments and online retail space. Adobe has a number of important offerings.

Broadcom Qualcomm Texas Instruments Intuit Moderna Applied Materials Advanced Micro Devices Intuitive Surgical Zoom and so on.

There are so many quality names in the portfolio that are generating strong profit growth and creating very powerful economic moats.

Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF's strong returns with a reasonable fee

Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF has an annual management fee of 0.48%.

The portfolio of quality names has produced sizeable returns over the shorter-term and longer-term.

However it's important to note that past performance is not an indicator of future performance.

Over the last 12 months the ETF has seen a net return of 31.6%. Since inception in May 2015 Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF has delivered an average return per annum of 22.5%.

However investors will have to wait and see what the next few years of returns looks like.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MxMzg1ODk0NzIwMzQxODk50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smart gripper based on electric-triggered superhydrophobic polyurethane arrays coated bucky gel composite ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385894720341899 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MxMzg1ODk0NzIwMzQxODk50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K proxy filing or by doing your own similarity analysis.

According to Benzinga Pro Arthur J. Gallagher's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 3.76% which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.

Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.

Ils ont été évacués.

Depuis plusieurs mois deux immeubles menacent de s’effondrer rue des Filatiers à Toulouse. Informée la municipalité a d’emblée défini un périmètre assurant ainsi la sécurité des passants et la sécurisation du bâti. La municipalité a aussi mis en œuvre une procédure de péril imminent avec interdiction d’habitation dans les appartements des immeubles 12 et 14 de cette rue du quartier des Carmes. Après expertise il a été reconnu qu’un risque d’effondrement était possible : l’ensemble des habitants a été évacué ainsi que les deux commerces situés sur la rue : un chocolatier- glacier et un restaurant indien. « Cela fait déjà plusieurs mois que cette situation perdure admet David Angeli gérant du glacier Bello & Angeli l’une des deux enseignes concernées. En cause la dégradation du mur mitoyen entre les deux immeubles ».

Ce commerçant tout comme son collègue cumule une perte de chiffre d’affaires important : « Nous espérons normalement des indemnités mais nous devons attendre l’avis définitif des experts ».

Ce problème qui touche les quartiers historiques du centre-ville est récurrent : début 2019 allées Jules Guesde (mur médiéval) fin 2019 rue Cujas (toiture) rue Temponières fin juin 2020 rue de la Fonderie rue des Filatiers. Sans oublier la rue d’Austerlitz à Victor – Hugo où en 2014 trois immeubles (46 et 8) avaient dû être évacués ainsi que trois commerces (le pressing O Fer Bistro d’Austerlitz et Asia Delice). Plusieurs raisons étaient alors invoquées dont la dégradation du système des eaux usées qui avait raviné les fondations de l’immeuble causant un déséquilibre des charges et son affaissement.

Sept ans après Thibaud ancien gérant du Bistro d’Austerlitz témoigne : « Je n’ai eu qu’une partie des indemnités car le procès intenté aux différents corps de métier pour malfaçons n’est pas encore achevé».

Un arrêté d’interdiction d’habiter depuis début 2021

En matière d’immeubles anciens y aurait-il péril en la demeure sur le centre-ville de Toulouse ? En 2020 le service communal chargé de la sécurité des bâtiments a enregistré 186 signalements contre 116 deux ans plus tôt. Depuis le début de l’année ce chiffre atteint déjà les 41 signalements. Ce chiffre en hausse est lié à l’angoisse des habitants depuis le drame de la rue d’Aubagne à Marseille en 2018.

« Dès que nous sommes informés nous nous rendons sur place assurait-il y a peu Claire Nison conseillère municipale chargée de ce dossier au Capitole. Bien souvent rien n’est grave. La structure n’est pas endommagée. À chaque fois ce sont des bâtiments très anciens qui appartiennent à des propriétaires privés. Nous ne pouvons que les inciter à les entretenir"". Infiltrations travaux non conformes etc. sont les points noirs les plus classiques sur ces bâtiments anciens ne nécessitant pas d’arrêtés de péril imminent.

Depuis le début de l’année un arrêté de péril imminent et un arrêté d’interdiction d’habiter ont été notifiés par la municipalité toulousaine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1ZmZpbmd0b25wb3N0LmZyL3Nwb3J0L2FydGljbGUvbC1lcXVpcGUtZGUtZnJhbmNlLW1hc2N1bGluZS1kZS1mbGV1cmV0LW1lZGFpbGxlZS1kLW9yLWF1eC1qb18xODQ5OTQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L'équipe de France masculine de fleuret médaillée d'or aux JO,"MOHD RASFAN via AFP MOHD RASFAN via AFP

JEUX OLYMPIQUES - Le fleuret français en or! L’équipe de France masculine est devenue championne olympique en battant largement (45-28) les Russes concourant sous pavillon neutre aux JO de Tokyo ce dimanche 1er août en finale. C’est la 5e médaille d’or pour la délégation française dans ces Jeux.

Les fleurettistes français vice-champions olympiques à Rio en 2016 et vice-champions du monde en 2019 s’étaient qualifiés en battant quelques heures plus tôt le Japon 45 à 42 assurant ainsi une 21e médaille à la France à Tokyo.

Le dernier titre pour le fleuret masculin par équipes remontait à Sydney-2000. En individuel le meilleur Tricolore à Tokyo a été Enzo Lefort sorti en quarts de finale par l’Italien Daniele Garrozzo champion olympique à Rio-2016 et médaille d’argent cette année.

La démission d’Olivier Duriez représentant la communauté scientifique lors du dernier comité interdépartemental Massif central vautour élevage témoigne des tensions entre le monde de l’élevage et spécialistes des vautours. ""Jamais dans un comité la parole scientifique n’a été aussi peu écoutée même pas demandée voire décrédibilisée"" déclare le conseiller scientifique ornithologue qui ajoute : ""C’est dans la suite logique des précédentes réunions de ce comité ou autres réunions publiques sur ce sujet auxquelles j’ai participé depuis deux ans.""

Pour rappel ce comité interdépartemental couvre six départements (l’Ardèche l’Aveyron le Gard l’Hérault la Lozère et le Tarn) dans le cadre du plan national d’actions (PNA) ""Vautour fauve et activités d’élevage"" 2017-2026 qui vise à résoudre la question des interactions entre le vautour fauve et le bétail pour préserver la relation entre éleveurs et vautours et sa restauration sur les territoires où elle s’est dégradée ces derniers mois. Le ticket gagnant gagnant du moins l’entente cordiale entre les éleveurs fournissant une ressource alimentaire essentielle et les vautours assurant en retour un équarrissage naturel et écologique est en effet mis à mal par une partie de la profession agricole qui s’inquiète notamment de la présence du vautour sur le Nord-Aveyron et leurs interactions sur les animaux.

Sur ce point le scientifique déplore ""la place prépondérante laissée aux interventions de la profession agricole au détriment de celle accordée aux institutions de l’État aux services vétérinaires aux associations de protection de la nature et aux scientifiques"" et avance des faits non vérifiés. Chiffres à l’appui : la situation n’est guère différente de la précédente campagne de 156 constats et 82 expertises vétérinaires menées dans les Causses entre 2007 et 2014 et le risque de 01 % avec deux cas avérés d’interaction par an sur des animaux mourants alors que 40 000 bêtes meurent par an sur la région des Grands Causses. Le changement notable s’opère sur le délai d’intervention des charognards passé de jours voire d’heures à quelques minutes. D’où la nécessité d’expliquer le fonctionnement des curées et des interactions du vautour. En ce sens Olivier Duriez préconise une meilleure communication en diffusant au plus tôt les expertises vétérinaires et de mettre des moyens plus conséquents sur la sensibilisation (lire ci-contre) et de reprendre l’installation de placettes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZnIuc2FoYXJhbWVkaWFzLm5ldC9tYXVyaXRhbmllLXVlLXJlbm91dmVsbGVtZW50LWRlLWxhY2NvcmQtZGUtcGFydGVuYXJpYXQtZGFucy1sZS1kb21haW5lLWRlLWxhLXBlY2hlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mauritanie-UE : renouvellement de l’accord de partenariat dans le domaine de la pêche,"Mauritanie-UE : renouvellement de l’accord de partenariat dans le domaine de la pêche

“Mr. Kellyanne Conway celebrating my Victory in 2016!” Trump posted Thursday.

One photo showed Conway wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat with his wife former top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway and another showed him filming Trump with a crowd of supporters.

Conway who announced his divorce from Kellyanne Conway last year has become a frequent Trump critic.

While Kellyanne Conway remained loyal to Trump throughout his time in office he went on to fund The Lincoln Project with several other Republicans who were opposed to Trump and looking to keep him from securing a second term.

Since then the two have been battling it out on air and online criticizing one another. Conway a conservative lawyer has frequently commented on Trump’s web of legal battles.

In an interview last Thursday Conway dismissed Trump’s claims that he was not sleeping in court after reporters noticed Trump appeared to doze off during his hush money trial in New York.

Conway slammed Trump’s reputation for not arriving to Trump Tower before 11 a.m. as well as the at White House because he “wasn’t an early riser.” The court is requiring the former president to be in-person early in the morning.

In January Trump walked out of the courtroom when closing arguments began in his defamation case against writer E. Jean Carroll.

Now he must sit in court and restrain his comments because of a gag order and Conway said he doesn’t think Trump has the “complete ability to control himself.”

Rory McIlroy made a subtel change to his golf ball for this week's Wells Fargo Championship TaylorMade Golf

This week the Wells Fargo Championship marks the final PGA Tour event before the PGA Championship next week at Valhalla and some players have been making small changes to their gear leading up to the year’s second major championship — including Rory McIlroy.

The difference is that Rory’s most recent change has nothing to do with performance and has everything to do with how he marks his TaylorMade TP5x golf balls.

With the help of TaylorMade’s MySymbol program and custom printing abilities Rory has gone from using a traditional number on his golf ball to using a TP5x marked with RORS. This not only makes identifying his golf ball a lot easier but it also means that the only other marking he has to make on his golf ball is the putting alignment line that runs through the side stamp.

Rory isn’t the only one either.

Collin Morikawa who is also currently sitting tied for second at 4-under with Rory McIlroy and Alex Noren also utilizes the My Symbol printing capabilities by using a number 5 done in L.A. Dodgers font.

The only other mark Rory puts on his golf balls is a line along the side stamp. TaylorMade golf

TaylorMade MySymbol

TaylorMade’s My Symbol program has been a huge hit with pro golfers and consumers alike since its introduction in 2023 and they continue to push the envelope when it comes to golf ball customization.

“Personalization and customization is on the rise and it’s not just in golf” says Mike Fox senior director of product creation for TaylorMade’s golf ball category. “With MySymbol we not only wanted to meet demand but exceed expectations as well. That doesn’t come with just adding different logos on a golf ball. It comes with years of machinery development to put logos in places where they haven’t been before. It’s a fully designed product where you can choose the color of your TaylorMade logo the logo underneath it as well as where it goes. MySymbol is truly allowing golfers to take your ball customization somewhere it’s never been before.”

Some of those customization options have included TaylorMade’s limited drops of pix golf balls that have included peaches donuts and even tacos.

TaylorMade’s printing sysyem allows for a lot of customization options including tacos TaylorMade Golf

The best part is you don’t need to be Rory McIlroy or Collin Morikawa to get your golf balls customized with a logo or 4-letter stamp. All you need to do is head to the Taylormade.com MySymbol portal to get started.

More women becoming single parents by choice

New York City — Up against her biological clock Traci Kodeck faced a tough decision at age 39.

She says she remembered the moment she decided to have a baby on her own.

""I was with my best friend and I said 'I don't have a partner I need to be a mom'"" Kodeck told CBS News.

She emptied her savings to cover fertility treatments ultimately using sperm donated by a friend. After three years of trying she had Zola.

""Then it was 'Oh my gosh I'm taking home a human.' And she was perfect"" Kodeck said.

Kodeck belongs to the organization Single Mothers by Choice. Its 30000 members are part of a growing trend of women having babies alone because they're tired of waiting for ""the one"" or they simply want to parent solo like Emma Ramos mother to 2-year-old Michael.

She describes her life as a single mother by choice as ""beautiful chaos.""

As a teenager Ramos dreamed of having a child not a partner. Modern attitudes have helped make that possible. According to a Pew Research Center survey from last year 78% of Americans find single parenting acceptable. Although more 93% support a two-parent household.

""That speaks to the misconception...that we have somehow purposefully handicapped our children by…only bringing them into the world with one parent"" Ramos said.

Ramos admits that the responsibility of shouldering the decision-making for her family does come with challenges.

""Decision-making I would say is a blessing"" Ramos said. ""But then I suppose if I make the wrong decision I'm the only one…to blame I guess.""

Zola Kodeck recently turned 11 just in time for Mother's Day.

""Having a single mom by choice can be hard like when you're first growing up but then my mom just wanted me nobody else"" Zola said. ""…Every day to me is like a Mother's Day.""

""Everything I do I do for her"" Traci said of her daughter. ""This house is for her. My job it's all for her.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9tb3RoZXJzLWRheS1sdW5jaC1jaHJpcy1hbGxlbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos of his mom at lunch are a balm people didn't know they needed,"Photos of his mom at lunch are a balm people didn’t know they needed

The cell harvesting process also requires pre-flushing of depth filters (which are the typical workhorse of cell harvesting) to bring the total organic carbon (TOC) values down to acceptable values Kumar says.

Exposure of samples to changes in temperature when manually moving from one process to the next (e.g. refrigerated centrifuging to keep samples chilled when processing)

Technical equipment or processing issues continue to pose challenges for cell harvesting. Most bottlenecks arise from manual processes during cell harvesting says Charlie Duncheon CEO co-founder and chairman of the board at Celltrio a manufacturer of automation-based solutions for the life sciences industry. Duncheon says that manual processes are often still a concern in systems defined in semi-automated systems. He points out the following bottlenecks associated with manual steps:

Fortunately improvements in harvesting technologies such as centrifugation depth filtration and membranes have aided in easing this bottleneck. Further innovations to answer the drive for increased automation in bioprocessing are also leading to enhancements in how cell harvesting technologies can be streamlined and increase product recovery.

Cell harvesting is the start of the downstream separation process to recover the therapeutic biologic product from the bioreactor following cell culture and cell lysis. Over the years improvements in upstream cell culturing processes have resulted in significant increases in product titer that tend to create a bottleneck at the point of harvest.

“Significant time is spent in installation of multiple depth filter modules and then removal of process solution-soaked depth filter modules which are typically heavy and messy at 20–25 lbs each” Kumar states.

Overcoming challenges

Biomanufacturers have traditionally overcome cell harvesting challenges with extensive manual labor from both scientists and technicians says Duncheon. “This [approach] is expensive and subject to human error resulting in delayed timelines. We have seen a trend in the lab where some of the steps are automated combined with manual steps” he states.

“We believe the real opportunity is to integrate all cell line processes using one automated contained platform that maintains the digital record with automatic data logging data import/export traceability and reporting” Duncheon adds.

Kumar notes that companies are taking multiple approaches to address the challenges posed by cell harvesting. He points out a new technology introduced by Repligen a novel tangential flow depth filtration (TFDF) technology that offers a significant reduction in filter sizing and eliminates the need for pre/post flush treatment. In addition the TFDF technology enables closed processing using a single-use filter assembly that replaces the primary clarification Kumar says.

“Depth filter suppliers are working on developing new depth filters that will reduce the number of filter modules required to process batches. There are also new single-use centrifuges designed to provide for closed single-use processing” Kumar adds.

Automation as an asset

Automation is an asset to overcome bottlenecking at the cell harvest step. For instance by providing 24 hour/7-days-a-week operation automation can be scheduled in an optimum manner after scientists (remotely) download protocols and allows them to run the process as well as to connect every step of the cell harvesting process Duncheon explains.

“Using robots to transfer samples from one process to the next and automatically sharing process data and setup information accelerates knowledge transfer and ensures consistency and uniformity” Duncheon states. “More efficient transfers reduce exposure to open air and sample exposure to temperature.”

Duncheon also says that the greatest gains in efficiency will come from fully automating the entire process of cell culturing and harvesting which will establish a standard platform that will provide a digital footprint. For example Celltrio’s automation platform RoboCell is built on the company’s standard task modules and this design provides flexibility and scalability which can allow easy integration of all cell line development processes into one solution. Duncheon lists the various standard task modules in Celltrio’s portfolio which include the following:

Liquid handling (Robo-LH)

Incubation and cell culturing (Robo-I)

Cell counting confluence and viability inspection (RoboReader)

Centrifuge harvesting (Robo-C)

Cryogenic storage and retrieval of samples (RoboStor).

Because the cell harvesting process typically involves operations comprising multiple steps (e.g. pre-flush harvest processing and post-use product recovery steps) that are performed in manual and semi-automated mode there is a desire to automate which will enable faster processing and less operator dependance Kumar comments.

Automated processing

In a 2015 study that compared automated versus manual downstream processing the performance of automated harvesting and tandem purification was compared to those of manual processing including manual harvesting and two-step purification. The results indicated that recovery of product was significantly higher using automated processes compared to manual and product quality was consistent the quality seen in manual processes (1).

The researchers noted that by setting up an automated system for in-line cell harvesting and purification they were able to reduce their downstream bottlenecks. The researchers concluded that automated processes eliminate subjective user decisions which in turn minimized waste and potential contamination while improving process yields and process reproducibility (1).

Transition to automation

Today the transition to automated cell harvesting remains an growing trend says Duncheon. He also notes that automated cell harvesting is gaining more interest because of process efficiency gains and attractive payback.

As the transition continues the cell harvesting process is currently carried out with a mix of manual and automated systems notes Kumar. “Currently there are limited processes that utilize automated processes. There is a desire to go more toward automated processes and minimize the manual operation and new technology such as TFDF is designed to have thatautomated processing concept in mind” he states.

“We believe two-dimensional cell growth and cell harvest are fully developed from companies [such as] Celltrio” adds Duncheon. “We are committed to further innovating the cell harvesting process as we continue to examine 3D cell growth microfiltration and depth filtration [and other processes].”

We used the XGBoost method in the identification of the most predictive factors of HIV positivity which delivered better results than the other five algorithms with f1 scores on the sample test of 90% and 92% when all variables are included in males and females respectively.

The method enabled us to establish the most predictive features for HIV status in both sexes: age relationship with the head of the family ever enrolled in school the highest level of education highest grade at that school level work for payment in the last 12 months wether avoiding pregnancy age at first sex experienced ever sought TB treatment frequency of alcohol drinking urban area indicator wealth quintile number of pregnancies number of births since 2012 marital status and circumcision status.

The course of the association between predictor features and HIV status of individuals was determined through the use of XGBoost along with SHAP plots and illustrated specific feature importance to give an intuitive understanding of the key features. The age of an individual has the highest overall impact on HIV status than other features and any change of age can have a more remarkable influence than others. More aged individuals have a higher probability of infection in both sexes. Several of those avoiding pregnancy by various methods stand a higher chance of contracting the disease in both sexes. Potential reasons for this may be an increased exposure to sex making them more vulnerable. The majority of those living in urban regions seemed to be more exposed to the disease than their counterparts living in rural areas. Those with a little level of education have low knowledge of mitigation measures of HIV risk and pose a greater risk of HIV in both sexes. HIV positivity is associated with a higher number of those seeking TB treatment; a low CD4 count from HIV patients are at a much higher risk of falling ill from TB infection than those who are negative. Similarly being uncircumcised exposes males to the disease which is consistent with studies by [45] while in females alone being exposed to sex at an older age attaining higher grade at school an increase in the number of children born may lead to a reduction of HIV positivity. Our results are consistent with those of [46] that indicated literacy and urbanity as strong predictors of HIV acquisition and Sing et al. which found that urban dwellers may increase HIV positivity through more contact with high-risk sexual individuals than rural residents [47]. Age a little level of education and gender being predictors of the disease assert the findings in [48 49].

A 95% sensitivity was required in ensuring that 95% of individuals living with HIV knew their status. With the XGBoost algorithm we utilized 15 and 12 most predictive variables of males and females accordingly to establish 5 and 19 the number required to screen to know one individual with HIV in males and females respectively. These are within the range of 3 to 86 and 4 to 154 for community-based and facility-based screening respectively given in previous studies [50]. We identified 4·14% males and 10.81% females as a high-risk population in the second situation which is consistent with previous studies that indicated that about seven women get new infections with HIV for every four men infected [51 52]. In general female performance in all our algorithms was slightly higher than those of males in this study. Our method borrows heavily from Orel's approach in predictor identification and they both choose the Xgboost model algorithm as the best performing model among the alternatives. Our results on the other hand show different predictors than those found in Orel's research with the exception that they both found individual age and wealth as predictors of the disease [29].

Other screening methods exist but they are not without drawbacks. Universal screening in which patients are given tests on health care facilities is limited to a poor cost–benefit ratio in low HIV incidence situations [53]. While indicator-condition-guided testing based on specific medical conditions ignores factors such as age sex and medical conditions which have all been linked to a lower risk of HIV transmission [54]. In generalized epidemic settings a focus on well-known risk groups such as serodiscordant spouses and young women can effectively reach high-risk individuals [55] but may overlook less well-known or easily defined subgroups at risk [56] resulting in inefficient resource allocation [57]. Despite the absence of a recognized risk factor self-assessment is one method of recognizing individuals at high risk. However an individual's risk perception is influenced by their HIV-related awareness and unanticipated or uncontrolled exposures can go undetected [58]. According to WHO guidelines PrEP should be targeted at subpopulations considered to be at high risk of HIV infection [59]. However in the context of a widespread outbreak the best demographic subgroups to target may not be obvious and merely providing PrEP to established high-risk subgroups like young people or mobile populations may be ineffective. As a result a PrEP technique based on more subtle use of individual characteristics may be able to reduce the cost of preventing a new HIV infection. Our method provides an alternative to some of the drawbacks listed above as well as a potential complementary method for identifying people who may gain most from enhanced mitigation strategies. One limitation of this study is the validity of our model. There was a high degree of missingness and inconclusiveness from self-reported data that potentially impacted the training data.

Our conclusion might reveal the social-behavioural identification of HIV and can enhance screening approaches in limited resources situations. There is a need to adapt HIV screening strategies that better target the adult population those using contraceptives urban dwellers the little educated population TB patients and uncircumcised men. There is an increased number of available surveys with individual-level data that is rich in demographic characteristics social history laboratory tests and results of various diseases. More advanced approaches to utilize them can effectively assist in preventing diagnosing and testing HIV and other diseases. Community-based or facility-based testing programs could incorporate this approach in practice to identify high-risk individuals. However additional studies are needed to further optimize this model integrate and apply them into a real-world primary care setting. This may also disclose individuals who may need PrEP among other risk reduction strategies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2lyZS5pbi90cmFkZS9jaGluZXNlLWltcG9ydHMtYXRtYW5pcmJoYXItYmhhcmF0LXRyYWRl0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9tLnRoZXdpcmUuaW4vYXJ0aWNsZS90cmFkZS9jaGluZXNlLWltcG9ydHMtYXRtYW5pcmJoYXItYmhhcmF0LXRyYWRlL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heavy Reliance on High-Value Chinese Imports Indicates We Need an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ Review,,,,

A form of directional drilling ERD is also being used increasingly to tap into hard-to-produce reservoirs making viable projects that might otherwise be written off as noncommercial.

This article highlights how the Russian Far East became the ERD epicenter in the past decade given ExxonMobil and Rosneft’s extensive use of ERD in developing Arctic resources offshore Sakhalin Island and how ERD is becoming more widely used in regions as diverse as the Gulf of Thailand offshore Brazil and the Arab Gulf.

By definition an extended-reach well (ERW) is one in which the ratio of the measured depth (MD) vs. the true vertical depth (TVD) is at least 2:1 (PetroWiki). An ERW differs from a horizontal well in that the ERW is a high-angle directional well drilled to intersect a target point a feat requiring specialized planning to execute well construction.

ExxonMobil subsidiary Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL) which operates the Sakhalin-1 license area offshore Russia’s Sakhalin Island (Fig. 1) has been pushing the limits of ERD for nearly 2 decades with innovative technologies and sophisticated well planning making the Sea of Okhotsk a place where any ERD drilling record set today may easily be broken tomorrow.

Russia’s state-owned Rosneft (which has a 20% stake in Sakhalin-1) owns bragging rights for having drilled the longest ERW well on record to date. Rosneft announced in November 2017 it had drilled a 15000-m horizontal ERW from the offshore Orlan gravity-base platform at Chayvo field situated in 14 m water depth in the Sea of Okhotsk topping four previous records set between 2013 and 2015 that had reached between 12450 m and 13500 m (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2—The Orlan offshore platform in 2017 drilled the longest O-5RD ERD well with a measured depth of 15000 m. Source: Exxon Neftegas Limited.

In a news release at the time Rosneft called the well “super complex with a DDI [directional drilling index] of 8.0 and a 14129-m stepout.” The release went on to say that the Sakhalin-1 Consortium could (as of the 2017 announcement) claim to have drilled nine out of the world’s 10 longest ERD wells.

According to Rosneft the project had set five world records for measured depth of wells between 2013 and 2017. In April 2015 development well O-14 was drilled with a length of 13500 m. That broke a 2014 record when the 13000‑m Z-40 well was completed. In 2013 records were announced for wells Z-43 and Z-42 which were drilled respectively in April and in June 2013 with lengths of 12450 m and 12700 m.

Rosneft credited ExxonMobil’s patented “Fast Drill” drilling optimization process that can increase rates of penetration (ROP) by up to 400% as a significant innovation contributing to the ERD success story at Sakhalin-1.

One of the largest foreign direct investments in Russia Sakhalin-1 operates under a production sharing agreement (PSA) with its license area off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island comprising the Chayvo Odoptu and Arkutun Dagi fields.

ENL holds a 30% stake in Sakhalin-1 as project operator; its partners include two affiliates of Rosneft (RN-Astra 8.5% and Sakhalinmorneftegaz-Shelf 11.5%); Japan’s SODECO Consortium 20%; and India’s state-owned ONGC Videsh Limited 30%.

SPE/IADC 119373 presented at the 2009 SPE/IADC Drilling Conference offered a case study in the drilling of one of the early record breakers the Chayvo Z-12 well and detailed the well design and operational practices that enabled Sakhalin-1 to initially increase well reach to more than 10.5 km.

The first of the Sakhalin-1 fields to be developed Chayvo is described by the paper’s authors as “a gas-filled structural anticline with an oil rim.” Drillers first targeted the oil rim “using ERD techniques including horizontal completions up to approximately 3700 m in length from the Yastreb [drilling rig] land location [on Sakhalin Island] and from the Orlan offshore concrete island drilling and production platform [a gravity-base structure) offshore on Chayvo]” according to the authors.

Employing ERD to draw down Chayvo’s oil rim and generate cash flow from oil sales laid at the heart of the consortium’s business strategy from the beginning. Drilling ERWs from onshore to offshore targets helped sidestep at first some costs of having to work offshore in the Sea of Okhotsk with its punishing 1.5-m-thick ice sheets high seas and –40°C temperatures.

Now after nearly 20 years ENL and its partners are preparing to switch into gas production. By late this decade Rosneft and ExxonMobil expect to commission the first train of the Far East LNG plant to be constructed near the De-Kastri oil export terminal in the Khabarovsk region across the Tartar Strait from Sakhalin Island.

The Russian government greenlighted the project in the past year though the partners have yet to make a final investment decision.

Parker Drilling engineered and built the Yastreb (Russian for “hawk”) exclusively for Sakhalin-1 to drill ERWs to offshore targets from land. Yastreb at the time was the world’s largest onshore drilling rig. Today however the Krechet on Sakhalin’s Odoptu field has taken over as the largest land rig that drills ERD wells to offshore targets according to ENL’s website.

The consortium now is producing also from the Arkutun-Dagi field from a second gravity-base structure the Berkut.

Applying ERD to Mature Fields in the Gulf of Thailand

Meanwhile in the tropics Mubadala Petroleum (Thailand) Ltd. set its own “longest-ever” ERD completion in the Gulf of Thailand while researching the applicability of drilling ERWs to develop marginal oil reserves in the hard-to-produce reservoirs of the mature Jasmine offshore oilfield. Mubadala and Schlumberger coauthored IPTC 21488 presented at the 2021 International Petroleum Technology Conference which noted that the “riskiest prospects in the Jasmine field are undeveloped thin oil-rim accumulations below thick gas caps” not unlike the situation in Sakhalin.

Previous failed attempts to produce these gas-cap reservoirs by drilling deviated wells resulted in booking the reserves as “contingent resources” because of thin oil columns the low volume of oil in place and inefficiencies in recovery the authors noted.

Mubadala a wholly owned subsidiary of Mubadala Investment Company (owned by the government of Abu Dhabi) successfully drilled experimental ERD wells in Jasmine’s challenging thick gas cap and thin-oil-column reservoirs in 2017. This was followed by a second campaign from February to August 2019.

The authors noted in their paper that “the Jasmine field is a mature sophisticated oil field with many shallow reservoir targets that require a minimum 10000-ft [3048-m] horizontal displacement.”

Mubadala drilled research Well X from the Jasmine-C platform (Fig. 3). The authors describe the well as “a three-string design structure with an 11¾-in. top hole an 8½-in. intermediate section and a 6⅛-in. reservoir horizontal section.” Well X was constructed by utilizing an existing platform well slot. The challenge involved drilling from the top hole to the kickoff point and drilling directionally away from the casing stump of the existing well to avoid any collision with nearby wells emanating from the Jasmine-C platform.

Despite the challenges posed by the complex well profile lost circulation and control of torque and drag the well was completed successfully.

A total depth (TD) of 13052-ft MD was achieved to reach reservoirs at 3260-ft TVDSS. It was therefore announced in 2019 as a new ERD record for Mubadala Thailand (ERD ratio=3.26; directional difficulty index [DDI]=6.95) according to the authors. Full details describing how the well was drilled are available in the paper.

Offshore Brazil Equinor Taps Tricky Reservoirs

OTC 28091 coauthored by Baker Hughes and Statoil (now Equinor) and presented at the 2017 Offshore Technology Conference Brazil described the successful drilling of what was then Brazil’s longest horizontal section 2268 m inside a depleted reservoir.

Though the Peregrino project in the post-salt zone of the Campos Basin poses major challenges for drilling the authors credit their success to the use of a rotary-steerable system combined with a modular positive-displacement motor. The drilling scenario followed while geosteering was one of high torque low weight on bit and water-based drilling fluid without any trips to change the drill bit the authors wrote.

Equinor operates the Peregrino oil field which is located in licenses BM-C‑7 and BM-C-47 approximately 85 km offshore Brazil in the Campos Basin in water depths of 100 m. The second phase is expected to be developed at a cost of $3 billion and will start production in 2022 according to Equinor’s website.

Phase 2 envisions the drilling of horizontal production wells with artificial lift that will be provided by subsurface downhole electrical-submersible pumps (ESP) according to the paper’s authors.

Equinor a holds a 60% interest in what is its largest operated field outside of Norway. Sinochem is a minority partner in the concession which runs until 2040.

Island-Hopping Offshore Abu Dhabi in the Arab Gulf

Far from the icy Sea of Okhotsk ExxonMobil is applying its ERD technologies in the world’s second-largest offshore oil field the Upper Zakum field which lies offshore Abu Dhabi in the Arab Gulf.

ExxonMobil has a joint venture with field operator ADNOC Offshore; other shareholders include the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Japan’s JODCO.

To reach a production target of 1 million B/D by 2024 the partners are implementing a development plan that includes the drilling of extended reach wells of up to 6 miles long drilled from four artificial islands situated in the Gulf to achieve higher recovery while reducing costs and minimizing the operation’s effects on the environment according to ExxonMobil.

SPE 202717 presented at the 2020 Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference explains the technologies used to drill the UAE’s longest complex 3D ERD well on an artificial island using a slim casing design.

“This well was drilled with the objective to support the pressure sustainability of multiple producer wells across the Lukhweir-2 formation based on the ERD approach” the authors wrote adding that the ERD well had “a total measured depth of 27352 ft (8.34 km) and having a horizontal hole of 11300 ft (3.45 km reservoir contact) with directional difficulty index (DDI) of 7.208 using a light/slim casing design.”

Because of its effectiveness the ERD well saved the operator the cost of drilling three separate wells that would have normally supported the producer well. This amounted to a savings of $18 million according to the authors.

Italy's Marcell Jacobs produced a stunning upset to win the men's 100m final at Tokyo 2020.

Marcell posted a personal-best time of 9.80 to end the 13-year reign of retired Jamaica legend Usain Bolt as 100m Olympic champion.

USA's Fred Kerley and Canada's Andre De Grasse - who finished third of at Rio 2016 - also ran personal bests of 9.84 and 9.89 to claim the silver and bronze medals respectively.

China's Su Bingtian set an Asian record as he qualified fastest in the semi-finals with a formidable time of 9.83 but he was unable to replicate his heroics in the final with a disappointing sixth-place finish.

USA's Ronnie Baker went into the final as favourite but finished fifth with a time of 9.95.

Baker's compatriot Trayvon Bromell was tipped for 100m glory ahead of the Olympic Games but his time of 10 seconds flat was not enough to progress from the second semi-final which was won by Team GB's Zharnel Hughes with a time of 9.98.

But Hughes' hopes of gold in the final were over before they began due to a clear false start which saw him disqualified.

The other runner in the race Nigeria's Enoch Obaloluwa Adegoke appeared to suffer a muscle injury after the first 50 metres and did not finish.

USA legend Michael Johnson predicts a ""new world order"" of sprinters may come to the fore as the traditional heavyweights of athletics are toppled.

""It'll be interesting to see if there is a new world order with some of the things that we're seeing"" the four-time gold medalist told BBC Sport.

""This Olympics is a little bit strange so things may go back to how they were before.

""Or this may actually spur on some of these countries where we're seeing new talent come through to say 'hey we can do this at this level!'

""There's nothing like succeeding at the Olympics to give you that hope and confidence.""

Team GB hero Denise Lewis added: ""That was just a phenomenal piece of sprinting.

Were you surprised to see Jacobs take home gold? Comment below.

""Technically it was a beautiful transition and he just kept his form.

""Full credit to Lamont Marcell Jacobs. He's had a really good season and was getting better through the rounds so it's just rewards.""

Meanwhile former 400m gold-medalist Christine Ohuruogu admitted she thought Baker was a shoo-in for victory saying: ""This is what makes our sport so beautiful and what makes the Olympics come alive.

""I think you have seen the Olympic spirit I love my sport. What a result I would not have picked Jacobs to have let alone medalled my money was on Ronnie Baker.""",,,

Demand is set to surge on the back of climate-change investment and mega-producer China -- which accounts for more than half of global output -- is cracking down on smelting to reduce pollution and meet green targets.

Those combined forces mean the oversupply that's dominated the market for more than a decade is on the way out leaving buyers bracing for a new era of scarcity and higher costs. With aluminum a feature of everyday items from food packaging and beer cans to iPhones and cars what's playing out in markets has implications for inflation and consumers' pockets.

It's already jumped 26% this year to about $2500 a ton one the best performers on the London Metal Exchange. Goldman Sachs is among those seeing more gains ahead forecasting record prices above $3000 by late next year.

In the short term the global economy's post-pandemic rebound and demand in the automotive and construction industries are eating into inventories. But while in the past supply kept pace with additional demand that could change once China's cuts kick in leaving the market in a deep deficit by 2024 according to trading giant Trafigura Group.

""It takes quite a mindset change -- some viewed buying aluminum similar to buying groceries in the supermarket"" said Philippe Mueller head of aluminum trading at Trafigura. ""It's not going to work like this anymore.""

The metal isn't alone in facing short-term issues. The combination of soaring demand and spluttering supply after covid-19 disruption has upended many raw materials markets all of which is feeding the global inflation scare that's taken hold in some corners this year.

For aluminum China's actions are key. The government started cracking down in 2017 capping smelting capacity at 45 million tons a year and its subsequent carbon emissions targets have dashed any expectations that policymakers might ease off on the sector.

""The government is serious this time"" Alison Li co-head of base metals research at Mysteel said by phone from Shanghai. ""Now China has its carbon neutrality mission we think they will stick to that limit.""

Actual production will reach about 40 million tons in China this year so for now producers still have some room to boost output according to Goldman Sachs. But the industry is likely to hit the ceiling by 2024 and from then on the Chinese market will move into deficit.

Producers elsewhere could help to plug the gap but prices will need to rise substantially to make investment worthwhile given higher costs for environmental compliance.

Trafigura estimates aluminum needs to hit $3500 within the next year to prevent shortfalls given the timelag to build new smelters. Logistical bottlenecks higher freight costs as well as taxes and tariffs are also at play right now wreaking havoc in the spot market.

United Co. Rusal International the biggest aluminum producer outside China may curb shipments because of a new Russian levy on exports.

There's been a staggering rise in the premiums that companies need to pay on top of LME prices to get hold of the metal meaning buyers are already facing near-record all-in prices for specialized products like aluminum billet.

There's even a shortage of aluminum cans thanks in part to the shift to dining at home during the pandemic. As a result firms have been forced to import from East Asia and South America at a time when freight rates are soaring adding to costs.

""The supply-chain complexity of bringing cans in from across the world is intense not only from a cost perspective"" John Hayes chief executive of can-maker Ball Corp. said on an earnings call in May.

For those counting on market dislocations proving temporary lumber offers some hope.

Having rallied to a record in May on the back of a U.S. homebuilding boom prices are now fast tumbling back toward pre-pandemic levels. But Rob Van Gils CEO of Austria-based Hammerer Aluminum Industries sees no let-up for aluminum yet as customers snap up his specialist products even with near-record prices.

Like many in the industry Van Gils was forced to make deep cuts to headcount and output when the pandemic struck but plants are now back at full capacity and orders have never been so strong.

""The whole supply chain is very much stressed from beginning to end"" Van Gils said by phone. ""It's created this situation where premiums have skyrocketed because the availability is just not there.""

The surge in aluminum premiums could unravel quickly if end-consumer demand starts to drop away and construction will be the key sector to watch according to Van Gils.

But for now sales are booming. Rising demand from the largely dormant aerospace sector as well as the long-term environmental shifts could yet lend further support when the post-Covid-19 demand boost starts to ebb in other areas.

""It's a seller's market out there"" said Mueller. ""If you look at the next 10 years we're in a massive transition phase in the aluminium market.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy92YWdhemV0dGUvbmFtZS9qYW1lcy1qZW5raW5zLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTE0NDMyMjA50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Jenkins Obituary (1944 - 2021) - Gloucester Point VA - Virginia Gazette,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/vagazette/name/james-jenkins-obituary?id=14432209 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy92YWdhemV0dGUvbmFtZS9qYW1lcy1qZW5raW5zLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTE0NDMyMjA50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzIwMjEvanVsLzMxL2dhcnktcmV5bm9sZHMtMjAyMS0wNy0zMS8_PS8mc3ViY2F0ZWdvcnk9MjIzJTdDTWVkaXRhdGlvbislMjYrWW9nYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gary Cole Reynolds Obituary,"Gary Cole Reynolds 71 of Little Rock and formerly of Pine Bluff passed away peacefully at Circle of Life Hospice in Springdale Ark. on Thursday July 28 2021.

President Bukele Agrees With Bank Of America

President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador a Central American country tweeted yesterday screenshots of a Bank of America economic outlook report (BofA). Along with explaining why the bank is optimistic about El Salvador’s economic prospects the paper also underlined the benefits that Bitcoin acceptance as legal cash could offer to the country.

The paper which was released on July 26 discusses El Salvador’s general economic outlook with the part in question focusing on remittances digitization and company operations.

BofA acknowledges how bitcoin could improve cross-border remittance outflows which account for a significant 24 percent of El Salvador’s gross domestic product (GDP). According to the Bank of International Settlements the average cost of such a remittance is above 10% which bitcoin might lower.

“Using Bitcoin for remittances could potentially reduce transaction costs compared to traditional remittances channels” BofA said. “If using Bitcoin indeed lowers transaction costs then for every dollar that the Salvadoran diaspora send home a greater portion of that dollar could be received by recipients increasing their disposable income and reducing the proportion of remittances lost to financial intermediaries.”

According to the paper another beneficial effect Bitcoin may have on Salvadorans is the ability to bank the unbanked. Because more than 70% of El Salvador’s adult population lacks access to traditional banking Bitcoin has the potential to democratize electronic payment access –– a “progressive touch.”

Furthermore according to BofA adopting Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador provides more options to the country’s citizens including consumers and retailers who may select which monetary standard they choose to deal and save under.

“Bitcoin’s adoption could also bring [foreign direct investment] flows into El Salvador” the report said. “There could be FDI from Strike (developer of the payments platform) Bitcoin miners ATM manufacturers among other types of firms.”

While the research goes into great length on the possible benefits of adopting the bitcoin standard for El Salvador it’s worth remembering that Bank of America recently stated that bitcoin’s sole feasible use-case is price speculation.

Similarly earlier this year Bank of America released the results of its fund manager survey which found that ‘long bitcoin’ was named as the most overcrowded trade by 36% of those polled.

A Bold Move By El Salvador

El Salvador has used the US dollar as its national currency since abandoning the colon in 2001. When President Bukele announced his ambitions to make bitcoin legal tender he shocked the globe. On June 8 a supermajority of the country’s legislature enacted his Bitcoin Law which will go into effect on September 7. El Salvador became the first country to use the bitcoin cryptocurrency as its legal currency.

Bukele’s choice to use bitcoin was greeted with both delight and apprehension. It was symbolic of mainstream adoption and more positive things to come for crypto aficionados as other Latin countries such as Paraguay hinted at developing their own cryptocurrency plans.

Meanwhile close to 83% of El Salvador residents don’t want to receive their remittances in the oldest cryptocurrency according to a recent survey.

Significantly Sánchez did not visit the capital Washington D.C. nor did he publicly meet with Joe Biden or any other official representative of the US government. Instead he met with investment bankers hedge fund managers and other major corporate heads. Sánchez was traveling not as a representative of the Spanish people as is usually presented in the capitalist media but as a lackey in the service of Spain’s banks and corporations.

The explicit aim of the trip was to attract investments from large vulture funds and other possible US investors. Using the 140 billion euros Spain expects to receive in European Union (EU) bailout funds in exchange for massive attacks on the working class—pension and labour reforms and austerity—the PSOE-Podemos governments hopes to obtain an additional €500 billion in private investment.

During his visit Sánchez met with a long list of banks and fund managers: Ares Management Corporation Bank of America Blackstone Group Bank of New York Mellon Brookfield Asset Management Roko Capital Management J.P. Morgan Catterton Partners Lone Star Funds Morgan Stanley Providence Equity Partners Soros Fund Management Wellington Management Group and also the US Chamber of Commerce in Spain.

Sánchez offered all of them guarantees that he will continue his attacks on the working class. In Spain Podemos promotes the lie that a new labour reform is part of “social measures” to improve working conditions but in the United States Sánchez made clear that he intends to escalate attacks on workers.

As El País explained “The Prime Minister explained to them that the labor reform agreed with Podemos and also negotiated with Brussels will mean that Spain is moving towards the German model of labor relations where there is social peace but also flexibility for employers to adapt to circumstances through the use of furlough schemes without redundancies.”

By German model of labor relations Sánchez really was talking about the notorious Hartz laws which created conditions for the emergence of a huge low-wage sector. This in turn served as a lever to smash wages and working conditions wiping out many thousands of well-paid industrial jobs. The result of the “model” hailed by Sánchez has been an explosion of social inequality. In Germany there are 136 billionaires and 542000 millionaires. On the other hand 13 million people live in poverty the highest number since German reunification in 1991.

Sánchez boasted to investors that pro-Podemos unions will suppress the class struggle El País added: “Sánchez explained to them that Spain is a country with few strikes with social peace and constant negotiation between employers and unions.” In other words the trade unions play a fundamental role in suppressing the class struggle and working with big business to impose wage cuts plant closures and pension reforms.”

He also told them not to worry about his government’s new housing law. This was of special interest to these hedge funds: Blackstone is Spain’s largest landlord with more than 40000 homes out of the nearly 240000 managed by hedge funds in Spain while Lone Star owns around 15000. Pedro Sánchez made clear that he had no intention of limiting their profits by regulating rents.

This issue affects millions of workers and youth. According the Platform for those Affected by Mortgages (PAH) since 2008 there have been more than one million evictions in Spain.

In addition to the real estate sector other groups such as J.P. Morgan Morgan Stanley Providence or Wellington have strong investments in various sectors such as mobile telephony energy banking food and other sectors in Spain. But it is global investment fund BlackRock that has the largest slice of Spain’s economy with €17 billion worth of shares in 18 of the 35 companies of the IBEX-35 Spain’s principal stock market index.

BlackRock is the world’s largest asset management corporation with $9 trillion in assets under management as of June 2021. It holds stakes in almost all major multinational companies including Coca-Cola Microsoft Monsanto and Apple among others. To understand its size and influence it is enough to say that if it were a country it would be the world’s third largest economy by size. Its president and CEO Larry Fink is known as “the fixer” for being the person who “fixes things in the financial market.” Sánchez reportedly held a private one-on-one meeting with Fink.

Podemos has covered for Sánchez’s visit. Podemos leader and Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda Díaz declared “I suppose they have talked about taxes” adding that this is “the only interesting thing about a visit to a large investment fund.” She concluded “The president has done his job” then cynically explained “Investment funds are in the world to make money and governments especially progressive ones are there to improve people’s lives.”

Díaz’s cynicism has no end. She and her government have done nothing but work tirelessly with the collaboration of the trade unions to benefit these investment funds. The examples are many.

Spanish banks laid off 15000 workers in the first six months of this year all rubber-stamped by the trade unions and endorsed by Díaz herself. This has allowed the banks to announce last week €4 billion in profits which will keep BlackRock and the IBEX-35 happy.

The monthly rise in electricity bills that is ruining millions of workers green lighted by the PSOE-Podemos government is benefiting large Spanish corporations like Iberdrola. The latest pension reform signed by the government and trade unions with the employers opens the way towards the privatization of pensions through company pension plans—in line with the aggressive promotion of these schemes by the hedge funds in Spain and throughout Europe.

These hedge funds have also profited from the herd immunity policy pursued by Madrid and the European Union prioritising corporate profits over workers’ lives. While these firms made billions in profits the cost in human lives of this policy has been over 100000 deaths in Spain and over 1.1 million across Europe. Europe is now confronting a new wave under the virulent Delta variant as capitalist governments across the continent continue to aggressively reopen the economy.

Sánchez’s visit to America confirms the warnings that the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) has made about pseudo-left parties like Podemos and their political satellites. Workers cannot expect anything from Sánchez Podemos the trade unions or their political satellites. They defend the interests of the billionaires and the big multinationals. The critical question is the struggle to give a political perspective to workers for a struggle against the pseudo-left by forming sections of the ICFI in Spain and throughout Europe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuYmFua2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luLXdhci1mb3ItdGFsZW50LWJhbmstZW1wbG95ZWVzLWdhaW4tdXBwZXItaGFuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In 'war for talent' bank employees gain upper hand,"Early in the pandemic the number of job openings at Zions Bancorp. plummeted to less than 200. A year later the Salt Lake City company has three times as many positions available.

Zions is offering certain perks to new employees including signing bonuses for select positions and the opportunity to enroll in benefits immediately instead of waiting the standard 30 days. But sometimes those enticements aren’t enough.

The $87.2 billion-asset company has seen a sharp decrease in applicants across its 11-state footprint and it is now negotiating compensation on virtually every job offer that it makes according to Trina Eyring its director of recruiting.

“This is the most challenging recruitment environment I’ve seen in my career” Eyring said.

“Everywhere I go I see ‘help wanted’ signs” she said. “Candidates today know they have bargaining power when they’re applying for jobs because there are so many different options.”

Like other companies banks are grappling with an unusually competitive labor market that is leading to higher wages and giving many prospective hires the leverage to demand a continuation of the remote-work arrangements to which so many Americans have become accustomed.

At Synovus Financial in Columbus Georgia executives are providing raises to all employees who earn less than the company’s median salary. Synovus is also providing pools of money to managers to “match or combat what’s becoming a fairly competitive landscape” Kevin Blair its president and CEO told analysts last month during the company’s quarterly earnings call.

Capital One Financial — which recently adopted a hybrid work schedule — has warned investors that “the cost of technology talent is visibly moving upward” because the demand for tech workers exceeds the supply.

Some banks are trying to get ahead of the competition for workers. Bank of America will raise its hourly minimum wage from $20 to $25 by 2025 while Synchrony Financial in Stamford Connecticut — which has already adopted a permanent remote work policy for its entire workforce — will move from a floor of $15 per hour to $20 in August.

Across the industry salaries have been climbing fast. Among the 50 largest U.S. commercial banks the median salary expense per full-time-equivalent employee rose to $148000 in the first quarter of 2021 up from nearly $129000 in the same period a year earlier according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

An analysis of the second-quarter data which is based on information that banks disclose in regulatory filings will not be available until mid-August. But the data will likely show another increase in salary expenses as banks boost wages to attract and retain workers especially those who can bring in new business to counteract persistent revenue headwinds according to Jennifer Demba an analyst at Truist Securities.

She expects wage pressure to keep building throughout the next year because “there is so much demand for revenue producers” across business lines.

“The war for talent has definitely heated up in the last several quarters” Demba said.

Economists and other observers have been waiting to see how increased access to COVID-19 vaccines will impact the labor market which was battered when the pandemic delivered widespread layoffs and double-digit unemployment rates. In June employers added 850000 jobs the highest number since August 2020.

Still companies say they continue to struggle to find workers especially lower-wage employees. Some are hopeful the situation will change in September when the end of enhanced unemployment benefits could change the calculus for many people who are currently out of the labor force.

In the banking industry hiring activity is stronger than it has been in three or four years partly because of the rapid digitization of banking which has increased the demand for technology workers and partly because of the retirement of baby boomers according to Eric Pikus head of North America global financial services at the consulting firm Korn Ferry.

To lure prospective hires and keep existing employees on board banks are granting more bonuses and equity awards ditching relocation requirements and retraining those already on the payroll he said.

“It is a red-hot job market” Pikus said.

The human resources team at The Cooperative Bank of Cape Cod in Yarmouth Port Massachusetts is feeling the effects. The $1.2 billion-asset community bank has always faced recruitment challenges because of its rural location but the struggle to find and keep talent reached a whole new level this spring said Lee Ann Hesse the bank's chief engagement officer.

The company — which employs 175 people and currently has eight job openings — recently lost an employee of eight years who decided to take a remote job in another industry for almost the same compensation Hesse said.

This week the bank plans to launch a program that will allow nearly 60% of its employees to work remotely three days per week Hesse said. “If we don’t do this we are not going to be competitive” she said.

Similar decisions are being made at Norway Savings Bank in Norway Maine. The $1.6 billion-asset bank normally has five or six job openings at this time of year but this summer it has 14 positions available including eight front-line jobs and two manager-level positions.

The bank is increasing its starting pay offering hybrid and fully remote work options and providing more flexibility than it did in the past said Richelle Wallace senior resources officer at Norway Savings.

She said in an email that the bank expects its average wage increase in 2022 to be higher than in previous years as Norway Savings seeks to keep pace with competitors. The bank also is investing in technology in an effort to become more efficient so that it can continue to grow while minimizing the addition of new employees Wallace said.

Codorus Valley Bancorp in York Pennsylvania has adopted a “long-term remote work policy” that will allow certain employees to work off-site on an as-needed basis the $2.2 billion-asset company announced in its second-quarter earnings release.

“This new employment strategy provides more work flexibility broadens the employment geographic market allows for the redeployment of office space and ensures that we remain competitive in a tightening labor market” the company said in the release.

More banks large and small may take similar stances in order to attract and retain workers said Cameron Boyd director of the financial services practice at the executive search firm Smith & Wilkinson. This month he recruited a credit analyst who initially accepted an offer from an unnamed bank but later turned it down because the employer would not offer remote work.

“The bank wanted this person in the office five days a week and this person’s current employer said ‘Not only will we pay you more to stay you can stay home to work’ ” Boyd said. “That’s the first time that I’ve had that happen where it’s directly related to remote work.”

“And we know and our clients know that if they don’t afford flexibility they’re going to lose people” he added.

At Zions job candidates have turned down positions because they would not be allowed to work from home Eyring said. She noted that the company has not made an across-the-board decision on remote work in part because it is waiting to see whether the tightness in the labor market continues.

Zions also has not made any policy changes on salaries in response to wage pressure. But such decisions could be up for consideration if the tight labor market persists according to Eyring.

“I think we’re moving right into the time that will tell if we have to offer retention bonuses to get people to stay if we have to make counter-offers if we have to increase salaries for internal equity purposes” she said.

There are bright spots for Zions where the relatively high number of available positions is due to both turnover and job creation. The pool of applicants appears to be rising in recent weeks and the time it takes to fill positions has not changed despite the recruiting challenges Eyring said. The company still fills about 80% of job openings within 60 days of posting them.

“I think we’re making progress with people who were not participating in the workforce who are now getting back to work” Eyring said.

It remains to be seen how long the tight labor market in banking will persist. But if strong economic growth continues Pikus said “I think we’ll have a good couple of years of this kind of market.”"

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

Open this photo in gallery: Holburne Museum Bath's first public art gallery and former home of Sir Thomas Holburne.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

In truth Bath's discipline gave Newcastle hope of a comeback as the latter stages were littered with penalties but they managed to hold on for the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2RyYWItcmVudGFsLWJhdGhyb29tLW1ha2VvdmVyLTM3Mzk3ODI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An $800 Rental Bath Makeover Goes from “Drab” to Fab,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/drab-rental-bathroom-makeover-37397824 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2RyYWItcmVudGFsLWJhdGhyb29tLW1ha2VvdmVyLTM3Mzk3ODI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyY2hkYWlseS5jb20vMTAxNjI5Ny9qb2NoZW9uLXlva2phbmctYmF0aC1hdGVsaWVyLWl0Y2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jocheon Yokjang Bath / Atelier ITCH,"+ 24

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2hvdy1vZnRlbi1zaG91bGQteW91LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLWJhdGgtdG93ZWwtODY0NDg2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Often You Should Change Your Bath Towel,"After a shower you probably throw your bath towel over a wall hook to dry. It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

It was the only way he knew how to survive’,"Baxter Dury strolls up to the pub casually dressed and apologetic. The indie musician known for his stylish suits is wearing a white vest and unbuttoned denim shirt. His face is even whiter than the vest. Food poisoning. He ate oysters the other day and has never been so sick. He orders a pineapple juice and soda water sheepishly. “That’s going to be the headline isn’t it?” The 2010 biopic about his father was named Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll – after one of Ian Dury’s most celebrated songs and a fair summary of his life.

But we’re not here to talk about Dad says Baxter a successful musician in his own right. It’s 21 years since his father died and 19 since Baxter recorded his debut album the fabulously titled Len Parrot’s Memorial Lift. Don’t get me wrong he says he loved the old man but he’s got Ian Dury fatigue. He’s tired of the comparisons – their music voice looks and lifestyle.

So it might seem a strange time to write a book about growing up as the son of Ian Dury? He smiles. He knows he’s not got a leg to stand on. “But the book isn’t about Dad” he protests. And he’s right in a way. The memoir called Chaise Longue is about his mother the artist Betty Rathmell school days expulsions teenage anarchy yobbo bad-boy friends posho bad-boy friends and the Sulphate Strangler (a 6ft 7in drug dealer entrusted with Baxter’s care). And of course it’s also about Ian Dury – the punk poet who had a withered arm and leg from a bout of childhood polio who could tickle or terrorise depending how the mood took him.

Baxter aged 49 draws us into the Dickensian underworld of his father – the “pot-soaked Fagin” who always had to be the centre of attention. “There’s a loss of boundaries when your parent needs you to be their audience as Dad did. He broke your confidence and replaced it with his own” he writes. After all Ian had endured as a boy – sent to live in an institution for disabled children where he was ridiculed and written off – he emerged determined to prove the world wrong. He was furiously ambitious and nothing would stop him. Certainly not children. “He just made the choice ‘I’m going to be relentlessly about myself.’ He created a vacuum dedicated to him where everything was about him. It was the only way he knew how to survive – by a form of almost total control. He controlled everything and he realised if he let go of that control it didn’t work. It worked and he made money and he succeeded but it was really awkward and people got fucked over and spat out.”

To an extent Baxter was collateral damage. His father is rehearsing when he is born drops him the first time he holds him and makes it clear that no matter how much he loves Baxter and his sister Jemima priority-wise they will always come a poor second to himself.

Betty who came from a family of artists with a “nerdy Bohemian-ness” about them wasn’t that much more reliable a parent. While Ian seemed to constantly teeter on a precipice it was Betty who fell off it when she fell asleep at the wheel of her car and killed a motorcyclist. Baxter then aged nine or 10 and Jemima were both in the car and not wearing seatbelts. Baxter was fine and Jemima only had concussion but Betty broke her leg and arm and shattered her shoulder. A year later having learnt to walk again Betty was convicted of manslaughter due to reckless driving but only given a suspended sentence because of her family circumstances. Young Baxter callow and callous called her a “murderer” and that was the last time they ever mentioned it. He says Betty who died of cancer in her early 50s never recovered from the accident. In the book he writes: “Mum is difficult to describe but the best people always are.”

At the heart of Chaise Longue is an unlikely trio living in belligerent harmony – dad son and the Sulphate Strangler. They shared a flat in west London by the banks of the Thames; part of a block renowned for its arty squatters which Ian dubbed Catshit Mansions. They drank together took drugs together smashed crockery together rowed and made up together when Baxter was still in his mid-teens. At one point the Sulphate Strangler known affectionately as Strangler attempted to squeeze the life out of Baxter after he stole the laundry money. Today Baxter says Strangler who died in police custody was simply trying to teach him right from wrong. The title Chaise Longue refers to the day bed Baxter was relegated to when Strangler moved into the flat and commandeered his bedroom.

Baxter is parched. He downs his pineapple juice and soda in one and is on to the next. When my bitter and whitebait arrives he turns an ever whiter shade of pale. A family of four at the next table is enjoying an exuberant Thursday afternoon out.

When his father died he left the flat to his four children (two from another relationship) who leased it out. Four years ago Baxter decided to rent it for himself and his son Kosmo. It’s funny he says how history repeats itself. When they moved back in the tenants with a long memory looked terrified. “It was like fucking hell here they come because it was unadulterated chaos when Dad was there.”

Actually he says the neighbours seem to miss the bedlam of the old days. “They were all quite fond of Dad because he was quite charming  but he didn’t give a fuck if he played the drums through the night. Now they’re a bit ‘Bravo! Bravo!’ at us cos we still make a little bit of noise politely. They’re like: ‘Your son was playing his drums. What a wonderful noise!’ There’s a tenderness that’s developed.”

Baxter has been thinking a lot about his relationship with his father and Strangler. He wrote the memoir through lockdown “in moments of utter bleakness in this space where it all occurred”. Did it inspire him? “I don’t know. It’s made me a bit more agitated about living there.” It certainly brought a rawness to the memories: lawless days when he bunked school and did whatever he fancied; overdosing on Strangler’s “jellies” (temazepam) after falling in love with his best friend’s girl; his father’s tipsy joviality morphing into drunken nastiness; the stench of dope and booze and Strangler’s body odour. At times he says the endless freedom he enjoyed became a burden.

It’s a vivid portrait of family life at its most dysfunctional. But he worries that his writing isn’t sufficiently nuanced – that he’s sensationalised the story turned his father into a pantomime villain made life too thrilling. He says he lacks the subtlety to deal with the boring bits. Whereas his father loved a tall story Baxter seems compulsively truthful. “It’s a distortion of history to an extent in that I’ve laden it with excitement because there were many more ambient moments when people were peaceful and read books. They were really smart my parents on both sides. Dad taught art for years. He knew everything about Van Gogh.”

Baxter contrasts the early years when the family struggled financially with the riches that came when his father made it big. Again though he fears misleading us. Go back a couple of generations and the Durys had money and standing. He tells me of the two great aunts on his father’s side – both were university educated independent minded and had no interest in men. Great Aunt Moll was a high-ranking civil servant who took trips to India to spend time with a spiritualist while Aunt Elizabeth became a doctor. “If Dad hadn’t got polio he would have probably gone to Cambridge” Baxter says.

Baxter’s done with the pineapple juice orders a pint of bitter and talks about his father’s “selective socialism”. Ian sent him to the local comp in Chiswick but went private when it came to his own needs. At school the kids were aware that Baxter was the son of a celebrity. It was hard not to be. After all young Baxter was photographed on the cover of New Boots and Panties!! the debut album by Ian Dury looking even moodier than his father. The toughies at school acknowledged his fame by throwing him to the ground and beating him to the tune of Dury’s No 1 single “Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick”. Sometimes he fought back but on the whole he found it easier to absent himself.

Baxter downs his beer and we order another. He seems so much better now. Then a man on the opposite table hands his dog a rabbit leg with the fur still attached. The dog owner looks on proudly pleased at the offence he is causing as his pup gnaws the leg to the bone and the fur flies. It’s a scene I would imagine his father relishing. Baxter looks as if he’s about to throw up. He talks about his son Kosmo now 18 telling me he may turn out to be the best musician of the lot.

He split up from Kosmo’s mother many years ago but they brought him up as a team. He says he wouldn’t be best pleased if Kosmo got up to some of the stuff he did when he was young. On the table next to us the family are knocking back Jägerbomb and rosé chasers. Mother and daughter share the same birthday and they are all out celebrating.

We toast them while Baxter scratches away at his book’s failings. The reality wasn’t as bleak as he makes out he says. “By the time I was at a posh college hanging out with narco-toffs I was as happy as you can be. And living in that flat with a seven-foot asthmatic drug dealer I was genuinely happy. I look back and think: ‘God they are fond memories.’”

Soon after Strangler moved in Ian suggested he take Baxter and his friends clubbing. That’s where he first saw the Brobdingnagian bruiser on the job. They popped into Dingwalls in Camden where Strangler had business to sort. Next thing Baxter knew he saw Strangler throttling a man who owed him. “He let go of the man who slumped to the floor” he writes. “We all suspected Strangler was mad but now we knew it.”

Was there anything gentle about him? “Loads and loads” Baxter says. He talks about how Strangler would take him shopping call for him from school (when he could be bothered to go) hang out with his mates and chill. “He found sanctuary in my friends because we were an open little bunch. He was funny and kind and sweet.”

Dad was this in-command say-what-he-fucking-wants person and I’m this other person. I’m now comfortable with that

Strangler whose real name was Pete Rush died in his late 30s. Looking back Baxter says he’s surprised he lasted that long. Even now he is unsure what role his father had intended him to play in their life – part guard-dog part nanny part friend and flatmate. “Sometimes Dad’s intentions were self-serving and sometimes they were genuinely altruistic. I don’t think he gave Strangler somewhere to live just because he wanted him to look after me I think he was helping him out.” After his father’s death Baxter discovered Ian had been paying Strangler’s mother’s domestic bills ever since Rush died just over 10 years earlier.

When writing the book Baxter carried out more research into Strangler’s life but didn’t like what he found so didn’t include it. “There was some really dark shit there. I decided not to go further because that contaminates my childish version of what I knew of him.”

For most of his 20s Baxter Dury dossed around. He worked on building sites and in Oxford Street shops lived in the US for a while appearing to have neither the desire nor drive to make something of himself. In 2002 two years after his father died he released his first album. “I blagged myself a record deal without much merit. Being a famous man’s son I had manipulated the system a bit in the era where you got quite a lot of money for not doing a lot.” The record was not a commercial success but was well received as have been his five subsequent solo studio albums. Back then he sang with the whispery diffidence of a young boy questioning his right to be there. If Ian Dury had been Fagin Baxter Dury was Oliver.

These days his voice is more of a gravelly sprechgesang. Did he resist singing in that voice because it was so close to Ian’s? He smiles – just. “Well close to mine!” He pauses. “Yeah close to our voice” he concedes.

Like his father he is a natural storyteller. His songs are often character studies of monstrous (and vulnerable) men played out to gorgeous beats with a surprisingly French feel to them – he has an imagined conversation with an old school friend who broke his nose in “Oi” is a stalker in “I’m Not Your Dog” and beyond menacing as the “sausage man” and “shadow licker” in “Miami”. Despite the bravado his characters can also be hopeless romantics. Imagine Serge Gainsbourg mixed with Ray Winstone backed by the electronic chill-out duo Air.

I ask if it was hard following his father in the music industry. No he says the hard thing was lasting the pace. “I was going to get attention because Dad was really famous. So the music business will look at me but it only lasts about a year if I’m a poor emulation of him. Most kids of famous singer parents only last for a year or so before it dies off. They become a version of their parents’ creation.” Who like? I’m not going to quote them” he says diplomatically. “Like them all” he adds less diplomatically. “Ninety nine per cent. I’ve grown a music career that I’m proud of. And it’s intact because it’s mine.”

I never had a constitution for drugs. I’d be sick in my pocket after three pints and any drugs

Two Jägerbombs arrive courtesy of our neighbours at the next table who are in party mood. Baxter who appears to have made a rapid recovery tells me to knock it back. I obey orders before heading off to the bar to get us a couple of beers to clear our heads. Matt the young man at the bar points outside: “Is that Baxter Dury you’re with?” Yes I say. “I love him. He’s brilliant.” I tell Matt to come out and meet him. Meanwhile an attractive woman walks up to the table and starts chatting. It’s turning into quite a party. The woman heads off and Baxter explains she is a former girlfriend a dancer with the Royal Ballet who lives nearby and to whom he remains close. He seems to have a gift for remaining close to people.

I tell him how surprised I was when Matt got so excited. “You’re only surprised because of your perspective” he says. What he means is I’m still thinking of him as the son of Ian Dury. He’s right to quietly put me in my place. I’m not sure that Matt would have even heard of his father. So many people throughout his life have wanted him to be what he is not – Ian Dury mark 2. “Dad was this in-command say-what-he-fucking-wants person and I’m this other person and I’m now quite comfortable with that.”

Perhaps there was a time he wanted that too. He’s thinking about his own childhood and the way he saw himself – the bad boy forever getting expelled from schools. He ended up sending Kosmo to King Alfred’s the private school that threw him out after three days for chucking a chair through the window. The same headmistress was still there. “I said: ‘What was I like’?’ and she said ‘You were such a wonderful sweet sensitive little boy.’ I think I was pretty naughty but also sweet and sensitive.”

The family next door have knocked back their final Jägerbombs and are off to the Dove down the road. The mother walks over to Baxter before they leave. “You are my son’s absolute hero” she says. “He has seen you so many times but he’d never say it! Can I grab a picture – is that all right’?” Baxter and son have their photo taken and the family leave happy.

I’m beginning to think this is Baxter’s elaborate set-up. To be fair he’s beginning to think it’s mine. In the end we agree it’s serendipity and sit there swapping stories and family photos. We head off slightly the worse for wear. Baxter only has a few yards to walk back to the flat.

He tells me he’s lucky – busy but not too busy comfortable but not loaded well known but not too well known and best of all close buddies with Kosmo with whom he has written his latest single. Perhaps he wouldn’t be in such a fortunate position if his father had left a fortune he says. “There’s no great gold mine Dad left because there are too many people and there are only a few hits so it doesn’t generate that much. But it’s a fun position to be in. People like what we do. I make enough money to live quite well I’m about to sign a new deal and I can kind of do what I want.”

Is he surprised that he’s so functional after the early years? Not really he says. He never felt he was in danger of becoming an addict. “I never had a constitution for drugs. I’d be sick in my pocket after three pints and any drugs. I’m so shit at it.”

We’re back at the flat. Baxter says he’d invite me in but he doesn’t want to distract Kosmo. We stare up at the third floor with its huge balcony overlooking the Thames. I imagine Dury Strangler and young Baxter wreaking havoc all those years ago. It’s so quiet now. Baxter says he has started to think it wasn’t all quite as haphazard as it seemed at the time; that the old man had a plan. “Maybe it was some kind of experiment.

The Sulphate Strangler arrived one afternoon. He was dripping in different gold and silver pendants necklaces demonic earrings and turquoise arm bracelets. He had snakeskin cowboy boots over tight jeans with a gigantic silver skull centred on his belt buckle. His large belly was bulging through a floral shirt with the sleeves cut off exposing his trunk-like arms.

Strangler appeared more frequently over the next few months helping Dad on different errands. He would accompany him on his daily walk through Richmond Park wearing silk skating shorts that revealed too much thigh and a pair of second world war binoculars. Dad would walk at a meditative pace and it would take them a few hours to complete three or four miles. Dad would smoke a big joint and discuss the mating habits of the great crested grebe while Strangler pretended to listen.

Eventually Dad bought Strangler a tiny white Nissan Micra but with his enormous arms breaching either side of the vehicle it was almost impossible to sit next to him. Strangler placed a kamikaze flag across the front panel as a warning.

Strangler was told to take my friends and me out clubbing. Six of us managed to fit in the Nissan. He gave us some Tennent’s Super to share

Dad also decided to offer Strangler a room in the flat which meant I had to move out of it. I was transferred on to the decaying Victorian daybed or as Dad referred to it to make it sound more glamorous the chaise longue in the front room. In a forced bonding exercise – or maybe Dad just wanted us out of the way – Strangler was told to take my friends and me out nightclubbing. Six of us managed to fit into the Nissan with the smallest in the boot. Strangler gave us a few cans of Tennent’s Super to share.

The first club we went to was at Dingwalls in Camden. Everyone knew Strangler and we were ushered in without any issue. We were given a drink each by the bar staff amused at our age and told to stay close to one another on the dance floor while Strangler attended to some business. After a while I could see Strangler towards the back of the nightclub. A small crowd had formed a circle around him and his mammoth arms were stretched out with his hands gripped around someone’s neck. As I approached I could see the fear in the other man’s eyes. Strangler ordered us to start heading towards the exit. “It’s out of order” is all he said to his victim over and over again. He let go of the man who slumped to the floor. We all suspected Strangler was mad but now we knew it. We dared not say anything as we got back into the Nissan. He slammed down the accelerator and sped across London.

We arrived at the Slimelight club which was three floors of frightening goths in an old church. This was more Strangler’s comfort zone but it was clear this wasn’t a place to bring six children. We were told to be quiet and sit at a table and he gave us a flask of vodka to share. He went into the darker fringes of the club and wasn’t seen again for an hour. He came back and sat on the table and used the silver tube attached to his necklace to sniff up some white powder from a tiny plastic vial.

On the way home Strangler now more upbeat stopped on the All Saints Road in Ladbroke Grove. He waited for all the drug dealers to gather round the car and then wound down the window and hollered “Grrrrrroooooaaaarrrrgh.” He sped the car for a short distance and then stopped and waited for the dealers to start chasing us and then repeated this several times. We genuinely screamed for our lives until we were safely out of danger and then thought it was hilarious.

After a few months I started to grow accustomed to his vast range of habits. He often took amphetamines in the morning in the same way someone would drink coffee. If he took too much he would stabilise this with alcohol sometimes he would have a Special Brew by noon and then consume a whole Ventolin inhaler. Speed is an appetite suppressant so he wouldn’t eat anything all day. By early evening he’d have a few more lines and would start to get a bit jittery at which point he’d have to drink stronger alcohol. He would swig from a bottle of Jack Daniel’s that he concealed in his room. To sleep he would take a handful of temazepam. This would cancel out all the speed and shut down his system for a few hours. And so the cycle would continue.

Contrary to his violent persona Strangler enjoyed being domestic and we would go shopping every Saturday morning

Contrary to his violent persona Strangler enjoyed being domestic and we would go shopping every Saturday morning. First stop Safeway Supermarket. Gravy granules potatoes frozen peas various meat pies and shampoo. He would growl at the other shoppers who gawped for too long. Sometimes we would go to meet Graham who was an amphetamine manufacturer with a big house at the bottom end of Hampstead Heath. Graham was quiet unassuming and enormously polite. Nothing about him suggested he made or sold drugs. I guess that I was taken as a way of lessening suspicion if we were pulled over by the police. I was told strictly to never mention these visits to Dad or anyone else.

An Aboriginal man called Bartholomew arrived at the flat one afternoon. He was small and athletic with a huge wave of black hair and colossal sideburns. Dad had met him while touring in Australia. He told us how to spear a crocodile from a canoe and that you should lick the back of a hallucinogenic frog. After a certain point of drinking Dad’s behaviour became a lottery. It was best not to underestimate how crazy he could turn so as usual I faded into my room without being noticed.

The rotting chaise longue was one of only two bits of furniture in the barren front room. There were no curtains so the light was tormentingly bright from the crack of dawn. A thunderous banging woke me up a short while later. Someone was slamming their fist on the front door and ringing the bell. As I tentatively approached I could see the outline of the upstairs neighbour through the frosted glass. I opened the door and saw he had a hammer in his right hand. I shouted for Dad. An ominous sound permeated the entire flat like hundreds of baritone witches. I started to lead the enraged neighbour towards the source of the noise. Dad limped towards us grinning like a murderous clown barely visible through the dim light and cannabis smoke. The door of the bathroom was ajar. Dad grabbed it smiled and presented the scene. Bartholomew was crouched either side of the bath wearing only a loincloth. Resting between his thighs was a huge didgeridoo. His cheeks were inflated and his eyes were closed and he seemed to be in a trance. The neighbour hesitated uncertain how to react his hammer dropping to his side. The Strangler then appeared in his pink shorts consuming the last available light and space left in the corridor. The neighbour was trapped. Dad leaned in and sensing his vulnerability squeezed him affectionately on the arm. He whispered “You’re OK. You’re OK.” As the neighbour left he looked me directly in the eyes and said “Please no more … no more.” He moved out a week later.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvYWwuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvbGVvbmFyZG8tY2FzdHJvLWthaXplci1jaGllZnMtc3RyaWtlci1vdXQtZm9yLTE2LXdlZWtzLS0tc3R1YXJ0LWJheHRlci8xamNuYzRxNDhyZTZ1MXJvYmZtdmloeTBzNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leonardo Castro: Kaizer Chiefs striker out for 16 weeks - Stuart Baxter,"The Colombian was already confirmed as unavailable for the season curtain-raiser but the extent of his injury has now been explained

Kaizer Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter has confirmed Leonardo Castro will be out for 16 weeks due to injury.

Following the signing of Keagan Dolly by Chiefs earlier this week there was anticipation that his combination with Khama Billiat and Castro will be 'reincarnated' as early as Sunday's Carling Black Label Cup against Orlando Pirates.

This is after their partnership thrived during their days at Mamelodi Sundowns leading to a Caf Champions League triumph.

But Castro is set to miss a bigger part of the season in what will delay witnessing his combination with Billiat and Dolly.

“We’ve signed a few centre-backs we've signed a few fullbacks” said Baxter as per Sowetan Live.

“In attack we have options there. We have Leo Castro who’s probably going to be out for another 16 weeks and Lebo Manyama is coming back. Samir [Nurkovic]‚ we are hoping is going to be a clean bill of health now to kick on.”

Chiefs already have a depleted squad ahead of Sunday’s Carling Black Label tie against their old foes.

Apart from Castro they will also be without the likes of attackers Billiat and Samir Nurkovic as well as defender Siyabonga Ngezana and Lebogang Manyama.

After making a number of new signings ahead of the upcoming season Baxter says they are not yet done on the transfer market.

Chiefs signed the likes of Njabulo Ngcobo Thabani Dube Sifiso Hlanti Sibusiso Mabiliso Phathutshedzo Nange and goalkeeper Brandon Peterson.

SuperSport midfielder Teboho Mokoena is one of the players linked with Amakhosi.

“We’re always looking in the market Baxter said.

“But at this moment in time we feel that with the attacking options that we have when we get everybody in and everybody fits then we’ll make a decision if we need to be active or if we can just make‚ let’s say‚ contingency plans.

“I think at the moment if we get everybody fit we can make a more definitive decision on that one.”

KAIZER Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter has described Zimbabwean midfielder Willard Katsande as a warrior who gave everything for the success of the club.

Katsande was released by the club this week after 10 years of service.

His departure coincided with the return of Baxter who worked with the midfielder at the club between 2012 and 2015.

This was one of the most successful periods for Chiefs in the last decade.

They won a League and Cup double in the 2012-2013 season and another one in 2014-2015 with Baxter as coach.

The Englishman reserved special praise for Katsande who was an integral member of the team during the period.

“Willard played for me obviously in my first time with Chiefs and he was a warrior’’ said the Englishman.

‘’Willard was a warrior wearing gold black and he was the Chiefs. He became Chiefs through and through.”

Katsande said he had no hard feelings after he was released along with six other players this week.

The departure of the 35-year-old who would have loved to play on at least for another season divided opinion among the Chiefs.

Some felt the club should have told him in advance and organised a proper send-off rather than wait for his contract to expire.

Baxter who addressed a virtual press conference along with club captain Itumelang Khune ahead of this Sunday’s Carling Black Label clash with Orlando Pirates said Katsande fits in the bill of club legend.

“Every player goes through phases in his career. Itu (Khune) who is sitting next to me he’s been through phases and (as a player) you adapt to a phase.

“Alan Shearer was a player that was quick and he was dangerous up until he had a very bad injury.

‘’And after that he became very clever in the box very strong holding off defenders. He adjusted.

“Willard went through those phases and Willard adjusted. And at some point you know players say ‘well my role is such that I don’t really want to do that I want to move on’.

“Now Willard’s role I’m sure that he will have a role with Kaizer Chiefs in the future because he’s been an icon of the club.’’

Baxter said Khune could also follow suit on day.

“The same as the day that Itu wants to hang up his gloves I’m sure that there’ll be a job for him at Kaizer Chiefs because he’s an icon of the club’’ said the coach.

“So Willard has been a warrior for me. Personally he has been a great player for me.

“And I think he’s one of those players that can be an example to other South African players because he has made himself into an excellent player from someone who’s not the most talented player in the world.

“He wasn’t the most gifted player in the world. Things didn’t come easy to Willard Katsande.

“He made sure he learned the game. He made sure that he did what he was good at. And he made a very good career out of it. And he will always be an icon of this football club.”

Katsande played a record 326 games for Chiefs.

He won two league titles the MTN8 and the Nedbank Cup.

Katsande was known for his no-nonsense approach in the heart of midfield the never-say-die spirit and the workaholic attitude which won him many admirers in the Chiefs family.

He won the Player of the Season Players’ Player of the Season Fans Player of the Season at the 2016 club awards.

In his own words said he “came as a nobody but I am leaving as a legend.”

Khune who is currently the longest serving player at Chiefs also hailed Katsande for his contributions to the club.

“I fully agree with the coach that Willard was a warrior. He was a soldier that we could always count on’’ said Khune.

“When the chips were down we knew that we could count on Willard.

“He was a great soldier and he was a hard-working player on the field and a very humble person off the field.

“I remember the first time he came here he had stiff competition against his countryman Tinashe Nengomasha.

“You know what Nengomasha did for the club but I think Willard surpassed that by his work rate.’’

He said his number of appearances speak for themselves.

If I can count the number of matches he has played I might be wrong’’ said Khune.

“But he knew who he was replacing and he wanted to write his name on the history books of this great institution.

“I salute Willard for what he contributed to the club.

“For him to be given the nickname such as ‘Salt ’n Vinegar’ you know you got to count on salt when you eat.

“That was him he got so many nicknames along the way but he didn’t take any prisoners on the field of play.

“But off the field he was a smiling person he was such a great guy and we are surely going to miss him.

“I have been with him for the past 10 years and it’s sad to see him leave.’’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvY2NlcjI0LmNvLnp3LzIwMjEvMDcvMzEva2F0c2FuZGUtd2lsbC1yZXR1cm4tdG8td29yay1hdC1rYWl6ZXItY2hpZWZzLWJheHRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Katsande will return to work at Kaizer Chiefs: Baxter,"Kaizer Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter believes Willard Katsande will return to work at the club in future after retiring from playing football.

The Zimbabwean midfielder’s departure was confirmed last week following the end of his contract. He made 326 appearances across all competitions to become the club’s most-capped foreign player after ten years.

Chiefs have indicated their willingness to offer the 35-year-old a new job should he decide to end his playing career.

And the two parties will hold talks soon before the player makes his final decision.

“I am sure Willard will still have a role with Kaizer Chiefs because he has been an icon at the club the same as the day that Itu [Khune] wants to hang up his gloves” Baxter told the media.

“I am sure there will be a job for him because he is an icon at the club. Willard has been a warrior for me. He has been a great player for me and he has been one of those players that can be an example to other South African players because he has made himself into a player.”"

He might have billions of dollars to his name but unlike other celebrities and financial gurus Warren Buffett prefers to live life simply.

The Oracle of Omaha won't be found living in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills collecting a fleet of fancy sports cars or dining daily on foie gras and caviar. The investing icon practices what he preaches when it comes to financial discipline saving and paying off debt.

Simple living can pay off in the inflationary environment that's emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Buffett warned a livestream audience of over 28 million during Berkshire Hathaway's May 1 annual meeting that ""substantial inflation"" is hitting both retail prices and wholesale prices being charged to businesses.

Singling out Berkshire Hathaway's homebuilding investments Buffett said “We’ve got nine homebuilders ... we really do a lot of housing. The costs are just up up up. Steel costs you know just every day they’re going up.”

When one of the world's most successful investors raises concerns about rising prices it's likely time to apply some well-tested strategies to tighten your belt.

Here are nine ways Buffett's frugality can help you save and spend wisely.

1. He lives in the same home he bought back in 1958

While most billionaires bulk up on expensive real estate Buffett originally paid $31500 for his Omaha Nebraska home — that’s around $288700 in today’s dollars — and he’s lived there for over 60 years.

His home is by no means tiny however. The 6570-square-foot five-bedroom home has had plenty of renovations and additions over the decades and is worth about $1 million today. It’s also protected by fences and security cameras and most likely has a good homeowner’s insurance policy as well.

Buffett has no plans to move out calling it “the third best investment I ever made” in a 2010 letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders.

2. He rarely takes out loans

Buffett’s one-and-only mortgage was on a vacation home in Laguna Beach California which he purchased in 1971 although he certainly had the cash to afford the $150000-listed seaside property.

He told CNBC that he took out the 30-year-mortgage loan because “I thought I could probably do better with the money than have it be an all equity purchase of the house.” He decided to use the extra cash on-hand for shares in Berkshire Hathaway — the company that brought him billions — instead.

Buffett's point about not locking up capital still resonates. And if you own your home you have options to free up some of your own capital by refinancing at today's historically low mortgage rates. A switch today can save you thousands of dollars a year.

3. He buys breakfast cheap

@BusinessInsider / Twitter

While Buffett could simply hire a personal chef to cook him gourmet meals he often grabs his breakfast from Mickey D’s on his way to work. He doesn’t spend more than $3.17 on his morning meal.

“When I’m not feeling quite so prosperous I might go with the $2.61 which is two sausage patties and then I put them together and pour myself a Coke” he says in HBO's documentary Becoming Warren Buffett. ”$3.17 is a bacon egg and cheese biscuit but the market’s down this morning so I’ll pass up the $3.17 and go with the $2.95.”

Instead of going out for big meals or buying a latte from Starbucks every day just make your own lunches and coffee. You can even get rewarded for buying your groceries and earn cash back for future spending.

4. He buys marked-down cars

Many billionaires and millionaires keep a collection of flashy sports cars and vintage models in their garages but Buffett allegedly prefers fixed-up automobiles that he can acquire at reduced prices.

He upgraded from his 2006 Cadillac DTS to a Cadillac XTS for just $45000 in 2014. ""The truth is I only drive about 3500 miles a year so I will buy a new car very infrequently” he admitted to Forbes.

Whether you’re opting for a brand-new car or a slightly-used model you shouldn’t overspend on vehicles so don’t go for the first loan you spot and look around for better deals. Make sure to shop for auto insurance rates every six months as well.

5. He doesn’t splurge on brands

Buffett doesn’t much care for designer suits or the latest iPhone model — he relied on his $20 flip-phone for years before swapping it out for the Apple smartphone in 2020. And despite the upgrade he doesn’t use any of the iPhone’s fancier functions.

Buffett avoids unnecessary spending and once said “Do not save what is left after spending but spend what is left after saving.”

Park your funds in a high-yield savings account so they can accumulate interest and grow over time. Set aside your extra cash for an emergency fund or retirement instead of blowing it all on big purchases.

6. He doesn’t invest with borrowed money (anymore)

Freedomz / Shutterstock

“I’ve never borrowed a significant amount of money in my life. Never. Never will. I’ve got no interest in it” he told students at Notre Dame in 1991.

Although a young Buffett once borrowed 25% of his net wealth to buy shares he warns investors against repeating the same mistake.

Even skilled stock traders will tell you borrowing to invest can be risky. And with easily downloadable apps like this one that lets you invest your ""spare change"" and turn your pennies into profits there's no real need.

7. He does what he loves

Financial Freedom / YouTube

Buffett credits some of his success to his passion for investing. “You have to love something to do well at it” he says urging people to take the jobs they love instead of positions that look good on your resume.

Even if you can’t quit your full-time job to focus on the things you truly enjoy you can certainly find the time for some affordable hobbies. Buffett himself enjoys card games and playing the ukulele.

And if you’re looking for a way to boost your income capitalize on your skills and hobbies and set up your own side hustle.

8. He finds creative ways to save

When Buffett’s first child was born he converted a dresser drawer into a bassinet. For his second he borrowed a crib.

“If you buy things you don’t need you will soon sell things you need” the billionaire says. Buffett watches out for the small expenses before they can add up and comes up with creative solutions to avoid spending more than he has to.

Take a good hard look at your finances and figure out where you can cut down on. Get yourself a library card and borrow books and movies instead of purchasing them. Or download a budgeting app to monitor your spending habits.

9. He uses cash not credit

While most of us prefer the convenience of a credit card for our everyday purchases Buffett uses hard cash.

In fact he told Yahoo! Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer in 2019 that he uses cash “98% of the time. If I’m in a restaurant I’ll always pay cash. It’s just easier.” While the method may sound a bit old-school relying less on your credit card can help prevent spending money you don’t have.

Using most of your available credit and falling behind on your monthly payments damages your credit score. If you’re struggling to pay off your credit-card debt you might want to consider bundling it up into a debt consolidation loan with a lower interest rate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWFjb25qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvcHJvL2Jyb3ducy8yMDIxLzA3LzMxL2hhc2xhbS1zcG9ydHMtZ3JvdXAtY291bGQtY29uc2lkZXItb3duZXJzaGlwLXRoaXJkLXByby10ZWFtLzUzOTQzMzcwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Haslam Sports Group could consider ownership of a third pro team,"BEREA — For over two years the Cleveland baseball team has been looking for a minority investor who would bring a needed infusion of cash to boost player payroll.

Browns co-owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam who head the Haslam Sports Group do not appear to be coming to the rescue.

Jimmy Haslam said Saturday during the owners’ annual training camp kickoff press conference that Haslam Sports Group has not spoken to Paul Dolan chairman and CEO of the baseball team.

“We have not talked to Paul” Jimmy Haslam said at the Browns’ CrossCountry Mortgage Campus. “Paul’s a great friend he’s done a tremendous job with the Indians but we have not talked about that.”

A story surfaced in September on the website Sportico that Haslam Sports Group was exploring a purchase of the NBA’s Minnesota Timberwolves. While Haslam Sports Group issued a denial it said in a statement it is “regularly evaluating potential investment opportunities in sports and entertainment.”

When the Timberwolves story was brought up Saturday Jimmy Haslam said “We’ve looked at a lot of different opportunities over the last year or two.”

Haslam Sports Group also owns Major League Soccer’s Columbus Crew SC which raises the question of whether the family’s sports entity would like to concentrate its holdings in Ohio.

“It would make sense. But we’re used to operating all over the place” Jimmy Haslam said. “We evaluate things on a regular basis. Between Dee’s company Pilot the Browns and the Crew we’ve got a lot going on.”

Dee Haslam is founder and executive producer of RIVR Media.

The Haslams are in the process of cashing out their holdings in Pilot Travel Centers LLC owner of the Pilot Flying J truck stop chain a transaction that could boost their interest in acquiring another team. The sale of the business to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. began in 2017 and the latter will increase its stake to 80 percent through 2023.

“We still will own 20 percent of Pilot so we’ll still have a fairly significant stake and it’ll always be part of our lives” Jimmy Haslam said. “We like sports we like business … We feel like we have both the Crew and the Browns in a good place here but we need to make sure that happens before we add anything else.”

Austin Hooper says Browns are an ‘unsatisfied team’

Tight end Austin Hooper lost the Super Bowl his rookie year with the Atlanta Falcons in 2016 suffering a 34-28 overtime setback against the New England Patriots. But he said the Browns’ 22-17 defeat at Kansas City in the AFC divisional round in January took him a while to get over and it wasn’t just that he caught two passes for 16 yards.

“Losses suck. I’ve lost a Super Bowl; I had to deal with it. Obviously that game hurt” he said of falling to the Chiefs. “If you love anything it’s going to be emotional. If it means something to you it’s going to be emotional.

“But at the end of the day you’ve got to put it to bed just like anything else. You’ve got to learn the hard lessons. Looking at the tape there are definitely things I wanted to do different just like I’m sure everyone else wanted to do different in the game obviously because we’re a very unsatisfied team which is a great trait to have.

“All you can do at the end of the day is learn the hard lessons and move on.”

Changes coming to Cleveland Browns practice

Browns coach Kevin Stefanski is eager for the players to begin wearing pads Tuesday noting that's when they might start to separate from one another in competitions.

“It's a physical game so I know that the guys are champing at the bit to get to that point” he said. “We're just going to make sure that we ramp it up and are safe when we get there.

“But it's football. So excited when the pads do get on.”

Stefanski said the Browns will also start playing crowd noise during practices next week. Many games last season were played without loud crowd noise because COVID-19 restrictions prevented stadiums from being full.

“We're going to turn the crowd noise on next week because it is something that we've been talking about for a long time here” Stefanski said. “That's going to be new for most points having not gone through it for an entire season. So we'll devote a good portion of time to dealing with crowd noise silent count all the things that go with that.”

Haslams encourage COVID-19 vaccinations

While 90% of the players are in the process of getting fully vaccinated and 100% of the coaches and staff have been there is concern that the 2021 NFL season could be disrupted by the Delta variant of COVID-19.

“We have been focused on getting the message out that everybody needs to be vaccinated” Dee Haslam said. “The Delta variant is obviously something to be of concern but everything we have been told if you have had your vaccination it is not as severe. That's what we are hoping.

“Obviously we will follow all of the safety protocols and keep up to date on what is going on. I do not think anybody knows at this point. Right now we are looking forward to having our fans back and that is what we are thinking about.”

Jimmy Haslam said they are watching the rising case numbers both with their sports teams and Pilot.

“I would just encourage everyone to … take those shots if you have not already because it is important for your health and safety and it is important for the country” he said.

As of March this year it held over $10 billion of client assets under management and custody the firm said.

The company aims to go public in three to five years to offer investors an exit Ge said on Monday. It also aims to have hundreds of billions of dollars in assets under management and custody within five years.

Wu spun Matrixport off from Bitmain in 2019 after the world’s largest maker of Bitcoin mining rigs ran into a cash crunch. In January he resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of the company he co-created seven years ago ending a years-long power struggle with his co-founder Micree Zhan. Wu now serves as chairman of Matrixport with Ge his former Bitmain ally as the CEO. The duo has a majority stake in the firm Ge said.

The startup took in $7 million to $8 million in revenue for 2019 and expected that to more than double in 2020 it told investors when pitching a funding round last year. Ge said the firm is profitable without disclosing financial numbers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9zaGFyay10YW5rcy1rZXZpbi1vbGVhcnktaW52ZXN0LWRvZ2Vjb2luL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary Won't Invest in Dogecoin Says 'I Don't Understand Why Anybody Would' – Featured Bitcoin ...,

Outside of the holidays one of the best times of the year to buy a laptop for less is during the back-to-school season.

We're in mid-summer and back-to-school sales are in full swing right now as students and educators prepare for the new semester. Among must-have back-to-school supplies deals on laptops for students are of Black Friday proportions right now. Whether you're back to school shopping or not if you're considering buying a MacBook Chromebook Windows laptop or a gaming machine for less it's a great time to save.

Retailers like Amazon Best Buy and Walmart offer fantastic back-to-school laptop deals during the summer. And if you want to go to the source PC makers Dell HP Lenovo Microsoft and Samsung also slash prices on their laptops around this time of year. From premium laptops to affordable PCs under $500 summer sales have something for everyone.

On any given day you can find student discounts and deals on laptops throughout the year. However during July and August in particular retailers offer especially low Black Friday-like laptop deals to make way for new inventory. These post-Prime Day summer savings events are dubbed ""Black Friday in July"" sales.

For example Amazon and Best Buy are slashing hundreds off various configuration current and previous-gen MacBooks some of which are at all-time low prices. If you're looking for a sub-$300 laptop a kid’s first device or a Windows 10 or macOS alternative for yourself Chromebook deals are abundant this season.

We recommend newer model Chromebooks with Intel or AMD processors. With this kind of CPU power paired with Google’s lightweight Chrome OS you’ll benefit from fast boot times snappy performance and long battery life. If you have more room in your budget the Editor's Choice Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is of tremendous value. This 10th Gen Intel CPU-charged 2-in-1 Chromebook with a 2K display is a solid choice for students business users and general consumers alike.

As retailers run seasonal deals all summer long we're seeing aggressive discounts on laptops right now. When you find the laptop you want it's a good idea to compare prices among stores to get the best value. To save you the trouble we've already done the leg work for you.

One thing’s for sure babies need a ton of stuff. From big-ticket items like strollers to everyday baby essentials the list of must-haves can feel endless—and expensive.

Renting borrowing or buying used baby gear can be a good alternative for parents browsing on a budget. Many families sell gear their baby has outgrown meaning there’s plenty of stuff up for grabs at bargain prices (if you know where to look!). Eager to save some cash but don’t want to compromise on quality? You’re in luck—many retailers list open-box and gently used items on their sites. “Open-box gear is almost like new the box has just been opened. Think: A parent opened their new stroller didn’t like the color and returned it before ever using it says Kristin Langenfeld the CEO and co-founder of Good Buy Gear. Gently used gear has been previously loved and may show signs of general wear and tear but is still in perfect working order. Another benefit of shopping second-hand? It reduces carbon emissions and puts money back into the pockets of parents—win-win.

But before you give away your whole house (or fill it up with someone else’s stuff!) it’s important to note that some used items can pose safety risks to babies and young children. For one thing “safety standards change on a regular basis so some items may not comply with newer regulations” says Lauren Crosby MD a pediatrician at La Peer Pediatrics in Beverly Hills California. Despite the risks many parents seek out easily accessible high-quality second-hand baby gear. Luckily many online marketplaces and “recommerce” sites have emerged to meet this growing demand. Here you’ll find the best places to buy and sell baby gear online—plus safety tips and a list of items you should always buy new.

Baby Gear You Should Buy New

If you can’t resist a bargain you might be tempted to buy all of baby’s essentials second-hand. But there are some baby products that should definitely be purchased new. “Parents should be careful with high chairs bouncy seats swings and play yards as they are often the subject of recalls” says Crosby. You should always buy these three items new:

• Car seats. A car seat is an essential piece of gear for new parents; they can be expensive but this is one item that should be bought new. In order to comply with stringent crash safety standards all car seats have expiration dates listed in their manuals (in general they expire within six years but it may depend on the manufacturer). To that end purchasing a car seat without a manual is a major no-no. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) parents shouldn’t use a car seat if they don’t know its history. “A car seat may appear to be in good shape but there is a chance it may have been in a car accident so its safety may have been compromised” says Crosby. If you do opt for a used car seat Crosby advises researching the expiration date checking for potential CPSC recall notices and only purchasing one from someone you know and trust.

• Cribs cradles and bassinets. Crib safety standards are constantly changing so it’s best to buy one new. In June 2011 the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) adopted a slew of new safety requirements and banned the sale of drop-side rail models (so do not buy this type of crib second-hand or new). The AAP also advises against purchasing antique cribs. “Antique cribs may be appealing but they don’t conform to current safety standards and may even be finished with lead paint” says Crosby. Crib slats should be spaced no more than 2 3/8 inches apart the crib sides should be at least 26 inches above the mattress support in its lowest position there should be no drop-down rails and headboards and footboards should be solid without decorative cutouts explains Crosby.

• Crib mattresses. A mattress of any kind should always be bought new. “A crib mattress could be worn meaning it won’t provide proper firmness. Plus it could be dirty and there is no good way to clean a mattress” says Crosby.

Baby Gear You Can Buy Used

Wondering what products are safe to buy second-hand? You can buy most baby gear “as long as it goes through a proper quality and safety inspection” says Langenfeld. Here are three types of gear that are generally considered safe to buy and sell used:

• Strollers. Strollers don’t have expiration dates meaning they are typically safe to buy used. However it’s important to inspect secondhand strollers thoroughly and always check to see if that particular model has been recalled. Make sure its wheels and brakes are working properly the seat reclines and that all of the straps are functional.

• Baby clothes. It’s okay to buy used baby clothes but make sure they are clean and check for choking hazards like drawstrings or decorations that could come off.

• Toys. Toys that are in good condition and are easy to clean can be bought secondhand. However Crosby advises against buying toys with batteries that are easily accessible to children as battery ingestion can be life threatening.

Safety Considerations When Shopping for Used Baby Gear

There are certain safety considerations you should be aware of when purchasing baby products that have been resold. Regardless of the product “always look for signs or wear and tear [and] choking and strangulation hazards and only use baby gear as directed per the product instruction manual” says Crosby. Read on to discover more important safety tips.

• Check recall notices. A product recall occurs when an item has a manufacturing defect or poses a safety risk to the user. Before you make a purchase check to see if the model has been recalled on the CPSC website or at Recalls.gov.

• Purchase used baby gear from a trusted supplier. Local markets and online auctions can be a good place for seasoned thrifters to source second-hand products. But when it comes to baby gear Langenfeld advises parents to buy from a trusted friend or third party: “That way you know you’re purchasing from a reliable source and can ditch the back-and-forth messaging and meet-ups with strangers.”

• Inspect the product for safety hazards. If you are shopping in-person inspect items thoroughly. Keep an eye out for the following safety hazards: Peeling paint or rough edges on furniture gear or toys with loose parts plastic products that are cracked or damaged and garments with frayed or threadbare material. If you’re shopping online make sure the product images are high-quality so you can get a sense of overall condition.

• Check for missing parts. Avoid items with missing parts as they may not function properly and replacement parts could end up costing you more in the long run.

• Clean products before use. Many used baby gear sites inspect and sanitize each product before posting it for resale but some don’t—so it’s important to clean items before use. Some products have specific cleaning requirements but in general you can use soapy water a cleaning spray or an anti-bacterial wipe to sanitize an object with a hard-surface.

• Wash soft furnishings and clothing before use. Put secondhand clothing cloth diapers fabric baby wraps or any other soft furnishings in the washing machine as soon as you bring them home.

RNA-Seq data generated through high-throughput Illumina and PacBio sequencing30 permitted for the identification of eight gene sequences that showed the most stable digital expression levels in five different tissues of T. ravennae: the root vegetative meristem inflorescence flower and seed tissues (Fig. S1). The sequences corresponded to EF1α Ubi4-like polyubiquitin (Ubi4) histone H3.3 isoform X1 (H3.3) translationally controlled tumor protein homolog (TCTPH) fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (Aldolase) BI1-like protein (BI1) autophage-related protein 8C (8C) and aconitate hydratase (AH) respectively (Table S1). EF1α Ubi4 and H3.3 are housekeeping genes and have been widely used as reference genes in many plant species313233. The other five genes are new candidate reference genes that have not been used for studying gene expression levels in any plant species to date.

The PacBio (i.e. cDNA) sequences of Ubi4 Aldolase BI1 and 8C showed relatively stable reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM) values ranging from 148.52 to 355.34 in the sampled tissues except for Aldolase in the root (Fig. S1). Comparable digital expression patterns were observed for EF1α H3.3 and TCTPH except that their RPKM values were higher (from 240.52 to 629.94) in the vegetative meristem inflorescence flower and seed. Similarly the RPKM values of EF1α and TCTPH were higher in the root (1054.89 and 725.26 respectively). AH showed the most variation (from 423.27 to 926.13) in its RPKM values in different tissues. These eight genes were selected as the candidate reference genes for further analysis.

Validation of the accuracy of the PacBio sequences of the eight candidate reference genes in T. ravennae

To validate the accuracy of the PacBio sequences of the eight candidate reference genes we compared the PacBio sequence of each gene with its most similar genomic copy. If SNPs were identified for any genes we conducted PCR for the amplification of both the PacBio sequence and its most similar genomic copy simultaneously for that gene followed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR products without cloning. The BlastP search for the homologous sequences of each of these eight genes (i.e. EF1α Ubi4 H3.3 TCTPH Aldolase BI1 8C and AH) in the reference genome assembly of T. ravennae29 returned 7 12 8 3 6 5 4 and 3 homologous genomic sequences with high amino acid sequence similarities respectively (Figs. S2–S9). By comparing PacBio sequences with their respective genomic DNA sequences (Figs. S10–S17) we found the PacBio sequences for EF1α H3.3 and TCTPH were identical in sequence to their respective genomic copies. However SNPs were identified between each cDNA sequence and its most similar genomic copy for Ubi4 Aldolase BI1 8C and AH (Figs. S10–S17).

Four pairs of sequence-specific primers were designed for each of the five PacBio sequences (Ubi4 Aldolase BI1 8C and AH) to PCR amplify both the PacBio sequence and its most similar genomic copy simultaneously. Each PCR amplicon contained SNPs between each PacBio sequence and its most similar genomic copy (Tables S1 and S2 and Figs. S10–S17). Our preliminary data showed that a 1:10 dilution of cDNA was appropriate for use since the average Ct values varied from 20 to 31 for all the candidate reference genes (data not shown). With the leaf cDNA (1:10 dilution) being used as the PCR templates Sanger sequencing without cloning revealed that each PCR product was identical in nucleotide sequence to its respective PacBio sequence (Fig. S18). Therefore these five PacBio sequences were accurate in nucleotide sequence and used as the candidate reference genes for further qPCR analysis.

Optimization of qPCR conditions

We optimized qPCR conditions by optimizing primer annealing temperature and primer concentration and identifying the optimal template cDNA concentration range and the best primer pair for each gene. To achieve this four pairs of sequence-specific primers were designed for qPCR for each of the eight candidate reference genes based on cDNA sequence alignment (Table 1 Table S1 and Figs. S10–S17). The primers were 20 or 21 bp in length with one (or two) SNP(s) present in the last nucleotide position(s) at the 3’-end. When possible we avoided the presence of 5 or more consecutive nucleotides of the same type (e.g. AAAAA or GGGGG) in any primers and had a C or G in the last nucleotide position at either or both ends of each primer with a 45–55% GC content. PCR amplicons were 85–125 bp in length for most primer pairs and contained SNPs between each gene and its most similar homolog in the genome.

(1) Optimization of primer annealing temperature: Using the diluted leaf cDNA (1:10 dilution) as the templates and primer concentration of 350 mM per primer per reaction we conducted gradient qPCR (56 58 60.6 and 62.7 °C) to identify the optimal annealing temperature for each primer pair for each gene. All the PCR reactions at 60.6 °C had the lowest Ct values for each primer pair for each gene (Table 1 and Fig. S19). Thus the annealing temperature at 60.6 °C provided an optimal temperature for each primer pair for each gene. (2) Optimization of primer concentration: Using the same leaf cDNA (1:10 dilution) as the templates and 60.6 °C as the optimal annealing temperature we used different primer concentrations (200 250 300 350 and 400 mM) to determine the optimal primer concentration for each primer pair for each gene. We found that primer concentrations of 350 and 400 mM per primer per reaction had the lowest Ct values (Table 1). The exceptions came from a few primer pairs of EF1α Ubi4 H3.3 and Aldolase which had the lowest Ct values at the primer concentrations of 250 or 300 mM. The primer concentration with the lowest Ct value for each primer pair was chosen as the optimal primer concentration for that primer pair (Table 1). (3) Identification of the optimal cDNA concentration range and its associated best primer pair: Using 60.6 °C as the optimal annealing temperature and the optimal primer concentration for each primer pair as detailed in Table 1 we used serial dilutions of the same leaf cDNA (1:10 1:20 1:40 1:80 and 1:160 dilutions) as the templates to run qPCR and obtain the standard concentration curve with a logarithmic scale for each primer pair. When the efficiency of each primer pair was factored into an equation as described in the efficiency calibrated method (Fig. 1) we found that different primer pairs had different optimal cDNA concentration ranges for each gene that gave rise to the largest R2 and optimal efficiencies (100 ± 5%) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The optimal cDNA concentration range means that the qPCR amplification is at the exponential stage under the conditions of the optimal primer annealing temperature primer concentration and cDNA concentration range. Thus a twofold difference in gene expression results in the difference of one qPCR cycle. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 most R2 were between 0.98 and 1.0 and most efficiencies were between 100 and 110%. Primer pairs EF1α-qPCR-F1/EF1α-qPCR-R2 Ubi4-F2/Ubi4-R2 H3.3-qPCR-F2/H3.3-qPCR-R2 TCTPH-qPCR-F1/TCTPH-qPCR-R1 Aldolase-F2/Aldolase-R1 BI1-qPCR-F1/BI1-R2 8C-F2/8C-qPCR-R2 and AH-F1/AH-qPCR-R2 gave rise to the best R2 (0.9924–0.9999) and efficiencies (100.3–104.8%) (Table 1). The only exception came from the R2 of the primer pair H3.3-qPCR-F2/H3.3-qPCR-R2 of H3.3 which was 0.9876 despite the optimal efficiency at 102.85% for H3.3. Taken together these primer pairs were the best for their respective candidate reference genes. The PCR amplicons from these best primer pairs were 86–121 bp in length except that the PCR amplicon from the best primer pair BI1-qPCR-F1/ BI1-R2 for BI1 was 142 bp in length (Table 1). Fig. 1: The plot of the averaged Ct values from three technical replicates against the Log (cDNA in ng/reaction) for optimizing qPCR conditions for the best primer pair of each of the eight candidate reference genes in T. ravennae. The PCR efficiency (E; %) for each primer pair was calculated as E = (10-1/A − 1) × 100. The cDNA concentration in 1:10 1:20 1:40 1:80 and 1:160 dilutions was 5 2.5 1.25 0.625 0.3125 ng/µl respectively while the Log (cDNA in ng/reaction) for the 1:10 1:20 1:40 1:80 and 1:160 dilutions were 0.69897 0.39794 0.09691 −0.20412 and −0.50515 respectively. The data from the lowest (or highest) one (or two) cDNA concentration might have been omitted in order to obtain R2 ≥ 0.99 and E = 100 ± 5% for the data from the remaining four (or three) consecutive cDNA concentrations for the best primer pair for each candidate gene. This served as the prerequisite for using the 2−ΔΔCt method for data analysis Full size image

As a result the qPCR conditions were optimized as shown in Table 1 and used for further qPCR analysis in T. ravennae.

Transcript abundance of the eight candidate reference genes across different tissues and inflorescence developmental stages of T. ravennae

We examined the expression stability of each of the eight candidate reference genes across different tissues and inflorescence developmental stages of T. ravennae. Under the optimized qPCR conditions (Table 1) the transcript abundance of each candidate reference gene was quantified in the root vegetative meristem leaf inflorescence flower and immature seed of T. ravennae. The mean Ct values from three biological replicates varied from 22.17 to 28.47 for the eight genes under study (Fig. 2A and Table S2). Gene expression stability evaluated across the different developmental stages revealed a ranking of the stability of gene transcript abundance in terms of the same amounts of total RNA per reaction was Ubi4 > BI1 > 8C > AH > H3.3 > TCTPH > Aldolase > EF1α as determined by the coefficient of variation (CV %) of each gene’s Ct values (Table S2).

Transcript abundance of the eight genes was also measured at different inflorescence developmental stages of T. ravennae (i.e. 40 80 120 160 and 200 cm in length). The average Ct values of the eight genes ranged from 21.63 to 27.89 (Fig. 2B and Table S2). The coefficient of variation (CV %) of each gene’s Ct values across different inflorescence developmental stages demonstrated the stability ranking of transcript abundance in terms of the same amounts of total RNA per reaction was H3.3 > EF1α > Ubi4 > Aldolase > AH > TCTPH > 8C > BI1 (Table S2).

Transcript abundance of the eight candidate reference genes in T. ravennae under salinity stress treatment

We also examined the expression stability of each of the eight candidate reference genes in T. ravennae under salinity stress treatment. Transcript abundance of each gene was measured in the leaves of the T. ravennae clones treated with 0 150 300 and 600 mM NaCl for 0 10 20 and 30 days (Fig. 3A–E). Under the mock treatment (negative control; 0 mM NaCl) the clones’ phenotypic analysis found that all the clones were healthy at each time point except for 30 days post treatment (dpt) where ~30% of the leaves exhibited a chlorosis phenotype (Fig. 3A). Growth performance analysis revealed that fresh biomass steadily and significantly increased from 0 to 20 dpt by 2.3-folds (P < 0.05 Fig. 3E). Growth from 20 to 30 dpt resulted in a significant decrease in fresh biomass weight (P < 0.05 Fig. 3E) a possible outcome of growing the plants in the test tube. The outcome led to the exclusion of the data collected at 30 dpt from further data analysis.

Phenotypic analysis of the clones treated with 150 300 and 600 mM NaCl revealed that the severity of the salinity stress phenotype was correlated with the NaCl concentration and treatment duration (Fig. 3B–D). The clones treated with 150 and 600 mM NaCl showed the least and most growth stress respectively (Fig. 3B D). Analysis of plant growth revealed that clones’ fresh weight at 10 and 20 dpt with 150 mM NaCl and 10 dpt with 300 mM NaCl were similar to that of the mock treatment (P > 0.05 Fig. 3B). However the fresh biomass weight at 10 and 20 dpt with 600 mM NaCl decreased significantly compared to that of the mock treatment (P < 0.05 Fig. 3B). Together we concluded that the clones were tolerant to the treatments with 150 mM NaCl for 20 days and 300 mM NaCl for 10 days and were highly stressed by 600 mM NaCl for 10 and 20 days.

Under the mock treatment transcript abundance of each gene at 20 dpt significantly decreased when compared to that at 0 dpt (P < 0.05) even though there was an insignificant difference between 10 and 0 dpt (Fig. 3F). This noncontinuous change in transcript levels suggests that the plants at 20 dpt were suffering from an abiotic factor not related to the treatment and possibly related to the growth condition of the plants in the test tubes and thus data collected at 20 dpt were excluded from further analysis. The transcript abundance at 10 dpt is inversely correlated to NaCl concentrations (Fig. 3G–I). There was an insignificant difference in each gene’s transcript abundance at 10 and 0 dpt with 150 mM NaCl (P > 0.05 Fig. 3G). However there was a significant difference in each gene’s transcript abundance at both 0 and 10 dpt with 300 or 600 mM NaCl (P < 0.05 Fig. 3H I).

Time-course analysis of the average Ct values for each gene under the mock treatment at 0 and 10 dpt showed that the coefficient of variation (CV %) of the Ct values of the eight genes at both time points was ranked as BI1 > Aldolase > TCTPH > Ubi4 > EF1α > AH > H3.3 > 8C. However the salinity stress treatments at 10 dpt changed the ranking of the coefficient of variation (CV %) of the Ct values (Table S3). We found that the 8C gene had the lowest coefficient of variation of the Ct values under the treatments with 150 300 and 600 mM NaCl and EF1α had the second-lowest coefficient of variation of the Ct values under the treatments with 150 and 300 mM NaCl and the third-lowest coefficient of variation of the Ct values under the treatments with 600 mM NaCl (Table S3).

Fold change in fresh biomass weight (E) was calculated by dividing the fresh biomass weight at each time point by the fresh biomass weight at 0 dpt.

Transcript abundance of the eight candidate reference genes in T. ravennae under water-deficit treatment

Next we studied the expression stability of each of the eight candidate reference genes in T. ravennae under water-deficit treatment. Transcript abundance of the eight candidate reference genes was quantified in the leaves of the T. ravennae clones treated with 0% 20% and 40% PEG 8000 for 0 5 and 10 days (Fig. 4A–D). The phenotypic analysis found that the clones under the mock treatment (0% PEG 8000) were healthy at each time point (Fig. 4A) but the clones treated with 20% and 40% PEG 8000 exhibited enhanced stress phenotype severity as PEG 8000 concentration increased (Fig. 4B C). The severity of the stress phenotype at 5 dpt was apparently milder than that at 10 dpt with 20% and 40% PEG 8000. Growth performance analysis revealed that the clones’ fresh weight under the mock treatment steadily and significantly increased from 0 to 10 dpt by 1.59 times (P < 0.05 Fig. 4D). However the fresh biomass weight under the 20% and 40% PEG 8000 treatments significantly decreased at 5 and 10 dpt when compared to that at 0 dpt (P < 0.05 Fig. 4D).

Fig. 4: Representative images of the phenotype fold change in fresh biomass weight and transcript abundance of the eight candidate reference genes measured by qPCR in the leaves of T. ravennae seedlings under water-deficit stress. Images were taken with a Canon EOS Rebel T6 digital camera and a 35 mm macro lens at 0 5 and 10 dpt with 0 (A) 20% (B) and 40% (C) PEG 8000. Fold change in fresh biomass weight (D) was calculated by dividing the fresh biomass weight at each time point by the fresh biomass weight at 0 dpt. RNA was extracted from the leaves at 0 5 and 10 h post treatment (dpt) with 0 (E) 20% (F) and 40% (G) PEG 8000. Ct values indicate the mean values of transcript abundance from three independent replicates ± standard errors (vertical bars) Full size image

Under the mock treatment each gene’s transcript abundance at 5 and 10 dpt was insignificantly different from that at 0 dpt (P > 0.05 Fig. 4E). The transcript abundance of each gene at 5 dpt with 20% and 40% PEG 8000 was also insignificantly different from that at 0 dpt (P > 0.05 Fig. 4F G). However the transcript abundance of each gene at 10 dpt with 20% and 40% PEG 8000 significantly decreased compared to that of 0 dpt (P < 0.05 Fig. 4F G).

Time-course analysis (i.e. 0 5 and 10 dpt) of the average Ct values under the mock treatment revealed that the coefficient of variation (CV %) of the Ct values of the eight genes at the three time points was ranked as BI1 > Aldolase > TCTPH > Ubi4 > EF1α > AH > H3.3 > 8C. However the water-deficit stress treatments at 5 and 10 dpt changed the ranking of the coefficient of variation (CV %) of the Ct values of each gene (Table S4). We found that AH had the lowest coefficient of variation of the Ct values at the three time points of treatments with 20% PEG 8000 followed by Aldolase 8C Ubi4 BI1 EF1α TCTPH and H3.3. Ubi4 had the lowest coefficient of variation of the Ct values at the three time points of treatments with 40% PEG 8000 followed by 8C AH EF1α H3.3 BI1 TCTPH and Aldolase (Table S4).

Analysis of the expression stability of the eight candidate reference genes in T. ravennae

Since RNA components and their concentrations vary from sample to sample34 it is critical to analyze the expression stability of the candidate reference genes under different experimental conditions using statistical algorithms such as RefFinder35 which were designed to identify a set of reference genes with similar expression patterns in different samples. The comprehensive ranking by RefFinder showed that the stability rankings of the genes were BI1 > TCTPH > AH > Aldolase > 8C > H3.3 > EF1α > Ubi4 in different tissues and EF1α > Aldolase > H3.3 > TCTPH > Ubi4 > 8C > BI1 > AH at different inflorescence developmental stages (Table 2). The stability rankings under salinity and water-deficit stresses were TCTPH > Aldolase > EF1α > AH > 8C > Ubi4 > BI1 > H3.3 and EF1α > 8C > BI1 > H3.3 > TCTPH > AH > Ubi4 > Aldolase respectively (Table 2). When all the samples were analyzed in combination the stability ranking was Aldolase > EF1α > Ubi4 > 8C > H3.3 > AH > BI1 > TCTPH (Table 2).

Table 2 Ranking of expression stability of the eight candidate reference genes in T. ravennae with Ct values being calculated using RefFinder Full size table

H3.3 and AH did not rank high among the most stably expressed genes under any conditions and should not be used as reference genes for qPCR analysis in T. ravennae under these conditions tested in this work.

Optimal numbers of reference genes in T. ravennae

To identify how many genes should be used as the reference genes for qPCR analysis the reference genes that showed similar expression patterns in different samples should be identified. The geNorm method was used to calculate the expression pairwise variation (V) of each candidate gene against all the other candidate genes under different experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 5 the V of V 2/3 was smaller than the threshold of 0.15 for all the eight genes in all the tissues at various inflorescence developmental stages and under water-deficit stress. Thus the use of the two most stably expressed reference genes ensures accurate normalization of qPCR data; the addition of one more reference gene did not make a significant difference. Under salinity stress or when all samples analyzed in combination however all the V-values were larger than the 0.15 threshold except V 6/7 (0.14) for all samples in combination (Fig. 5). Since the use of six or more reference genes in qPCR is unpractical we propose to use the two most stable genes as reference genes for salinity stress treatment in this study.

Fig. 5: The optimal number of reference genes for qPCR normalization in T. ravennae detected by geNorm. The pairwise variation (V n/n+1 ) of the eight candidate reference genes under various conditions were calculated by the geNorm software and the optimal number of reference genes was determined by the lowest number of genes with V n /V n+1 smaller than the threshold of 0.15 Full size image

Relative expression levels of H3.3 and AH in T. ravennae

Since H3.3 and AH did not rank among the best reference genes in this study we proposed they should not be used as reference genes for qPCR analysis in T. ravennae. To better understand their poor expression stability we chose to quantify the relative expression levels of both genes in T. ravennae. BI1 and TCTPH EF1α and Aldolase Ubi4 and Aldolase and EF1α and 8C were used as the reference genes in different tissues at various inflorescence developmental stages under salinity stress and under water-deficit stress respectively (Table 2). Thus the geometric mean (which was calculated by multiplying the Ct values of the two reference genes and then taking a square root) of the two reference genes was used as the Ct of the reference genes for each experimental condition. Using the optimal annealing temperature (60.6 °C) and primer concentration (250 300 350 or 400 mM) for the best primer pair of each gene and 1:40 cDNA dilution (Log (cDNA in ng/reaction) = 0.09691) for all the samples (Table 1 and Fig. 1) the relative expression levels of both genes were quantified in different tissues at different inflorescence stages and under the salinity and water-deficit stress treatments (Figs. 6 and 7). These data showed that both genes had variable relative expression levels under different conditions in this study.

The two best reference genes BI1 and TCTPH in different tissues (A) and EF1α and Aldolase at various inflorescence developmental stages (B) were used as the reference genes.

Analysis of the expression stability of six candidate reference genes in soybean under biotic stress treatment with Xag

We confirmed our improved approach for expression stability of six candidate reference genes in soybean under biotic stress treatment with Xag the causal agent of bacterial leaf pustule (BLP) disease and one of the most destructive bacterial diseases of susceptible soybean varieties. Soybean cv. Williams 82 (W82) was used as a BLP-resistant variety3637 and cv. Jack as a BLP-susceptible variety. The candidate reference genes Actin (Glyma.08G1822000) cons4 (Glyma.12G020500) cons6 (Glyma.12G051100) Tubulin (Glyma.08G014200) FtsZ homolog 2-1 (FtsZ2-1; Glyma.19G194800) and Tubulin beta chain (TUBB; Glyma.04G023900) were selected from Kim et al.38 and Libault et al.39 that studied their expression stability at 12 hpt with Xag treatment. The cDNA and protein sequences of all the homologous sequences of each candidate reference gene were downloaded from the soybean whole-genome sequence database in Phytozome. Following protein sequence alignment (Figs. S20–S25) and then cDNA sequence alignment (Figs. S26–S31) the SNPs were identified between each candidate reference gene and its most similar homolog in the soybean genome and used for primer design for subsequent qPCR analysis. Using the diluted W82 leaf cDNA (1:10 dilution) as the templates optimization of qPCR conditions was conducted as described above and summarized in Table S5. We found the optimal annealing temperatures were 58 or 60.6 °C and the optimal primer concentrations were 250 300 350 or 400 mM for the four primer pairs of each gene (Table S5). Using the optimal annealing temperatures and the optimal primer concentrations for each primer pair and the serially diluted W82 leaf cDNA (1:10 1:20 1:40 1:80 and 1:160 dilutions) as the templates we obtained the standard concentration curve with a logarithmic scale for each primer pair for each gene (Fig. S32). We found the best primer pairs for the six candidate genes were Gmcons4-qPCR-F2/Gmcons4-qPCR-R2 GmActin-qPCR-F2/GmActin-qPCR-R2 Gmcons6-qPCR-F1/Gmcons6-qPCR-R1 GmTubulin-qPCR-F1/GmTubulin-qPCR-R1 Gm023900-qPCR-F1/Gm023900-qPCR-R1 and Gm194800-qPCR-F1/Gm194800-qPCR-R2 which gave rise to the best R2 (0.9852–0.9975) and efficiencies (100.46–104.23%) (Tables S1 and S5). The PCR amplicons from these best primer pairs were 88–124 bp in length.

To test the expression stability of these six candidate reference genes under Xag treatment the leaves of soybean cvs. W82 and Jack were inoculated with pathogenic Xag strain EB0840 by leaf infiltration and subsequent spray inoculation. Symptoms were assessed daily and there was no symptoms observed on the leaves treated with the mock (10 mM MgCl 2 buffer) treatment (Fig. 8A). In Jack treated with Xag chlorosis was observed on the leaf surface at 72 hpt and raised centers on the lower leaf surfaces were observed at 120 hpt. Pustules then started to appear with small yellow haloes surrounding each lesion and lesions coalesced into larger necrotic areas by 240 hpt (Fig. 8A). However in W82 inoculated with Xag minimal chlorosis was observed on the leaf surface at 72 hpt and large necrotic lesions developed after that. The BLP symptoms on the leaves of W82 were restricted to the leaf infiltration sites at 120 hpt. At 240 hpt the inoculated leaves had become chlorotic and fell (Fig. 8A).

Fig. 8: Disease symptoms (A) and transcript abundance (B) of the six candidate reference genes in the leaves of soybean cvs. W82 (Xag-resistant) and Jack (Xag-susceptible) under Xag strain EB08 treatment. Disease symptoms were assessed at 120 and 240 h post treatment (hpt) with Xag strain EB08 (A) which was used as the virulent pathogen with 10 mM MgCl 2 being used as the mock treatment. RNA was extracted from soybean leaves at 0 12 24 48 72 and 120 hpt and transcript abundance was quantified by qPCR in W82 under the mock (B) and Xag (C) treatments and in Jack under the mock (D) and Xag (E) treatments. Ct values indicate the mean values of transcript abundance from three independent replicates ± standard errors (vertical bars) Full size image

Transcript abundance of the six candidate reference genes was evaluated in the leaves of soybean cvs. W82 and Jack inoculated with Xag at 0 12 24 48 72 and 120 hpt. Under the mock treatment the average Ct values for the six genes in the three biological replicates of W82 across the six time points varied from 28.80 to 31.44 (Fig. 8B and Table S6). The coefficient of variation (CV %) of the Ct values of the six genes across the six time points showed similar stability of gene transcript abundance in terms of the same amounts of total RNA per reaction ranking the expression stability as cons6 > cons4 > TUBB > FtsZ2-1 > Actin > Tubulin. Similarly the stability of gene transcript abundance in Jack under the mock treatment was ranked as cons6 > cons4 > FtsZ2-1 > TUBB > Actin > Tubulin (Fig. 8D and Table S6). Time-course analysis of transcript abundance of the six genes in W82 and Jack under Xag treatment revealed that the treatment slightly changed the ranking of the coefficient of variation (CV %) of the Ct values of the six genes (Fig. 8C E and Table S6). The stability of gene transcript abundance in W82 and Jack under Xag treatment in terms of the same amounts of total RNA per reaction was ranked as cons6 > cons4 > FtsZ2-1 > TUBB > Actin > Tubulin and cons4 > cons6 > Actin > FtsZ2-1 > TUBB > Tubulin respectively (Table S6).

To confirm that biotic stress did not affect the expression patterns of the six gens in question we monitored the bacterial populations on both Jack and W82 treated with Xag for the duration of the experiment. As expected the bacterial population increased significantly from none detected at 0 hpt to 5.6 Log (CFU/g) at 12 hpt (Fig. S33). The bacterial populations remained steady through the duration of the experiment averaging a mean bacterial population of 5.5 CFU/g of tissue in both soybean cultivars (Fig. S33). No bacteria was detected in any soybean plants treated with the mock (10 mM MgCl 2 buffer).

RefFinder ranked the stability of the six genes in both soybean cultivars treated with Xag as cons6 > cons4 > FtsZ2-1 > TUBB > Actin > Tubulin for W82 and cons6 > cons4 > FtsZ2-1 > Actin > TUBB > Tubulin for Jack (Table S7). When all the samples were analyzed together the stability rankings of the six genes were cons6 > cons4 > FtsZ2-1 > TUBB > Actin > Tubulin (Table S8). As a result cons6 and cons4 were ranked as the most stably expressed genes while Tubulin was ranked as the least stably expressed genes under all the experimental conditions. Since all the V-values were larger than the threshold of 0.15 (Fig. S34) we recommended cons6 and cons4 be used as the reference genes in soybean under Xag treatment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDQzMTM1NDIxMDA0OTkx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microbial water quality improvement associated with transitioning from intermittent to continuous water supply in ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135421004991 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDQzMTM1NDIxMDA0OTkx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Significantly Sánchez did not visit the capital Washington D.C. nor did he publicly meet with Joe Biden or any other official representative of the US government. Instead he met with investment bankers hedge fund managers and other major corporate heads. Sánchez was traveling not as a representative of the Spanish people as is usually presented in the capitalist media but as a lackey in the service of Spain’s banks and corporations.

The explicit aim of the trip was to attract investments from large vulture funds and other possible US investors. Using the 140 billion euros Spain expects to receive in European Union (EU) bailout funds in exchange for massive attacks on the working class—pension and labour reforms and austerity—the PSOE-Podemos governments hopes to obtain an additional €500 billion in private investment.

During his visit Sánchez met with a long list of banks and fund managers: Ares Management Corporation Bank of America Blackstone Group Bank of New York Mellon Brookfield Asset Management Roko Capital Management J.P. Morgan Catterton Partners Lone Star Funds Morgan Stanley Providence Equity Partners Soros Fund Management Wellington Management Group and also the US Chamber of Commerce in Spain.

Sánchez offered all of them guarantees that he will continue his attacks on the working class. In Spain Podemos promotes the lie that a new labour reform is part of “social measures” to improve working conditions but in the United States Sánchez made clear that he intends to escalate attacks on workers.

As El País explained “The Prime Minister explained to them that the labor reform agreed with Podemos and also negotiated with Brussels will mean that Spain is moving towards the German model of labor relations where there is social peace but also flexibility for employers to adapt to circumstances through the use of furlough schemes without redundancies.”

By German model of labor relations Sánchez really was talking about the notorious Hartz laws which created conditions for the emergence of a huge low-wage sector. This in turn served as a lever to smash wages and working conditions wiping out many thousands of well-paid industrial jobs. The result of the “model” hailed by Sánchez has been an explosion of social inequality. In Germany there are 136 billionaires and 542000 millionaires. On the other hand 13 million people live in poverty the highest number since German reunification in 1991.

Sánchez boasted to investors that pro-Podemos unions will suppress the class struggle El País added: “Sánchez explained to them that Spain is a country with few strikes with social peace and constant negotiation between employers and unions.” In other words the trade unions play a fundamental role in suppressing the class struggle and working with big business to impose wage cuts plant closures and pension reforms.”

He also told them not to worry about his government’s new housing law. This was of special interest to these hedge funds: Blackstone is Spain’s largest landlord with more than 40000 homes out of the nearly 240000 managed by hedge funds in Spain while Lone Star owns around 15000. Pedro Sánchez made clear that he had no intention of limiting their profits by regulating rents.

This issue affects millions of workers and youth. According the Platform for those Affected by Mortgages (PAH) since 2008 there have been more than one million evictions in Spain.

In addition to the real estate sector other groups such as J.P. Morgan Morgan Stanley Providence or Wellington have strong investments in various sectors such as mobile telephony energy banking food and other sectors in Spain. But it is global investment fund BlackRock that has the largest slice of Spain’s economy with €17 billion worth of shares in 18 of the 35 companies of the IBEX-35 Spain’s principal stock market index.

BlackRock is the world’s largest asset management corporation with $9 trillion in assets under management as of June 2021. It holds stakes in almost all major multinational companies including Coca-Cola Microsoft Monsanto and Apple among others. To understand its size and influence it is enough to say that if it were a country it would be the world’s third largest economy by size. Its president and CEO Larry Fink is known as “the fixer” for being the person who “fixes things in the financial market.” Sánchez reportedly held a private one-on-one meeting with Fink.

Podemos has covered for Sánchez’s visit. Podemos leader and Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda Díaz declared “I suppose they have talked about taxes” adding that this is “the only interesting thing about a visit to a large investment fund.” She concluded “The president has done his job” then cynically explained “Investment funds are in the world to make money and governments especially progressive ones are there to improve people’s lives.”

Díaz’s cynicism has no end. She and her government have done nothing but work tirelessly with the collaboration of the trade unions to benefit these investment funds. The examples are many.

Spanish banks laid off 15000 workers in the first six months of this year all rubber-stamped by the trade unions and endorsed by Díaz herself. This has allowed the banks to announce last week €4 billion in profits which will keep BlackRock and the IBEX-35 happy.

The monthly rise in electricity bills that is ruining millions of workers green lighted by the PSOE-Podemos government is benefiting large Spanish corporations like Iberdrola. The latest pension reform signed by the government and trade unions with the employers opens the way towards the privatization of pensions through company pension plans—in line with the aggressive promotion of these schemes by the hedge funds in Spain and throughout Europe.

These hedge funds have also profited from the herd immunity policy pursued by Madrid and the European Union prioritising corporate profits over workers’ lives. While these firms made billions in profits the cost in human lives of this policy has been over 100000 deaths in Spain and over 1.1 million across Europe. Europe is now confronting a new wave under the virulent Delta variant as capitalist governments across the continent continue to aggressively reopen the economy.

Sánchez’s visit to America confirms the warnings that the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) has made about pseudo-left parties like Podemos and their political satellites. Workers cannot expect anything from Sánchez Podemos the trade unions or their political satellites. They defend the interests of the billionaires and the big multinationals. The critical question is the struggle to give a political perspective to workers for a struggle against the pseudo-left by forming sections of the ICFI in Spain and throughout Europe.",,,,,,,,,

Significantly Sánchez did not visit the capital Washington D.C. nor did he publicly meet with Joe Biden or any other official representative of the US government. Instead he met with investment bankers hedge fund managers and other major corporate heads. Sánchez was traveling not as a representative of the Spanish people as is usually presented in the capitalist media but as a lackey in the service of Spain’s banks and corporations.

The explicit aim of the trip was to attract investments from large vulture funds and other possible US investors. Using the 140 billion euros Spain expects to receive in European Union (EU) bailout funds in exchange for massive attacks on the working class—pension and labour reforms and austerity—the PSOE-Podemos governments hopes to obtain an additional €500 billion in private investment.

During his visit Sánchez met with a long list of banks and fund managers: Ares Management Corporation Bank of America Blackstone Group Bank of New York Mellon Brookfield Asset Management Roko Capital Management J.P. Morgan Catterton Partners Lone Star Funds Morgan Stanley Providence Equity Partners Soros Fund Management Wellington Management Group and also the US Chamber of Commerce in Spain.

On that day Boeing was launching its brand-new CST-100 Starliner spacecraft to the ISS on an uncrewed demonstration mission. Along with SpaceX’s Crew Dragon Starliner was set to become NASA’s go-to option for ferrying astronauts to and from Earth’s orbit.

That didn’t happen. Starliner made it to space but a computer glitch sank the spacecraft’s chances of actually getting to the ISS. Though it came back to Earth in one piece a couple of days later it was clearly not ready for human missions.

Now Boeing is going for a high-stakes redo of that mission. On August 3 Orbital Flight Test 2 or OFT-2 will send Starliner to the ISS again. The company cannot afford another failure.

“There is a lot of credibility at stake here” says Greg Autry a space policy expert at Arizona State University. “Nothing is more visible than space systems that fly humans.”

The afternoon of July 30 was a stark reminder of that visibility. After Russia’s new 23-ton multipurpose Nauka module docked with the ISS it began firing its thrusters unexpectedly and without command shifting the ISS out of its proper and normal position in orbit. NASA and Russia fixed the problem and had things stabilized in under an hour but we still don’t know what happened and it’s unnerving to think what could have happened if conditions had been worse. The whole incident is still under investigation and has forced NASA to postpone the Starliner launch from July 31 to August 3.

It’s precisely this kind of near-disaster Boeing wants to avoid for OFT-2 and any future mission with people onboard.

How Starliner got here

The shutdown of the space shuttle program in 2011 gave NASA a chance to rethink its approach. Instead of building a new spacecraft designed for travel to low Earth orbit the agency elected to open up opportunities to the private sector as part of a new Commercial Crew Program. It awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build their own crewed vehicles: Starliner and Crew Dragon respectively. NASA would buy flights on these vehicles and focus its own efforts on building new technologies for missions to the moon Mars and elsewhere.

Both companies hit development delays and for nine years NASA’s only way of getting to space was by handing over millions of dollars to Russia for seats on Soyuz missions. SpaceX finally sent astronauts to space in May 2020 (followed by two more crewed missions since) but Boeing is still lagging behind. Its December 2019 flight was supposed to prove that all its systems worked and that it was capable of docking with the ISS and returning to Earth safely. But a glitch with its internal clock caused it to execute a critical burn prematurely making it impossible to dock with the ISS.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ib2VpbmctNzc3LTMwMC1wb3B1bGFyaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Wasn't The Boeing 777-300 Popular?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ib2VpbmctNzc3LTMwMC1wb3B1bGFyaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VyZWYuY29tL3NwYWNlLWNvbW1lcmNlL2JvZWluZy1zdGFybGluZXItYXdhaXRzLWxhdW5jaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing Starliner Awaits Launch,"Boeing Starliner

Editor’s Note Aug. 3 2021: NASA and Boeing have stood down from the Aug. 4 launch opportunity so mission teams could examine valves in the CST-100 Starliner propulsion system that were in unexpected positions. Mission teams have decided to roll the Atlas V and Starliner back to the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) for further inspection and testing.

Editor’s Note: This advisory was updated on Aug. 2 to reflect that media participation in the postlaunch news conference will be via phone only due to enhanced COVID-19 protocols.

Editor’s Note: This advisory updates the original advisory issued July 16 2021.

NASA will provide coverage of the upcoming prelaunch launch and docking activities for the agency’s Boeing Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2) mission to the International Space Station. OFT-2 is the second uncrewed flight for Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft as part of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program. The mission is targeted to launch at 1:20 p.m. EDT Tuesday Aug. 3

Starliner will launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. About 30 minutes after launch Starliner will perform its orbital insertion burn to begin its daylong trip to the space station. The spacecraft is scheduled to dock to the space station at 1:37 p.m. Wednesday Aug. 4. Launch and docking coverage will air live on NASA Television the NASA app and the agency’s website.

The spacecraft will carry more than 400 pounds of NASA cargo and crew supplies to the space station. It will return to Earth with more than 550 pounds of cargo including the reusable Nitrogen Oxygen Recharge System tanks that provide breathable air to station crew members.

OFT-2 will demonstrate the end-to-end capabilities of the Starliner spacecraft and Atlas V rocket from launch to docking to a return to Earth with a desert landing in the western United States. The uncrewed mission will provide valuable data toward NASA certifying Boeing’s crew transportation system for regular flights to and from the space station.

The deadline has passed for media accreditation for in-person coverage of this launch. More information about media accreditation is available by emailing: ksc-media-accreditat@mail.nasa.gov.

The United States had developed the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber but there was still more work to do. So Boeing one of the United States’ most capable defense aircraft developers went to work.

The company’s Phantom Works division created the Boeing Bird of Prey a single-seater black project stealth aircraft that looks like the most futuristic plane ever developed. It’s not -- but it sure looks like it.

Boeing’s Bird of Prey looks part F-22 Raptor and part science fiction-inspired deep space fighter. Not much is known about the experimental fighter aircraft’s true purpose. Even less is known about the specific technologies it might have been testing. Its association with Phantom Works and being developed and constructed at Area 51 means the skies are the limit for UFO junkies and big tech enthusiasts.

Figuratively speaking that is. For all we know we're still working on sending this guy back home (Image by Pawel86 from Pixabay)

Despite its cool futuristic appearance and the technologies it might have been testing the program was a relatively cheap one for the aircraft manufacturer. At just $67 million dollars the Bird of Prey is considered a “low-cost” program for a defense contractor.

What is known about the Bird of Prey is that it was a stepping stone in the development of low-observable technologies and aircraft design. Some of its “revolutionary” design elements were later incorporated into the X-45 unmanned combat aerial vehicle one of the earliest tested drones developed by the Air Force.

The X-45 program was the first test the technology needed to “conduct suppression of enemy air defense missions with unmanned combat air vehicles.""

Developing the Bird of Prey and its associated technology first began in 1992. The aircraft took its first flight in 1996. It never received an x-plane designation because it was never a true military test aircraft but the tech it tested might later have been integrated into the F-22 and the F-35 fighters.

It’s also believed the Bird of Prey tested active camouflage technology for planes which would allow it to change colors luminosity or appearance mid-flight to blend into its environment.

Although the Bird of Prey was potentially packing a wide array of unknown and probably still-classified technologies keeping costs down meant using commercially-available engines and manual controls as opposed to computerized controls.

Aside from classified future technologies the Air Force also says its tested tech that is now considered “industry standards.” This includes the lack of a horizontal tailplane and a conventional vertical rudder which is used in later experimental stealth drone aircraft.

Boeing Phantom Works is an advanced prototyping arm of the aircraft manufacturer that has worked on a number of advanced vehicles and technologies including the Boeing X-51 Waverider hypersonic vehicle and concepts for an as-yet unnamed sixth-generation joint strike fighter.

The Bird of Prey was officially ended before the turn of the 21st Century even though it looks the part of an aircraft from this era. After (presumably) being stripped of all the nifty tech that would allow it to evade ground sensors (and maybe the naked eye) it officially ended its career in the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

Let's see Ben Stiller deal with this museum coming to life (U.S. Air Force)

Visitors to the massive aircraft and air power museum can see the Bird of Prey in the Modern Flight Gallery – near its successor aircraft the X-36 flight demonstrator and the museum’s F-22 Raptor.

LOS ANGELES -- Sunday night is Disney Night on ""American Idol"" and your top 5 are getting the experience of a lifetime.

Guest mentor Kane Brown joins the team at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando where the contestants will sing not one but two beloved favorites from the Disney Songbook. Brown says that Disney magic is everywhere.

""I think the most special thing about this is actually being at Walt Disney World getting to meet the contestants and got (sic) to ride some rides!""

A highlight of the trip for Brown? Watching the iconic fireworks show. ""For ten minutes I felt like nothing was going on in the world and it was a nice feeling.""

Kane has an interesting history with ""American Idol."" He actually auditioned for the show more than a decade ago but they rejected him. Fast forward to present day and he is a wildly successful country music artist whose hit single ""Miles On It"" with Marshmello just became the most-added song on both country and pop radio simultaneously. They are the first male artists to achieve this.

The superstar knows what it takes to make it and is sure to steer the contestants in the right direction.

""My advice for the top 5 heading into Disney Night would be bring your all 100% confidence own the stage show everybody you're a star.""

Two contestants will be eliminated and the remaining three will compete in the finals airing May 19th.

Watch ""American Idol"" Sunday LIVE at 8pm ET/ 7pm CT/5pm PT on ABC and stream the next day on Hulu.

Don’t panic when stocks collapse.

That investing maxim proved absolutely correct during the rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic panic of early 2020.

Remarkably shares of 57 of the 75 largest North Carolina-based public companies increased by at least 30% during the year ending June 30. Five tripled in value while another 12 doubled. The star performer was Belmont-based Piedmont Lithium which shot up more than 11-fold aided by a big contract to supply electric automaker Tesla.

Only four of the 75 stocks lost ground during that period.

We expanded this annual list from 50 companies to 75 this year reflecting the market’s increased bullishness.

A dozen companies are new to the list led by No. 7 Trane Technologies which was spun off from Ingersoll Rand. Trane is based in Dublin Ireland but senior executives work in Davidson. Five newcomers emerged after initial public offerings: nCino Driven Brands Krispy Kreme Bioventus and Fathom Holdings.

Other newcomers include companies that relocated their headquarters. Hayward Holdings moved from New Jersey Phreesia from New York and Avaya from California.

Departures included Raleigh-based BMC Stock acquired by Builders First Source and Charlotte-based Extended Stay America which was sold to Blackstone and Starwood Capital.

Old Dominion Freight Line SPX PRA Health and Cree repeated as four of the best stock market performers over the past five years. PRA was acquired in July by Ireland-based Icon while PPD and Select Bancorp have also announced plans to be sold.

We appreciate great support in compiling this report from Matt West of Capital Investment Cos. of Raleigh.

Celine Dion Elton John Cher Bette Midler and Shania Twain have also performed at the venue.

Usher added dates in August (Aug. 4 6-7 11 and 13-14) after his early shows sold out.

He will return for a holiday run Dec. 28-29 and Dec. 31-Jan. 1.

LAS VEGAS – In a blur of blue sequins and sunglasses Usher hustles down a walkway between aisles of grabby fans trailed by security and camera operators as he unfurls the aptly named show opener “My Way.”

In less than a minute he’s bopped on stage fleet-footed as always with a formation of dancers ready to join him in lockstep for the swooping “Caught Up” one of his numerous club hits that entices with its smash-up of pop and R&B.

It’s been two weeks since the debut of Usher’s residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace the hallowed musical domicile fashioned for Celine Dion nearly 20 years ago (2003) that has hosted Elton John Cher Bette Midler Shania Twain and a handful of other vaunted stars with catalogs robust enough to engage fans and high rollers alike.

And the multi-threat performer realizes that his inclusion among those who are – or could be – known by a single moniker is significant.

'I thought he was joking':T-Pain reveals he fell into four-year depression after Usher criticized his use of Auto-Tune

“To be greeted with the excitement of people who want to get out after being locked down the past year – and the fact that I’m playing a venue where legendary artists have played – it’s all just an honor” Usher told USA TODAY shortly after landing back in Las Vegas from the Los Angeles home that is his base during these shows. “Even as a kid when I would look back and hear about Sinatra or Elvis (Vegas) was always the place they went. This is the planned destination for anyone who considers themselves an artist who has made a contribution.”

Along with Bruno Mars (playing at Park MGM) Usher marks the return of the megastar residency to the Strip where he's been greeted with sold-out shows. His August dates (Aug. 4 6-7 11 and 13-14) were added because of demand; he returns for a holiday run Dec. 28-29 and Dec. 31-Jan. 1.

How has Las Vegas changed? 5 things that are different because of COVID

While Nevada reinstated its indoor mask policy on July 30 a sizable sampling of The Colosseum crowd that night ignored the mandate despite the valiant reminder efforts of ushers (no relation).

Usher even joked from the stage to some compliant fans in his eye line “I know how hard it is to breathe in that damn mask but nothing can keep us apart.”

Masked or not fans danced and shouted along for the hour and 40 minutes that Usher rolled through dozens (sometimes snippets) of his more than 50 charting singles. His liquid dance moves – still a marvel of elegant pirouetting and hip-hop-inspired nimbleness – were often accompanied by the contributions of an impressively limber cast of ladies a few shirtless dudes and Usher’s pure undiminished voice.

Some highlights from the show:

Usher's residency brings touch of the ATL to Vegas

Though he spent his early years in Chattanooga Tennessee Usher is definitively Atlanta where he’s built his career and family. During “U Remind Me” he sported a baseball cap jauntily tipped on his head with a signature “A” emblazoned on the front.

A fleeting bit of a song from fellow Atlanta luminaries OutKast was tucked into the segue to “Don’t Waste My Time” which found Usher and two dancers roller-skating across the massive stage in a choreographed routine worthy of Broadway. It was both a nod to his youth spent at Atlanta’s Cascade Skating Rink (the backdrop of the 2006 movie “ATL”) and to one of his dancing heroes Gene Kelly.

“All of the things in the show are inspirations from things I’ve done on video and also the culture of Atlanta” he says adding that fellow Atlantan (and “Yeah!” buddy) Lil Jon helped him curate the production. “I feel like that culture is exciting from the idea of skating culture to adult entertainment to music.”

The latter two were showcased during “Bad Girl.” “Hey Vegas I brought you Atlanta!” Usher yelled gleefully during a segment influenced by the city’s famed strip club Magic City. Red- and pink-lit platforms poles and ladders provided the backdrop as Usher frolicked among a sea of gyrating derrieres. The segment ended with his headline-making “Ushbucks” floating from the rafters to “make it rain” in the venue.

At 42 Usher is still a specimen of physical dedication

The multi-pack he bares during “Nice & Slow” would make any gym rat envious – and pouring a bottle of water over his already sweat-slicked body is the kind of “Magic Mike” eye-roll-with-a-smile move so fitting for Vegas.

His workouts with a personal trainer are specified to “core strengthening like an athlete” Usher says.

No doubt that Usher’s showmanship is supreme and his leonine athleticism a hallmark of his performances. But never let it be forgotten that he possesses one of the most vibrant and malleable voices in music.

Even with a healthy assist from backing tracks during the show (his three band members were perched on platforms flanking the stage but did not add vocals) Usher’s leads were impeccable.

Coming soon:Usher talks 'Confessions 2'

He can bounce through rap-sung club bangers such as “Yeah!” and “DJ Got Us Fallin’ in Love” with the required swagger. But give him a hand-held mic and an open stage and whether it’s “U Remind Me” or the emotionally devastating “Burn” Usher will reign.

His joy of being onstage is palpable throughout the vigorous show and Usher is dedicated to entertaining his fans but also reminding himself why he’s embracing the pressures of this high-profile gig.

“I want to make sure I educate you on who I am (with this show)” Usher says. “I am an entertainer and entertainment is a long game. Whether you’re AC/DC or James Brown or the Grateful Dead or The Temptations you love it ‘til the day you die.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd2duby5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3dhdGNoLW1vbnN0ZXItamFtLWJyaW5ncy1mYW5zLW9mLWFsbC1hZ2VzLXRvLWNhZXNhcnMtc3VwZXJkb21lLXNhdHVyZGF5LW5pZ2h0L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd2duby5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3dhdGNoLW1vbnN0ZXItamFtLWJyaW5ncy1mYW5zLW9mLWFsbC1hZ2VzLXRvLWNhZXNhcnMtc3VwZXJkb21lLXNhdHVyZGF5LW5pZ2h0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch: Monster Jam brings fans of all ages to Caesars Superdome Saturday night,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://wgno.com/news/entertainment/watch-monster-jam-brings-fans-of-all-ages-to-caesars-superdome-saturday-night/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd2duby5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3dhdGNoLW1vbnN0ZXItamFtLWJyaW5ncy1mYW5zLW9mLWFsbC1hZ2VzLXRvLWNhZXNhcnMtc3VwZXJkb21lLXNhdHVyZGF5LW5pZ2h0L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd2duby5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3dhdGNoLW1vbnN0ZXItamFtLWJyaW5ncy1mYW5zLW9mLWFsbC1hZ2VzLXRvLWNhZXNhcnMtc3VwZXJkb21lLXNhdHVyZGF5LW5pZ2h0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVhZHZvY2F0ZS5jb20vYmF0b25fcm91Z2Uvb3Bpbmlvbi9reWxlLWZyYW5jZS13ZS1uZWVkLXRvLWNvbnRpbnVlLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi1pY29uaWMtbG91aXNpYW5hLXN1cGVyZG9tZS9hcnRpY2xlX2E2ODc4NmM0LWYwYTgtMTFlYi1iYmVmLWZmMjE0OGQ2MDA0OC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kyle France: We need to continue to invest in iconic Louisiana Superdome,With the topple of the first domino later this week in Baton Rouge the Saints football team could either be in New Orleans for the next 30 ye…,https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Monster Jam: monster truck gladiators compete in Caesars Superdome - The most American of sports?,"Surely one in five attendees at Saturday’s event are currently dreading the end of summer vacation and the return to elementary school. Young Rohan Anderson clutched a miniature version of his favorite monster truck – the speckled ""Monster Mutt Dalmatian"" – as he waited in a concession line. Anderson said that the best thing about monster trucks is “when they’re going on a jump.” Upon landing the heavy vehicles rely on “their suspensions” he explained. “Then sometimes” he said “they go backwards.”

Asked if monster trucks are too noisy his eyes widened with a look that separates the cognoscenti from the dilettante. Of course they’re not too loud he said without speaking. Of course they’re not.

Saturday’s monster truck rally began with the giants swiftly circling the infield of the Dome the way elephants used to chase around the inside of the tent before a circus. After that the drivers competed in short timed races and demonstrated individual stunts. But the payoff was the freestyle event that concluded the rally in which drivers pushed their mounts to the limit in a sort of fossil fuel-gobbling interpretive dance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zdGluY3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vY2hlci1wYXlzLWhlci1mcmllbmQtaWRvbC10aW5hLXR1cm5lci1hbi1pbnRpbWF0ZS12aXNpdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cher Pays Her “Friend & Idol” Tina Turner An Intimate Visit • Instinct Magazine,"There is absolutely nothing like seeing some of our favorite divas team up and we have been lucky enough to see the iconic Cher & Tina Turner team up a number of times on stage (who can forget their iconic Divas Live performance where they were joined by fellow icon Elton John)!?

Top-performing CEOs can transform sinking businesses into profit-making corporations — but not all leaders have the magic touch. Some CEOs are now known for turning failed companies around whereas others are largely credited with the demise of the corporation they founded or led.

One company currently facing an uncertain fate is Tesla led by CEO Elon Musk. The savvy electric car company beat Wall Street earnings estimates for the first quarter of 2021 Investors Business Daily reported. However it was the sale of regulatory credits and Bitcoin and not electric vehicle sales that drove the company’s profits.

Although Musk noted in the Q1 earnings statement that Tesla would begin delivering its Model S vehicles in May it was June before delivery began. And now barely a week before Tesla is due to announce its Q2 earnings deliveries are on hold according to Electrek with no clear indication of how long or why. But experts see positive signs for the company ahead of the July 26 earnings release.

The ship named after the line's original passenger vessel circa 1972 has tons of modern touches.

Notably the new-build boasts six neighborhoods. If you've sailed on Royal Caribbean's Oasis-class vessels the concept might sound familiar to you but Carnival has taken a slightly different approach by incorporating amenities like a two-deck tiki bar a brewpub the first roller coaster at sea and an area called the French Quarter with a New Orleans jazz-and-jambalaya ambiance.

In the French Quarter on Deck 6 aft four outposts tie the area together. Here I'll walk you through each.

Fortune Teller Bar

This mystical watering hole is shrouded in dark hues and features a menu of 17 standout drinks that are gimmicky but tasty. One of the most popular the Crystal Ball -- a combination of Herradura Silver Tequila Green Chartreuse agave nectar and lime -- packs a punch but its allure comes in the form of a giant smoke bubble that sits on top. Poke it with your finger for a surprise that will elicit a round of oohs and ahhs.

Other fun tipples include the color-changing Abracadabra (Bacardi Superior with pineapple and lime) Bayou Smoke (Remy Martin 1738 Cognac spiced peach shrub Bayou Satsuma Liqueur and Regans Orange bitters No. 6) and Bog Juice (Absolut Vodka passion fruit kiwi pineapple lemon and Sierra Mist). They're reasonably priced ranging from $9.50 for a classic Hurricane to $12.50 for some of the more showy options.

You can enjoy your beverages at the bar or at nearby high-top tables or booths set in front of crushed red velvet walls that are adorned with golden mirrors. The mysterious atmosphere is rounded out with crystal ball decor and bartenders who tell ghost stories and conduct palm readings.

In a partnership with famed chef Emeril Lagasse Carnival brings his first-ever at-sea restaurant to Mardi Gras. Its name Emeril's Bistro 1396 is a nod to the construction of the vessel which was built at Finland's Meyer Turku shipyard. Before the ship was named it was simply dubbed vessel 1396 -- the 1396th ship the yard had created.

Passengers can walk up to the counter place an order and have their food delivered to one of several bistro-style tables in the area.

Menu items range from $5 small plates like fresh seafood ceviche and fried oysters to slightly larger portions of barbecue shrimp sausage gumbo and red beans with rice. The latter range in price from $3 to $8 and can be topped off with $4 desserts that include lemon icebox pie and bananas foster among others. There's also a children's menu with $3 portions of fried chicken tenders pasta and Emeril's ""Who Dat"" Burger. Beverage options include beer wine and coffee as well as nonalcoholic selections.

The Brass Magnolia

The Brass Magnolia will make you feel like you're in a New Orleans jazz club complete with cushy red velvet chairs trumpet lights and live music that screams Big Easy.

The drink menu provides a selection of wines as well as cocktails. Among the considerable number of specialty options are Sazerac (Sazerac Rye Whiskey Hennessy VSOP Cognac sugar Peychaud's Bitters and Herbsaint) a Pimm's Cup (Pimm's No. 1 Cup fresh lemonade Sierra Mist and a cucumber garnish) a Praline Truffle (Absolut Vodka Praline Liqueur Chocolate Liqueur cream and Kahlua) and Brandy Milk Punch (Hennessy VSOP Cognac heavy cream whole milk simple syrup and vanilla extract). All cost $9.95.

This refined bar located next to the Flamingo Restaurant main dining room is a great place to relax and unwind with an adult beverage before or after dinner.

Whether you're a kitchen whiz who likes to show off their skills or someone who needs a cooking lesson or two Carnival Kitchen puts you in a real culinary setting under the supervision of an onboard chef who will teach you how to whip up some delicious dishes.

Follow along with your own set of ingredients and instructions as the chef prepares themed meals that vary by day. The cost is $30 per person and on our sailing options included a tailgate party with canapes on the menu and a pit grill smoke class where barbecue was the name of the game.

It was a really big month for Carnival Cruise Line in particular as its new mega-ship Mardi Gras entered into service on July 31.

Friday we got a sneak peek at all she had to offer during a special party thrown by Carnival but the few hours we’d spent on board were sort of a whirlwind of ribbon cuttings food tastings and glances at the map to try and figure out where we were.

I’ve been on almost every ship in the Carnival fleet over the years and know them well enough that I could almost navigate them blindfolded. But Mardi Gras is a different story.

You’ve heard me and others talk about how this is a “game-changer” for Carnival and it’s really not an exaggeration. Everything about this ship is different including the things that are the same.

For example you know I love Guy’s Burger Joint. It’s usually one of the first places I head after boarding and I know to just wander over to the Lido Deck and it’ll be there next to the pool.

Not on Mardi Gras! Here it’s one deck up from the main pool having been relocated to make room for the new trio of Street Eats “windows.” But more on that later this week…

READ MORE: Photos From Carnival’s VIP Mardi Gras Party

The point is this ship takes what you know and shakes it up. It’s sort of like that thing brides and their attendants do before a wedding: “Something old something new something borrowed and something blue.”

The old is familiar venues like Guy’s the BlueIguana and the Alchemy Bar. The new is everything from the roller coaster Rudi’s Seagrill (at which I’ll be eating tonight). In the “something borrowed” category we have the six “zones” which is similar to the “neighborhood” concept on Royal Caribbean’s Oasis-class ships.

And the something blue is the ocean on which we’ll be sailing and the beautiful new livery which if we’re being honest is a major improvement over the former white hulls which were sort of bland and showed a ship’s age a little too easily.

One thing that hasn’t changed is the fact that you’re still boarding a Fun Ship… and that was especially true today. After an incredibly seamless embarkation process that saw us stopping just once to show our paperwork we were walking up the gangway and onto the ship. The second we stepped on board masks came off music was playing and drinks were flowing.

Yes the crew are required to remain masked at all times. And while some people on message boards have complained about this it’s not too tough to tell that the crew is thrilled to be welcoming guests again.

The ship wasn’t going to set sail until around 6:30 p.m. so we had all afternoon to explore before that happened. Our first stop? The new RedFrog Tiki Bar on the Lido Deck for a Fun Ship Special.

You can tell we were on the ship pretty early because look not a chair hog (or the items they inevitably leave behind to save their spot) in sight. We also strolled over to check out another of the pools at Summer Landing.

We were going to head to the Fortune Teller’s Bar (in the French Quarter zone) next but realized that before doing that we needed to complete the muster drill. Carnival’s new policy (which is kinda brilliant) is to cut off your Sail & Sign card (including your access to booze and shopping) after two drinks until after you’ve completed the safety drills.

Having already watched the required videos all I needed to do was report to my station and get what basically amounted to a personal explanation of how to use a life jacket in case of emergency. Two minutes later we were off to our next stop.

From the moment that Eddie Allen Vice President of Beverage Operations first told me about the Fortune Teller’s Bar I was intrigued. You can’t really have a French Quarter-themed section of your ship without some serious cocktails and a little bit of magic both of which come together in wildly unpredictable ways here.

It was right around this point that I forgot we’d have a whole week to try everything the ship has to offer including the many (many many) specialty cocktails that were rolled out specifically for Mardi Gras. I was treating this like a sprint instead of the marathon it would be.

But you know what they say: In for a penny in for a pound! So after making sure to feed the machine by swinging by Big Chicken (the Shaquile O’Neal grab-and-go restaurant on board with some seriously good sandwiches that are going to give Guy’s Burger Joint’s offerings some stiff competition especially since both are complimentary)…

… we were ready for the next stop.

Like the Fortune Teller’s Bar the Alchemy Bar is the kind of place you go when you want something different than you’ll find at all the other bars on board. They don’t serve wine they don’t serve beer and don’t even think about asking for a soda. The mixologists here don’t sling drinks they craft cocktails.

It was around this point that I realized we still had a few hours until sailaway and that left plenty of time for a nap. Which makes me realize now that I haven’t yet shown you my stateroom. So when I booked this sailing I went with an inside stateroom because it was the most afforadable.

Regular readers know that I’m not really someone who spends a lot of time in the cabin so this was fine for me. And I have to say the inside staterooms on this ship are beautiful.

I’ve always thought that blue was the perfect accent color for cruise ship staterooms. After all most of us are there because on some level we love the ocean right?

From the runner on the bed to the artwork everything gives you that nice calm blue. I also really like the light circling the mirror. It’s a simple design touch but again goes to show how much thought went into details and how the end process of that was a general elevation.

I’m also a very big fan of the fact that even interior staterooms have actual shower walls and doors as opposed to plastic curtains. I’ve never been a fan of shower curtains

All in all this is probably the nicest inside stateroom I’ve ever stayed in complete with a whole lot of nice little touches like numerous USB ports and a cool little reading light beside the bed.

Although truth be told I shouldn’t say that I “stayed in” this room because since the ship was sailing at reduced capacity Carnival offered to upgrade me to an ocean suite.

By now it was time for sailaway so I headed for a quiet spot toward the front of the ship. Despite the fact that this is the fourth cruise I’ve done in the past five weeks I’m still incredibly aware of how meaningful this particular trip is.

Not only is it the first sailing of a new ship which is always special but it’s also the first ship to be sailing out of Port Canaveral with paying passengers on board.

Obviously that’s a big deal for Carnival given that they had basically no revenue during the shutdown. But it’s also huge for Port Canaveral and all of the people whose livelihood was impacted by the fact that there were no ships sailing no tourists spending money… this ship — and all the ships that will follow — sailing out of Port Canaveral will have a huge impact on the local economy of not only this particular port but all those we’re going to visit.

Before long it was time to head down to Brass Magnolia — another of the new bars in the French Quarter — were a great little jazz trio was playing. I didn’t get their name or their picture so as I keep saying yet another reason for you to stay tuned as the week goes on.

A group of us then headed for dinner in Rudi’s Seagrill. While chef Rudi Sodamin has had restaurants on ships within the Carnival Corporation (specifically Holland America) this is his first on a Carnival Cruise Line vessel. It’s really appropriate that this being a Fun Ship and all the first thing you see when you sit down at the table is these beautiful plates which give a bit of a hint as to what you can expect.

The name probably tipped you off but this is a seafood restaurant. That’s not all they have on the menu — meat lovers can get a pork chop or a steak for example — but seafood’s definitely what you come here for. The cost is $38 per guest and if the meal I had is any indication well worth it. I went with the muscles and a fantastic stuffed lobster.

Although I didn’t get the lobster mac and cheese you have to see the way it’s served. It comes in this very cool serving dish…

… which you open before diving in. I wonder if they sell these in the gift shop? While it would be tough to take them home in your luggage without breaking off the legs (especially if you were getting enough for say a family) I bet they’d fly off the shelves.

I wound up skipping dessert (which you know is not at all like me!) because we were running a little late and I wanted to catch the Playlist Production Evolution of Rock. (And again regular readers know that’s not really like me given that I’m not much of a show guy.) Evolution of Rock was pretty much what you expect from these kind of shows.

Some singing some dancing some special effects. I have to give it props for keeping me interested long enough to stay to at least the halfway point. If you’ve ever seen a show with me and seen the way I start to twitch about 15 minutes in you know this is a pretty positive review.

After that it was over to the atrium — which at night serves as another show venue — to catch Chris Williams (aka the Flying Scotsman) hosting the Welcome Aboard Show.

Truth be told as this was the late version of the traditional first-night presentation there weren’t an awful lot of people in attendance. That didn’t stop Chris and the rest of the team from bringing as much energy as if the place was packed to the rafters.

By this point I was pretty exhausted and ready to call it a night. And even as I was heading back to the stateroom I realized just how much of the ship I hadn’t seen… which makes me realize as I’m typing this how much of it I haven’t shown you!

We haven’t even started to explore!

Fortunately tomorrow’s a sea day which means we’ll have plenty of time to poke around.

So until then…

The warships left Britain two months ago and are on a 42000km (26000-mile) mission that will continue until the end of the year.

HMS Queen Elizabeth and its strike group are in the South China Sea for freedom of navigation exercises and a series of military drills with a number of other countries in the region.

The presence of Britain’s new aircraft carrier and scheduled permanent deployment of two warships to Asia reflects the country’s ambition to become a major global player and its commitment to US plans to contain China according to military analysts.

“The strike group’s journey from Europe to Asia can be seen as a political show. It should stay home to cope with the Russian navy instead” Zhou said.

However Macau-based military observer Antony Wong Dong said London had used the maiden voyage of its strike group to try to rebuild its credibility and highlight its commitment to joining France Germany and the Netherlands in supporting the US’ freedom of navigation efforts and operations in the South China Sea.

The US and China have been at odds in the contested waterway where Beijing has territorial disputes with a number of neighbours including Vietnam and the Philippines.

“The high-profile visits and joint naval drills along its journey from home to the contested South China Sea is [a sign of] the Royal Navy’s resurgence after decades of contraction. It’s good training for the British navy” Wong said.

“The US welcomed Britain’s support in containment against China because Washington understands London’s influence in the region due to its former glory of being the ‘empire on which the sun never sets’.”

Carrying more than 30 aircraft the strike group embarked on its maiden voyage in late May taking part in military exercises with French US Canadian Danish Greek Israeli and Italian forces as well exercises with South Korea Japan and Singapore.

Addressing an event sponsored by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore on Tuesday US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said both Britain and the US were “global nations with global interests”.

“As we look to balance our efforts in various parts of the world we are not only looking to help each other in the Indo-Pacific but we are looking to ensure that we help each other in other parts of the world as well” Austin said.

“Resources are scarce no matter which country you are talking about. But again we have a global perspective and there are a number of places we have helped each other as we shift our stance.”

Collin Koh a research fellow with the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore said the ongoing deployment of the strike group to Asia had highlighted London’s new “Global Britain” approach in the post-Brexit era.

“[The deployment] definitely showcases that [Britain] continues to be one of the world’s major military powers” he said. “It definitely serves as a reminder that London has long-standing interests spanning centuries in this part of the world.”

But the two warships to permanently support US freedom of navigation operations in the Asia-Pacific would not be considered “high-end platforms” Koh said.

“They are actually offshore patrol vessels that are optimised more for lower-intensity operations that would be tailored more for this region” he said.

“[Britain] continues to devote more attention to its neighbourhood in Europe. While it has exited the EU London is still a major Nato power.”

Lu Li-Shih a former instructor at Taiwan’s Naval Academy in Kaohsiung noted that the British carrier strike group did not provoke Beijing on its maiden voyage by entering the Taiwan Strait.

“The strike group’s journey to Asia is a political gesture to indicate London’s response to the US’ China containment strategy but the British navy is careful not to provoke Beijing” Lu said.

“The strike group’s joint exercises with so many countries from the Commonwealth nations along its long maiden would help London to rebuild its military supply and logistic coordination system with Nato and other allies.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS9kYWlseS1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDcvMzEvdXMtbmF2eS1zYXlzLWRyb25lLXN0cmlrZS1oaXQtb2lsLXRhbmtlci1vZmYtb21hbi1raWxsaW5nLTIuaHRtbNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS9kYWlseS1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDcvMzEvdXMtbmF2eS1zYXlzLWRyb25lLXN0cmlrZS1oaXQtb2lsLXRhbmtlci1vZmYtb21hbi1raWxsaW5nLTIuaHRtbD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Navy Says Drone Strike Hit Oil Tanker off Oman Killing 2,"DUBAI United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. Navy explosive experts believe a “drone strike” targeted an oil tanker that came under attack off the coast of Oman in the Arabian Sea killing two on board the American military said Saturday.

The strike Thursday night on the oil tanker Mercer Street marks the first-known fatal attack after years of assaults on commercial shipping in the region linked to tensions with Iran over its tattered nuclear deal. While no one has claimed responsibility for the attack Israeli officials alleged Tehran launched the drone strike.

While Iran did not directly acknowledge the attack the strike comes as Tehran now appears poised to take an even tougher approach with the West as the country prepares to inaugurate a hardline protégé of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as president.

The American nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and the guided missile destroyer USS Mitscher were escorting the Mercer Street as it headed to a safe port the U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet said in a statement early Saturday.

“U.S. Navy explosives experts are aboard to ensure there is no additional danger to the crew and are prepared to support an investigation into the attack” the 5th Fleet said. “Initial indications clearly point to a (drone)-style attack.""

The 5th Fleet statement did not explain how it determined a drone caused the damage although it described its explosive experts finding “clear visual evidence that an attack had occurred” aboard the Mercer Street. The U.S. military's Central Command did not immediately respond to a questions on the evidence.

The drone attack blasted a hole through the top of the oil tanker's bridge where the captain and crew command the vessel a U.S. official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as an investigation into the attack still was ongoing.

The Mercer Street is managed by London-based Zodiac Maritime part of Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer’s Zodiac Group. The firm said the attack killed two crew members one from the United Kingdom and the other from Romania. It did not name them nor did it describe what happened in the assault. It said it believed no other crew members on board were harmed.

British maritime security firm Ambrey said the attack on Mercer Street had killed one of its team members on board the vessel.

The Mercer Street empty of cargo had been on its way from Dar es Salaam Tanzania to Fujairah United Arab Emirates at the time of the attack Zodiac Maritime said. The attack targeted the tanker just northeast of the Omani island of Masirah 185 miles southeast of Oman’s capital Muscat. Oman's state-run news agency late Friday described the area as “beyond Omani regional waters” and said its forces responded to the tanker's mayday call.

Zodiac Maritime described the Mercer Street’s owners as Japanese without naming them. Shipping authority Lloyd’s List identified the vessel’s ultimate owner as Taihei Kaiun Co. which belongs to the Tokyo-based Nippon Yusen Group.

Israeli officials who spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren’t authorized to talk to the media blamed Tehran for the attack. They offered no evidence to support their claim.

Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid tweeted late Friday that he spoke with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab about the “need to respond severely” to the attack although he stopped short of directly blaming Iran.

“Iran is not just an Israeli problem but an exporter of terrorism destruction and instability that affects the whole world” Lapid wrote. ""We can never remain silent in the face of Iranian terrorism which also harms freedom of navigation.”

Other Israel-linked ships have been targeted in recent months as well amid a shadow war between the two nations with Israeli officials blaming the Islamic Republic for the assaults.

Israel meanwhile has been suspected in a series of major attacks targeting Iran’s nuclear program. Also Iran saw its largest warship recently sink under mysterious circumstances in the nearby Gulf of Oman.

Thursday’s attack comes amid heightened tensions over Iran’s tattered nuclear deal and as negotiations over restoring the accord have stalled in Vienna. The series of ship attacks suspected to have been carried out by Iran began a year after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018.

The attack on the Mercer Street also came the night after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaking from Kuwait warned Iran that talks in Vienna over the nuclear deal “cannot go on indefinitely.”

This is the second time this month a ship tied to Ofer apparently has been targeted. In early July the Liberian-flagged container ship CSAV Tyndall once tied to Zodiac Maritime suffered an unexplained explosion on board while in the northern Indian Ocean according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.

In a complaint filed on Wednesday with the Federal Maritime Commission Easton Pennsylvania-based MCS Industries a maker of household furnishings also accuses China’s COSCO Shipping Lines Switzerland’s MSC Mediterranean Shipping and their competitors in the Asia-U.S. trans-Pacific trade of violating the U.S. Shipping Act since the beginning of the pandemic while increasing profits at the expense of their customers.

“MCS has experienced this misconduct by global ocean carriers firsthand as they have unreasonably refused to deal and negotiate with MCS” the company stated in its complaint. “In a stark break from pre-pandemic practice several ocean carriers refused to negotiate or provide service contracts to MCS and those that did provide such service contracts including Respondents [COSCO and MSC] refused to provide more than a fraction of the cargo capacity that MCS requested and needs despite the fact that the Respondents overall have continued to operate at or near pre-pandemic capacity.”

To make matters worse MCS states COSCO and MSC “then proceeded to engage in a common practice of refusing to perform even under those limited service contracts instead forcing MCS to buy space on the inflated spot market.”

The spoofing seems to be happening but who’s behind it and why?

The potential for international incidents

On June 18 of this year a system used to track the locations of vessels on the open ocean showed two NATO warships steam out of port in Odessa Ukraine near midnight under cover of darkness. The two ships one British Destroyer and one Frigate from the Royal Netherlands set course through the Black Sea to Sevastopol the strategic headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea fleet.

Before long the HMS Defender and HNLMS Evertsen had closed to within just two nautical miles of the Russian port in what seemed like one of the most brazenly aggressive acts taken by NATO warships in recent memory. Parking so close to the epicenter of Russia’s military might in the region would almost certainly prompt a response. Indeed later that same week Russian warships would claim to fire warning shots at the very same British destroyer in the very same region.

Sending these ships so close to a Russian Navy base could have resulted in an even more aggressive response from Putin’s forces than warning shots. There was just one thing stopping them…

The HMS Defender and HNLMS Evertsen never actually left port.

At the time this spoofing of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) was reported in the news but the story quickly slipped back beneath the surf as other more pressing stories reached the news cycle. Soon most had forgotten about the unusual signals seemingly sending a NATO ghost fleet straight into the heart of Russia’s regional defenses. That is until July 29 when a joint analysis from the non-profit SkyTruth and Global Fishing Watch was released showing that this was no fluke nor was it an accident.

In fact they claimed to have discovered a trend of over 100 warships flagged from at least 14 different nations that have had their locations “spoofed” or faked since August of 2020. Many of these ships are European and American but not all. In fact at least two have been from the Russian Navy. More pressing these fake signals often show these warships entering contested waterways or the sovereign territory of other nations.

“Analysis of tracking data from Automatic Identification System broadcasts reveals vessel locations have been simulated for a number of ships including military vessels” the report reads.

“This false information could compromise vessel safety decrease confidence in a crucial collision avoidance system and potentially spark international conflict.“

Faking the location of an entire carrier strike group

Last September the Royal Navy’s new flagship the carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth was shown on the same Automatic Identification System sailing alongside a bevy of warships from allied nations the Netherlands and Belgium. The carrier strike group comprised of six total vessels could be seen clearly on the publicly available tracking information heading for the Irish Sea.

But satellite imagery of their location on that day at that time shows nothing but waves and surf: no ships no crews nothing but water.

The ships being tracked by the AIS alongside the British carrier were:

HMS Duncan

HMS Albion

Dutch HNLMS Rotterdam

HNLMS Johan de Witt

Belgian BNS Leopold I

As you might now expect that fleet and their entire voyage also never existed.

“This flotilla of massive warships should have made quite a striking picture on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. However the image coinciding with the AIS transit dates seen below shows none of the six naval vessels. Furthermore several publicly posted photos and news articles show that these vessels were in port elsewhere at the time” SkyTruth’s report goes on.

The Automatic Identification System

The system being spoofed called the Automatic Identification System (AIS) is an automatic tracking system that pulls data from transceivers installed in every ocean-going vessel. The data is collected by satellites overhead and aggregated for use in maritime safety efforts (to avoid collisions) and increasingly to identify vessels that are violating international sanctions and the like. While this system isn’t the primary means of preventing a collision onboard most ships (collision avoidance radar fills that role) this data is widely leveraged for everything from logistics to criminal investigations.

But it would seem that someone has found a way to fool this system into seeing ships that aren’t there even fabricating entire voyages. Bjorn Bergman a data analyst with SkyTruth and Global Fishing Watch first identified nine Swedish naval vessels sailing south of Karlskrona that weren’t really there on February 4 and 5 of 2021. As he poured over the data he found an unusual pattern in the code so he used it to create a search query to identify any other potential fakes out on the seven seas.

“The results were alarming. Nearly a hundred U.S. and European naval vessels had track segments with the same AIS pattern as the false tracks of the Swedish navy ships near Karlskrona” he wrote.

“Over the past few months I dug into this data using all available sources to confirm vessel locations and identities. I confirmed false AIS positions for 15 navy vessels from seven countries with many more vessels suspected of having fabricated positions.”

The nations with apparently faked warship positions include:

United States

UK

Belgium

Lithuania

Estonia

Germany

Russia

The Netherlands

Bergman used publicly available images of the ships satellite imagery and even formal confirmation from national navies to determine the actual location of the confirmed fakes but confirming them all is difficult. Some ships don’t have many photos taken of them in port or the suspected fakes are beneath a thick layer of cloud cover satellites can’t see past.

With more than a hundred potential “ghost ships” shown in AIS in recent months Bergman has yet to find a single one with the unusual code pattern that he can prove was actually there.

It’s important to note that warships are known to turn off their AIS transponders which makes locating them more difficult but until recently no one had ever spotted fake transmissions before.

Who would fake warship positions and why?

Because the majority of faked ship signals seem to be from NATO nations often showing them behave aggressively toward Russia the inclination is to assume that Russia has a had in this effort. After all Russia is perhaps best known in the 21st century as a Grey Zone power often leveraging cyber campaigns and hacking to achieve their geopolitical aims.

“Confirmed and suspected false AIS segments show incursions by 11 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and NATO allied warships into Russian territorial waters near Kaliningrad and Murmansk as well as within the disputed territorial waters around Crimea in the Black Sea” the report states.

If indeed Russian in origin the effort could be aimed at presenting NATO nations as aggressive bolstering Russia’s repeated claims that accusations about the nation’s aggressive behavior including attempted assassinations on foreign soil and the military annexation of Crimea in 2014 are more about international bullying than Russia violating international norms.

Russia has long relied on an information operation strategy known as Reflexive Control wherein they flood the media (and now social media) with conflicting information and intentional disinformation all aimed at driving the recipient to an intended conclusion that they feel as though they arrived at organically. Russian efforts to manipulate the 2016 presidential election as one example has become a controversial subject in American politics with many Republicans often downplaying Russia’s meddling and many Democrats presenting it as nothing short of a foreign-backed insurrection. The truth however was that Russia’s aim was less about putting Trump in the White House and more about diminishing the American public’s faith in its electoral process and government as a whole.

In that regard one could argue that their Reflexive Control strategy was a rousing success.

The AIS system isn’t so heavily relied upon that these ghost readings could spark a war but they are so widely leveraged that they could almost certainly be used to substantiate aggressive behavior in response to what appears to be a Naval incursion. In other words these ghost readings could be about painting Russia as the victim of international prodding.

“We are aware of manipulation of AIS tracking data placing Carrier Strike Group vessels in areas where they were not” a spokesperson for the UK Ministry of Defence told WIRED.

“There was no operational impact on any of the vessels but AIS is the commercial global safety system for all marine traffic. Any manipulation could result in a serious incident.”

However at least two Russian ships also seem to have been spoofed in the past year. That doesn’t eliminate Russia as a possibility but it does muddy the proverbial waters.

It’s not over: The USS Roosevelt was spoofed on July 15

We’re not talking about an isolated incident but rather an ongoing situation. As recently as July 15 the USS Roosevelt an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer was shown on AIS to be sailing into Russian territorial waters near Norway while the vessel itself was actually hundreds of miles away training with members of Norway’s Navy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1c2F2aWFpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hZXJvZmxvdC1ncm91cC1yYW1waW5nLXVwLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aeroflot Group Ramping Up Operations,"Recovery of the Russian air travel market is gaining traction. According to the latest report by the country’s aviation authority Rosaviatsiya in the first half of 2021 Russian airlines carried collectively 44.093 million passengers down only 23.5 per cent on the same period of the pre-crisis 2019. Even more the figures have improved to just 11.9 per cent below the ‘norm’ in June up from 19.7 per cent in May. Sluggish restart of international travel due to slow reopening of national borders has led to shift of demand onto the domestic travel destinations. Whilst the international segment is still notably below the 2019 activity hardly reaching quarter of the pre-pandemic levels with 5.87 million passengers the domestic passenger traffic for the first six months of 2021 has already exceeded the same period of 2019 level by 15.2 per cent.

AEROFLOT GROUP SHIFTS FOCUS ON LOW-COST DIVISION

During first six months of 2021 Russia’s largest airline group Aeroflot was accountable for 18.557 million passengers or 42 per cent of the country’s traffic. The June results for the entire group which includes flagship Aeroflot low-cost carrier Pobeda and Rossiya Airlines were just 17.8 per cent below same month of 2019 to 4.6 million passengers. Amazingly the domestic segment has improved 29.9 per cent on 2019 level reaching 3.9 million passengers.

The group’s title carrier Aeroflot primarily focused on international premium service segment is still being affected by the pandemic aftermath. The demand plagued by continued uncertainty of wide border opening and declining household income is shifting towards low fare travel. The group has therefore adapted its strategy to foster the growth of its low-cost division Pobeda Airlines. Russia’s only LCC served 1.393 million passengers in June – an incredible 53.8 per cent up on the same month in 2019. The seat load factor for Pobeda has reached 94.5 per cent (versus 80 per cent average for the entire group). To support that growth the group is optimizing its fleet strategy whereby 50 of Aeroflot’s Boeing 737-800s are being transferred to the budget division’s fleet. The hand-over of 14 aircraft scheduled for this year has been completed in time for busy summer. To further improve fleet utilization these aircraft have remained at Aeroflot’s Moscow Sheremetyevo base (IATA: SVO) and a code-sharing agreement is now in place between Aeroflot and Pobeda.

UNLEASHING THE DOMESTIC MARKET POTENTIAL

Aeroflot in the meantime is also reshaping its business to unleash the full potential of Russia’s significant domestic market. In advance of the summer travel season the airline has launched an inter-regional flight programme featuring an array of new leisure destinations in the south of Russia including flights from 13 cities across the country to resort destinations on the Black Sea. Passengers from Arkhangelsk Chelyabinsk Samara Kazan Murmansk Novosibirsk Perm Ekaterinburg Tyumen Ufa Orenburg Syktyvkar Surgut can now benefit from direct connections to holiday destinations Sochi Simferopol Anapa Krasnodar and Rostov-on-Don. Frequencies on existing routes have been nearly doubled. Another popular tourist attraction Lake Baikal is served by direct flights to Irkutsk from Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

On the other part frequencies of flights from country’s capital and largest city Moscow to towns in Ural Siberia Far East and Volga Region (including Irkutsk Khabarovsk Krasnoyarsk Niznevartovsk Yekaterinburg Samara etc.) have doubled or even tripled on some routes. The intense summer schedule is promoting domestic travel supported by the Russian government’s incentives. “The development of transportation between Moscow and federal districts to the East of Russia’s central European part is a priority of Aeroflot’s strategy aimed at providing enhanced connectivity of the country’s remote regions and improved mobility of the Russian population at large” the airline says in a statement.



GEARING UP FOR INTERNATIONAL RECOVERY

Whilst streamlining its domestic operations Aeroflot is also preparing for the imminent relaunch of international travel. Several major overseas markets for leisure tourism including Turkey and Egypt have already opened up for Russian customers. But the major hope for full-fledged recovery is linked to the vaccination process which is gaining momentum in Russia. Efforts are also underway for mutual validation of vaccines. If this work is completed within several months borders may re-open with Europe and China before the end of the year.

In the meantime to help facilitate international travel Aeroflot and Rossiya became first Russian airlines to test IATA Pass. Aeroflot is staging a month-long experiment using the digital health document from July 19 to August 19 on flights between Moscow and London. Owing to the IATA Travel Pass app to be installed by travelers on smartphones pre-flight formalities will take less time. The IATA Travel Pass contains all the details of traveler’s health required for the flight including results of COVID-19 PCR tests. The company credits 5000 bonus miles to travelers using the app during the test period.

Gearing up to cater for the pent up demand Aeroflot has launched hub operations at its new Krasnoyarsk base (IATA: KJA). The hub’s inauguration service features five destinations in Russia – Krasnodar Simferopol Blagoveshchensk Sochi and Irkutsk served by Boeing 737-800s but the hub’s beneficial geographical location in the heart of Siberia and at the crossroads between Europe and Asia holds potential for gradual expansion by transporting international travelers. More than 100000 passengers are expected to use Aeroflot’s first regional hub in the summer of 2021. The launch of the international hub in Krasnoyarsk is a milestone for both our airline and the whole of Russia’s transport system” asserts Aeroflot CEO Mikhail Poluboyarinov. “The air hub means new opportunities for our passengers reduced travel time and fewer connections per trip attractive air fares and all the possibilities of our Group’s route network.”

At Sheremetyevo the airlines major hub all of Aeroflot’s flights have been transferred to Terminal C adjacent to Terminal B which serves domestic flights. This facilitates transfer for connecting passengers and offers increased capacity to Aeroflot as air travel recovers.

FLEET MODERNISATION ON TRACK

As demand is forecast to recover gradually Aeroflot Group has resumed its fleet modernization and optimization programme. This year the group expects to take delivery of 34 brand new aircraft including 19 for the flag carrier Aeroflot (six Airbus A320neo three A321neo seven A350 widebodies and three Boeing 777-300ERs).

According to the group’s new strategy Airbus New Engine Option narrowbody family aircraft will make the core of Aeroflot’s new fleet. The A320neos are powered by CFM’s LEAP-1A26 engines and configured with 156 seats including 12 in business class. The A321neos have 196-seat cabin layouts including 12 seats in business class. The A350-900s powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 engines feature three-class cabin configurations with 28 seats in business 24 in comfort and 264 in economy class.

As of June 30 2021 the group had 344 aircraft in its combined fleet. The group is planning to phase out 24 older aircraft this year.

AEROFLOT NAMED STRONGEST AIRLINE BRAND GLOBALLY BY BRAND FINANCE

Aeroflot has again been named the strongest airline brand globally in 2021 by Brand Finance the world’s leading independent brand valuation consultancy recognizing the stable positions and growth potential of the Russia’s national carrier in the global market despite the aviation’s worst crisis. The airline has been at the top of the rating since 2017.

Brand Finance noted that Aeroflot retained its market positions and a strong presence in consumers’ mind despite reduced air travel. Analysts emphasised the Russian airline’s new strategy encompassing gradual aircraft fleet renewal.

Aeroflot scored a very strong 89.5 out of a possible 100 on Brand Finance’s Brand Strength Index (BSI). This is equivalent to the ААА rating.

“Once again Aeroflot has been named the world’s strongest airline brand” Savio D’Souza Valuation Director Brand Finance said. “The airline’s strong and vast heritage paired with its constant strive to innovate and improve its strategy stand it in good stead to put itself in a solid position in the global airlines market once international travel restrictions ease.”"

Caterpillars are very good at two things. One is their near-miraculous ability to turn to goo inside a cocoon or chrysalis and emerge as a flying moth or butterfly days weeks or months later. The other thing is their amazing ability to quickly turn plants into protein.

Think of caterpillars as the cows of the natural world. They eat massive amounts of leaves that they quickly turn into the flesh of their bodies. If a baby human grew as fast as a Monarch Caterpillar it would be the size of a school bus in two weeks.

It’s not hard to find animals that want to take advantage of all that caterpillar protein to have as a snack or feed to their young. Most songbirds feed their babies a steady diet of insects especially caterpillars. One notable study by researcher Doug Tallamy found that one chickadee family fed their babies 350 to 570 caterpillars every day. That’s 6000 to 9000 caterpillars to raise one family of baby birds. Caterpillars and the plants they eat are one of the essential foundations of animal life.

Many many insects eat caterpillars as well. Wasps fly down and eat them. One of my favorite wasps the Potter Wasp creates little clay pots that it fills with an egg and paralyzed caterpillars that the baby can eat when it hatches. The half-inch-wide clay pots are hidden on garden plants rocks and trees where most people aren’t looking. Bugs also suck the juices out of the caterpillar leaving behind a skin that looks like a deflated balloon. Ants tear them apart and eat them.

Sometimes it is hard to believe that caterpillars ever grow up to be moths and butterflies since they are eaten by so many things. There are many ways caterpillars can keep themselves safe. Some use ingenious camouflage and look exactly like a twig or blend into the leaves. Others pretend to be snakes and have colors that help them look like tiny snakes.

Many caterpillars eat foods that make them taste horrible to some predators.

Monarch caterpillars for example famously only eat milkweed. This plant is full of toxic cardiac glycosides that the caterpillar incorporates into its body. These chemicals make any animal that has a backbone sick when they eat the Monarch. The caterpillars get the poisons to keep themselves safe from the plant they eat. This poison doesn’t work on invertebrates so the caterpillars are still eaten by ants spiders bugs and wasps. Research has shown that less than two out of ten Monarchs make it to the adult butterfly stage even with all the defenses they have against birds frogs and other animals with spines.

Some caterpillars keep animals away with sharp spines or irritating hairs. The Io moth caterpillar has sharp spines to inject a venom into its predators that feels like a bee sting. This strategy is used by several caterpillars in the area though there are very few caterpillars that do this. I wouldn’t hesitate to let my own children pick up and look at any caterpillar in the area.

There are over 5000 butterflies and moths that live in the eastern half of the country. Of those well over a thousand live in the Northeastern United States. Many of these are just as persnickety about their food as Monarchs.

Many caterpillars eat only one family of plants or one species of plant. This makes caterpillar gardening an important part of butterfly gardening. My yard is filled with plants that were planted for caterpillars in an attempt to attract butterflies. Four species of milkweed attract Monarchs. Spicebush attracts Spicebush Swallowtails. Virginia Creeper attracts Eight-spotted Foresters and a variety of moths. The violets that grow crazy under the Redbud tree provide food for Fritillaries. Most important may be the oak tree my daughter planted in the corner of the yard as an acorn. Over 500 different caterpillars dine on oak according to biologist Douglas Tallamy.

Backyard ecosystems are important to understand. Caterpillars turn plants into the protein of their fast-growing bodies. Birds feed those caterpillars to their young which are also growing fast. The average songbird grows from egg to flying in less than a month a giant growth spurt mostly fueled by caterpillars and other insects.

While people say that birds feed their babies worms it is actually a more complicated topic. Children’s books would have you believe that the worm is a segmented worm popping out of the ground with a smile but the real worm that fuels birds is the caterpillar. Why do people call caterpillars worms? I have no idea but have known people all my life that do so. It is the caterpillar “worms” that are important to birds much more than the earthworms. Those caterpillar worms are remember fussy. Perhaps we should say the early bird gets the caterpillar instead of the early bird gets the worm.

Most butterfly and moth caterpillars will not eat trees from foreign lands. We are losing an essential part of our backyard ecosystem as we plant all of these plants from around the world. Gingkos Bradford Pears and Japanese Maples might look good but they add no food for caterpillars and may reduce the number of birds and other animals that depend on those caterpillars for survival.

Caterpillars and the plants they depend on fuel the growth of birds and other insects. Be kind to a momma bird and plant some food for caterpillars in your yard.

Mr Chahin said he had received several offers for the property before going to market. Around the corner at 393 Bridge Road on the corner of Coppin Street the car yard occupied by Thrifty car rental has sold for around $8 million.

Dante Michael LaVerde’s Hardware Hospitality group has taken a five-year lease with a five-year option on the 395 sq m two-storey building at 68-78 Hardware Lane with expectations of a post-winter-lockdown boom. Records show the building has been owned by some of the city’s top legal eagles former judges Ray Finkelstein and Ron Merkel since 1988 - the former currently presiding over an inquiry into Crown’s suitability to hold a gaming licence. The pair along with fellow judge the late Alan Goldberg bought the building when they were barristers with new chambers on nearby Queen Street. Fitzroys agent James Lockwood negotiated the lease which he called a strong vote of confidence in the CBD. Mr LaVerde who has more than 25 years in the hospitality business is embarking on a full refurbishment of the space and will also open a bar on the first floor.

It has a fully-fitted kitchen which Mr Lockwood said was a key attraction. Rents in the area are understood to be running at more than $250000 a year. It’s a big risk in the time of short sharp lockdowns but a representative said Mr LaVerde is keen to pull the local crowds after winter ends and is confident the interstate and international market will follow when it can.

The Gold Coast beckoned of course followed by Singapore in the 21st century. They’re expecting around $7 million for Lensworth House which will buy a lot of greasepaint and stage lights.

JLL agents Josh Rutman Nick Peden and MingXuan Li are handling expressions of interest which close on August 20. Two floors of the 1019 sq m building are vacant but the ground floor is occupied by long-time Queen Street Indian restaurant Nirankar.

Cherry Creek Schools will kick off the new school year with a one-to-one technology model for its students a dynamic that will see laptops in the hands of every student from first grade to high school. According to Huy Tran CCSD’s Director of Technology Services approximately 55000 laptops will be set to go into students’ hands by the time school starts in August.

This total includes about 40000 devices that were already in the district system as well as about 15000 new laptops that have come in part from a partnership with Microsoft Dell Computers CDW-G and Technology Integration Group or TIG.

“For the 40000 devices that are in the system now our technology team had to go to every school do an inventory clean them make sure they still worked. Then they had to reimage them or give them a clean operating system” Tran said. “On top of that the team had to work with our partners to ensure that the 15000 new devices were delivered to the right locations.”

Those new devices include Dell laptops for first-graders in the district and Microsoft Surface Go devices for older students. According to Tran elementary school devices will generally be school-based while middle school and high school students will be allowed to take devices home. Specific policy depends on the classroom and the school.

The one-to-one technology model aligns with the district’s overall vision of connecting every student with the resources and tools they need to succeed and pursue their pathway of purpose. Last year as the COVID-19 pandemic forced teachers and students to interact in new ways the district distributed thousands of laptops in a matter of weeks to ensure that Remote Learning operated efficiently.

The one-to-one model will build on that foundation offering students teachers and administrators alike new tools and expanded options as the CCSD comes together to kick off the 2021-22 school year.

Weeks before students report to classrooms across the district’s 108 square miles the response has already been impressive.

“The whole community is excited” Tran said. “We’ve received a lot of feedback from teachers and tech staff at schools across the district. They’ve been waiting for this for a long time.”

The HoverCam Solo 8Plus is a popular high-resolution document camera that can record up to 4K resolution at 30 frames per second as well as slow-motion video at 1280x720 resolution and 120 fps. For courses that may not require such advanced features the AVerVision U50 USB Flexarm is an affordable document camera and a bestseller.

If an educator is willing to part with traditional whiteboards interactive projectors and displays can help engage students by allowing them to collaborate on PowerPoint presentations. The interactive flat-panel displays in particular help online students feel connected to the traditional classroom while plug-and-play tools allow users to add video audio and images to lessons.

Digital signage is also becoming popular on college campuses and can be used to convey important announcements such as COVID-19 safety precautions and exam dates.

Software Considerations for Modern Higher Ed Classrooms

From desktop virtualization to improving learning management system integration with existing collaboration software tools investing in the right software solutions is just as critical for hybrid learning success. First university leadership must define the pedagogic approach and teaching strategy before IT teams can consider how students and staff will interact and collaborate. Once that’s determined it’s time to look for software that delivers on specific goals.

Broadly speaking a good virtual learning environment should stimulate in-person student discussions in college classrooms and offer a personalized learning experience. Examples include software for recording lessons; solutions for improving LMS integration with existing collaboration software tools; and creative apps such as student response systems for collaborative learning in synchronous environments.

Regardless of which technologies are chosen the utility should be informed by pedagogical considerations.

Hardware Tools for Managing the Device Flux

At this point most higher education institutions know that adequate hotspots and one-to-one (or even two-to-one) device programs are essential for hybrid learning success.

But universities and colleges may need extra help managing all of these devices. Tools such as Ergotron baskets for mobile work stands can help users easily move stacks of computers from one room to another. Other options include JACO printer mounts camera hanging mounts and flat-panel TVs that double as charging stations.

Another popular solution that saves both time and expense is a simple charging cart or tower. Whether for a building full of devices or just one classroom these space-saving cabinets can cheaply store and charge a large number of tablets and notebooks. Simply pile the devices on plug them in and they’ll be charged in time for the next class.

The Infrastructure and Cloud Solutions for Campus Readiness

In a Twitter poll posted July 8 EdTech: Focus on Higher Education asked readers to rank the IT investments with the greatest impact on student experience. Nearly 50 percent said Wi-Fi infrastructure.

But many institutions lack the manpower to navigate wireless preparation. One-to-one programs provided everyone with a laptop or other device; now most of these are coming back to campus. Is the infrastructure ready for this explosion of technology? One of the best ways to find out is by conducting a wireless site survey which can provide a roadmap for designing a network that can meet a campus’s specific needs.

To support hybrid learning colleges also need a robust compute storage and security infrastructure.

Institutions should also clarify the storage parameters governing cloud-based resources such as virtual meetings and online materials.

For cloud technologies there are three service models to consider:

Software as a Service: This delivery model offers e-learning software on a subscription basis.

This delivery model offers e-learning software on a subscription basis. Platform as a Service: This category of cloud computing provides hardware and software tools from third-party service providers.

This category of cloud computing provides hardware and software tools from third-party service providers. Infrastructure as a Service: This solution type supports services such as storage networking and virtualization.

Because these solutions support face-to-face communication with students anytime from anywhere they are ideal for asynchronous education. Students can pop in and participate in lessons around the clock.

With unlimited storage that’s accessible across devices all three as-a-service options can be scaled to accommodate a growing student base.",,,,,,,,,

In 2020 the Outcome Capital’s CRO Index (see Figure 2 ) comprised of large public CRO players who often command market share due to size scope and scale vastly outperformed the broader market as its performance was buoyed by COVID-19 testing research and therapeutic development. Interestingly the public markets have rewarded different strategies over the past year.Charles River Labs (+65%) has been rewarded for its aggressive growth by acquisition strategy while Medpace (+67%) has seen success by capturing the market share from smaller and medium-sized biopharma players.

The CRO market remains highly fragmented ( Figure 1 ) with approximately 52% of the market captured by smaller or niche service providers.Large players such as IQVIA LabCorp PRA PPD and Charles River Labs will continue to command significant market share but this fragmented market points toward consolidation from both the large strategic and financial buyers. The authors expect to see the trend of both vertical and horizontal expansion to persist for the foreseeable future. The majority of strategic acquisitions have been to capture specific niche or specialty services in a specific vertical.We have not seen any major CRO looking to move from the discovery/preclinical space to the clinical space or vice versa.

Prior to COVID-19 investments in the biopharmaceuticals industry increased consistently year-over-year for the past five years on the heels of technological advancements and attractive returns for investors. The authors see a more robust investment landscape post-COVID as the pandemic has increased awareness of the healthcare sector. With more scrutiny on pharma R&D pipelines the CRO and contract manufacturing organization (CMO) industry will continue to see growth. The clinical research segment will see a higher growth rate (8.1% 2018–2024 compound annual growth rate [CAGR]) (2) while the discovery and preclinical segment maintaining strong growth (7% 2018–2024 CAGR) (2) as biopharma players broaden their clinical pipelines.

Software and analytics will continue to have a greater influence in pharma services as more players look to leverage population data to help in enrollment and management of clinical trials. Acquires have already moved upstream to clinical trial management and analysis to complement traditional research and manufacturing capabilities. While the authors see the growth of the clinical segment outpacing that of preclinical services highly specialized players with expertise across the development value chain offer a more well-rounded value proposition to potential clients enabling them to lock in long-term alliances and capture more market share. However with a surge of investigational new drug (IND) filings in 2020 (more than 3800 in 2020 vs. approximately 3600 from 2012–2019) (1) the discovery/preclinical segment will remain very active in the years to come.

Outcome Capital a Boston-based life sciences advisory and investment banking group has been following the pharma services market dynamics for the past five years.The authors believe this fragmented market will give way to greater consolidation by both financial buyers looking to consolidate smaller players and larger CRO players wanting to expand into value-added specialty service areas. To secure future business larger CROs will move toward long-term alliances with major pharmaceutical and biotech companies which will put greater pressure on further market consolidation. Adding to this consolidation is a tepid fundraising environment opening the door for financial buyers to play a more active role in consolidating many of the niche players. The increased presence of financial buyers will also likely lead to greater initial public offering (IPO) activity in the next three to five years reversing a long industry trend.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shined a light on the healthcare industry particularly biopharmaceuticals which has created strong tailwinds for the pharma services industry. As money continues to flow into the biopharma sector and industry players look to outsource more of its value chain both contract research organizations (CROs) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) will continue to benefit. Additionally the advent of personalized medicine and the development of complex gene therapies have led to greater specialization by smaller CROs signaling a persistence in market fragmentation—a consistent theme seen over the past decade.

Over the past five years the number of M&A transactions has remained steady (see Figure 3); a few large mergers have skewed the total dollar value—2016 saw the $8.8 billion merger between Quintiles and IMS Health (now IQVIA) while 2017 saw the $4.6 billion merger of INC Research and InVentiv (now Syneos) and the $5B buyout of PAREXEL by Pamplona Capital.The wave of large transactions looks to be picking back up in 2021 as ICON announced its $12 billion acquisition of PRA Health Sciences and Thermo Fisher announced their acquisition of pharma services giant PPD for $17.4 billion. An area of consolidation has been around software solutions and analytical technologies used in the pharma services space. ICON noted PRA’s mobile clinical trial management software as a primary catalyst for the acquisition continuing the trend of technology acquisitions seen in 2019 and 2020.Both the IQVIA and Syneos mergers were driven by the need to deliver greater value through data and clinical trial analytics.Additionally the largest deal by a financial buyer (Astorg’s $1.8 billion buyout of eResearch Technology) also focused on clinical analytics.

While clinical trial software and analytics will continue to drive value traditional services companies still saw healthy activity over the past five years; however both strategic and financial buyers sought to acquire CROs and CDMOs with differentiated offerings either through specialized indications or breadth of services. Curiously CMOs have not been able to take advantage of advanced analytics or specialization and as a result their overall deal numbers and values have lagged. In the past five years only 23 CMO acquisitions have taken place for a total of approximately $1.3 billion (compared to 25 deals totaling >$5.8 billion for CDMOs and 70 deals totaling >$21.8 billion for CROs).

Over the past five years the number of CRO transactions remained relatively stable (see Figure 3) but the number of transactions seen in either the discovery/preclinical space or clinical space fluctuated widely from year-to-year along with the deal values (see Figure 4).The overall difference between discovery/preclinical (31 transactions) and clinical (34 transactions) were even despite each year having its own unique profile.Generally the clinical segment draws larger transaction sizes with >$18.3 billion in deal value (including 4 deals >$1 billion each) over the past five years.Companies with clinical trial management tools or analytical software drove most of the transaction volume with more than $14.7 billion across 23 deals.The discovery/preclinical segment had a total deal value of only approximately $2.1 billion (0 deals >$1 billion) over the same time period.

Many of the large industry players were active in the M&A markets from 2016–2020 with Charles River Laboratories (nine deals) LabCorp (five deals) ICON (four deals) Syneos (four deals) and Cambrex (three deals) leading the pack in deal counts.As previously noted clinical trial management enrollment and analytics were of particular interest as buyers looked to expand capabilities in the value chain. In addition to clinical trial management LabCorp used its acquisitions to expand its focus into medical technology and diagnostics services to diversify its biopharma offerings.Conversely the most active buyer Charles River Labs has continued to focus on a vertical acquisition strategy and has focused its efforts on broadening its capabilities in the biopharma discovery/preclinical segment.Charles River Labs consistently accessed the M&A market for growth spending more than $2 billion with at least one transaction in each of the past five years. Similarly Cambrex used M&A to solidify its market position as a leading CDMO with all three of its acquisitions focused on CMOs.

Financial buyers active and hungry

The COVID-19 pandemic has also created a tailwind for financial buyer activity in pharma services especially as biopharma players of all sizes have gained more attention from investors and the public at large. There were several large buyouts in 2020 including Astorg’s $1.8 billion transaction for eResearch Technology KKR’s $1.0 billion buyout of PCI Pharma and Ares’ $500 million buyout of ArchiMed.There were 10 buyouts in 2020 and it became the most active year for buyouts since 2017 (10 deals) when the industry saw a flurry of large deals from both strategic and financial buyers including Pamplona Capital’s $5 billion acquisition of PAREXEL.In total financial sponsors accounted for 34 deals from 2016–2020.

While strategic buyers placed significant interest in data management and clinical trial software financial buyers focused on traditional CRO services to roll-up the offerings into a larger and more diversified company.However increased financial buyer activity will likely be seen in analytics offerings as data management’s importance in the value chain continues to grow.The trend is starting to emerge with three of the four analytics buyouts completed in 2020. Compared to strategic buyers financial buyers also put more emphasis on expanding manufacturing capabilities as 14 of the 34 deals were buyouts of manufacturing companies.Of the 14 manufacturing deals eight had a primary focus on medical technology signaling a potential diversification strategy to capture another market segment.With the rise of robotics in medical technology this trend will likely continue in the near-term.

Of the approximately 50 financial sponsors participating in deals from in the past five years no other firm has been more active than London-based GHO Capital which completed four deals over the period. GHO has been in the process of building a comprehensive biopharma services platform as its deals spanned most of the value chain from discovery/preclinical to clinical services and manufacturing. As the industry continues to garner attention the authors expect to see more financial buyers following GHO’s strategy which will lead to a larger IPO pipeline in the next three to five years.

Capital markets are waiting on the sidelines

Given the lack of intellectual property in the pharma services space along with the consultative nature of the businesses growth capital is typically unavailable to the sector.As a result the financing landscape has remained tepid with only eight companies raising a combined $270 million over 12 rounds of equity. Of the eight companies five were developers of clinical trial software tools while the other three focused on scaling manufacturing capacity.The authors expect to see more clinical trial analytics companies accessing more traditional venture capital but a vast majority of pharma services companies will need to rely on organic growth over a long period of time to achieve scale; in fact CROs and CDMOs had an average time to exit of 22 years and 27 years respectively.

Additionally the public markets have not been a viable path for traditional pharma services either.The only companies that have successfully completed an IPO were large diversified companies with geographic scope and economies of scale.Notable IPOs during the authors’ analysis include large players Medpace (2016) and PPD (2020).With the continued interest of financial buyers consolidating the CRO and CMO market it seems likely that an IPO exit strategy could be a target for the financial buyers for their aggregated companies.

Conclusion

Both the CRO and CDMO segments will continue to see long-term sustainable growth and will remain an active area for consolidation. The larger strategic players will need to continue to grow by acquiring specialized services and technologies to improve efficiency. Outcome Capital believes the market may start to see larger strategic CROs engage in a bolt-on acquisition strategy and will also look to move from strictly focusing on either the discovery/preclinical or clinical space to becoming highly integrated to capture large long-term pharma and biotech partnerships.This integrated strategy will allow the service provider to capture more value. Financial buyers will continue to look to consolidate specialty research and clinical services to build out a larger offering to either make those companies attractive for a future IPO or acquisition by the larger strategic players.This market will remain frothy with activity over the next three to five years and we will continue to see consolidation and growth.

But if you care about the future of our Earth the power of your dollar isn't just limited to buying recycled goods. You can take the same approach when it comes to investing. Socially responsible investing (SRI) — which also goes by other names like environmental social and governance (ESG) investing as well as impact investing— is a way to put your hard earned dollars to work that considers both your financial returns and overall impact on the world around you. In fact socially responsible investing has piqued the interest of many investors and the trend continues to grow. At the beginning of 2020 U.S. assets under management that engaged in ESG investment strategies grew to $17.1 trillion experiencing a 42% growth compared to the beginning of 2018. Tristan Blaine-Gonzalez a California-based small business lawyer is one of the millions of investors who engages in socially responsible investing. He believes that everyone including businesses need to work toward maximizing their positive impact. ""As an investor I want my money to go to companies that believe in these basic values. I also believe that these practices are simply good for business in the long run"" he says. Blaine-Gonzalez does his research by looking at companies that focus on green technologies are working toward being carbon negative or have a certified B-Corps status. Even though he uses Robinhood investors can go with almost any brokerage to build their own portfolio. If you're someone who's interested in aligning your values with your investments we'll go over the basics of socially responsible investing and how you can get started.

What is socially responsible investing?

Socially responsible investing refers to an approach to investing where the investor considers both the value of a company's broader impact on the world and its potential financial returns. ""[This type of investing category] is a way of investing that incorporates both an investor's desire to achieve a certain level of financial performance along with consideration of environmental social and corporate governance (ESG) factors that may generate a positive societal impact"" says Nicole Middleton Holloway CFP founder and CEO of Strategy Squad a wealth management firm. In other words these types of investments seek out companies that base their value on alternative energy sources social justice and environmental sustainability. It also excludes companies (such as tobacco manufacturers) that are known to do harm or aren't transparent in their business values. Plus it also encompasses several more specific approaches within the impact investing sphere. While both ESG and SRI look at a company's broader impact there are some distinct differences that affect the types of investments and an investor's overall portfolio. SRI investing is not as well defined as ESG investing says Tara Falcone CFA CFP® and founder of fintech company ReisUP. ESG investments are measured by and scored on specific environmental social and governance metrics whereas socially responsible investing is a bit subjective based on current issues in the political and social spheres she says. ""Many times SRI investments are assessed through an ESG lens."" More specifically ESG investing looks at specific factors such as a company's best practices when it comes to issues like pollution or child labor as well as the quality of its leadership. Socially responsible investing on the other hand takes these factors into account and also considers the investor's motives such as their personal values or political beliefs. Ultimately many investment portfolios take both elements of ESG and SRI investing into account which makes it up to the investor to choose how to invest with their dollars.

Benefits of socially responsible investing

One of the main benefits of socially responsible investing is that you can use your money to align with your values perhaps helping you sleep better at night. ""Investors interested in ESG or SRI investing probably have reckoned with the fact that we do not live in a just equitable society and they are looking for solutions to address these disparities"" Holloway says. ""ESG investing is powerful because it encourages investors to start engaging with their wealth in a different way becoming more aware of how they want to use their capital and resources to create a better world and what they want their legacy to be for future generations."" Falcone agrees and adds that it might also make it easier for you to stay invested for the long haul. ""Being confident with your investments gives you an emotional tie to them which may make it easier stay invested during periods of volatility when you might otherwise be tempted to sell"" she says. With ESG investing in particular you could potentially help earn better returns. That's because these types of investments use traditional financial analysis to weigh potential returns. Not only are you helping to improve a number of social and environmental issues your portfolio will help you build wealth for years to come.

Drawbacks of socially responsible investing

With any type of investing there are some potential risks. Sure you want to make sure your entire portfolio is composed of ESG or SRI investments but it may come at a cost. Falcone suggests being careful with balancing your values with your financial goals. For instance it's easy to hyper focus on a company's impact but neglect to look at the risk tolerance of an investment. ""If your portfolio is perfectly aligned with your values but doesn't have the proper allocation or return potential to achieve the goals you're investing for then it may not be the best investing strategy for you"" she says. Another potential downside is that there may be a lack of availability options. If you're looking specifically for ESG options you may be limited to what's offered with your retirement accounts. Holloway also adds that some may have minimum investment requirements which investors who are starting out may find hard to meet. With socially responsible investing you have more flexibility but you may be mostly on your own when it comes to researching investments that are the right fit. Even if there are ones vetted for you you may end up paying more fees to do so. ""There's a lack of universal ESG standards which makes it more difficult to evaluate investments through this lens and increases the expense ratios portfolio managers charge"" Falcone says. ""There also isn't much long-term performance data on ESG investments which makes it difficult to confidently project potential future returns."" Of course if you're willing to pay higher expense ratios that's fine as long as you're aware of what you're getting into.

How you can start building your own investment portfolio

Before you start investing it's crucial you define what your reasons are for investing in the first place and what your goals are. Then look at what resources you have available. Do you have an employer-sponsored plan like a 401(k)? Or do you want to open an IRA or taxable brokerage account? You'll also want to consider how much time and effort you want to put into making sure all your investments fall within the realm of ESG or socially responsible investing. If you want to be more hands off consider investing in socially responsible ETFs available with a few brokerages like Charles Schwab and Betterment. Seeking out an advisor who specializes in ESG or socially responsible investing is another great option. For those who are willing to commit more time researching Holloway suggests looking at a fund's management team (the more diverse the better) the company's track record and the goals of the companies within the fund. For example will you be helping to finance renewable energy sources? Or helping those in marginalized communities? Don't forget to look at the fees — see whether you're willing to pay a higher expense ratio or management fee. If so you can consider balancing it out with a fund with lower fees to ensure you're keeping most of your investment dollars. Whatever avenue you choose it's a good idea to start educating yourself on the basics of socially responsible investing given there are so many ways you can incorporate it into the way you invest. Holloway suggests going to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment website since it offers a lot of educational material and a free online course for individual investors. It is possible to achieve strong financial returns while sticking to your values. It may take some work to build a socially responsible portfolio but the effort is worth it.

And if you’ve been listening to company honchos and its soon-to-be mega-rich CEO Vlad Tenev this is what “democratizing” Wall Street is all about — letting its clients the littlest of the little-guy investors cash in on a hot IPO like those big nasty hedge funds have been doing for decades.

Power to the people right? I’m not so sure. In fact there’s a strong counternarrative bouncing around Wall Street circles that Vlad’s supposed noblesse oblige is anything but — and yet another example of when something looks too good to be true it usually is.

Tenev positions himself as a fellow following in the footsteps of his company’s namesake stealing from those rich Wall Street-types and giving stuff to us poors even as he’s setting himself up to be the latest 30-something billionaire tapping into the high-finance wealth machine.

He created Robinhood eight years ago as a way for average people to trade easily and seamlessly just like the big guys on Wall Street and with no commission. The company became a cultural touchstone during the pandemic lockdowns when many people had nothing better to do with their time than trade stocks.

What his loyal customers might not fully appreciate is that they trade for free only because the firm sells client trades to brokers who then match the buyers and sellers a practice known as “payment for order flow.”

Nothing illegal about that (at least not yet) nor immoral in my opinion. But let’s drop the sanctimonious BS: This “empowering the little guy” is doing a lot to enrich Wall Street’s ruling class.

Once you get past the myth of Robinhood’s eleemosynary foundations you can see that the IPO stunt is hardly the stuff that democratization is made of.

Most IPOs want shares to be placed with large institutional investors that hold them for the long haul. They are diversified mutual funds and asset managers that can withstand the vicissitudes of any nascent company’s fortunes that play out in hopefully rising share prices over a period of time usually years.

But Robinhood isn’t getting a lot of interest from those investors I hear. The big asset-management firms are not Robinhood’s customers and have no allegiance to the product. They’re looking hard at potential user growth during market downturns and regulatory risks.

While the Robinhood trading-app exponentially grew from thousands of “little guys” playing around with meme stocks like GameStop its business model is not sustainable at all. Christopher Sadowski

And I am told they didn’t like what they saw. Many were so skeptical about the business model that they decided they wouldn’t participate in the offering and might just short shares betting they can make money when the shares fall in price as they did Thursday dipping below the $38 IPO point.

As one large institutional investor told me “Robinhood’s business model is mezzo morto.” (Translation: Half dead.)

So Tenev makes a good show of giving his shares to the “little guy” when the little guy probably didn’t have much of a choice.

To become profitable Robinhood needs retail trading to grow exponentially like it did during pandemic lockdowns. Its competitors discount brokers like Charles Schwab E*Trade etc. are extremely profitable. A big reason why is they have commercial banks and other lines of business that allow them to make money under more adverse market conditions.

Something simple like the Fed having to start raising interest rates because of non-transitory inflation will hurt Robinhood’s growth. The minute the Fed moves rates higher it’s likely you can kiss goodbye to much of the meme-stock and crypto trading that is behind Robinhood’s amazing 200 percent surge in user growth in just the past several years (18 million customers at last count compared to just 6 million at the end of 2018).

To be fair during the company’s road show executives furtively conceded (in between a fair amount of chest pounding about customer growth etc.) that they are open to making changes as soon as the IPO is complete. They seemed to acknowledge that they need to rely less on payment for order flow which accounts for around 75 percent of the company’s revenues because after all Gary Gensler chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission isn’t a big fan of the practice.

So maybe Robinhood will at some point diversify its way into profitability and into large investors’ good graces. Robinhood executives have strongly hinted that they too could get into the payment-for-order-flow business by matching their own orders and skimming the difference in the bid-ask spread on stocks the way other market makers do.

Robinhood could also use some of that $2 billion in IPO cash to buy a bank a business that generally makes money when interest rates rise (and markets tumble) because banks charge more when they lend and are slow to raise rates on savings and checking accounts.

Lots of maybes for a company pushing the narrative that it’s poised for tremendous overnight growth while democratizing Wall Street.",,,,,,,,,

The book titled 'Power Play: Tesla Elon Musk and the Bet of the Century' by The Wall Street Journal reporter Tim Higgins claims that Musk reportedly wanted to become the Apple CEO in a 2016 phone call with Cook who suggested to Musk that the iPhone maker acquire the electric car-maker.

Musk reportedly said that he wished to become Apple CEO reports The Los Angeles Times quoting from the book.

In a tweet on Friday Musk denied that any such conversation ever took place.

""Cook & I have never spoken or written to each other ever. There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla. There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever"" Musk posted.

""He refused to meet. Tesla was worth about 6% of today's value"" the Tesla CEO added.

In a recent interview with The New York Times Cook had said: ""I've never spoken to Elon although I have great admiration and respect for the company he's built"".

Cook replied after Musk in December last year tweeted that he offered Cook to sell his electric car company at one-tenth of its value during the struggling period in 2017 but the Apple CEO refused to meet him.

Musk had said that during the ""darkest days"" for Tesla Model 3 he wanted to sell the company off.

""During the darkest days of the Model 3 programme I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting"" Musk had said in a tweet.

According to several sources with knowledge of the matter Shell has engaged Standard Chartered to sell its Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) subsidiary.

SPDC operates the company’s shallow-water and onshore asset interests with its 30% stake in the SPDC joint venture which supplies around 10% of Nigeria’s gas demand.

One of the sources said that the vendor is asking for non-binding offers in the subsequent second phase according to Arise TV.

Why Shell is divesting from SPDC

The sources had said that Shell is selling its Nigerian business because it no longer views its activities in the Niger Delta as core to its ongoing strategy which is driven by the Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) pressure from its investors.

This had earlier been corroborated by Shell’s CEO Ben van Beurdenearlier in May this year when he added that the oil giant was in talks with the Federal Government on the way forward.

The sources also said that several of the oil mining leases (OMLs) have upcoming development costs which Shell does not intend to fund. However the oil giant still hopes to retain its deepwater assets in the country.

A person will knowledge of the matter said that Shell wants full value offers for the business which is worth several billions of dollars and will likely prefer low execution risk as against waiting for a knockout offer. The business might be too large for a single buyer.

The valuation of the oil and gas firm can be derived from different views on the separate assets the shallow-water fields the onshore fields and the infrastructure for which there could be separate buyers.

Alternatively Shell may sell portions of equity in the whole of SPDC to different consortia of buyers with the intending buyers expected to have local Nigerian elements.

And everyone knows Coors Brewing Company started in Golden right?

Maybe. Even as Coors has long represented Colorado to beer drinkers outside the state thousands of new transplants may be surprised to learn that Coors is really actually from here along with dozens of other instantly recognizable brands whose beginnings have been obscured by time.

Some such as Samsonite or Mapquest were purchased by larger companies and relocated. Others like Chipotle Mexican Grill operated here for a quarter-century before picking up stakes and moving (in Chipotle’s case to Newport Beach Calif.).

Here’s a curated primer for some of Colorado’s biggest exports — edible quaffable or wearable — that represent the best of homegrown innovation. Some of their histories are well-known some not so much but all are proudly Colorado-born.

Jolly Ranchers

The weirdly resilient Jolly Rancher candy line was founded in Colorado 71 years ago but hardly anyone mentions it in roundups of local brands. That makes sense given that Jolly Rancher changed hands frequently over the years from Beatrice Foods to Leaf Candy Co. to current owner Hershey Co. — which shifted production of the hard candies out of Colorado and into Mexico and Canada after its 1996 purchase.

But for bragging rights it’s correct to say the company founded by Bill and Dorothy Harmsen in 1949 began in Golden and that its candy-making continued at a Wheat Ridge facility until 2002. Trick-or-treaters and dentists miss it at least.

Smashburger

In addition to Chipotle which fled to California in 2018 Colorado has exported multi-state restaurant chains like Noodles & Company Quiznos Qdoba Illegal Pete’s Tokyo Joe’s Snarf’s Snooze and Garbanzo Mediterranean Fresh. Still Smashburger — with its wildly customizable sandwiches uncommon ingredients and corporate tunnel-vision — has seen its name and concept go global in ways that most brands could only dream about.

As part of the fast-casual trend of the 21st century Smashburger opened its first brick storefront in Glendale in 2007 and expanded rapidly going head-to-head with fresh-burger staples like Five Guys and Steak ‘n Shake. The company currently boasts an estimated 200-plus stores in 34 states and territories according to data company ScrapeHero although that’s only about half of its high point in 2018.

Did we finally hit our limit with fancy hamburgers? Or are the new arrivals (to Colorado anyway) such as In-N-Out Burger and Shake Shack eating up the market? Analysts say it’s because the burger market is oversaturated and the company has blamed outside forces such as a weak retail environment despite its recent turnaround. On-site research is clearly required here with fries.

Celestial Seasonings

Few Colorado companies regularly rake in tens of millions of dollars while selling their products internationally but Celestial Seasonings has long and quietly been one of them according to business-data firm Dun & Bradstreet. The tea company which started in Boulder in 1969 dominates many grocery store shelves with its feel-good colorful packaging and well-known blends. Red Zinger or Sleepytime anyone?

While it’s still based in Boulder and may soon reinstate its signature free-tea tours (ah the smells!) the company is now part of the Hain Celestial Group which includes products like Terra veggie chips Alba Botanica lotions and Garden of Eatin’ among dozens more. It’s based in Lake Success N.Y. but we’ll try not to hold that against them.

Crocs

Many Front Range residents know that the mass-produced foam-clog shoes known as Crocs were created in Niwot nearly two decades ago. That success story is not without its hiccups however including a sales crash in 2008 that immediately followed the company’s first big retail flourish or the constant flood of lawsuits that Crocs has unleashed on its rip-off competitors.

But these days Broomfield-based Crocs is such a well-known global brand that its Colorado beginnings have all but disappeared from the narrative. Fashionistas rappers celebrity chefs and many many others sport limited-edition and custom-designed Crocs while affordable versions have been embraced by health care workers and students. The ever-expanding styles can be dizzying but with $1.4 billion in revenue last year the Crocs trend seems to be here to stay (for a bit longer at least).

OtterBox

Colorado’s dozens of outdoors brands spring in most ways from our gorgeous and diverse natural resources. Outdoor activities are one of the reasons many people live and visit here but they’ve also inspired ingenious products for hiking camping running climbing cycling and rafting. OtterBox provides an ideal example.

The Fort Collins company founded in 1998 started out making waterproof cases for electronic devices. Our increasing reliance on smartphones and tablets (and previously iPods and such) made them the right-time right-place market leader starting in the mid-2000s. But company leaders have managed growth intelligently as OtterBox has diversified into screen protectors charging kits and cables carrying cases gaming accessories and more. Its bespoke products for major hardware manufacturers and branding partnerships (hello Star Wars) also show no signs of stopping.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jYmouY29tL2Zvb2QvcmVzdGF1cmFudHMvNTAtYmlsbGlvbi1saWZlc3R5bGUtYnJhbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The $50 Billion Lifestyle Brand,"Here’s some food for thought.



Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.’s (NYSE: CMG) stock in late July reached an all-time high as quarterly sales approached $2 billion for the first time under CEO and Chairman Brian Niccol.



More’s in store: Niccol thinks the restaurant chain can eventually grow to 6000 locations in North America with the average location generating more than $3 million annually or roughly $18 billion in annual sales for the Newport Beach-based chain.



Chipotle’s recipe for growth is easy to remember: open successful restaurants leverage digital and bolster the brand.



Niccol to that end recently told analysts late last month digital is helping make Chipotle a “food-focused digital lifestyle brand.”



It’s a mouthful but the concept lends to Chipotle’s focus under Niccol.



The chain’s done a lot to build its brand around the conversation in sustainable farming playing up how fresh its ingredients are and how it wants to support the next generation of farmers.



A bigger push around digital has made tech the conduit to gain social currency and relevance. Examples include Pepper the chatbot in the Chipotle app for frequently asked questions a digital-only kitchen in New York to expedite orders Chipotlanes to also service digital orders faster piloting TikTok for hiring and creating a video game for its now 23 million loyalty program members.

Shares Up 450%



The brand building marks another achievement for Niccol who has taken the company’s stock to more than $1800 a piece as of last week for a market cap of $52 billion. Chipotle is OC’s second-most valuable public company behind the nearly $70 billion-valued Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (NYSE: EW).



Chipotle’s stock has seen a run up of more than 450% since Niccol took the top spot in March 2018 after previously heading Irvine-based Taco Bell Corp. as CEO.



By comparison multi-unit restaurant operator Yum Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) of Louisville Ky.—parent to Taco Bell The Habit Burger Grill KFC and Pizza Hut—trades at around $130 per share with a market cap of $39 billion.



Most analysts covering Chipotle’s stock maintain a hold rating including Deutsche Bank’s Brian Mullan who characterized the company as “solid all around” in a research note last month. Mullan increased his price target to $1630 from $1495 and maintained a hold rating.



BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Strelzik noted Chipotle “is emerging from the pandemic stronger” as he reaffirmed the market perform rating on the chain’s stock and raised Chipotle’s price target to $1750.



“Loyalty remains in its early innings and enhancements to digital technology and CRM [customer retention management] capabilities should allow [Chipotle] to increasingly leverage its loyalty member base” Strelzik wrote in his research note also pointing to the runway for dine-in sales to continue to improve and menu innovation such as a brisket offering that could roll out later this year.

Digital Nearing $1B



Even as Chipotle restaurants bounced back in the recently ended quarter recovering 70% of pre-pandemic sales digital still held its own with about 80% of that channel’s revenue recovered.



“This highlights our digital experience’s sticky because it is everything customers love about Chipotle with added convenience” Niccol told analysts in July. “And due to the pandemic many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative and often incremental occasions.”



In other words the channel’s surge last year wasn’t just a short-term factor to ward off the impact of COVID on both the company and the consumer end.



Digital saw a 10.5% lift in the second quarter from the year-ago period to total $916.5 million in the quarter. That accounted for nearly half of the quarter’s $1.9 billion in total revenue up 38.7% year-over-year.



Chipotle’s got the pull to make good on gaining more ground.



Its restaurant footprint totals more than 2850 locations with a target to open more than 200 new ones this year. Chipotle’s workforce is now over 100000 with a stated goal for its July 15 career day to hire another 15000.



A spokesperson for the chain said thousands have been hired as a result of the recent career day with the company still working through rescheduled interviews. The company’s pilot using TikTok has seen a “steady flow of video submissions” for restaurant jobs the spokesperson said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbWl4OTU3Z3IuY29tL3dlZWtlbmQtZmlyZS1jYXVzZXMtZ3JhbmR2aWxsZS1yZXN0YXVyYW50LXRvLXRlbXBvcmFyaWx5LWNsb3NlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weekend Fire Causes Grandville Restaurant to Temporarily Close,"A kitchen fire sent a Grandville restaurant up in flames this past weekend and are closed for now.

Everyone was safely evacuated and no injuries were reported. The fire was put out within 15 minutes and is being investigated by the Grandville Fire Department.

Facebook group West Michigan Fire Buffs posted pictures and videos of the fire. A big cloud of smoke is seen coming from the roof of the restaurant.

Texas Roadhouse posted on their Facebook Sunday morning that they would be closed until further notice. They did not estimate when they would open again.

Hopefully when they reopen no one's steak will be overcooked again.

In 2021 Rodriguez and a small team launched Viela da Graça Igreja in Novo Hamburgo a small city in Brazil’s most southern province Rio Grande do Sul.

Then it started raining.

The floods have done more than interrupt the small Reformed congregation’s celebratory plans. They’ve devastated the community. The storms that began at the end of April struck Rio Grande do Sul’s most densely populated areas and have killed at least 116 people. Around 130 people are still missing. The high water has closed roads and even the airport which has grounded flights until May 30. As of Friday May 10 nearly 400000 people have been displaced from their homes and 70772 are in public shelters.

Some of those have found their way to Viela da Graça which is located on higher ground and has been largely protected from a water breach. Since May 4 Rodriguez and members of the 75-person congregation have been hosting around 50 people in a two-bathroom 3500-square-foot building.

“As Christians we needed to open our doors” Rodriguez says. “And that’s what we did.”

Beyond the bathroom constraints the situation has been less than ideal. There are frequent power cuts (1.2 million people have been affected by outages) and the building has lost access to both running and potable water because the sanitation company cannot treat the dirty floodwaters. A nearby residential condominium which gets its water from a well has provided drinking water and showers.

Though Brazil’s evangelicals are known worldwide for their megachurches flood relief efforts have highlighted the impact that small churches can have in serving their communities in the country’s most secular state.

“It’s like the offering of the widow in Luke 21” said Egon Grimm Berg executive secretary of the Baptist Convention of Rio Grande do Sul. “They are giving everything they have.”

Or sometimes even more.

Igreja em Reforma a congregation founded three-and-a-half years ago by pastor Emanuel Malinoski in Quarto Distrito a trendy neighborhood in Porto Alegre has 80 members. When the nearby Guaíba River overflowed last week it flooded the first floor of the church building. The water could take weeks to recede.

Nevertheless since last Sunday the church has been cooking cleaning and providing donations for 82 people in an improvised shelter offered up by a church family in the neighboring city of Canoas that was a warehouse until a month ago. Now the state’s civil defense is sending flood refugees there.

“None of [those being served] are evangelical” said Malinoski who was in the church building attempting to save furniture when the waters started rising. “We are giving an important testimony to our community.”

Rio Grande do Sul has the smallest percentage of evangelicals among Brazil’s 26 states. The capital Porto Alegre had 11.6 percent evangelicals according to the most recent census in 2010 the lowest proportion among all 27 Brazilian capitals. Most churches have fewer than 80 members according to Ricardo Lebedenco the senior pastor of the First Baptist Church of Ijuí.

Located 300 miles west of Porto Alegre—ground zero for the disaster—Lebedenco’s 600-member congregation is sending supplies to distribution hubs in the city of 1.3 million.

Though they are just one of numerous organizations sending resources to victims many secular leaders are encouraging people to prioritize working with churches when it comes to donating and distributing clothes bottled water food and money.

“They say we are more organized and more mobilized” said Tiago Gomes de Mello pastor of Igreja Batista Boas Novas in Novo Hamburgo.

This is the second tragedy that Gomes de Mello has witnessed firsthand. In 2014 a storm’s strong winds damaged the church to the point where the building had to be rebuilt. During the reconstruction process and then later during the COVID-19 pandemic the previously 500-person church lost 90 percent of its members. Gomes de Mello took over as pastor in 2022 with a mission to revitalize the now 51-person church.

Around 5 a.m. on Friday May 3 he began receiving requests for help. He left his home in Porto Alegre to open the church to two families—only to find he couldn’t return.

Water had flooded the streets and surrounded his home. His wife Thaís and their children Ester 16 and Josué just over a year old were rescued by boat on Monday and taken to a relative’s home. Gomes de Mello finally reunited with his family on Tuesday but only after four days of relentless work at the church which now houses 45 people.

The sacrificial service of churches stems from people’s love of God says Marco Silva pastor of the Primeira Igreja Batista de Montenegro which sits 55 miles from Porto Alegre and has been sending support to smaller churches in the region.

“When we prepare a meal when we go out by boat to take food when we fold blankets to take to the displaced each of these things is an act of worship” he said.

For church members then the focus is not on suspended worship services but on the opportunity to put their “theology into practice” said Rodriguez. On Tuesday the Viela da Graça pastor recorded his sermon from his living room and will upload it to YouTube for people to watch on Sunday. It will be a condensed program with two praise songs announcements and a sermon on Jude 20–21 verses that have served as his personal reference in these difficult times: “But you dear friends by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.”

Igreja Batista Boas Novas is one of the few churches in the affected region that has managed to hold in-person services. In fact they have even expanded their number. Gomes de Mello has preached on Sunday Saturday and Wednesday.

On Sunday the message was about Psalm 121: “I lift up my eyes to the mountains—where does my help come from?”

Ragam budaya Indonesia sendiri sangat diminati masyarakat asing banyak orang dari berbagai negara di berbagai belahan dunia datang ke Indonesia hanya untuk belajar dan menyaksikan budaya Indonesia.

Tidak seperti masyarakat asing yang sangat meminati budaya Indonesia tidak sedikit masyarakat Indonesia sendiri yang kurang bahkan tidak tertarik akan budaya Indonesia sehingga sedikit masayarakat Indonesia saat ini yang melestarikan budaya Indonesia. Melestarikan budaya Indonesia merupan salah satu bentuk nasionalisme karena jika kita melestarikan budaya Indonesia itu berarti kita memiliki rasa cinta budaya dan tanah air Indonesia.

Setiap warga negara Indonesia harus punya rasa cinta dan menghargai budaya Indonesia oleh karena itu rasa cinta dan menghargai budaya milik negeri kita sendiri harus ditumbuhkan dengan berbagai cara. Ada pun beberapa contoh cara menumbuhkan rasa cinta dan menghargai budaya Indonesia sebagai berikut:

1. Menumbuhkan Rasa Cinta dan Menghargai Budaya Indonesia pada Diri Sendiri





Menumbuhkan rasa cinta dan menghargai budaya Indonesia paling mudah yaitu dari diri sendiri karena kita memilki kendali penuh terhadap diri kita sendiri. Kita harus membiasakan diri kita dengan budaya dari negara kita sendiri dengan begitu akan tumbuh rasa cinta dan menghargai budaya Indonesia. Setelah tumbuh rasa cinta dan menghargai budaya Indonesia pada diri kita kita juga harus mengajarkan kepada orang-orang disekitar kita tentang budaya Indonesia dan mengajak untuk lebih mencintai dan menghargai budaya dari negeri kita sendiri dibanding dengan budaya luar sehingga budaya yang telah dijaga oleh orang-orang terdahulu dapat terus dilestarikan.

2. Menumbuhkan Rasa Cinta dan Menghargai Budaya Indonesia di Lingkungan Keluarga





Keluarga adalah unit terkecil dari masyarakat yang terdiri atas kepala keluarga dan beberapa orang yang terkumpul dan tinggal di suatu tempat di bawah suatu atap. Keluarga adalah tempat dimana kita belajar tentang kehidupan. Dari keluarga pula kita bisa belajar budaya Indonesia. Di dalam keluarga kita bisa belajar budaya dari ayah ibu kakak atau bahkan adik kita.

Salah satu contoh pembelajaran budaya Indonesia di lingkungan keluarga adalah dengan memperkenalkan budaya-budaya Indonesia kepada anak kita sejak dini. Anak kita harus kita ajarkan budaya sejak dini agar kelak anak-anak kita dapat melanjutkan pelestarian budaya Indonesia dengan begitu akan tumbuh rasa cinta dan mengharai budaya Indonesia dan diharapkan anak-anak kita juga dapat menjaga dan mengajarkan budaya Indonesia kepada generasi selanjutnya.

The University College of the Cayman Islands (UCCI) and Cisco are collaborating on the summit which will give thirty-five females from the Cayman Islands ages 12-18 the opportunity to hear from inspirational guest speakers participate in hands-on practice with coding and other IoT activities and participate in workshops to help them build their professional skill set.

The Summit aims to inspire young females to pursue careers in STEM and aid in equipping the local younger generation with digital skills to drive advancement in their careers.

Research shows that science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) are still male-dominated fields. And Automation and advancements in technology will widen the gap: the World Economic Forum estimates that per every 20 jobs lost to the fourth industrial revolution women will only gain one new STEM job. Women ROCK-IT is designed to inspire girls to study tech and ensure that they don’t miss out on tomorrow’s jobs.

Last year Cisco donated Wi-Fi hotspots to the Cayman Islands that helped bridge the digital divide gaps caused by COVID-19. The donation provided residents with free public access to wireless internet at ten community sites across the islands enabling them to help connect with family friends and online resources.

Said Shari Slate Cisco VP Chief Inclusion and Collaboration Officer:

“Cisco is thrilled to inspire young women to pursue STEM careers that will empower their communities into pathways to prosperity. The Summit and Cisco Networking Academy are great examples of how we are working to close the digital divide that the Cayman Islands and the larger Caribbean face.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbWVyY2VyY291bnR5b3V0bG9vay5uZXQvMjAyMS8wNy8zMS9jZWxpbmEtbWFuLWRpZXMtaW4tY3Jhc2gtYWZ0ZXItcG9saWNlLWhhZC1hbHJlYWR5LWFib3J0ZWQtY2hhc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Celina Man Dies In Crash After Police Had Already Aborted Chase,"(7-31-21) This morning at about 4:08 AM Celina Police officers observed a blue 2004 Acura southbound on Brandon Av when it traveled through the stop sign without stopping.

Bryant a childhood fan of Bonds and the Giants received a standing ovation before his first trip to plate in a Giants uniform. But it was his second at-bat that really gave fans a reason to cheer.

With one down and the bases empty in the bottom of the third Bryant turned on a middle-in fastball and sent it flying 366 feet just clearing the wall in left-field for his first home run as a Giant — and his 19th overall this season. The 0-1 94-mph fastball from Astros starter Luis Garcia exited Bryant’s bat at 102 mph according to Statcast.

“You kind of knew he was going to hit a home run” Giants starter Logan Webb said afterward.

Bryant’s dinger got the Giants on the scoreboard and started a three-run rally that gave them a 3-2 lead over Houston by the end of the inning. Darin Ruf extended the Giants lead to 5-3 with a two-run blast of his own in the fifth inning.

Following his standing ovation in the first inning Bryant saw eight pitches and worked a full-count but eventually struck out swinging with Lamonte Wade Jr. on second base.

Bryant became the seventh player since 2011 and the first since 2018 to hit a home run in his first game with the Giants.

Bryant also became the third of his former Cubs teammates to homer in their first game with their new teams. Javier Baez went yard in his first game with the Mets and Anthony Rizzo has homered in each of his first two games with the Yankees. They are the first trio in the modern era to each homer in their debut with a different team after playing on the same team earlier that season according to STATS.

“It’s been cool to see what they’ve done in their debuts” Bryant said before the game. “Maybe there’s some magic here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2RheS5jby50dC8yMDIxLzA4LzAxL2ZpcnN0LWNpdGl6ZW5zLW5hbWVkLWFzLXR0b2Mtb2ZmaWNpYWwtYmFua2luZy1wYXJ0bmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Citizens named as TTOC official banking partner,"First Citizens named as TTOC official banking partner

Not everyone could afford it” said Ramachandran Mahesh a retired Army colonel now working with a corporate house in Delhi and past RimZim loyalist.

Today not many millennials and Gen Z will probably recall the ‘chatpata’ desi drink but after the exit of Coke from the Indian market in 1977 — the company had refused to bow down to the Indian government’s provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) 1973 — Indian consumers were left with few soft drink options to choose from. Among the pop picks at the time were Gold Spot Campa Cola and RimZim.

New Delhi: A jeera-flavoured fizzy drink may not make everyone’s tastebuds ‘pop’ in excitement but back in the 1980s RimZim had its own set of loyalists who made it one of the top-selling drinks of that time. This was before Coca-Cola acquired the homegrown brand in 1994 and took it off the market before relaunching it in 2018.

Many though preferred its taste before the relaunch by Coke.

Pointing out how the original version of the drink was “way better” a businessman in New Delhi who first tried RimZim when he was around five years old in the early ’80s told ThePrint: “I wish you could taste the original RimZim. It used to come in small glass bottles around 200-250 ml in size and had a unique way of appealing to the distinct Indian taste palette. The relaunched version according to him was a ‘pale copy’ of the original.”

Origin & relaunch

Launched by the Ramesh Chauhan-owned Parle — Chauhan is often referred to as the cola king — RimZim was a popular drink of the 198Os.

After Coca-Cola returned to India following the economic liberalisation of the 1990s the foreign company acquired RimZim from Parle along with some other beverage brands owned by the company such as Thums Up Limca Maaza Gold Spot and Citra in 1994.

Since Coke was more into expanding mainstream drinks at the time the focus was on Thums Up and Limca rather than RimZim which had a niche market. The jeera drink was therefore taken off the market at the time.

By 2012 however the company was thinking about relaunching RimZim.

“Coke viewed India as a country which had demonstrated a love for the ethnic drink whether it be a cola or one with an Indian twist like Thums Up and Campa and Dixie” said brand strategist Harish Bijoor. “Coke wanted more than just Cola. RimZim offered a readymade variant which was a hit in the northern belt.”

In 2017 the masala soda category was estimated to see a growth of over three times in the next three-four years. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola were the two big organised players in the space.

The latter relaunched RimZim — in a new package and a spicier taste — in 2018.

“The drink was reintroduced in select states — such as Gujarat Karnataka Andhra Pradesh and Odisha — where the market showed an affinity for it” a beverage industry expert told ThePrint on condition of anonymity. It was also taken to Bangladesh by Coca-Cola.

The initial response to the new version was quite encouraging according to the expert.

Quirky taste quirkier commercials

With its tagline ‘Atpata Nahi Chatpata’ Coke marketed RimZim through various quirky advertisements.

One such commercial launched in May 2018 showed a shocked man staring at a boy buying dinosaur eggs from a grocery store. When he turns to his friend to check his reaction the friend takes a sip of RimZim (probably the manufacture’s nod to the drink’s unexpected taste) before saying “Atpata Nahi Yeh to Chatpata hai”.

However because of competition from other desi-flavoured drinks (such as PepsiCo’s Nimbooz masala soda Bindu Fizz Jeera Masala and Parle Agro’s Dhishoom Jeera Masala Soda among others) RimZim started losing its niche market.

“RimZim was a taste that was regional. It continued to do well where it traditionally did well. A national rollout just could not work. In the bargain the brand fell through the slats” said Bijoor.

For some time even after it disappeared from the shelves in most stores the drink could be bought online from the site coke2home.com in six cities including Ahmedabad Bengaluru Chennai Gandhinagar Mumbai and Hyderabad. But that option is no longer available.

The spiced soda can still be bought from the virtual grocery store farms2fresh.

Keeping the safety of shop owners and consumers in mind the attempt was taken to support the business of grocery stores as well as the Food and Beverage Sector during the unprecedented times of global pandemic said a press release.

Since digital adoption has become a significant differentiator and the pandemic taught businesses to be prepared and operate effectively even during a crisis Coca-Cola has aimed to create opportunities for the partners and customers to be engaged with their favourite brands seamlessly by leveraging exponential technologies like WhatsApp through a pilot initiative

Through this initiative retailers will be able to place orders with ease and directly to the distributors using WhatsApp which will allow businesses to operate while improving communication and reducing the risk of physical contact.

While supporting the government's directive to minimize people movement this app-based solution will help ensure constant availability of Coca-Cola products across outlets to meet consumer demand.

Moreover it will benefit shop owners to keep stocks available at all times while not having to wait for the specific delivery dates and maintain Covid specific safety measures.

Coca-Cola Bangladesh said ""Be it large or small businesses across the nation 2020 was one of the most challenging years in history. As we continue to navigate the economic impact and pave our way to recover from this pandemic it is crucial to support small businesses all over the country. Small businesses are an essential part of what makes our marketplace unique and now more than ever they need our support – which is why Coca-Cola has come up with this unique initiative to help support the economic safety net of shop owners. In order to find inspiration in these trying times Coca-Cola is stepping into support the small businesses that are battling to stay afloat and once again can thrive at previously unheard-of levels.""

""Furthermore this initiative is a step toward assisting shopkeepers in quickly regaining their business by encouraging people to buy from nearby outlets in a secure manner and by providing a variety of digital options for connecting with us and their customers easily"" the company added."

After a rather painful season with Ferrari Sebastian Vettel will drive for Aston Martin in 2021. The German and British racing team are eying a comeback. Vettel had a really underwhelming season as Aston Martin comes back to the grid after six-decades.

After his last season with Ferrari Vettel is excited to start his new chapter with Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One Team. “I can’t wait to start working with Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team.”

Teams must cut their 2024 rosters down to just 12 spots from as many as 18 training camp players. And while this year’s WNBA draft class is undoubtedly rife with talent only 18 draftees remain rostered ahead of Monday's final cuts. Last year just 15 of the league’s 36 draftees made it onto their team’s opening-day squad.

And it's not just rookies. Veteran players are also on the chopping block even former title-winners: On Thursday the Minnesota Lynx waived 2021 WNBA champ Ruthy Hebard.

But with every wave of cuts players that survive dismissal inch closer to claiming a coveted roster spot. The Las Vegas Aces have already reached that magic number 12 opening the door for draft picks Dyaisha Fair and Kate Martin to stay on with the reigning champs.

Additionally Dallas has whittled their training camp group down to 12. Fifth overall pick Jacy Sheldon and undrafted rookie Jaelyn Brown continue to remain in the mix.

Other teams meanwhile still have decisions to make. Seattle currently lists 13 players while others like New York still have a full 18 players in training camp. It’s likely that the final preseason game will tip roster decisions one way or another as coaching staffs continue to evaluate performance and playing time.

But being cut doesn't mean the end of the road for everyone. Should players be waived they can still be signed to short-term hardship contracts with teams carrying injured players on their permanent rosters.

If last year's biggest corporate media challenge was launching subscription streaming services this year's unifying dilemma is figuring out what to put on them. The tension between how to balance streaming video theatrical release and linear TV is leading to some peculiar choices bound to confuse consumers in what's becoming an increasingly jumbled landscape. ""The challenge all of these companies are battling — the central question — is what content goes where who decides and why?"" said Rich Greenfield a media analyst at LightShed Partners. The programming decisions will ultimately reform how the public consumes media. So far most media companies have marketed streaming video as a complement to traditional pay television. This is why so many of the products are named with the suffix ""plus"" — Disney + ViacomCBS 's Paramount+ Discovery + etc. In the long run it's possible each streaming platform will become the home for all of a media company's programming. The ""plusses"" will essentially be lopped off. ESPN+ may just be ESPN with everything ESPN has to offer. But the world isn't there yet. And the results are increasingly confusing for consumers as new programming is made specifically for streaming services and the best of linear TV still doesn't show up on streaming.

The streaming labyrinth

For scripted television series media executives have largely made the decision that streaming services will be the home for the highest quality original programming. Disney AT&T 's WarnerMedia Comcast 's NBCUniversal and ViacomCBS are all attempting to convince Wall Street they can grow beyond traditional cable television. They're using new hit shows including ""The Mandalorian"" ""Mare of Easttown"" and ""Yellowstone"" as bait to entice subscribers. The results have varied from service to service but all of the major new subscription products are growing by millions of customers each quarter. For movies there's disagreement at a film-by-film level across the different services. Disney put Pixar movies ""Soul"" and ""Luca"" directly on Disney+ for no additional charge upon release. For ""Jungle Cruise"" ""Black Widow"" and ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" the company decided to make users spend an additional $30 to stream the movies before eventually making them free with a subscription. NBCUniversal placed ""The Boss Baby: Family Business"" on its paid tier of ""Peacock"" but only released ""F9"" in theaters. WarnerMedia decided to place its entire slate of 2021 films directly on HBO Max but won't do that for blockbuster movies in 2022. For news and sports most media companies have kept their most valuable programming exclusively on traditional cable TV. The most-watched primetime programming on CNN MSNBC and ESPN is still locked inside the cable bundle. This has allowed executives to push against the steady but not yet overwhelming surge of pay-TV cancellations keeping alive a highly profitable business that brings in billions of dollars each year.

Choice overload

NBCUniversal is navigating the challenge of distributing valuable programming as it broadcasts the Olympic Games. Executives can choose to air live and pre-recorded events on NBC's broadcast channel NBC's cable networks NBC's authenticated apps for cable subscribers NBC's free apps Peacock's free tier and Peacock's paid tier. The variety of choices has led to a complicated ecosystem because NBCUniversal is attempting to achieve several goals at once. The company wants to push Peacock subscriptions appease pay-TV distributors who have agreed to many years of fee increases because they were receiving unique content and maintain expensive TV advertising rates by attaching commercials to exclusive live programming. ""It's the innovator's dilemma in action"" said one veteran broadcast television executive. ""You know the linear TV world is collapsing but you're trying to stay on the Titanic for as long as possible. At the same time you're setting up the lifeboats which are digital and streaming.""

Making the numbers work

Disney is staring down a major business dilemma as soon as next year with ""Monday Night Football."" The company secured rights to stream the perennially most-watched cable series on ESPN+ in its new TV rights deal with the National Football League in March. But Disney and ESPN haven't said anything about when it will actually include ""Monday Night Football"" on ESPN+. ESPN is by far the most expensive network on cable TV. It gained that distinction by being the only way Americans can watch ""Monday Night Football"" and other popular sporting events. If Disney starts moving previously exclusive programming from ESPN to ESPN+ pay-TV distributors will push back on future rate increases and millions of consumers will be given another reason to cancel cable TV. The math makes this calculus tricky. Beginning Aug. 13 Disney will charge $6.99 per month for ESPN+ after a recent price increase. But Disney makes more than $9 per month per cable subscriber for ESPN according to Kagan the media research division at S&P Global in pay-TV distribution fees. When bundled with the other ESPN networks Disney Channel and ABC Disney makes more than $16 per month. In other words for every customer canceling cable Disney loses more than $16 per month. It will need to start charging more for its streaming products to break even and that's not even counting the loss in advertising associated with its linear programming which dwarfs digital video ad revenue. ""Nobody is ready to unplug the linear ecosystem because it brings in so much cash"" Greenfield said. ""So they're all balancing how to manage legacy assets with future investments that are free cash flow negative to show Wall Street that they're trying. They're all walking the tight rope.""

News programming decisions

NBCUniversal and WarnerMedia announced this month they'll hire hundreds of new employees to beef up their streaming news services. Instead of simply duplicating MSNBC CNBC and CNN programming on ""Peacock"" and ""HBO Max"" the media companies are taking a different strategy. CNN is building a subscription news service CNN+. CNN chief digital officer Andrew Morse said he plans to hire 450 people to develop and market new series and newscasts. NBCUniversal News Group Chairman Cesar Conde announced plans to hire nearly 200 new employees across its news brands the majority of which will support NBC News Now the company's flagship streaming network. ""Our core focus is to consistently innovate in how our brands deliver distinctive high-quality journalism"" Conde said when making the announcement Tuesday. The decision to create separate programming for streaming — some of which may duplicate the content of what's already being broadcast on linear TV — can be viewed in different ways. Skeptically it could be seen as a waste of resources filled with redundancies as a ""moment in time"" decision to keep exclusivity in the cable bundle that may no longer exist in two or three years. But NBC News executives say the investment acknowledges streaming audiences aren't the same as linear viewers. That should lead to programming decisions that acknowledge digital viewers tend to be younger and more diverse. ""We're always thinking about ways to optimize our journalism for each distribution platform"" said Noah Oppenheim president of NBC News. ""How do we engage these new audiences? Sometimes the answers lead to different faces on screen different approaches to storytelling a different lens on the world."" It's unclear if there's actually an audience for an all-streaming news network — especially one that demands consumers pay a monthly subscription fee such as CNN+ which debuts in 2022. The notion of programming to a younger audience is suspect as a video news broadcast whether streaming or on traditional TV may simply not appeal to those under 25. The decision to invest more in streaming news could lead to a gradual decline in investing in broadcast or cable productions if total revenue is shrinking. NBC News Chief Digital Officer Chris Berend said he's confident further investment in NBC News Now will pay off because he can already see the growth in time spent on the existing product which launched in 2019. NBC News Now is free for consumers backed by advertising. ""We are incredibly excited about the millions of hours audiences spend with NBC News NOW and how that continues to grow as we continue to invest"" said Berend. ""That time spent which includes more than an hour per visit on some platforms [like YouTube] is a clear indicator we are satisfying our audience across many platforms each with their own demographic nuances.""

As Tina Fey’s brainchild many tuned in to watch the fan-favorite comedian and actor.

To many people’s surprise including Fey’s the show ran for seven seasons ending in 2013. Even with its surreal humor and quality comedy 30 Rock faced cast members leaving the show.

’30 Rock’

After becoming a head writer and performer for Saturday Night Live (SNL) Tina Fey started working on what became 30 Rock in 2002. Originally pitched as a comedy show about cable news the NBC crew sent Fey back to the drawing board to rework the concept. She came back with a show revolving around a parody of SNL which was a big hit with the network.

Fans quickly became hooked watching the hilarious behind-the-scenes camera setups and production of the fictional sketch show TGS. The show was called 30 Rock because TGS was produced in Studio 6H in 30 Rockefeller Plaza which is the same location as NBC Studios and where SNL is created and performed.

TGS starred the three main characters Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) with Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) running the fictional comedy-sketch show. The comedy series highlights the disagreements between Liz and network executive Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) Jenna’s aspiration to become the next big star and the characters’ interesting personal lives. 30 Rock is known for its surreal humor as it parodies NBC’s corporate structure and entertainment industry.

In the seasons leading up to the finale in 2013 it even depicted the fictional network acquired by Kabletown which was a parody of Comcast’s acquisition of NBC. While many of the characters remained the same throughout the seven seasons of 30 Rock Ross unexpectedly left during the fourth season of the hit TV comedy sitcom.

Why Josh left ’30 Rock’

When characters are introduced early on in a series you expect them to have a major role throughout the show. This is why many fans were surprised when Josh left 30 Rock in the fourth season of the show. Josh served almost like Jenna’s male counterpart on TGS during the pilot episode of 30 Rock.

However as BoardGamesTips highlighted Tracy’s character development and build-up of a closer relationship with the cast notably Jenna Josh’s role dwindled. 30 Rock seemed to quickly abandon TGS as the main premise although that was not the original plan according to ScreenRant. However the fictional variety show became more of a backdrop the three supporting cast members of protagonists Liz and Jack became smaller roles than originally planned. Josh even seemed to be written out of the script after the first season which led to his departure.

A Reddit user brought to light how little we saw Josh after the first season by mentioning the scene in season four when Jack asked Liz to find a new cast member and he said “Right Josh. I don’t remember the guy do you think that’s a good thing?”

Who replaced his character Josh on the show?

After Josh’s departed from the show it created a new storyline as Liz and Pete must hire a new cast member. After following their humorous journey of finding a new cast member they hire Danny Baker because he was the only person in New York who would ride the elevator with Jack after being told he had bed bugs.

Jack “Danny” Baker played by Cheyenne Jackson made a similar exit as his predecessor leaving the show by the end of season five after the character was neglected for other 30 Rock storylines."

Sales of the company’s frozen snack and center-store brands continued to rise during the second quarter of fiscal year ended Nov. 29 2020.

“We continue to build on our momentum and our Q2 results exceeded our expectations across the board” said Sean Connolly president and chief executive officer during a Jan. 7 conference call with securities analysts to discuss the results.

Net income for the quarter rose 45% to $379 million.

Quarterly sales rose 6% to $2.995 billion from $2.82 billion the year prior.

“Total Conagra retail sales grew 10.4% year-over-year with strong growth across each of our snacks frozen and staples portfolios” Mr. Connolly said. “Total Conagra household penetration grew 14 basis points versus a year ago and our category share increased 26 basis points.”

Sales for Conagra’s Grocery & Snacks business unit rose 13% during the quarter to $1.3 billion. The company attributed the increase to elevated levels of at-home eating and replenishment of retailer inventories. Segment operating profit increased 20% to $316 million.

Mr. Connolly emphasized that Conagra’s line of staple products primarily products sold in the center of the store include such brands as Hunt’s Pam and Rotel enjoyed another strong quarter.

“Historically this portfolio has served as a source of cash for us but it hasn’t been looked at as a growth engine” he said. “Our basket of the total staples category grew retail sales by 12.7% in the second quarter. People are returning to their kitchens during the pandemic and new younger consumers are discovering the joy of cooking.

“People are returning to their kitchens during the pandemic and new younger consumers are discovering the joy of cooking.” – Sean Connolly Conagra Brands

“So a lot of our staple products be it products like Hunt’s tomato Rotel our salsa business or our dressing businesses these are businesses that are playing a meaningful role during the pandemic and we believe because of some of the demographic tailwinds will continue at an elevated level post-pandemic.”

Refrigerated & Frozen segment sales rose 7% to $1.2 billion during the quarter. Business unit operating profit surged 41% to $264 million. Tailwinds benefiting the business included supply chain productivity and cost synergies associated with the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods in 2019.

Total frozen retail sales grew 8% during the quarter and were propelled by Conagra’s Birds Eye frozen vegetables business. Supply chain constraints had been a drag on the Birds Eye business but with those issues resolved brand performance accelerated according to the company.

“In addition to strong retail sales growth of 7.2% in the quarter Birds Eye gained an impressive 261 basis points of share from Q1 to Q2” Mr. Connolly said.

International unit sales rose 7% during the quarter to $250 million. The sales increase was attributed to sales growth in both Canada and Mexico.

Foodservice sales decreased 23% to $212 million. Items affecting performance included lower restaurant traffic and the impact of some divested businesses.

Management declined to issue full-year guidance but did say it expects third-quarter organic net sales growth in the range of 6% to 8% and adjusted earnings per share between 56¢ to 60¢.

STZ,Constellation Brands,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDgvMDEvdGhjLWNhbm5hYmlzLWJldmVyYWdlcy01MDE5NTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No hangovers or beer bellies: Cannabis firms try to woo booze drinkers,"The universe of cannabis beverages is already large and seems to grow by the day: seltzers wines beers teas colas cocktails. Many of the world’s biggest beer companies — Anheuser-Busch InBev Pabst Brewing Company Constellation Brands — have invested in cannabis drinks. Craft brewers like Lagunitas Brewing Company in California and Atlanta-based SweetWater Brewing Company are also getting into the business.

And there are some promising signs for the industry.

Most marijuana drinks have negligible calories and the products pose little risk of a hangover. Cannabis beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to hit $421 million this year — more than double 2019 figures according to Brightfield Group which tracks the industry and double again to nearly $1 billion by 2025. Yet the beverage sector is less than 2 percent of the larger $20 billion legal weed marketplace.

“This is a category that can be moved dramatically if someone can get it right” said Bethany Gomez Brightfield’s managing director. “No one’s gotten it right yet.”

But where investors see untold riches rolling in — eight states have backed full legalization either at the ballot box or legislatively just in the last year — there are plenty of policy social and logistical hurdles.

Many cannabis beverages have traditionally been produced and marketed for their hardcore consumers packing a THC wallop that would need to be calibrated or risk staggering the casual customer. The price of the drinks is driven up by marijuana’s federal illegality requiring costly production bottling and distribution operations to be set up in each state. There is also a more practical challenge: dispensaries don’t typically have refrigerated display cases.

As we continue to cover the legislation and people at the center of the marijuana industry we want you our readers to help contribute to our reporting.

“Would I love to be on the shelf next to Robert Mondavi and other prominent wines? Absolutely” said Tracey Mason CEO of House of Saka which has been selling cannabis wines since 2019 in California and has plans to expand to Michigan and Canada this year. “Do I see that happening in the very near future? No. But I do see cannabis retail outlets dramatically changing and becoming much more beverage friendly.”

Luke Anderson the co-founder of Cann which has been selling low-potency THC seltzers with flavors like blood orange cardamom and ginger lemongrass since 2019 argues that a broader embrace of cannabis beverages will occur once consumers get comfortable with the products.

”It’s very similar to oat milk or kombucha in that the biggest thing is consumer education” Anderson said noting kombucha sales were only about 1 percent of the beverage market 15 years ago. “Now that’s totally changed and you can see it dominating the cooler in premium grocery stores everywhere.”

With the spread of marijuana legalization across the country overall cannabis sales are projected to double in the next four years topping $40 billion according to New Frontier Data an analytics firm that focuses on the cannabis industry.

“The beverage ecosystem presents a phenomenal opportunity for both growth and innovation in the broader cannabis product landscape” said John Kagia New Frontier’s chief knowledge officer. “The illicit market doesn’t have the resources or the skills to innovate the way the legal market can.”

Keef Brands is the OG of cannabis beverages. The company started selling 100-milligram THC colas to medical consumers in Boulder Colo. in 2010. And the company’s product line has evolved over time. In 2014 it introduced a line of 10-milligram drinks aimed at the more casual cannabis consumer.

Keef drinks are now sold in seven states and Puerto Rico with expansions into Maine Missouri and Ohio earlier this year. In Colorado and California the company’s most mature markets there’s roughly a 50-50 split between sales of low- and high-potency products according to Keef Brands CEO Travis Tharp.

“One of our biggest things that we always have to combat is the brownie story that everybody seems to have” Tharp said. “Where people didn’t seem to know how much they took and then two hours later they took too much and it was a horrible experience.”

Many cannabis beverage proselytizers point to an unlikely nemesis in convincing consumers to try their products: budtenders. The main reason is that dispensary workers are often heavy cannabis consumers devoted to smokable products.

Cann’s Anderson said the company encounters this problem repeatedly when it conducts “secret shopper” tests. Even when the customer says they’re a casual consumer worried about getting too stoned budtenders still recommend high-potency products nine times out of 10.

But Pedro Fonseca director of retail for legendary California dispensary chain Harborside which has four stores in the state said drinks have become an important part of the product mix making up about 3.5 to 4 percent of sales in any given month. Lower potency products in particular have made inroads with Harborside’s customers in recent years.

“You can bring it to a barbecue and not have to get stoned off your rocker” Fonseca said. “The stigma doesn’t always come with it like it would if you’re just rolling a blunt and smoking it.”

Producing and distributing beverages is already an expensive endeavor compared to other cannabis products. Complicating matters further the inability to take marijuana products across state lines means companies have to duplicate their manufacturing infrastructure in each state.

“We’ll never be able to compete milligram for milligram against products like gummy bears” said Matthew Hawes founder of Novel Beverage which has a production facility in Maine and plans to open another one in Massachusetts. “Commercial bottling is really a business that requires scale.”

Anderson is a recent convert to cannabis beverages who says his breakthrough moment came when he was struggling with his identity as a queer person.

After another night of heavy drinking he was flattened by a two-day hangover and realized he needed to bring his alcohol consumption under control.

“I cannot have this happen and get in the way of being a productive human” Anderson recalled thinking of his 30-year-old self.

Soon after he began working with a close friend Jake Bullock who had been developing a concept for low-THC seltzers called Cann. They’re now available in five states with big expansion plans.

“It’s going to be just like gay marriage” said Anderson of the growing acceptance of cannabis beverages. “It’s just going to take time for people to just come over the hump on it.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

This listing doesn’t specify what exact variant of the GV70 this is but we can see it is powered by the flagship 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6 (as evidenced by the exhausts) and is painted in the same shade of red that Genesis launched the car with.

As is typical of Copart auctions no mention is made about how the luxurious SUV ended up in this sorry state. However as most of the visible damage appears limited to the passenger side front and rear doors it either hit something from the side or was perhaps T-boned by another vehicle. Whatever the explanation the damage has been severe enough to send the GV70 straight to the scrapyard.

As the damage is limited to the passenger side the SUV still runs and drives which is good news as it had only been driven 179 miles (288 km) at the time of the crash.

The listing notes that the GV70 in question has a retail value of $53964 and while it may be repairable we suspect someone will probably buy it with the intention of stripping it back and selling it for parts. After all Genesis’ 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6 has proven itself to be an excellent performer and it would be great to see it live on in another vehicle.

Not only can the powertrain be salvaged but much of the front and rear fascias as well as parts across the driver’s side can all be saved as can many interior parts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGVzbGFtb3RvcnNjbHViLmNvbS90bWMvdGhyZWFkcy9sb29raW5nLWZvci1waWN0dXJlLW9mLW15LWtuZWUtYWlyYmFnLWRlcGxveW1lbnQuMjM1NzMzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Looking for picture of MY knee airbag deployment,"You can install our site as a web app on your iOS device by utilizing the Add to Home Screen feature in Safari.

Walton introduced a new smartphone called Primo RX8 Mini in the country’s market. Focusing on gaming this phone has some breathtaking features. Here is a review of the Walton Primo RX8 Mini.

Design

Primo RX8 Mini has 2.5D glossy glass on the front as well as back. It is really good that the glass is scratch resistant and it saves your phone from any unwanted scratches. It tends to continue the trend of its predecessor and 8.4mm stylish slim corning gorilla glass gives an aesthetic look and feeling.

It has volume and power buttons on the right. The security slider remains on the left along with the SIM/micro-SD slot. The bottom of the phone features a speaker mic 3.5mm audio jack and a USD type C. On the top part of the phone you will find LED notification light and a noise cancellation system.

Display

Walton Primo RX8 Mini’s display featuring 2340 by 1080p resolution is good enough to enjoy heavy-graphics gaming as well as a multimedia experience. It offers a 6.3” IPS FHD display which is typical for the budget Walton phones.

Moreover 2.5D curved glass gives a fabulous outlook. The captive touch screen with corning gorilla glass protection can give you a smooth user experience.

Processor

Primo RX8 Mini comes with the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 6 series which is specially designed for the mobile platform. It increases the phone’s performance as well as efficiency. Therefore it can get your superior mobile user experience. The 2.2GHz Octa-Core Processor; Kryo 260 64-bit and Qualcomm® Adreno™ 512 GPU is great for mobile games. So you can play all the latest high-performance phones easily.

Memory

RX8 comes with only one variation 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage. Furthermore you can also expand the memory to 256GB through the micro-SD slot. However it is advisable not to use more than a 128GB memory card. Using a high-memory SD card slows the phone down.

Camera

The camera provides three different sensors which can get you three different experiences. A 12MP Sony IMX 486 sensor works perfectly with a dedicated 8MP wide-angle sensor and a 5MP depth sensor. The depth sensor leads to taking amazing portraits. Usually the triple lens is used for taking photos in the triple mood.

Moreover the Sony 12MP IMX can bring every detail. The wider 8MP camera sensor gets you a wider view and takes eye-catching landscape shots. The 5MP depth sensor offers amazing portrait shots with the background blur. Nevertheless the V-Drop notch of the RX8 mini features 13MP selfie camera with beautiful video features that can easily take confident shots.

Security slider

The Primo RX8 mini brings a unique feature named security slider which has three separate modes to allow access or deny access to your camera as well as microphone based on your need. Through the slider button you can enhance your phone’s security.

Battery

Despite all the features it doesn’t come with a heavy battery. It comes with a 3600mAh battery which may not be good enough for those who want to spend most of their time in gaming. But Walton has covered it up by providing a 10W charger out of the box which supports an 18W fast-charging capability.

This made-in-Bangladesh smartphone Walton Primo RX8 Mini has a special replacement facility. If there is any fault found within 30 days of buying the phone Walton replaces it and the buyer will be given another new phone.",,,

The six top members of management of Corteva Agriscience Ethiopia dismissed accusations of misconduct and misuse of power which are said to have led to conflicts in the regional office eventually bringing about mass resignations.

The reaction of the management team which includes Feseha Zeru and five other officials has come a week after The Reporter published a news story on July 24 2021 stating the giant improved seed producer and supplier has been hit with a management crisis.

The report stated that the regional office launched an investigation against its former Management team over allegations of misconduct.

In their letter written to The Reporter the former members of the management team of Pioneer Hi-Bred Seeds Ethiopia plc (otherwise known as Corteva) have rejected the report describing it as “categorically inaccurate” but confirmed their resignations.

- Advertisement -

“While the six members of the company management team who served the company for more than two decades admit that we have duly filed our resignation from the office and accepted by the African and Middles East Regional Office there are still pending issues that have not been addressed and we shall abide with the company rules of confidentiality not to disclose” the statement reads.

They argued that there has never been a management crisis in the company until they resigned from office. However as per The Reporter’s report last week its sources confirmed that the contentious crisis in the company started more than two weeks before the six individuals resigned.

In response to the reported allegation that the former country leader Fiseha Zeru committed misconduct the statement read “Neither Fiseha nor his undisclosed aides have any knowledge of such grave accusations of unspecified misconduct and abuse of power. We are unaware of the alleged violations reported to have been committed or received any charge.”

“we suspect the so-called investigation could have been conducted in an orchestrated fishing expedition with the instrumentalities of local collaborators and foreign staff that are privy to such conspiracy who are now engaged on fictitious and blasphemous media trials in the absence of concrete evidence.” it adds.

Besides rejecting the stated accusation the six individuals rather pointed their figure at the company’s regional management who accuse them of fabricating lies due to their achievement and successful performance they registered locally which is better than any other regional offices especially in the East Africa team where the mother company operates.

“The mass resignation of the six members of the management team along with the majority industrious staffs of the company toiled to bring the spectacular success that culminated on its recognition by CEO of Corteva Agriscience Jim Collins on its achievements that excelled and overshadowed all neighboring countries within the East Africa region including the country where the regional office is located” they said.

“We feel some of the leaders in the East Africa team enticed them to become jealous of the success story and plot to dwarf the Ethiopian Company and its hardworking staff not to reap the fruits of three decades of endeavors.”

Following the statements The Reporter once again contacted officials of the company via Zoom including the newly appointed Country leader Fasil Yilma from Addis Ababa’s office as well as Corteva’s regional Communication director Barbra Muzata based in Johansburg South Africa.

During the conversation The Reporter asked Barbara for the company’s official stand over the report of allegations as well as the reports of investigators deployed to Addis Ababa to investigate the stated allegation. However Barbara declined to give any details on this issue and she opted to neither confirm nor deny. But she replied “It is all about individual matter which I cannot comment in any way.”

“When you come to an individual matter such as this issue around accusations [of misconduct] and things like that we are bound by the law not to comment about personal issues what people are saying. So I am unable to comment or give any information” she said.

Asked how it can be considered personal or an individual matter when someone is entitled to lead and represent a company she insisted that “whatever it is it becomes the issue of an individual. It is very confidential and we will work it out.”

After the Zoom conversation the company has once again sent a separate statement confirming the appointment of a new leadership confirming last week’s reports issued by The Reporter.

According to the latest official statement Corteva Agriscience has new leadership appointments to support its Ethiopia business which includes Fasil Yilma who is appointed as Country Leader of its Ethiopian seed and crop protection business.

Fasil has an extensive local industry experience having fulfilled several senior management roles across the Company the company said. This includes working for both Dow AgroSciences and DuPont the two entities that merged to form Corteva Agriscience in June 2019.

In addition Mekonnen Engida will serve as Plant Location Leader (Seed Production) and Edomias Telahun as Accounting Leader for Corteva Agriscience in Ethiopia.

Corteva Agriscience is present in more than 40 countries across the Africa Middle East region and employs over 900 people as part of its operations. In Ethiopia the company has been working for more than 25 years supporting a mix of large and smallholder farmers across the country offering Pioneer brand seed and Corteva Agriscience crop protection solutions to maize wheat teff fruit and vegetables farmers in the market.

“As a leading global agriculture company we are ready to support the government in enabling the agriculture sector be more efficient helping to ensure that farmers have access to agricultural inputs such as hybrid seed varieties agronomic education and training” said Subbarao Kolli Corteva Agriscience President for Africa Middle East (AME).",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ting Shen/Xinhua via Getty Images



A Costco membership can give you access to a bevy of deals and perks from gas to cheap alcohol.

But some potential pitfalls like impulse shopping and food waste can drain your wallet instead of saving you money.

Here's how to determine whether a Costco membership is worth it for you.

Costco has a reputation as a paradise for thrifty and bulk-size shoppers but having a Costco card won't pay off for every person.

Though the cheap gas booze and deals on bulk items can seem promising if you're prone to impulse shopping and wasting food for example a membership might not be worth it for you.

Here's how to tell if you should get a Costco membership.

What are the different types of Costco memberships?

The Gold Star membership is $60 a year and the Gold Star Executive membership is $120 a year which includes an annual 2% reward on Costco purchases and cheaper car rentals and hotel stays through Costco Travel.

You can buy from Costco online without a membership but members get 5% off each purchase. So if you spend over $1200 on Costco.com without a membership you're losing money.

What are the pros of a Costco membership?

Costco can be a one-stop shop for errands since members can access the store's gas station food court optical department and pharmacy on top of the huge variety of goods offered in the store. Aine Cain a senior retail reporter at Insider who goes to Costco at least twice a month makes use of all the stores services – especially the gas which she said is cheaper than other gas stations near her.

The store's bundling of different services into one also made it an attractive destination for consumers looking to cut down on shopping trips during the pandemic.

The store also has unique items that shoppers aren't able to find elsewhere.

""For a while we were grabbing box after box of Mexican Cokes"" Cain said. ""We were walking out with cart-loads of Mexican Cokes. We looked unwell but we didn't care because the product is terrific.""

Though that product has since disappeared her other Costco favorites are Kirkland-brand seltzer water clothes and decaf coffee.

The store can also be a good deal for people who split their memberships with others or have large households.

Mary Meisenzahl a retail reporter with Insider who splits Costco purchases between herself her boyfriend and her parents buys bulk-sizes of frequently used items like oat milk and dog treats.







When a Costco membership might not be worth it for you

Costco is known for bulk sizes which translate to higher prices so you can rack up a long and pricey receipt if you have a tendency to impulse shop.

""We usually have a specific plan going into Costco but there's plenty of room for impulse buying once you're wandering around the warehouse"" Cain said. ""I feel like I'm the type of person who shouldn't be allowed to shop at Costco if I'm having a bad or stressful day because I'd really go wild with my purchases.""

If you're far away from one of Costco's 813 locations you might be wasting more money on gas driving to the store than you're saving. Plus if you have to make a long drive to get there you might not be shopping there enough to make the cost of a membership worth it.

Costco's whole appeal is bulk buying so unless you're shopping for a lot of people or if you know you're going to be using it up fast buying produce or meat in bulk won't save you money unless you can eat it before it expires.

Costco has a reputation for bargains but not all Costco deals are as thrifty as you might think – items like pasta and name-brand cereal are usually cheaper at regular grocery stores.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vdmVnbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS83L3ZlZ2FuLW1hYy1hbmQtY2hlZXNlLWNvc3Rjb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vegan Mac and Cheese Is Now at Nearly 100 Costco Stores,"This weekend wholesale retailer Costco is expanding a take-and-bake vegan mac and cheese to nearly 100 locations in the Southeastern region of the country. Chef Ayinde Howell’s Original Mac & Yease will be available in 32-ounce trays in the prepared foods section of stores in Alabama Florida Georgia Louisiana Mississippi North Carolina Oklahoma South Carolina Tennessee Texas and Puerto Rico.

Howell—the former personal chef for musician India.Arie—developed the now-popular Mac & Yease recipe several years ago as a tribute to his great-grandmother Mary’s Sunday supper staple. “I’m so happy that we get a chance to get this recipe out and for it to be in the South—that’s where the idea originated. My great-grandmother Mary Fluker used to make baked mac and cheese in St. Stephens Alabama and my father loved it so much that when he went vegan before I was born he wanted me to have it” Howell told VegNews “In my first cafe in Seattle 22 years ago I started selling cooking and refining Mac & Yease to what it is today and it will be available in the Mobile Costco in Alabama where I used to spend summers. I feel like that’s [coming] full circle if I ever saw one.”

Vegan mac and cheese for everyone

In April Costco tested Howell’s Jalapeño & Cheddar Mac & Yease at 30 locations in California and Hawaii. The jalapeño and cheddar flavor is the same recipe but with the added kick of fresh jalapeños. Howell says that the wholesale retailer expanded the meal option to more stores due to positive customer feedback. The Original Mac and Yease is available for a six-week limited time test period in the additional stores.

Though Costco was the first retailer to offer Howell’s Jalapeño & Cheddar Mac & Yease this is not the first time the Original Mac & Yease has been available at stores. In 2018 Howell partnered with Whole Foods Market to bring his mac and cheese to the supermarket’s hot-food bar at 44 locations in the Southern Pacific region which included California Las Vegas Arizona Maui and Oahu. In 2019 the option was expanded for a limited time at Whole Foods locations in Northern California.

More vegan options at Costco

In recent years Costco has expanded its selection of plant-based products particularly in the vegan meat and cheese category. Select locations of the chain offer bulk packs of Beyond Burgers Beyond Sausages and Beyond Meatballs; vegan chicken pieces made by vegan brand Daring Foods; pea-based milk by vegan brand Ripple; Daiya cheese shreds and frozen dessert bars; and JUST Egg vegan liquid egg replacer.

Additionally in May Costco rolled out new vegan breakfast sandwiches in the frozen aisle at Costco locations in Los Angeles San Francisco Bay Area and the Southeast region (which includes stores in Georgia Tennessee Mississippi South Carolina North Carolina Alabama Florida and Puerto Rico). Made by vegan brand Alpha Foods the Meatless Sausage Plant Egg & Cheeze sandwich features vegan cheese by Greek brand Violife. In 2020 the brand also launched its Plant-Protein Crispy Chik’n Patties at Costco locations in the Southeast region Los Angeles Hawaii and Texas. Earlier this month Costco increased its vegan chicken offerings with new bulk packs of Field Roast Plant-Based Nuggets at more than 50 locations in the Los Angeles area.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtob24yLmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2l3aWxlaS1jb3N0Y28tZXZhY3VhdGVkLWFmdGVyLXJlcG9ydGVkLWdhcy1sZWFrL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtob24yLmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2l3aWxlaS1jb3N0Y28tZXZhY3VhdGVkLWFmdGVyLXJlcG9ydGVkLWdhcy1sZWFrL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iwilei Costco reopens after evacuation due to reported gas leak,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.khon2.com/local-news/iwilei-costco-evacuated-after-reported-gas-leak/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtob24yLmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2l3aWxlaS1jb3N0Y28tZXZhY3VhdGVkLWFmdGVyLXJlcG9ydGVkLWdhcy1sZWFrL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtob24yLmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2l3aWxlaS1jb3N0Y28tZXZhY3VhdGVkLWFmdGVyLXJlcG9ydGVkLWdhcy1sZWFrL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy52dmRhaWx5cHJlc3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzL3RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLzIwMjEvMDcvMzEvdmljdG9yLXZhbGxleS10cmFuc2l0LWF1dGhvcml0eS1yZWxvY2F0ZXMtdHJhbnNmZXItaHViLW9sZC10b3duLXZpY3RvcnZpbGxlLzU0Mzg2ODgwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Victor Valley Transit Authority relocates transfer hub to Old Town Victorville,"Bus riders who use the Victor Valley Transit Authority system in Victorville will see changes in routes beginning Sunday when the main transfer center on Lorene Drive near Costco moves to Old Town.

After the relocation bus routes that once connected at the transfer center uptown near Seventh Street will be rerouted north to the city-owned Victor Valley Transportation Center on D Street.

“One of the reasons for relocating the bus hub was the increased traffic of people driving to Costco and pedestrians arriving for buses” said VVTA Board Director Elizabeth “Liz” Becerra who also sits on the Victorville City Council.

The added bus route between the Victorville hub and Barstow Superior Court as well as an upcoming route to California State University San Bernardino also prompted the move Becerra said.

Other benefits include the D Street building being enclosed with restrooms and vending space according to Becerra.

VVTA officials had scheduled a ribbon-cutting to mark the change but they later canceled the event due to the rise of the coronavirus’ Delta variant according to VVTA spokesperson Chris Ackerman.

VVTA Senior Planner Craig Barns told the Daily Press on Thursday “About 10 bus routes will be affected by the change of location but a stop will remain at the Lorene Drive site.”

Services at the Victor Valley Transportation Center which opened in 2000 will include VVTA and Greyhound buses a CNG fueling station and a park-and-ride according to city spokesperson Sue Jones.

“We’re excited to see our transportation center used for its intended purpose” Jones said. “Moving the VVTA transfer hub to this location will alleviate congestion on Lorene Drive.”

Jones added that the transportation center layout will provide a “better buffer” between motorists and pedestrians which she said promotes greater pedestrian safety.

To make the move possible VVTA and the city entered into a non-exclusive agreement that grants VVTA access for certain portions of the D Street site according to Jones.

The term of the license is month-to-month beginning Sunday. VVTA will pay a monthly license fee of $200 to cover the operating costs Jones said.

VVTA first approached the city regarding the potential use of the transportation center in April 2019. The license agreement was initiated by city staff and executed by City Manager Keith Metzler Jones said.

Rider feedback

Bus rider Hector Munoz 27 who lives in Victorville called VVTA’s hub relocation a “good move.”

“It doesn’t matter where you move the bus hub because there’s always going to be a bus stop to get you where you need to be” Munoz told the Daily Press on Friday. “I have noticed over the last few years that Lorene Drive has gotten more congested.”

Thom Bridle 35 of Victorville said he disagrees with a couple of fellow bus riders who claim the new VVTA location on D Street will be a “dangerous hot spot” due to the number of homeless individuals in the area.

“The homeless are everywhere and people just need to get used to it” Bridle said. “They’re on D Street by Costco on Bear Valley Road and over by the mall. Most of them are harmless and I’ve never seen them bothering anyone.”

Warming shelter

The Victor Valley Community Warming Shelter operated by High Desert Homeless Services began using Victorville’s transportation center in November 2019 with the intention of leaving the location in March 2020 Jones said.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic though the shelter transitioned to a 24-hour emergency shelter operating instead through August 2020.

At that time the shelter transitioned to the city-owned Westwinds Sports Center located on George Boulevard at the Southern California Logistics Airport across from Schmidt Park.

In April the Victorville City Council approved a 92-bed homeless shelter at Westwinds saying it would open on June 1 the Daily Press reported.

The city is paying roughly $1.1 million to the Illumination Foundation a nonprofit that runs the shelter which is seen as a temporary solution until the proposed Victorville Wellness and Recuperative Care Center is constructed.

When I first moved to Sheffield in 2014 I used to catch the bus on Waingate. Waiting for the number 75 to Pitsmoor surrounded by fellow passengers laden with shopping bags I would lean against the Old Town Hall giving little thought to the crumbling neoclassical edifice behind me. The windows were dark and the gates locked and while the city went about its business one of its grandest buildings stood silent slowly deteriorating.

Over the past seven years it has not fared any better. Its grimy and soot-stained walls and clock tower make it look like a building that has miraculously survived a nuclear attack. Graffiti and weeds texture its blackened facade and signs warning that “24-hour CCTV is in operation” are fixed to its boarded-up windows.

Many of the building’s grand fixtures and fittings are still in place. Photo: Dan Circa/HotSpot Media.

It seems strange now to think that up until November 1995 the building was still being used as Sheffield’s main Crown Court hearing the most serious criminal cases from the region in its three large courtrooms. Magistrates cases had already been moved into the court next door in 1978 and the Old Town Hall finally fell into disuse when the city's new Crown Court opened on West Bar.

Back then the building was owned by the Sheffield Town Trust an ancient organisation that traces its roots back to the thirteenth century. It then passed into the ownership of central government for four years between 2000 and 2004 before being bought by the anonymous-seeming G1 London Properties Ltd. They would do nothing with it for the next 15 years bar a few grudging repairs.

In the years that followed vandals vagrants and urban explorers had the run of the place. Almost everything of value was taken out leaving only things which were either too big or cumbersome to carry. These included mahogany panels and oak benches as well as ionic columns and ornate iron trusses. In 2007 a legally binding “urgent work notice” was considered by the council but ultimately not enacted. Shortly afterwards it was put on a list of the Victorian Society’s most at risk buildings in the UK.

On February 3 2019 Sheffield councillor and cabinet member Mazher Iqbal announced out of the blue that the building had been bought by city businessman Efekoro Omu who had also just purchased a former pub building across the road. Sheffield City Council granted him planning permission to create 12 serviced apartments a 12-room “pod hotel” in the cells and a “middle-eastern style souk market” on the ground floor.

The plans seemed incredibly ambitious and they appear to have fallen apart during the pandemic. Mr Omu says that the Covid lockdowns caused him to miss deadlines and left him in default with his lenders. But whatever the reason for his financial difficulties last month his company went bust and the Grade II listed building was put back on the market for £1.35m.

Valerie Bayliss a former chair of the Yorkshire branch of the Victorian Society set up the Friends of the Old Town Hall group in 2014 and says the building has been her life for the last seven years. The Friends used grant money to pay for a condition survey in 2016 that found it would cost around £10m to bring back into use. Around the same time compulsory purchase by the council was mooted but never came to anything.

Valerie says it is a “great shame” that the urgent work notice wasn’t enforced in 2007. That missed opportunity meant that by the time Mr Omu got access to the building in 2019 its rooms had gotten so wet that four foot deep piles of plaster framed every room. She added that in the last two years he had managed to clean and weatherproof the building but that work on his development plans had not yet begun.

‘A lack of civic ambition’

The long and complicated history of the building perhaps goes some way to explain its current difficulties. It was built in 1808 to replace an even older Town Hall near what is now Sheffield Cathedral. The new building was intended to house the then town of Sheffield’s governmental judicial and custodial functions but quickly became too small to fit everything in. The creation of an improvement commission to provide street lighting and cleaning and an early police force of sorts was followed by the establishment of an elected Town Council in 1843. All were expected to share the same space. As this account from 1862 shows:

This building...has grown perfectly inadequate for the wants of the town...the offices for the Chief Constable and other members of the police force etc are...inconvenient. It is in fact with the utmost difficulty that the necessary business can be carried on...The cells for the prisoners are the worst of all. They are confined mostly underground and most unhealthy. It is not infrequent when prisoners are confined here for any length of time...for them to beg to be removed to the Wakefield House of Correction in order to escape the discomfort and unhealthiness of the local prison.

The Old Town Hall in the late 19th century.

Major extensions were built in 1833 1866 and 1896 but the town’s rapid growth during the Industrial Revolution meant each one was rendered insufficient. Eventually when the current Sheffield Town Hall was opened on Pinstone Street in 1897 the building could concentrate purely on its judicial role. But even then it needed further extension in 1955 and by the 1990s was considered inadequate for the sheer number of serious criminal cases coming through the city.

“The whole history of the building is that it has never been big enough for what people wanted to do with it” explains Valerie. One of Sheffield’s problems throughout the nineteenth century seems to have been “a lack of civic ambition” she says adding that it is no coincidence that the city’s current Town Hall was the last of the great Victorian town halls to be built.

Outside the Old Town Hall on Thursday morning Castlegate was still quiet as the city centre continued its slow re-emergence from Covid. A few bus passengers and shoppers had heard of plans to renovate the building but were unaware they had now been shelved. One man who said he owned property in the area told The Tribune the project had been too big for an individual developer like Mr Omu. He believed a project of the size and complexity of the Old Town Hall needed a “big company or the council” to take it on.

The building’s interiors have deteriorated badly. Photo: Dan Circa/HotSpot Media.

Because of the huge scale of the task everyone involved now accepts that any renovation must be completed in stages. A few years ago the Friends of the Old Town Hall suggested a solution of their own. They proposed that the 1955 brick extension on Castle Street could be turned into a modern workspace while conference facilities and a performance space could be created in the main building and a pub could be located in the cells.

They suggested the 10-15 year project could have been funded by a lottery provided the council were able to pay for compulsory purchase up front. When Mr Omu’s plans fell through in June some drew comparisons with the George Hotel a similarly dilapidated Victorian building in Huddersfield. Kirklees Council last year bought the 170-year old building to turn it into the National Rugby League Museum. Valerie told the Star last month that all the work that had gone into their proposal remained “on the table”.

Whoever ends up owning it Valerie thinks the building’s function — what it is for — needs to be nailed down before anything else is decided. “Our plans would have cost about £15m — a huge sum of money” she says. “We know the council doesn’t have that so we were happy to encourage someone to take it on. But first you have to decide what you want to do with it.”

A new owner

In June Sheffield City Council reiterated that the building was once again on the market. They added that they were open to supporting another “developer-led proposition” but for the first time hinted they could consider public sector involvement if no buyers came forward. Council leader Terry Fox told The Tribune:

A solution to bring new life to the Old Town Hall must be found in order to retain the heritage value of the building but to also play a key role in the wider regeneration of the Castlegate area. We will be looking at what we can do to ensure that a valuable development goes ahead be that by supporting another developer-led proposition or exploring how the public sector can facilitate delivery.

But this week Nalin Seneviratne director of city centre development for the council revealed that a new buyer had been found. Speaking to The Tribune he said it would be “interesting to see whom may have bought the building and the council will be keen to discuss their plans with them.”

Sheffield-based administrators Wilson Field said they couldn’t comment on the sale process as it was “commercially sensitive”. They added that the property remained on the market and that they were unable to disclose details of potential buyers until the site was sold.

For Valerie the sale is just the latest chapter in a long series of new dawns for the 213-year-old structure. But she firmly believes that the Old Town Hall’s renovation remains the key to developing the whole Castlegate area — and that only when its future is secured will the wider neighbourhood thrive. “There is no sorting out Castlegate if you haven't sorted out the Old Town Hall” she says. “Investment won’t happen anywhere else in this area until we do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLTU4MDM3Mjg50gEqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWstNTgwMzcyODkuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Imelda Staunton pictured as Queen in Netflix's The Crown for first time,Seasons five and six of The Crown are set to encompass the 1990s - a decade that saw the Prince Charles and Diana Princess of Wales split the collapse of the Duke of York's marriage to Sarah Ferguson the Windsor Castle fire and Princess Diana's death.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvZGVzdGluYXRpb25zL2V1cm9wZS91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9zY290bGFuZC9hYmVyZGVlbnNoaXJlL2hvdGVscy9kb3VuZXNpZGUtaG91c2UtaG90ZWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Douneside House Hotel Review Aberdeenshire Scotland | Telegraph Travel,"9 / 10

The character of the hotel stays with guests long after a visit. Family portraits display a proud happy landowner Lady MacRobert with her three handsome sons. By 1941 her boys had all died one in a civil air accident two in RAF service. The bar is decorated in RAF navies and greys and in the garden a statue of a Stirling Bomber named ""MacRobert’s Reply"" commemorates Lady MacRobert’s reaction to her loss – she furnished the RAF with aircraft in her name.

This summer there's no need to go abroad to visit a gorgeous beach: there's one just two hours from London that's been named one of the prettiest in the country.

The coastal village of Orford is a ten-mile-long shingle spit of Orford Ness and it's a peaceful and tranquil place for a delightful summer day out.

Spend the day relaxing and strolling around the village tucking in to some local oysters or explore some of the historic highlights that Orford has to offer from the pretty lighthouse to impressive castle.

Orford has its very own castle Orford Castle and a visit there feels like a step back to the Medieval times.

The splendid site has an impressive tower that was once surrounded by huge walls but all that remains of the 12th century castle now is the main tower - with some spectacular views from the top.

The village has a historic town status as it was of some significance as a port and fishing village in the Middle Ages.

Even today Orford is popular during the summer with sailors: the River Alde joins to the sea just south of the village offering a unique experience for sailing fans.

Orford is a special area as it provides the only way to access to the nature reserves of Orford Ness and Havergate Island. Both of the sites can only be accessed through ferry boat from Orford Quay.

On top of all this the village has an array of attractions such as river cruises three pubs a smokehouse a renowned traditional bakery restaurants and lots of nature sites.

For some quick refreshments visitors can stop by at the Jolly Sailor at Orford which is a traditional red brick pub with rooms in a 400-year-old building with a garden.

Or you can stop at The Crown and Castle which is known for serving a delicious Sunday roast.

Seafood-lovers can't miss Pinney’s of Orford near the quay which has a stock of its own smoked fish as well as the day’s catches.

The Butley Orford Oysterage is a cute restaurant on the Market Square which offers some of the best seaside cuisine the heart can desire.

The no-frills eatery has its own smokehouse and offers local oysters and some of the best fresh seafood in town.

With so much to see and do in stunning surroundings it's no surprise that Orford was ranked among the 20 most beautiful villages in the UK and Ireland by Condé Nast Traveller in 2020.

How to get there

(Image: Google Maps)

Orford is best reached by car via the A12 and A14 motorways - the journey takes around two and a half hours and gives you a scenic look at the Suffolk countryside.

You can get there by public transport in just under three hours taking a train from Liverpool Street to Ipswich before using local train services to Melton and then hopping on a bus to Orford.",,,

It’s in the middle of just normal typical Lindenwald framed houses and then just this gigantic castle on Tiffin.”

Cummins 41 vividly recalls being about 9 and “I was scared to death to go up and get candy.”

But he did: “My Mom and Dad would have to force me to get candy. The people were extremely nice and gave us good candy.”

The presentation will happen during the 17Strong Advisory Board meeting 6 p.m. Monday in City Council Chambers on the first floor of 345 High St.

Cummins a 17Strong board member is a business teacher at Mason High School. This summer he was one of several people who performed a comprehensive inventory of every parcel in the city.

“Through this it was exciting to come across some hidden gems in Hamilton” Cummins said. “I’ve lived in Hamilton for 30 years of my life and there were some areas I wasn’t even familiar with” especially on the city’s West Side.

Another interesting place that stood out for him was a large farm house on Alberta Drive in the city’s New London neighborhood.

“There’s all these new developments and as you’re going up this hill on Alberta Drive there’s this old … . I would think it was probably before any of that settlement took place” probably from the early 1900s Cummins said. “That was really really cool in that area.”

While studying city properties he was surprised by the many city parks and other public areas that aren’t generally known to people who don’t live in an immediate area. Also “these beautiful blocks on neighborhood side streets that are deep in subdivision and unique homes that weren’t easily seen along the busy roads.”

“There are some areas of Hamilton that are very cool to see” he said. “I think the charm and charisma in some of these neighborhoods is unbelievable.”

After he graduated from Miami University he moved to Cincinnati to be near his job. He moved to the Highland Park neighborhood where he has lived two years and is building a house in the Washington neighborhood.

Saurber the city’s director of neighborhoods said in the past people have shown up at 17Strong board meetings and had to sit through the uninteresting aspects of board business.

“We’re really trying to consider that and make sure the board meetings themselves offer an opportunity for engagement and outreach of people outside the board.”

So “These presentations are going to become a new staple of the board meetings” Saurber said. “So if you don’t stick around for any of the board business some of these presentations should hopefully be pretty enlightening for residents.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ2dHJhdmVsLmNvbS9kZWYtaGVhZC1zdHJhbmRlZC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudHMtd29ya2Fyb3VuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stranded due to DEF head?

LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--After AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) launched a new national advocacy and ad campaign to take on health and pharmacy giant CVS over its anti-competitive business model and practices it learned late last week that the ‘Providence Journal’—CVS’s home state daily newspaper—was rejecting AHF’s ad. CVS the sixth largest corporation in the world is headquartered in nearby Woonsocket RI. A version of the ad ran in today’s Boston Sunday Globe on page A3.

The advocacy campaign and ad ‘CVS: Corporate Vampires Suck’ (https://ahf.org/stop-cvs) targets CVS over its fierce anti-competitive behavior specifically regarding its refusal to allow patients any choice in their pharmacy services. CVS’s currently forces most of its health plan patients from providers like Aetna—which CVS purchased for $69 billion in cash and stock in 2018—to obtain their lifesaving medications by mail order or drop shipment.

AHF’s ‘CVS: Corporate Vampires Suck’ campaign kicked off last month with a full-page full-color ad that ran in daily and weekly newspapers across the country with most ads landing Sunday July 11. The ad also ran in the weekly ‘Houston Defender’ (Thursday July 8). The Sunday papers include the Ft. Lauderdale ‘Sun Sentinel’ ‘Houston Chronicle’ and the ‘Chicago Defender’ (online). The ads are being complemented by a radio campaign social media and a legislative call-to-action urging viewers and readers to contact their legislators asking them to help fight back against CVS’s monopolistic and anti-competitive behavior.

AHF intended to run the ad this week in the ‘Providence Journal’ and had been communicating back and forth with the paper’s advertising department regarding suggested possible changes or edits to the ad. Some changes were incorporated by AHF: a change to the parody CVS logo and some softening of the ad copy. However after making some initial changes suggested by the ‘Providence Journal’ the paper’s ad reps then advised AHF the ad could not run. They also refused to inform AHF what else might need to be changed or altered to clear the ad for publication. The ‘Providence Journal’ is the oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the United States.

“While we are disappointed that the ‘Providence Journal’ will not run our ‘Corporate Vampires Suck’ advocacy ad we are not entirely surprised. It’s the hometown paper of CVS which also runs multipage ad circulars dozens of Sundays every year in the paper and in most major newspapers across the country” said Michael Weinstein president of AHF. “But make no bones about it. CVS remains a major threat to public health. It has been buying up health plans for billions and forcing clients—including HIV/AIDS patients—to use CVS’s mail order services harming patients and fragmenting their care in the process. Patients are suffering and small pharmacies are being squeezed with many being put out of business. That’s why we put some real fangs into this advocacy campaign—we need the public’s help to fight back against CVS’s ‘corporate vampires.’”

AHF’s ‘CVS: Corporate Vampires Suck’ campaign will run until September. For more information about this campaign to fight back against CVS and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who are putting their profit ahead of patient health please visit: https://ahf.org/stop-cvs

The Good Clinic under former MinuteClinic CEO Michael Howe 68 quietly launched in February with a flagship site in a residential-commercial complex called NordHaus in bustling lower Northeast.

Good Clinic also plans sites in Eden Prairie St. Louis Park and St. Paul by December as well as 50 clinics in in several states over the next three years.

Good Clinic is a subsidiary of publicly held Mitesco an over-the-counter stock with bigger-market aspirations which recently hired investment banker E.F. Hutton to raise a yet-to-be specified sum to finance the growth of Good Clinic and other ventures.

Mitesco said it will spend about $900000 to build out and market the Nordhaus clinic with a 7.5-year lease and that it will need $50 million for the next 50.

Like MinuteClinic Good Clinic is built around nurse practitioners as primary heath care providers. It has agreements or negotiations with major insurers including Medicare.

Howe said the difference with the typical clinic-in-a-store model is that Good Clinic will provide a ""medical home"" instead of more one-off visits to treat strep throat or an earache or panic attack.

""We want the accountability of health care to be [in the hands of the patients]"" Howe said last week. ""But they need the coaches education and empathy. And study after study about the value of primary care shows that for every dollar you invest you save $13 in downstream health care costs.""

Good Clinic will locate in dense-population urban areas with a spa-like feel and wellness plans for every patient. The focus will be convenience value and satisfaction.

Amid a primary-care doctor shortage care increasingly is being delivered by physician assistants and nurses often outside traditional doctor offices.

There's lots of competition. CVS acquired Target's pharmacy business in 2015 for $1.9 billion and added MinuteClinics in many stores. Walmart Walgreens and others are in the walk-in primary-care business.

Mitesco CEO Larry Diamond 58 a Wall Street veteran who once worked for UnitedHealth Group said Good Clinic is focused on the 70% of Americans who consume 25% of the rising U.S. health care spending as opposed to the 5% who use about 50%.

Part of the Good Clinic secret sauce is an ""activation tool"" that helps determine if patients can self-manage and how providers can best work with them.

""We never knew 50% of the population is not good at self-management"" Howe said. ""Our clinicians are now armed with the information. A diabetic has 10 things to do every day. Some people struggle with that. We parse it down to the vital few that they have to do.""

Howe stayed with MinuteClinic since relocated to CVS headquarters for about three years after the 2006 acquisition.

His team designed Good Clinic around sustainable personal and virtual relationships.

Mitesco based in Minnetonka raised $15 million in preferred stock proceeds in spring 2020 following discussions between Howe and Diamond that led to acquisition of Good Clinic. Earlier Diamond and other investors acquired a near-dormant public company and changed its name and purpose to be a holding company for health startups.

Diamond said the advantage of initially capitalizing Good Clinic through a public company compared with the more traditional route of venture capital and private equity will allow retail investors to get in on the ground floor. That's where big gains often accrue.

Rob Goldman a former Piper Jaffray analyst who now runs Goldman Small Cap Research of Baltimore was paid $4000 by Mitesco to produce an introductory analysis in February.

Mitesco (ticker MITI) shares have slid since winter from 40 cents to about 20 cents; it now has a market value of $38 million. Goldman in a late-June update projects 2022 revenue of $18 million and forecasts a price of $2 per share within a year.

""MITI offers unusual upside potential"" Goldman wrote in the update.

Good Clinic senior management includes several MinuteClinic veterans: Dr. Jim Woodburn president and chief operating officer was a former medical director of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota; Dr. Rebecca Hafner-Fogarty chief medical officer and primary-care physician held a senior role at Zipnosis; and Kevin Lee Smith the chief nurse practitioner was a founder of MinuteClinic and also is a veteran of Zipnosis.

A young woman from Alabama who vanished in Europe two years ago has finally been found her family says.

Nicole Denise Jackson 23 left her Birmingham area home for Germany at the end of 2018 and eventually stopped answering calls and texts. Her family hasn’t heard from her in two years.

On Friday a private investigator finally found her.

“Nicole has been located” the family told WBRC . “She’s safe and in good health. She has been verified by the State Department in person.”

Ms Jackson who is a singer allegedly moved to Germany to study music – and her family later learned to be with a man she’d met online. After she got there she continued speaking with her family for about a year occasionally sending a “Happy birthday” text or some other perfunctory communication.

Then around Christmas of 2019 she went silent.

“I know this is not like her’’ Ms Jackson’s older sister Ela Vaughn told AL.com in July. “When I say no one has talked to her I mean no one.”

In July Ms Vaughn and her father Antonio Jackson hired a detective to find Ms Jackson and also prepared to travel to Munich to look for her themselves.

The detective got to her first. Digging through Ms Jackson’s emails the P.I. managed to identify the man Ms Jackson was living with and contacted his employer and landlord.

Before long Ms Jackson – apparently aware her family was looking for her – walked into a State Department outpost and showed proof of her identity.

However she still hasn’t spoken to her family.

“She’ll reach out to us when he’s ready’’ Ms Vaughn told AL.com . “I feel a whole lot better. She will eventually reach out. I know she will.”

Ms Vaughn still doesn’t understand why her sister stopped communicating with their family but says the important thing is that she’s alive.

“I’m more at peace. I’d still like to hear her voice’’ Ms Vaughn said. “I’m happy to know our prayers have been answered. She’s safe and she’s OK.”

The past year-and-a-half has brought countless challenges for restaurants from the early days when restaurant operators were forced to think on their feet as sudden shutdown orders brought dine-in business to a halt to current struggles with supply and staffing. During the course of the pandemic restaurants have had to reinvent themselves countless times — ramping up off-premises sales exploring virtual brands and rallying around their communities to support people in need.

While many of these changes came out of necessity as a reaction to the times the pandemic has brought about a shift in the restaurant industry that will outlast the pandemic. Most restaurant operators plan to keep at least some of the changes they made to their operations during the pandemic according to the National Restaurant Association’s 2021 State of the Industry report. In fact more than 25% of fast-casual and quickservice restaurant operators said they plan to keep all of the changes they made to their restaurants after COVID-19 has subsided.

Whether it’s new or expanded channels for off-premises that cater to lasting demand for convenient meal options or programs that serve the local community here’s a look at some of the concepts and innovations that are defining the future of foodservice.

Takeaway is here to stay

Delivery and takeout sales skyrocketed early in the pandemic since they were restaurants’ only means of serving customers while their dining rooms were closed but many eateries are betting on continued demand for off-premises. Darden Restaurants reported sustained interest in off-premises dining in June even as dine-in sales picked back up and off-premises sales accounted for 33% of total sales at Olive Garden in the quarter ending May 30.

Darden has made improvements to its digital ordering and curbside pickup operations to streamline takeout. Countless other restaurants are also making efforts to scale up takeout operations and make it as convenient as possible for customers to get food to go. Chains including Portillo’s Chipotle and Jack in the Box have announced plans for new stores that will serve off-premises orders only and many restaurants have unveiled revamped store designs that feature multiple drive-thrus or expanded parking areas for in-car dining.

Brands take shape without brick and mortar

While some restaurants will take on new physical forms in the coming years there is also a wave of new restaurant brands that have done away with the need for a storefront altogether.

Virtual concepts and ghost kitchens were already growing before the pandemic but the uptick in takeout and delivery orders has kicked off a tidal wave of new virtual brands that is still going strong. Chicken wing concepts have been one of the most popular entry points into virtual brands with new virtual brands including Cosmic Wings and Wings Out debuting from Dine Brands and Dave & Buster’s respectively.

Some virtual brands are betting on the continued growth of both on- and off-premises dining by expanding from digital to brick and mortar. Dickey’s Restaurant Brands plans to launch a restaurant next month for the Wing Boss virtual brand it launched earlier this year.

Hotel guests dine in and order out

With travel starting to rebound after people put trips on pause during the pandemic some hotels are overhauling their food options to be more appealing to travelers. One change we’re likely to see more of in the coming years is hotels adding partnerships with restaurants or delivery services to cater to people who don’t want to give up their food delivery habit while on the road. For example Resorts World Las Vegas recently announced it is partnering with Grubhub to replace traditional in-room dining with its delivery service.

On the other end of the spectrum some hotels are stepping up their in-house restaurant game to become dining destinations in their own right by partnering with big-name chefs. The partnerships — which range from permanent restaurants to limited-time dinner series — can be a win-win for chefs who are looking for new opportunities after their businesses were hit hard by the pandemic.

Community support for all seasons

Despite the difficult circumstances that the restaurant industry continues to face during the pandemic chefs and restaurant operators were quick to come to the aid of those in need in their communities. This community-focused ethos will continue to be a driving force for many restaurants even after the pandemic has ended.

After she was laid off in 2020 chef Camille Cogswell worked with the social justice bake sale effort Bakers Against Racism and now she is working on a community-focused bakery in North Carolina.

Massachusetts chef Tracy Chang started two non-profits during the pandemic that distribute groceries to restaurant industry employees and serve meals to front-line workers. Chang said she plans to keep serving her community even after her restaurant resumes normal dine-in business. “These communities will continue to feel the impact of COVID even after the pandemic is over” she said.

First it must be understood why the concave is so critical to a combine harvester’s performance. The concave is the cornerstone of threshing. It’s the heart of the machine. It’s the one element of the machine whose entire purpose is to thresh crop. There is no mechanism that plays a more important role in threshing crops than the concaves. Some unduly attribute rotor bars (rasp bars) as primary threshing components but forget that the purpose of rotor bars is primarily to move material through the rotor. Want proof? Put a perfectly smooth rotor bar on (with no aggression) and harvest corn. Then put on an aggressive rotor bar and go harvest corn. You will see minimal to zero differences in threshing effectiveness. On the other hand if you change the concaves you will see a massive difference between various styles in the combine’s capacity and performance. The concaves that come in OEM combines are the same concaves that came in the combines 50 years ago. The technology is way behind the rest of the machine.

There is one concave however that is changing the game: Estes Performance Concaves XPR 2 Concances from Estes Performance Concaves (also known as “Estes Concaves”). It has completely disrupted the combine concave market and even OEMs have released and started pushing their own “aftermarket” concaves. John Deere and Case IH seem to have finally admitted by virtue of offering an aftermarket option that there is merit and validity to the importance of the concave. In fact it’s the single most critical component in combine performance and we have the proof.

Last fall Estes Concaves set out to see just how much of an improvement the then unreleased XPR 2+ system was in comparison to the OEM. To say the least it was phenomenal. Estes ran several combines side-by-side (John Deere S780s S790s and Case IH 8250s 9250s) ones with the XPR 2+ system and ones with OEM concaves. They then exported all the data from Deere’s Ultimate Data and Field Analyzer. They also compared elevator tickets between the machines. Although they have not released any hard data just yet of the ongoing research and development they did say the data is pretty unbelievable. The tank sample is “seed quality” and that was while harvesting at 180% capacity of OEM machines with no loss and no changes other than the concaves. The XPR 2 concaves are already disrupting the market but Estes Performance Concaves fervently insist that the disruption has just begun and that a massive breakthrough is just over the horizon.

(Provided by Monarch Tractor)

Monarch Tractor the world's first electric driver-optional smart-tractor manufacturer has closed a $20-million Series A funding round. The round includes global industrial equipment manufacturers and automotive suppliers.

The investments come from Musashi Seimitsu Industry Co. Ltd. a Japan-based global auto parts company CNH Industrial (Case IH New Holland Agriculture and Steyr) and VST Tillers Tractors Ltd. an Indian tractor and implement company. Monarch Tractor headquartered in Livermore California was founded in 2019.

""The food ecosystem is ready for transformation with farmers demanding sustainable tools that can increase efficiency and farm profitability"" says Praveen Penmetsa CEO of Monarch Tractor. The investments validate the Monarch Tractor platform he adds.

Monarch tractors look similar to a compact tractor but are narrower and slightly longer. Their electric drivetrain can provide 40 hp (30 kilowatts) of continuous power and short-duration peak power up to 70 hp (55 kw). The PTO and 3-point hitch are comparable to a diesel tractor. Its hydraulic capacity equals or exceeds conventionally powered units of the same size. Because it is electric the Monarch has two times as much torque as comparable units.

The tractor is essentially a hub for data collection (analyzing 240 gigabytes of data every day it operates) and observation and is even a source of remote electrical power. It can be a sprayer a cultivator and a drone for recharging other units while uploading information collected from field operations. The Monarch can create alerts provide actionable information as well as give managers close insight into what is going on in a given field. For example the Monarch incorporates a micro weather station that among climatic conditions monitors wind speed. The platform can be programmed to cease spraying operations if local wind conditions exceed preplanned or regulatory parameters.

A large battery with 10 hours or more of operating time powers Monarch tractors. Under high workloads the battery is designed to give owners four to five hours of operation. The battery system lasts 10 years according to Monarch. A battery recharge requires up to five hours. To manage charging times Monarch sells an optional swappable battery pack. The swap can be completed by one person in 10 minutes."

Since airline travel rebounded this spring as vaccinations went up flight attendants said they encountered more aggressive passengers than before the pandemic.

The vast majority of flight attendants — 85% — said they had dealt with unruly passengers since the year started according to a 5000 person survey by the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

One Chicago-based flight attendant said part of her job is understanding she never knows why someone is flying; she does not know whether they are flying for a vacation or a funeral. She therefore tries to be patient with all her passengers.

But she said the same patience is ""never"" extended back to flight attendants.

""It's hard to not be seen as a human at work you're seen as an entity"" the Chicago-based flight attendant told Insider. ""I am the face of the airline and for people to air all their grievances directly to me when in reality there's only so much I can do.""

Five flight attendants told Insider they want airline passengers to stop taking their frustration out on them. Most flight attendants requested to stay anonymous so they could speak freely. Insider has confirmed their identities and employment.

Harvard psychologist Luana Marques recently told Insider's Avery Hartmans passengers may be more aggressive right now due to the collective fear and anxiety over the COVID-19 pandemic for the past year and a half.

One Boston-based flight attendant said she can understand that passengers feel frustrated by the patchwork mask rules and the ongoing pandemic but urged passengers not to take their anger out on her and other workers.

She said she used to have more fun on the job from traveling and interacting with passengers but since passenger violence soared she's felt burned out and anxious about going into work.

""I still think it's a great job to have but it's just like is it worth the possible abuse you have to withstand is it worth not being supported by your company is it worth being shamed almost when you request personal time?"" she said.

Flight attendants told Insider the harassment has taken a toll on their mental health. Nas Lewis a Chicago-based flight attendant and the founder of the mental health resource for airline workers th|AIR|apy said she has seen a rise in activity this summer due to passenger violence.

Lewis said flight attendants have posted photos of themselves crying to the th|AIR|apy Facebook group and said some have revealed they've engaged in self-harm.

A Texas-based flight attendant said she has deliberately not worked in certain parts of the aircraft she knows will encounter the most abuse. She said she has been called a ""bitch"" sworn at and told to ""watch her back"" by aggressive passengers.

She said passengers may be more aggressive in the air because of frustration over the pandemic. The flight attendant said passengers may feel ""emboldened"" to act aggressively due to the lack of consequences unruly travelers face.

The AFA called for the Department of Justice and the FAA to intervene in passenger violence incidents more often. According to the AFA survey 71% of flight attendants who filed incident reports received no follow-up and a majority ""did not observe efforts to address the rise in unruly passengers by their employers.""

Sweet Spot Sunday is a weekly series highlighting the best-value award redemptions across loyalty programs.

Virgin Atlantic Flying Club has a ton of interesting redemptions with its non-alliance airline partners. One of these includes economy flights from the U.S. to Israel. More often than not you can book this award at prices similar to what you'd pay for a domestic ticket within the U.S. That's right: These awards start at just 20000 Virgin points one-way.

Remember you can transfer points to Virgin Atlantic from most of the major transferable points programs like:

Let's take a closer look at this award and how to book it.

Award tickets to Israel aren't cheap. Most programs charge at least 30000 points one-way including Air France and KLM's joint Flying Blue loyalty program which recently devalued these tickets. So with that in mind 20000-point one-way tickets to Israel are an absolute steal. Plus awards are predictable as Virgin Atlantic Flying Club doesn't have dynamic award pricing on partner flights.

You'll fly on airlines like Air France Delta and Virgin Atlantic on these award itineraries. These airlines each provide quick connections to Israel through European hubs like Amsterdam (AMS) London Heathrow (LHR) and Paris (CDG). Unfortunately Delta-operated flights are more expensive thanks to Virgin Atlantic's new Delta award chart.

Taxes and fees on these tickets are reasonable too. When on Air France or KLM flights you'll pay less than $175 each way. Virgin Atlantic tickets will have moderately higher taxes and fees in economy but you'll get a slight points discount. For example New York-JFK to Tel Aviv (TLV) via London is 19000 points and $244.50 in taxes and fees.

Better yet you'll pay only marginally more points if you depart from the West Coast. For example this KLM flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to Tel Aviv via Amsterdam is just 23000 points and $190.80 in taxes and fees one-way. This is an exceptional deal on such a long flight.

The quarantine exemption will come into effect from 4 am on Monday and British Airways is hoping to cash in on relaxed travel rules by ramping up its U.S. schedule through August. Flights between London Heathrow and New York JFK will increase from 17 to 21 flights per week services to Chicago will increase by 30 per cent to 10 flights per week and Seattle will become a daily flight.

Gearing up for the increase in passenger numbers BA’s flagship U.S. lounge at JFK Terminal 7 reopened on Sunday after being mothballed for 16 months.

Los Angeles will also be served double-daily beginning August 23 and British Airways says it hopes to “broaden” its U.S. network through September. That could see the resumption of flights to cities such as Philadephia and San Diego which have been suspended through the pandemic.

In the meantime British Airways is hoping to take advantage of its partnership with American Airlines to feed passengers from AA’s domestic network onto BA’s London-bound flights.

During a recent investor presentation BA’s parent company said that 92 per cent of the airline’s long-haul fleet was ready to go although the fleet is nearly 20 per cent smaller than in 2019. British Airways retired its fleet of Boeing 747’s during the pandemic and its Airbus A380’s remain grounded.

The airline’s cabin crew workforce has also been kept operationally ready although the total number of cabin crew is down by 30 per cent compared to before the pandemic. Around 18000 UK-based staff remain on the government-funded furlough scheme which ends in October.

British Airways was operating just 150 flights per day in early June but with travel restrictions slowly easing the airline plans to increase its daily flight schedule to 340 by the end of this month. If operations continue to ramp up BA says it will need to start using Terminal 3 before the end of the summer.

On Sunday it was revealed that Chancellor Rishi Sunak had written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a plea to drop restrictive travel rules that are leaving the UK other countries. The next review of the UK’s traffic light travel rules is set to be announced later this week."

Others include the much larger Bellingham Wash.-based eXp Realty and New York-based Compass.

Fathom now has 6000 agents compared with 1700 in 2017. Its revenue tripled in the last three years to $177 million and is expected to top $250 million this year and $310 million next year according to estimates by two analysts who track the company.

“All of our operations are built to operate off the cloud” says Wendy Forsythe Fathom’s chief brand officer. “When an agent does a transaction the contract is uploaded into our proprietary software system and then we manage everything from compliance to getting the agent paid through our technology platform.”

Fathom went public in June 2020 for $10 a share raising $31 million. After trading for as much as $54 earlier this year it closed at about $26 on July 16. The market valuation was about $350 million.

Since the IPO it has expanded from 75 markets in 24 states to 113 in 29 states. Fathom agents operate in most big N.C. markets but overall have a minor market share in the state. Its challenge is attracting brokers from established companies with name recognition built over decades.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Venezia FC as its new 2021/2022 effort proves is one of them.

Back in the Serie A big league for the first time in 19 years following financial struggles mismanagement and relegation the storied club has pulled out all the stops with a gorgeous navy kit. Featuring gold elements in a nod to Venetian churches and art a text bearing ""Venezia"" has replaced the typical sponsor once more while the gold stars of the iconic Basilica di San Marco are arranged as a “V.""

This is the first Kappa Venezia kit since the brand replaced Nike and it's neat to see a smaller club — similar to AIK in Sweden — work closely with brands to realize their clear aesthetic vision. Kappa is a brand known for mixing retro stylings with modern touches and that's certainly how they've gone about this beauty.

The Venezia home shirt has sold out on the official club store but those in Europe can find it on other sites such as Pro Direct Soccer. The club will release four kits in total with Kappa this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9zcXVhcmUtYWNxdWlyZXMtYWZ0ZXJwYXktMjktYmlsbGlvbi0yMzA0MzgzNzkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Square Acquires Afterpay for $29 Billion in All-stock Deal,"Square Inc. said it reached a deal with Afterpay Ltd. to acquire the buy now pay later company in an all-stock deal valued at $29 billion.

The company expects to close the deal in the first quarter of 2022.

Jack Dorsey cofounder and chief executive officer of Square said in a statement that the two companies have a shared purpose: “We built our business to make the financial system more fair accessible and inclusive and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles.”

“Together we can better connect our Cash App and Seller ecosystems to deliver even more compelling products and services for merchants and consumers putting the power back in their hands” Dorsey noted.

Square said the deal is expected to accelerate the company’s “strategic priorities for its Seller and Cash App ecosystems. Square plans to integrate Afterpay into its existing Seller and Cash App business units enable even the smallest of merchants to offer BNPL at checkout give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App and give Cash App customers the ability to discover merchants and BNPL offers directly within the app.”

Brian Grassadonia lead of Square’s Cash App business said the addition of Afterpay to Cash App “will strengthen our growing networks of consumers around the world while supporting consumers with flexible responsible payment options. Afterpay will help deepen and reinforce the connections between our Cash App and Seller ecosystems and accelerate our ability to offer a rich suite of commerce capabilities to Cash App customers.”

Afterpay serves more than 16 million consumers and nearly 100000 merchants globally including major retailers in fashion homewares beauty and sporting goods. “Afterpay empowers consumers to access the things they want and need while allowing them to maintain financial wellness and control” Square said in a statement. “Afterpay also assists merchants in growing their businesses by helping to drive repeat purchases increase average transaction sizes and provide their buyers with the ability to pay over time.”

Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar Afterpay cofounders and co-CEOs said that by combining with Square “we will further accelerate our growth in the U.S. and globally offer access to a new category of in-person merchants and provide a broader platform of new and valuable capabilities and services to our merchants and consumers.”

Eisen and Molnar are expected to stay on following the deal’s closing.

Charlie Youakim the co-founder of Sezzle at its ASX listing with chief financial officer Karen Hartje.

Matthew Dillon who was killed in action in Iraq in 2006.

The Matthew Dillon Scholarship Fund supports top Junior ROTC students from Wagener-Salley Silver Bluff South Aiken and Aiken high schools and the host site for this year's gathering will be the Lewis Wise Building 561 May Royal Drive next to the Western Carolina State Fairgrounds. The doors are to open at 6:30 p.m. and the event is under the leadership of James L. Hammons Marine Corps League 939 based in Aiken.

Columbia-based attorney Thomas Mullikin who retired from the South Carolina State Guard as the organization's major general is to be the featured speaker. Mullikin will be sharing from a background that includes certification as a polar diver (diving in the Arctic and Antarctic regions) and scaling such peaks as Mount Elbrus (the highest mountain in Europe) Mount Kilimanjaro (highest in Africa) and Mount Kosciuszko (highest on Australia's mainland) with more peaks in his sights. He also holds a black belt in karate.

The fund in Dillon's honor according to a Marine Corps League report provides $1000 checks to the top cadet in the JROTC programs at the four high schools.

Dillon a corporal died Dec. 11 2006 in Al Khalidiyah Iraq at age 25 when a roadside bomb hit his Humvee while on combat operations on his 37th mission. He was assigned to Support Squadron 373 Marian Wing Support Group 37 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing I Marine Expeditionary Force Marine Air Corps Station which is in Miramar California. He had attended South Aiken High School participating in the Naval JROTC program and went on to graduate from Wardlaw Academy in Edgefield County.

The new proposed route changes will be presented by Ocala Growth Management Director Tye Chighizola to the Ocala City Council during its Tuesday August 3 meeting.

SunTran operates as a division of the Growth Management Department since the city of Ocala took over management of the service from the Ocala/Marion Transportation Planning Organization.

According to city records the proposed changes to the Blue Green Orange and Purple Routes will create “a figure eight (8) loop” to provide more coverage and more direct travel in most of the service area between the different routes.

The proposed alignment reduces ride time by nearly 50% and offers greater ease of service for disabled passengers by providing for fewer necessary transfers according to the city.

In addition the proposal suggests that alternating the alignment of the Yellow and Silver routes allows expanded coverage to “crucial areas in need of public transit due to new employment corridors and human services agencies’ including travel from northwest and southwest Ocala to the downtown central business district.

According to the city the major route redesign undertaken in 2018 did “not achieve its stated goal to provide more coverage and more direct travel in most of the service area.” That conclusion was based on the lowest customer-rated service elements in the survey: Bench or shelter locations at bus stops number of times to transfer and overall trip time length.

For a complete breakdown of the route changes and survey responses visit the City of Ocala meetings page and access the “Agenda Packet” for the August 3 meeting.

If the Ocala City Council approves the route changes for SunTran’s Transit Network records show the city will target implementation by October 1 2021.

The Ocala City Council meets on the first and third Tuesday of every month at 5 p.m. Meetings take place at Ocala City Hall located at 110 SE Watula Avenue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vY29vc2F2YWxsZXluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4L2NhbGhvdW4tbWFuLWphaWxlZC1mb3ItdGFraW5nLWd1bi1kcnVncy1mcm9tLWNyaW1lLXNjZW5lLWluLXJvbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Calhoun Man Jailed for Taking Gun Drugs from Crime Scene in Rome,"Blake Marquese Pugh 31 of Calhoun was jailed in Rome this week after reports said he removed a gun from an active crime scene back in May.

Authorities went on to say that Pugh a convicted felon was not allowed to have a firearm in his possession.

He is charged with tampering with evidence and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon."

Wine deals wine deals WINE DEALS…but seriously if you’re close to a Trader Joe’s it may be time to make this place your grocery store go-to.

Trader Joe’s is able to keep prices low by selling private-label products instead of name brands.

According to Business Insider 80 percent of their products are in-house meaning you can’t buy these products anywhere else and that the store buys directly from suppliers cutting out the middlemen in a supply chain that can drive up costs.

Trader Joe’s also cuts costs by spending less on marketing and relying on word of mouth.

Trader Joe’s also offers discounts for shoppers who bring in their own reusable bags.

Aldi’s

Aldi’s is a great grocery store for deals on deals on DEALS!

The store avoids name brand products by keeping 90 percent of their items private label which saves their shoppers money.

The few well-known products they do sell are either discontinued or overstock products letting the store sell them at a reduced price.

The physical store itself saves money by its design which is made for minimal stocking and upkeep. All their products are left in the boxes they came and their locations are minimally decorated.

Aldi’s also has fewer workers at their stores which keeps costs lower and it helps shoppers avoid getting constantly asked “do you need help with anything” as they buy their products.

Don’t forget to bring your own bags (as the store does not offer free shopping bags) and bring a quarter (you’ll get back) to use one of their carts inside the store.

(WKRC/KARE/CNN Newsource) - A man is accused of a gruesome murder allegedly beheading his girlfriend and throwing her body in the street.

""The first question I asked the cop when I asked the cop if I could tell him what I saw was 'That was real?' And he said 'Yes'"" said Alexis Prull.

Prull was cleaning her house Wednesday afternoon on the corner of a busy four-way stop intersection when something suspicious out the window prompted her to start filming with her cell phone.

""I thought it was a joke"" she said. ""I thought it was some type of prank. I didn't think it was real I thought maybe it was a doll.""

The doll was actually a lifeless body pulled out of the car by a man who then grabbed her decapitated head.

""I saw him go in his backseat put on his backpack and walk away like nothing happened"" said Prull.

The victim was 55-year-old America Mafalda Thayer who prosecutors say legally changed her name to ""America"" when she got her citizenship.





Charged in her death is her boyfriend 42-year-old Alexis Saborit.

According to the criminal complaint witnesses at the busy intersection who drove around the car apparently saw the suspect hacking the victim but didn't realize what they were watching.





The next day a woman walking her dog found the bloody murder weapon -- a long machete with a deeply serrated edge.

""He smelled something and he just stopped"" she said. ""It was very awful seeing it and I wish I hadn't. I'll never be able to unsee it.""

Saborit has a pending arson charge and was bailed out of jail by the victim who also wrote a letter to a judge in a domestic abuse case claiming her boyfriend was not abusing her.

In court Saborit said he is innocent and it was self defense.

""Every murder is bad but just the horror and the effort it must have taken him to commit that act is just beyond belief"" said Scott County attorney Ron Hocevar.

At the murder scene community members who feel like they know the victim because she was a Dollar Tree store clerk created a memorial for her where they stop to pay respects.





""We just wanted to wish her so much love and so much peace"" one neighbor said.

In court the defendant asked the judge if he could be deported to his home country instead of standing trial. The judge denied this and set bail at $2.5 million. His next court hearing is scheduled for August.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMzM5MDYyOS9hbGV4LXNhYm9yaXQtd291bGRudC1sZXQtdGhheWVyLXVzZS10b2lsZXQv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vbmV3cy8zMzkwNjI5L2FsZXgtc2Fib3JpdC13b3VsZG50LWxldC10aGF5ZXItdXNlLXRvaWxldC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alex Saborit ‘dangerous & controlling’ & ‘wouldn’t let America Thayer use toilet alone’ before beheading s...,"CRUEL GRIP Alex Saborit ‘dangerous & controlling’ & ‘wouldn’t let America Thayer use toilet alone’ before beheading says pals

ALEX Saborit was “dangerous and controlling” and wouldn’t let America Thayer use the bathroom alone before her beheading her friends have claimed.

Thayer 55 was brutally dragged from her car and decapitated before her body was left on the pavement in Shakopee Minneapolis.

Saborit was charged with murder on Friday for allegedly beheading the woman while they were in a car in traffic at in intersection in Shakopee.

Friends and colleagues of Thayer told of how Saborit’s controlling behaviour had raised alarm - and they suspected she was a victim of domestic abuse.

Reba Skaar who worked with Thayer for three years at a Dollar Tree store in the area told the Star Tribune that Saborit had once not let her use the bathroom alone on a visit to her apartment and was “just dangerous”.

Skaar also claimed that Thayer would sometimes spend the night sleeping at her desk at her MyPillow job or in her car at the Amazon fulfillment center parking lot.

'I WAS SHOCKED'

Lori Stejskal another one of Thayer’s colleagues at Dollar Tree said of the alleged murder: “I was shocked but not surprised because of the way [Saborit] had been.”

Lori is one of three women who worked at Dollar Tree to claim they saw signs of domestic abuse.

They allege that Thayer had once come to work with a broken arm and bruises on her face and would set her phone onto Facebook’s FaceTime function between 4pm and 9.30pm so Saborit could watch her at work.

Thayer would also stay over with friends to avoid Saborit’s behaviour it is claimed. The couple were together for several years.

Saborit allegedly admitted beheading his girlfriend after she reportedly tried to break up with him police claimed yesterday.

Police were called on July 28 to reports of a stabbing and later discovered a women's decapitated body next to a car with her head nearby according to a search warrant obtained by KMSP Fox 9.

'GET RID'

According to a police statement Saborit told investigators the pair were together earlier in the day and were going to go to his court appearance for an earlier case.

On the way to court Thayer allegedly told Saborit that she wanted to ""get rid"" of him and end their relationship the statement adds.

He allegedly told cops he used a knife to kill Thayer because she had “gone too far” in her alleged abuse of him and in her comments about ending their relationship.

Authorities have not said what motivated the attack but Saborit has a criminal history that includes a domestic assault conviction for an attack against Thayer in 2017.

She was always in an upbeat mood Former co-worker Eileen Necklen

Friends described Thayer as a bubbly and outgoing person who was popular with customers in her retail jobs.

Former co-worker Eileen Necklen told the Star Tribune: “She was always in an upbeat mood.

“She was just a spitfire … an unbelievable person.

Tori Finney who worked at a gas station across the road from the MyPillow said: “I want [people] to know that even though she was going through all of this that she was just probably one of the sweetest humans ever like an angel on earth.”

That could change.

Dominion Energy South Carolina has released a 15-year integrated resource plan calling for the plant to burn all natural gas beginning in 2030.

“Dominion Energy is on a trajectory to achieve our goal of net-zero carbon dioxide and methane spokesman Matt Long said. “The modified 2020 (integrated resource plan) highlights details about how DESC has already reduced our dependence on coal generation increased our percentage of solar generation and created a cleaner generation fleet.”

“The plan also presents alternatives that could be pursued in the future to provide customers a path to clean renewable energy while allowing technologies to mature” Long said.

When it was originally placed in service in 1996 the Cope plant was designed for operation on coal and natural gas up to its full design capacity of 415 MW.

The Cope plant has the ability to operate up to its full original design capacity when using natural gas. The station frequently operates up to this load when natural gas supplies are available and economical Long said.

Converting the plant from its current dual-fuel capability to gas-only will not require any physical modifications Long said. No staffing changes have been announced based on that plan.

Currently the Cope plant employs 65 and pays about $9 million annually in taxes to Orangeburg County.

“Since the plan proposes that Cope Station continue operating DESC would not anticipate a major change in property tax as a result of the plan” Long said.

The plant formerly owned by South Carolina Electric and Gas has a number of environmental controls designed to reduce sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions.

“Natural gas operations emit significantly lower amounts of carbon dioxide per megawatt of energy generated compared to coal” Long said. “Natural gas combustion also emits less nitrous oxides sulfur dioxide mercury and particulate matter than coal combustion.”

As part of its plan Dominion will shut down operations at two of its other coal-fired plants by 2028. The plants are its Wateree Station south of Columbia and the Williams Station north of Charleston.

Currently the company's three coal plants provide 1709 megawatts of power. Natural gas would mostly replace the coal generation.

Dominion’s plan calls for adding more gas-fired generation capacity by 2028 including 523 MW of large-frame internal combustion turbines and 553 MW of combined cycle gas units.

Dominion Energy announced its 15-year plan earlier this year. In June South Carolina regulators approved the energy company's integrated resource plan which spells out its power development and purchasing plans for the next 15 years.

The utility’s preferred option would also ramp up solar adding 100 MW by 2028 and an additional 300 MW by 2032.

Dominion’s plan also calls for adding 100 MW of storage by 2032.

Dominion would further bolster its solar power lineup from 2030 to 2048 potentially adding as much as 2000 MW by mid-century. That's compared to the 973 MW of utility-scale solar power that Dominion currently has under contract.

The state’s Public Service Commission has accepted the utility’s integrated resource plan. It rejected an earlier version last December due to the company's failure to include a demand-side management option.

Environmental watchdog group The Sierra Club said the updated plan represented a significant turnaround.

The Cope Station has generated electricity by burning about 160 tons of coal per hour. At full load the plant can produce enough power in one hour to supply the average electric needs of 430 residential customers for one month.

The facility has consistently ranked in the top 20 plants for efficiency according to Electric Light & Power magazine.

The plant was designed and built with a dry scrubber to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. The scrubber eliminates more than 95 percent of sulfur dioxide. A co-benefit is that approximately 60-90 percent of mercury emissions are eliminated.

The Cope Station was also equipped with baghouses that remove 99 percent of fly ash from the combustion process. The boiler also had low-nitrous oxide burners installed in its initial construction.

Selective catalytic reduction equipment officially came online in 2008 to reduce nitrous oxide gases even further. The total cost was more than $69 million.

The Cope plant’s 525-foot stack can be seen from miles around. It emits condensation from the plant’s cooling system.

Plant construction began in 1992. The station was ready for operation before its May 1996 deadline officially coming online Jan. 15 1996.

The $411 million project came in about $34 million under budget.

At the peak of its construction the plant employed about 750 and paid a combined $65 million in wages.

The facility which sits on 3200 acres was designed so that only half an acre of the 1700 acres of wetlands would be disturbed.

Nearly 400 acres of wetlands along the South Fork of the Edisto River were included in a conservation easement to the Congaree Land Trust as a hardwood and cypress preserve.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ0b2luc2lkZXIuY29tLzI4MzE5LWV2ZXJzb3VyY2UtZW5lcmd5LXEyLWVhcm5pbmdzLWNhbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eversource Focuses on Connecticut amid Appeal of Penalties,"Looking to read the full article?

The AEW Dynamite Event on TNT featured a match between Chris Jericho and Nick Gage during which Gage used a pizza cutter on Jericho’s forehead.

Following the sequence the first commercial to air was a Domino’s ad which featured a pizza cutter slicing into a fresh pizza Front Office Sports reported.

However that didn’t stop fans from speculating that the ad placement was deliberate and part of an ""integrated marketing"" campaign according to Insider.

Gage and Jericho also used light tubes and panes of glass as makeshift weapons during their match.

WarnerMedia’s ad sales team was trying to fix the situation telling Domino’s it was an ""unfortunate accident"" according to FOS.

Gage tweeted out an apology Friday saying he ""didn’t meant to offend"" Domino’s.

""Guess I’m too ultraviolent for TV"" he wrote.

More specifically the pizza chain expressed concerns after an ad for their food appeared straight after the incident in what broadcaster TNT’s owners WarnerMedia have since described as an “unfortunate coincidence”.

In a statement issued to Front Office Sports Domino’s Pizza spokeswoman Jenny Fouracre-Petko said: “We share the concerns expressed about this incident and the content of this TV-14 rated program and are assessing our advertising presence on it going forward.”

The fight itself involved wrestlers Nick Gage and Chris Jericho with the former taking to Twitter on Friday to apologise to the brand.

“Sorry Dominos didn’t mean to offend you guess I’m too ultraviolent for TV oh well” he tweeted.

The TV blunder was caught by Twitter user @patcheschance who shared the video to the platform on Thursday.

“Still losing my mind over Nick Gage with the pizza cutter then DOMINOS WITH THE PIZZA CUTTER” they wrote.

While Domino’s didn’t see the funny side of the placement others described it as the “best promo ever”:

There is now speculation that WWE played a role in TNT/WarnerMedia sponsors being contacted about the Jericho vs. Gage match. It started with Dave Meltzer of F4WOnline.com writing the following in regards to the fallout…

“Domino’s is a major sponsor of TNT and WarnerMedia programming so this is a serious issue. There was a concerted campaign to contact sponsors but at press time Domino’s was the only one that has reacted to the match.”

The Twitter account for Voices of Wrestling commented on the matter…

I don't know about that but they have been calling journalists in hopes the story picks up steam. So far it hasn't. Nor has any advertiser (including Dominos) pulled any money off the table as far as we know. Sure feels like all of this will amount to nothing. https://t.co/PY5XaNgMc5 — Voices of Wrestling (@voiceswrestling) July 31 2021

David Bixenspan wrote an article about the Domino’s Pizza story and here in an excerpt…

“According to a screenshot shared with Babyface v. Heel a reporter from a mainstream publication in reaching out about the story explicitly said that WWE had contacted them about writing a article on the Domino’s/AEW situation. (As a condition of being able to get the screenshot in the first place I did agree to withhold identifying information about the reporter who sent the message who does not specialize in professional wrestling coverage.)”

There is also a trending Reddit post about the author that published the statement from Domino’s…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3Jlc3RsZXRhbGsuY29tL25ld3MvcmVwb3J0cy13d2Utc3ByZWFkLWRvbWlub3Mtc3RvcnktYWV3LXB1YmxpY2l0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reports Suggest WWE Spread Domino's Story To Get AEW Bad Publicity,"The Domino’s Pizza vs All Elite Wrestling saga has been the talk of the wrestling world since Wednesday’s Nick Gage vs Chris Jericho Deathmatch on Fight For The Fallen.

According to David Bixenspan a reporter from a mainstream publication claimed that WWE contacted all of AEW’s sponsors after the main event encouraging them to write an article on the situation.

A Tweet from Twitter user Voices of Wrestling also reported this claim stating:

I don’t know about that but they have been calling journalists in hopes the story picks up steam. So far it hasn’t. Nor has any advertiser (including Dominos) pulled any money off the table as far as we know. Sure feels like all of this will amount to nothing.

Dave Meltzer appeared to heavily imply the rumour in the Wrestling Observer this week saying:

“There was a concerted campaign to contact sponsors but at press time Domino’s was the only one that has reacted to the match”

Of course this is all hear-say and there is no official confirmation that WWE had any involvement in the saga.

They release quarterly reports details expenses and revenue. These reports allow a deeper look into the financials of the sport.

Back in 2019 Speedway Motorsports Inc left Wall Street and went private. Also in 2019 NASCAR purchased International Speedway corporation bringing their portfolio of track under the family-owned NASCAR banner.

Dover Motorsports Inc hosted events at Dover International Speedway and Nashville Superspeeday in 2021.

NASCAR Attendance Revenue

The company has reported $5786000 in attendance revenue from both tracks. During the Dover race the track was limited to just 20000 attendance of the 60000 capacity. The race at Nashville soldout.

Nashville Superspeedway

Attendance: 38000

Dover International Speedway

Attendance: 20000

In 2019 when the stands were at full capacity the company brought in $5786000 in attendance.

How much do NASCAR tracks spend?

Additionally the company estimated it’s 2021 expenses will be $11-11.5 million. A lot of part-time staff is required on race weekends while they work with a thinner crew for most of the year.

Most of those costs for 2021 went into the revival of Nashville Superspeedway a track that sat dormant for 10 years ahead of this years race.

NASCAR TV Money

Attendance is chump change in the world of NASCAR. We’re living in a digital world.

$26750000 in tv revenue was generated for the tracks from the two race weekends. That’s the track’s portion of the tv revenue alone actual television revenue is much higher.

NASCAR TV revenue is one of the largest incomes for the sport. The funds are split between the tracks teams and NASCAR.

The percentages of the split are mostly unpublished. But it’s been hinted that 10% of tv revenue goes to NASCAR itself 60% to the track and 30% to the teams via the race purse.

The future…

Earlier this week NBC hosted a conference call and discussed the tv market and future of their company. NBCSN is going away next year and that will likely change things going forward.

Next year at least two Indycar races will be shown from behind a paywall. Peacock premium will be required to view those races a paid version of the NBC app.

NASCAR’s tv contract expires at the end of the 2024 season. Speaking on 2025 NBC execs expect NASCAR to follow that same trend. For 2022 NASCAR races will still be shown on NBC and the USA Network.

If a paywall is introduced it’s unclear if that helps or hurts the funding of the sport. TV subscription revenue will likely play a role in the next contract but less viewers would likely hurt the advertisement revenue and the overall value of NASCAR sponsorships as well.

The utility circuit that Dow planned to rely on for 5000 amps of power was old and couldn’t handle the projected energy load.

National Grid the utility with a nearby power station told Dow that replacing the aged circuit with an updated one capable of generating enough power for his operation would cost Solar about $2 million up front.

Worse still the project would take two years.

Dow and his partners already had invested several million dollars in the project—a 70000-plus-square-foot manufacturing building that came with 70000 square feet of solar panels on the roof plus another 5 acres of solar panels on property behind the facility.

Combined the solar panels can generate more than 1 megawatt of power which is enough to power 300-400 homes for an hour according to conservative estimates.

Dow’s plan was to generate the maximum amount of clean power with the panels while the grid would provide whatever else Solar needed. It also would serve as a stable source of energy when the sun didn’t shine.

After consulting with energy and design specialists Dow decided that rather than paying National Grid $2 million for an upgrade that would take two years he would spend the money to create Solar’s own clean-power source.

He found two highly efficient combined heat and power (CHP) cogeneration units: one from Caterpillar and the other from MTU a Rolls-Royce subsidiary based in Germany. Dow estimated the cost at “around $3 million.” To pay for it Dow and his partners had to get a loan at an interest rate he called “north of 20%.”

“That’s really the backbone. They’re ultra-high efficiency (natural) gas generators” Dow said of the two cogeneration units commonly referred to as “cogens.” Each generator produces about 1.5 megawatts of power.

The decision to buy the cogens not only saved Solar from an expensive delay but turned out to be an environmentally friendly cost-saver that reduced the company’s spending as well as its carbon footprint. Cogens are far more efficient than getting power from the grid Dow said.

“Because you’re producing DC power on-site (with cogens) you’re already producing at a much higher efficiency rate than say a big power plant would down the road” Dow said. “At a power plant you’d lose maybe 30% plus in the transmission lines. We don’t lose any; there’s no transmission loss.”

Creating its own microgrid also cemented Solar’s business and brand strategy one based on sustainability.

“It’s our core ethos to build sustainably any way we can. It’s a major upfront expenditure but I think it will pay dividends with the way that general consumer behavior is trending” Dow said.

A Registered Power Plant

Many casinos hospitals pharmaceutical companies and factories have used cogens for years.

To get its own cogens up and running Solar had to meet federal Environmental Protection Agency and Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection standards such as for emissions and noise.

While Solar researched many companies purporting to have both cannabis industry experience and generator-installation experience the company ultimately opted for one without cannabis experience but steeped in industrial experience installing cogens in remote places such as oil rigs and mining operations.

“We’re now a registered power plant” Dow told MJBizMagazine.

In addition to the cogens—each producing about 1.5 megawatts—and the solar panels which produce 1-plus megawatt of energy Solar has a backup diesel generator capable of producing another 1.5 megawatts. Dow said the company tries to avoid using the diesel generator but having backup power is critical when you go off-grid.

Under Solar’s current microgrid scheme the cogens generate more than enough energy to power the 42500 square feet of the facility already built out and in use. Meanwhile the power generated by Solar’s solar panels goes back into National Grid’s network earning Solar hundreds of thousands of dollars in energy credits Dow said.

Solar is building out the remaining 30000-plus square feet of the facility which the cogens will also be able to power once the build-out is complete. Solar’s contract to sell solar energy back into the grid expires at the end of the year but Dow hopes to renew it.

He cautioned that having one’s own microgrid comes with headaches most notably being responsible for the grid when it goes down because of parts and mechanical issues. Complicating the challenge parts sometimes must be ordered from abroad while workers with the expertise to service the cogens must come from outside the state.

Issues such as worn or broken parts can arise a few times per year Dow said. “Be it the solar any of the generators whatever you’re going to have maintenance” he added.

Heat Feat

Beyond reducing energy spending and carbon emissions the cogens offer other cost and environmental savings opportunities.

Traditionally heat generated by microgrids and other factory and production equipment gets expelled into the atmosphere. But Solar captures and recycles that heat using it for processes such as powering its HVAC equipment including evaporative chillers. The evaporative chillers convert water into vapor used to cool hot grow rooms.

“We have a very significant heat load. We can take all our waste heat from those cogens and pump it right back into our main facility. And that can optimize your carbon footprint” Dow said. “Let’s say they operate at 60% efficiency prior which is still great. You can tweak it to north of 80% efficiency out of those cogens once you start taking the heat back.”

Solar has a central heating and cooling loop that flows through the facility and equipment in different parts of that facility are connected to the loop.

While New England weather might not always be conducive to solar panels it is conducive to another energy-saving investment free-fluid coolers which work when the outside temperature drops below a certain level. (Dow estimated 45 degrees Fahrenheit.)

Free-fluid coolers are placed outside the facility and draw cool air which is piped back into the facility to cool it down. Dow said the free-fluid coolers which Solar purchased from Cancoil in Ontario Canada eliminate the need for the company to run evaporative coolers.

Another way Solar reduces its energy consumption and heat emissions is using LED lights. The benefits of less heat load include reduced need for HVAC cooling as well as less plant transpiration which reduces how much you need to water the plants.

Solar also uses recycled water. Up to 90% of the company’s water is either recycled or comes from humidity (thanks to plant transpiration) that Solar recaptures with heat-recovery units that convert the humidity into condensate. That condensate then falls into sump pumps that transfer it back into Solar’s fertigation room.

A Model for the Future

While Solar’s environmental efforts are most extensive in cultivation they’re also present in manufacturing where the company uses CO 2 instead of solvents such as butane and ethanol for extraction.

On the retail side Solar uses LED lights and recycled ocean plastic from Los Angeles-based Ocean Works for packaging. The TV monitors that display menus and specials demand very little electrical current to operate. Solar is transitioning to tin packaging because tin is more likely to be recycled than plastic Dow said.

But the cogens continue to be the main focus. And as Solar’s relationship with National Grid has evolved the company has returned to the idea of replacing the old circuit with an upgraded one so that it can reconnect with the grid.

While the idea is very much in its earliest stages Dow said National Grid would pay for the upgrade in rebates. And although Solar would be connected to the grid it wouldn’t draw power from it but serve as an emergency backup. If Solar does strike such a deal with National Grid the upgrade would take about two years to complete Dow said.

“Then we’d have the best of both worlds: We’d have electric grid on-site and we’d have a grid power utility provider on-site” Dow said. “We’ve today already gotten over $1 million in rebates from them. And this one would be double or triple that.”

Having proved that Solar’s model works in Massachusetts Dow is looking to take it elsewhere. The best market candidates he said are regions and states with aging electrical infrastructure such as the Northeast and Midwest as well as Texas.

“Those are the type of markets where our model absolutely makes perfect sense” Dow said.

Farmington Police say they responded to a crash involving a pickup truck and a bicycle on Farmington Falls Road just before 4 pm.

Police say 55-year-old Christopher Krol of Chesterville was riding his bicycle west on the road when he was struck by a Chevy pickup truck driven by 50-year-old Richard Dow of Wilton.

Witnesses told police Krol made a sudden turn into the path of Dow’s vehicle and Dow was unable to avoid the crash.

They said Krol who was not wearing a helmet at the time of the crash was thrown from the bicycle.

Police say Krol was transported to Franklin Memorial Hospital for treatment and later to Maine Medical Center where he was pronounced dead this morning.

Police say no charges are expected at this time.

Supporters claim this group of doctors presents another side to the vaccine debate that is largely ignored by media and the government.

To investigate the trustworthiness of the group’s ideas I examined some of the points raised by AFLDS’ position paper on COVID-19 vaccines. I found a mix of truth and falsehood: The paper often twisted true statements to promote misleading ideas about vaccine safety.

First a little background on AFLDS: The group rocketed to notoriety last July after posting a viral video in which several doctors stood on the U.S. Supreme Court steps in white coats to offer arguments against lockdowns. One was Stella Immanuel known for her unusual views on the spiritual origins of gynecological maladies and her statements about “half human half E.T.” leaders in the U.S. government. Another was AFLDS founder Simone Gold who in other videos used the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center ER as a backdrop. Yet according to a statement by the Los Angeles hospital she has never worked for Cedars-Sinai apart from a three-week stint at an affiliated urgent care clinic in 2015.

After making the videos Gold largely faded from the spotlight until Jan. 6 when she and AFLDS communications director John Strand joined rioters illegally entering the Capitol. Twelve days later authorities arrested both in California and a federal court has since indicted them. (Authorities have so far arrested more than 500 people in connection with the Capitol riot.)

AFLDS’ goals appear to be more political than medical. Bloomberg reported that the original Supreme Court video event was hosted by the Tea Party Patriots. FactCheck.org states that “[AFLDS] appears to be connected to the Tea Party Patriots Foundation” offering as evidence an archived copy of a web page copyrighted by TPPF and featuring the AFLDS logo alongside that of the Tea Party Patriot’s “Second Opinion Project.”

(In an email after this story was published TPPF spokesperson TJ Winer said the foundation supported healthcare freedom and the doctor-patient relationship but was “no longer associated with America’s Frontline Doctors.”)

On its website AFLDS identifies itself as “a project of the Free Speech Foundation” a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. This nonprofit apparently has no website of its own. (AFLDS did not respond to my query about its organizational affiliations and its vaccine-safety claims.)

Now on to what the group believes as outlined by its position paper. While space prevents coverage of all of its claims we can examine the most salient.

Does hydroxychloroquine cure or prevent COVID-19?

The AFLDS write-up hinges on its assertion that hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19: If a cure exists the risk-benefit calculus for any given vaccine changes greatly. Here AFLDS mixes correct assertions—hydroxychloroquine is indeed a common drug and patients rarely die from its use at appropriate doses—with its incorrect claims that the drug is effective against COVID-19.

Hydroxychloroquine received a lot of attention early in the pandemic because of its ubiquity and safety profile. The drug’s proponents which had included President Donald Trump argued that scientists downplayed hydroxychloroquine due to anti-Trump sentiment. But once scientists began to investigate the drug quality research showed no benefit for patients who received it.

Interestingly another “front-line” group the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance rejects hydroxychloroquine and beats the drum instead for ivermectin an anti-parasitic drug. (The group claims neutrality on the COVID-19 vaccine.) Ivermectin as a treatment against COVID-19 is being studied in the ongoing British PRINCIPLE trial and WORLD reported on research into the drug back in February. But strong data supporting its use remain elusive.

Is COVID-19 actually dangerous?

AFLDS asserts that “COVID-19 kills very rarely and is mostly limited to the medically fragile” pointing out that most younger and healthy COVID-19 patients make a full recovery. That the elderly and infirm fare poorly against the coronavirus is well known. Whether 600000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States constitute killing “very rarely” is debatable.

This often leads to a discussion of what’s counted as a COVID-19 death. One particularly cynical anti-vaccine cartoon (not to my knowledge from AFLDS) features a weeping family asking whether a patient’s lung cancer might have contributed to his death as a doctor with his nose high in the air replies that it was COVID-19. Leaving aside the cartoon’s emotional manipulation the doctor would have been reporting correctly the cause of death.

This is because “cause of death” as popularly understood focuses on the “last straw” that prevented a patient from surviving any longer. Death certificates often include “underlying” and “contributing” causes. As the College of American Pathologists notes in an excellent write-up an underlying cause is “the disease (condition) that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death.” A contributing cause is one that was less directly related.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that in its count of COVID-19 deaths “COVID-19 is listed as the underlying cause on the death certificate in 92% of deaths.” The “cause of death” might then be viral pneumonia with COVID-19 infection being the underlying cause: If the patient had not contracted COVID-19 he would not have developed pneumonia and the virus is therefore what caused the death.

Are the vaccines “experimental”?

Here AFLDS moves from assertion-by-innuendo to plainly incorrect statements saying that the vaccines “are now being approved for experimental use” and demanding the public refer to them as “experimental vaccines.”

The vaccines are not “approved for experimental use” but rather carry an Emergency Use Authorization. In other words the U.S. Food and Drug Administration balanced the benefit of longer-term data against the risks of delaying vaccine distribution. Each vaccine had to pass through so-called phase 3 studies involving very large numbers of patients—30000 for Moderna and 43000 for Pfizer/BioNTech.

AFLDS’ proposal—that COVID-19 be treated with hydroxychloroquine—has far less evidence for its efficacy than the vaccines do. However AFLDS does not call its own proposal “experimental.”

The group also asserts that since the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer are based on new mRNA technology (involving neither live nor weakened viruses) they are not actually vaccines according to what AFLDS calls “the settled meaning of the term.” Yet that “settled meaning” has long allowed for new technologies: Dictionary.com back in 2016 defined vaccine as “any preparation used as a preventive inoculation to confer immunity against a specific disease.” The vaccines aren’t experimental but they are indeed vaccines.

Do the vaccines work?

Yes including against the Delta variant. A June study released by Public Health England found that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine were 96 percent effective in preventing hospitalization from the variant. The AFLDS paper tries not to address effectiveness directly but does so unintentionally in this complaint: “Notably the vaccine trials had too few positive [COVID-19] cases to assess with statistical significance any benefit in secondary outcomes such as decreased mortality or hospitalization.”

Actually the vaccine trials had plenty of positive COVID-19 cases—almost all of which were among the placebo groups. AFLDS effectively admits here that there’s no pleasing it: In its view either a vaccine doesn’t prevent cases from developing in which case it’s ineffective or it does prevent cases from developing in which case it can’t be studied sufficiently.

It is also worth noting here that 95 percent efficacy—or even 99 percent efficacy—is not the same as perfect 100 percent efficacy. More than 160 million Americans are fully vaccinated but if even 5 percent of them experienced a “breakthrough” case of COVID-19 that would still equal 8 million people. Thus reports of “thousands of people infected after vaccination” indicate only that the original efficacy statistics were largely accurate.

Is this just a way for companies to make money?

AFLDS argues that “the very exciting profit anticipated by the pharmaceutical companies” motivated them and others have pointed to Wall Street presentations by companies like Pfizer and Moderna as further evidence that the companies hope for returns on their investments.

But what does that prove? Under capitalism entrepreneurs accept economic risks in hopes of making a profit: Many promising vaccine candidates failed and the money invested in their development went to waste. Merck for example wrote off $305 million after neither of its two COVID-19 vaccines proved effective in a phase 1 trial. Even some successful candidates like Novavax may have proved their worth too late to pay off. In short capitalism fostered an environment where companies tried various approaches and rewarded those that found successful ones in time to help.

Do the vaccines cause “pathogenic priming” or “antibody-dependent enhancement”?

It’s possible to create a vaccine that makes infections worse instead of better. But these vaccines don’t do that. Again AFLDS accidentally refutes itself by comparing the COVID-19 vaccines to a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine from long ago:

This same thing happened in the 1960’s with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)—they gave the vaccine to 35 children and initially it looked like it worked well. But when those children were exposed to the wild virus they got much sicker and then two of the kids died which became a scandal.

The RSV problem came to light in a study with just 35 people. In America alone over 330 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have reached patients. We’d know by now whether COVID-19 vaccines lead to a similar problem. They do not.

Do the vaccines cause infertility or miscarriage?

AFLDS cites a case report of a pregnant woman who contracted COVID-19 and suffered a miscarriage at five months gestation. Without informing readers that severe illness of any type can cause miscarriage AFLDS concludes that “getting COVID-19 has been associated with a high risk of mid-pregnancy miscarriage because the placenta fails—but the vaccine may do the exact same thing—but not for just the few weeks of being sick—but forever.”

We know that patients who recover from COVID-19 often have antibodies to spike protein the same protein targeted by the vaccines. Those antibodies stick around so logic dictates that if antibodies to spike protein cause infertility then humankind has a major problem indeed—regardless of whether those antibodies come from COVID-19 infection or from a vaccine. Thankfully as a write-up from Henry Ford Health System explains antibodies to spike protein do not cause infertility.

Online misinformation about the connection between COVID-19 vaccines and miscarriages has included misquoting of a New England Journal of Medicine article about the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines. This study enrolled nearly 4000 pregnant women who received a vaccine including those vaccinated just before conceiving (that is any time after 30 days before their last menstrual period). It reported that among 827 participants whose pregnancies concluded during the brief study 712 had a live birth 104 had a miscarriage one had a stillbirth and 10 had an ectopic pregnancy or abortion.

Inevitably someone simply divided one number by another and announced the vaccine itself carried a 1-in-8 risk of miscarriage. This ignores a crucial fact: Roughly 20 percent of all early pregnancies do tragically but ordinarily end in miscarriage. During the short study period 2.6 percent of NEJM study participants miscarried and roughly 80 percent neither miscarried nor delivered but maintained their pregnancies. That reflects that the vaccines studied did not raise the risk of miscarriage. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists offers a similar analysis on its website.

AFLDS is right about one thing here: Pregnant women are far more likely to suffer harm from COVID-19 than their nonpregnant peers. But far from being a reason to avoid the vaccine it’s a reason to get it.

Have the vaccines caused 45000 deaths?

AFLDS asserts in a lawsuit against the Biden administration that the vaccines have caused 45000 deaths stating that the U.S. government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) “reported 9048 deaths associated with the Vaccines.” AFLDS claims a computer programmer compared this figure with Medicare and Medicaid data about deaths within three days of vaccination and concluded the death figure should be multiplied by five.

It’s not possible to corroborate the claimed analysis of Medicare and Medicaid data since the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services hasn’t publicly released its 2021 data yet and almost all COVID-19 vaccinations took place in 2021. So we’ll focus on the first claim about 45000 supposed deaths.

As of July 19 VAERS reported 6207 deaths. This would still be an unprecedented number but there’s a catch. The vaccines’ Emergency Use Authorization requires that all deaths after vaccination be reported to VAERS “regardless of causality.” In plain English that means that VAERS wants to know about any deaths that happened after vaccination whether or not the vaccine was believed to be related to them for future research.

This makes sense because VAERS did catch a rare complication from a now-recalled rotavirus vaccine in 1999. (Today’s rotavirus vaccine is not associated with that problem.) But it also means that we can’t simply count the deaths reported to VAERS as “deaths caused by the vaccine.” They could be deaths from anything.

The takeaway …

People I know personally including some who are high-risk themselves or who share a household with a high-risk individual have skipped getting COVID-19 vaccines after hearing unfounded claims like those above. This disinformation according to the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund of the United States is also amplified online by China and Russia. Their goal: to gain market share for their own products both vaccines and philosophies. Their autocratic governments by fostering tension and disagreement in the West hope to portray democracy as chaotic and unreliable.

We as Christians are called to be truth-tellers. This does not mean being undiplomatic or using the truth as a bludgeon. Still the fact remains that unlike at the beginning of the pandemic we now have significant evidence and knowledge about the nature of the virus that has ravaged the world and about the vaccines that are helping the country reopen.

Estimated reading time: 4 minutes

Developing on its impressive continually growing medical services Mediclinic Newcastle now welcomes Dr Bonginkosi Shadrack Shoba a Medical Oncologist who will begin seeing patients at the private hospital on a sessional basis.

Reflecting on his career Dr Shoba explains that his rooted passion for the medical sector began during his school days. “I always enjoyed life sciences biochemistry and so forth. I have also always been interested in life how it works and wanting to know how to fix it if something goes wrong.” Adding to this he highlights that growing up in the Ladysmith area he noticed there were minimal doctors available and recognised the gap that needed to be urgently filled. “Having grown up in a rural area I wanted to eventually work in similar areas and assist the people living in rural areas getting to understand their circumstances and helping them.”

When looking at the doctor’s qualifications and accolades it is clear that his determination to learn how life works and assist people ignited an unfaltering spark within him.

He acquired his MMBCh at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1995 followed by securing his FCP (SA) at the Colleges of Medicine of South Africa in 2006. Thereafter obtaining his Fellowship in Medical Oncology at the University of Nairobi Kenya in 2018 before receiving his Certificate for Medical Oncology at the Colleges of Medicine of South Africa in 2021.

Alongside his medical qualifications Dr Shoba has enjoyed remarkable achievements throughout his career. These include:

Being a Levitt Lecturer University of Colorado Health Sciences Centre USA Department of Family Medicine November 1995.

First black member of Medical Students Council University of the Witwatersrand 1994

WK Kelloggs Scholarship 1989-1995 University of the Witwatersrand

Founded and chaired The Harambee Medical Consulting at The University of Cape Town 2009

Founded and ran the first Oncology clinic at Ngwelezana hospital in 2011 leading to his first publication in the South African Medical Journal

Recipient of the Discovery Academic grant for Research 2018

Furthermore he is currently a fellow in the Department of Medical Oncology at the University of Pretoria while also holding the same position at the Department of Medicine at the University of Nairobi from 2016 to 2018 as well as holding the title of Principal Specialist and Head of Department of Internal Medicine at Ngwelezana Hospital in Empangeni.

Dr Shoba was also the Registrar in Internal Medicine in Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town from September 2004 until January 2007 the Medical Manager for Nkonjeni Hospital to mention but a few.

With comprehensive knowledge and experience in the medical sector Dr Shoba’s vision is to utilise his talents and training for research teaching and the care of cancer patients.

Moreover the good doctor states he thrives on the demand on professionals in this field to constantly further their education. He clarifies “Oncology goes to the heart of the shell straight through to biochemistry and to a DNA level. No two cancers are the same. You can treat three different women for breast cancer and none of these women’s cancer will be the same.”

It is because of this Dr Shoba stresses that oncology is constantly changing evolving as cancer itself changes. “For example treatment for heart attacks will more or less be the same as well when looking at rheumatoid arthritis. But oncology is always changing it keeps you on your toes.”

With the doctor now extending his services to the area Dr Shoba is looking forward to working within the community a stone’s throw away from his hometown. “There is a major need for oncology services in Newcastle and surroundings.” Additionally he affirms that he is also incredibly excited to work with Mediclinic Newcastle. “Mediclinic is one of the biggest brands in the medical sector and the Mediclinic Newcastle team are enthusiastic to work with their doctors and patients. It feels as if they are willing to help move the earth if necessary.”

With this in mind Dr Shoba will be holding his first clinic in Newcastle on Saturday 13 August 2021 and Sunday 14 August 2021. At this stage appointments can be made directly with the doctor on 083 582 4727.

Concluding the doctor says “I want to see patients during the weekend and be busy. I want to see people who are suffering get better. We will be covering oncology from all aspects over the two days.”

Join us in welcoming Dr Shoba to Mediclinic Newcastle in true Newcastillian spirit by sharing your messages in the comment section below.

It was third time lucky as veteran singer-songwriters James Taylor and Jackson Browne were finally able to take to the road for their rescheduled joint tour which kicked off at Chicago’s United Center. It was a busy night for live music in the city with Lollapalooza and Journey also performing but the draw of seeing these two iconic performers on one billing managed to pack the United Center to the rafters.

Jackson Browne took to the stage for an hour-long set which captivated the crowd from the very first note. Taking to the stage with an impressive nine-piece band it was Browne’s voice that was very much front and center proving to be as strong and expressive as ever. Browne thanked everyone for holding onto their tickets despite the dates being rescheduled due to the lockdown but it seemed everyone was just happy that it was able to go ahead.

Toward the end of his set Jackson stated “I don’t open the show for just anybody” and with that James Taylor walked out onto the stage. The pair went on to perform Browne’s “The Pretender” together much to the joy of the fans even if Taylor did mix up the lyrics. The set was rounded out with “Running on Empty” which really jeered up the crowd even more (not that they needed it).

After an opening set like that the crowd could have gone home happy having seen a fantastic show. But there was more still to come. As the audience patiently waited for James Taylor a screen was draped over the front of the stage with a video projected onto it showing a variety of fans discussing how his music has helped them over the years and particularly last year. There were also clips of them performing snippets of his songs.

As Taylor returned to the stage to begin his own set he was greeted with the audience taking to their feet cheering and clapping to show their appreciation for the legendary performer. He humbly stated “We really didn’t know if anyone would show up.” There was little question of these fans turning up as they were chomping at the bit for it to begin. Taylor was clearly appreciative of both the crowd coming out and being given the opportunity to be back on the stage again.

Taylor was joined on stage by an impressive eight-piece band and five vocalists (including his son Henry Taylor). It was an incredible experience getting to see such a large-scale production after the long hiatus. The large screen at the back of the stage was put to full use and was almost like an extra member of the band in its own right as it really added to the ambiance of the evening.

It’s so contagious when you go to see a show and the artist looks like they’re having just as much fun as you are. This was definitely one of those nights as Taylor looked to be in great spirits being back on the stage. He joked with the audience about how he knows they’ve begged for “Steamroller” to be removed from the setlist. He also joked how he learned everything in life from cartoons before performing “As Easy As Rolling Off A Log” taken from the animated classic from 1938 Katnip Kollege. Throughout the song the screen at the back of the stage alternated between video clips from the cartoon and live footage of the band.

Some of the biggest cheers of the evening came when James took a seat to perform the popular “Sweet Baby James” and “Fire and Rain” two songs that also garnered the loudest singalongs. And just when you thought there couldn’t be anything else squeezed into the jam-packed night Jackson Browne returned to the stage to perform The Eagles’ “Take It Easy” which he actually wrote with Glenn Fry.

As much as it was hard to wait so long for this show to happen it was well worth the wait. It was every bit as great as the fans had hoped it would be and then some. What a way to kick off a tour!

Ultimately the events would shatter the Steiners’ peaceful suburban life result in criminal charges against six eBay employees and a contractor five of whom have pleaded guilty and contribute to the departure of eBay’s chief executive.

Steiner who with his wife Ina publishes a news website about the e-commerce industry from their home thought his neighbor must be joking — who would be graffitiing his new white vinyl fence on their quiet tree-lined street?

Natick resident David Steiner was puttering in his garage on a sunny Sunday morning when a neighbor walking a dog called out to him: “Hey your fence has been tagged.”

The abuse would culminate in the couple fearing for their lives as they were stalked in their own neighborhood by unknown perpetrators in a slow-moving black van.

But that Sunday Steiner was simply surprised and dismayed to see the word “Fidomaster” spray-painted across his fence. He tried to clean up the mess before Ina who was out paddle boarding returned home but he failed. Ina recognized that the name matched an anonymous commenter on their newsletter one who was particularly critical of eBay.

“This was very unnerving” Ina recalled in an interview with the Globe this week. “It didn’t make any sense.”

Had the person who was Fidomaster painted their name on the fence? Or was someone accusing the Steiners of being Fidomaster? Or did the term have some other meaning? “I Googled right away to see if it was something kids might be saying” Ina said.

In their first interview with the news media the couple spoke to the Globe for several hours in the offices of attorney Rosemary Scapicchio who is representing them in a civil lawsuit against eBay. They provided additional harrowing details of their experience beyond those disclosed in court documents which include copies of e-mails and text messages of eBay employees that federal prosecutors say show how they conspired to terrorize the Steiners.

The couple met in the mid-1980s in Western Massachusetts at what was then called North Adams State College and is now called the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts. The two young students met at a party for a bandmate of David’s who was going away and immediately felt a connection and began dating. They married in 1988.

Around 1999 when eBay was still a young company and the World Wide Web was not the finely tuned commercial marketplace it is today David decided to sell some of his video gear on the auction site. The couple also began haunting garage sales and yard sales to find collectible items they could sell online to make money. “We’d get up early go through the classified ads get your Dunkin’ Donuts coffee and hit as many sales as we could” Ina said.

They quickly realized that a growing throng of like-minded sellers was struggling to figure out how best to auction their items. The Steiners initially created a paper newsletter with tips and tricks to help other sellers but realized after one issue that an online publication made more sense even in 1999. Thus was born AuctionBytes later changed to EcommerceBytes and running the advertising-based publication is the couple’s full-time occupation.

For years the publication thrived. Particularly while eBay was run by Meg Whitman small sellers flourished and EcommerceBytes offered a wide variety of useful advice. One time David explained to readers how he’d shipped a large item by Greyhound bus instead of a typical package delivery service saving hundreds of dollars.

After Whitman left in 2007 and was replaced by former Bain & Co. consultant John Donahoe eBay began to cater to larger sellers and established retailers a trend that continued when Devin Wenig was promoted to CEO in 2015. The couple had pivoted their newsletter from how-to tips to reporting more on the changing strategy and new policies of the company. Their take on the new eBay was often though hardly exclusively critical.

And criticism didn’t go down well at the firm. Prosecutors said the harassment campaign starting with the fence spray-painting incident was directed by James Baugh who headed eBay’s Global Security and Resiliency unit. Along with other participants in the scheme Baugh was charged last year with conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and conspiracy to commit witness tampering. He is awaiting trial.

Prosecutors said the 2019 campaign was sparked by complaints about articles in EcommerceBytes from eBay chief executive Wenig to his senior vice president and communications director Steve Wymer. Wymer in turn complained to Baugh who directed the team of eBay employees who worked for him to move against the Steiners according to the federal criminal complaints.

The articles that drew the eBay executives’ ire included reports about the CEO’s salary and his comments on protecting e-sellers against fraud. Prosecutors revealed angry text messages about an April 10 2019 article titled “eBay CEO Devin Wenig Earns 152 Times That of Employees” as well as “eBay CEO Says Sellers Can Expect Greater Protections” from May 31 2019. Such articles generated reader comments that were highly critical of the company’s leadership and its treatment of smaller sellers who felt left behind in favor of larger retailers.

From the Steiners’ point of view not much happened for a few weeks after the graffiti. But on Aug. 8 2019 they found their inboxes filling up with dozens of e-mail newsletters they hadn’t signed up for ranging from Heather’s Irritable Bowel Syndrome News and The Satanic Temple to more disturbing fare featuring pornography and bondage. At the same time a new Twitter account started bombarding Ina Steiner with expletive-laden taunts she said.

She had occasionally had to deal with inappropriate comments on the website she said. “If you’ve been on the Internet for a while you learn that you don’t feed the trolls don’t respond don’t encourage them.”

Two days later the phone rang. It was a taxidermy and animal parts shop in Arizona calling to ask about a purported order for the Steiners of a fetal pig. The Steiners’ delivery address didn’t match the billing address on the credit card used on the order so the shop called to double check the order. Shaken the Steiners canceled the order.

“I thought here we go from online to the real world” Ina said. “It was really scary.”

The couple decided to call the Natick police and an officer arrived at their house to take a report they said. As the officer was leaving the house he noticed a package by the front door. While David and the officer continued talking Ina opened the package in the kitchen. Seeing bits of hair and skin she screamed. Inside was a mask of a bloody pig face like the one worn by a crazed killer in the “Saw” horror movie series. The officer added the details to his report.

The Twitter abuse continued to escalate and even more bizarre deliveries arrived the couple said. One day it was a book for David called “Grief Diaries: Surviving Loss of a Spouse.” Ina said she Googled the return address of another package and when she discovered the sender was called Carolina Biological Supply Co. she feared they might need to call a hazmat team. A call to the company revealed the package was filled with live spiders and fly larvae; they turned it over to the police.

A few days later a florist arrived with a sympathy wreath for David. The driver told the Steiners he had come from Central Square in Cambridge and was instructed to leave the $255 wreath by their back door without ringing the bell. Ina snapped a picture more evidence for the police and debriefed the delivery man.

“All of these small retailers they were being weaponized to be used against us” David said.

On Aug. 15 the campaign took a darker turn. Unbeknownst to the Steiners a group of Baugh’s employees had flown to Boston rented two vehicles and checked into the Ritz-Carlton Hotel according to federal documents. They initially planned to plant a tracking device on the Steiners’ car. Luckily the Toyota Rav4 was locked in the garage and the eBay team retreated to the hotel the documents allege.

But the next day the team returned. David Steiner was up on a ladder installing one of several new security cameras he’d purchased while Ina handed him tools out of a second-floor window. Suddenly Ina saw a dark-colored Dodge Caravan driving up their street. “Black van New York plates” she told David as the vehicle drove past.

“We felt in danger we felt like targets” Ina said.

The van took another pass by the house as captured by one of the couple’s security cameras. Then later in the day David noticed the same van pull out to follow him while he was in his car with a friend.

“I can still feel how every hair on the back of my neck stood up” David said as the van followed him for several blocks.

The Steiners called the police again and this time three cruisers rushed to their house. But they hadn’t been able to take down the entire license plate number of the van and the police weren’t able to track down the vehicle. As the police milled about “I just sat on my steps sweating feeling my heart pounding” David said.

“Everything just faded away it was surreal” added Ina. “I was terrified.”

Thinking they might be physically attacked the couple decided to sleep in different rooms. Ina put a laundry cart by her back door with a few baking sheets balanced on top. “We didn’t have a full alarm system” she said. “This could at least warn us if someone broke in.”

That night David was awake at about 4:30 a.m. too stressed to sleep. He heard a car slowly driving up the street. A black sedan pulled up in front of their house. David yelled for Ina to call 911 as a man got out of the car and took what looked like a large leather case out of the back seat. David began screaming at the man that he’d called the police.

“We thought he had a gun” Ina recalled.

Instead the eBay team had called for a prank pizza delivery at the Steiners’ house according to federal prosecutors. The delivery man put the pizza boxes on the ground and left the couple said. The police arrived but the Steiners couldn’t get back to sleep.

The couple said they felt besieged and trapped in their own home. “You couldn’t shut the feeling of terror off there’s just no off switch” David said.

On Aug. 18 David became determined to break out and go to the grocery store. Again a vehicle a silver SUV started following him. He called Ina. “I’m going to take them downtown” he told her planning to drive to the Natick Police Department.

The SUV followed at a distance. He pulled over and parked across the street from the police station. As the SUV slowly drove past he propped Ina’s iPhone up on the steering wheel and photographed the stalkers. “I’m determined to take a picture this time I just kept hitting the button” he said.

With a full license plate number in hand from David’s pictures the Natick police quickly started to unravel the conspiracy. The vehicle tracked back to an eBay contractor who was staying at the Ritz.

eBay’s team knew it was in trouble according to their own messages obtained later by federal prosecutors. But on Aug. 21 even as a Natick police detective traveled to the Ritz to find the van renter the stream of threatening tweets against the Steiners continued.

The Steiners cooperated with the investigation which soon included FBI agents and federal prosecutors. For months the couple weren’t sure what had really happened or who was behind the abuse which stopped after a final burst of tweets on Sept. 6 2019.

“It was a really long winter with the weight of all of this hanging over us” David said. The couple have remained vigilant to outside threats. Ina no longer goes for long walks by herself and David still has trouble sleeping. The couple maintain a network of security cameras including one in their car.

In June 2020 federal prosecutors announced criminal charges against six former eBay employees and a contractor. The company apologized to the Steiners and in a lengthy statement said it had conducted its own investigation that had resulted in terminating all of the employees charged by the government plus communications chief Wymer who has not been charged.

The investigation also found that former CEO Wenig had made “inappropriate communications” but did not have advance knowledge of the harassment and stalking. Wenig who was not charged was allowed to resign in September 2019 with a compensation package worth $57 million; the Steiner scandal was a “consideration” in his departure the company has said.

Wenig’s lawyers Martin G. Weinberg and Abbe D. Lowell said in a statement to the Globe: “An independent investigation confirmed that Devin Wenig had nothing to do with and no knowledge of any of the activities alleged in Mr & Mrs Steiner’s Complaint. Although he is an inviting target as the former CEO he did not know of approve or authorize the conduct and regrets what the Steiners experienced.”

Reading the criminal complaint in June 2020 the Steiners got a view for the first time of what had been going on inside eBay during their torment. “The vitriol towards us where did it come from?” David asked.

“We didn’t even know these people” Ina added. “We were helping their customers sell more. That should be a good thing.”

After the Steiners filed their civil lawsuit on July 21 eBay issued a new statement again apologizing to the couple and saying the company would “do what is fair and appropriate to try to address what the Steiners went through.”

On July 28 one of the defendants in the criminal case Philip Cooke the former senior manager of Security Operations for eBay’s Global Security Team was sentenced to 18 months in prison. It was the first sentencing of anyone involved in the case.

“Sometimes in the past two years I haven’t been able to recognize myself” David told the Globe on the day after Cooke was sentenced. “But I woke up feeling great today.”

The civil lawsuit is an attempt to get the fuller story and gain some compensation for the mental toll exacted by the company’s employees the couple said. They also want to put other corporations on notice.

“The reason we’re suing is we don’t want it to happen to anybody else” Ina said. “It has to be known what was done to us.”

With summer now in full swing you might be planning an exciting trip somewhere. We all know that choosing what to pack is important. For watch collectors having the right watches for the trip is a critical part of packing. If you’re headed somewhere special this summer you’ll want to bring watches that will complement both your destination and your wardrobe. Using eBay is one of the easiest ways to find a just-right timepiece for your trip. With its escrow service eBay takes the guesswork and risk out of buying a watch online. Buyers of wristwatches sold by U.S. sellers for $10000 or more (after seller discounts but before shipping and taxes) will have the option to pay via Escrow.com including items that qualify for local pickup. eBay even covers all of the Escrow.com fees.

This means that for up to seven days after you receive the watch the funds will be safely held by Escrow.com. This gives you time to inspect it and ensure that it arrives in the condition described. If you decide to return the watch you’re guaranteed to receive your money back via this secure and fully traceable payment method (as long as the purchase is eligible for return).

We’ve picked out a few of our favorite escrow-eligible vacation “flex” watches choosing watches that will go with a range of possible summer vacation activities.

Patek Philippe Calatrava Pilot Travel Time

If your vacation will take you to a different time zone you’ll need just the right travel watch. Our recommendation is the Patek Philippe Calatrava Pilot Travel Time. It uses the same 324 S C FUS movement from other Patek travel watches giving it the ability to jump the hour hand (and date) forward or backward across time zones by simply pushing its buttons. It’s one of our favorite travel watch movements for this reason. It is also one of the easiest-to-read methods of displaying two time zones which means that you’ll be able to make that connection on time. Once you adjust to local time a skeletonized hand will emerge keeping track of the time at home. If you do need to check in with work this hand paired with day/night indicators for both time displays will help you to keep tabs on what is going on in the office.

This watch ruffled a lot of feathers when it debuted because its bold style and 42mm size were big departures from the typical offerings from Patek. The large dial together with its luminous hands and markers makes it easy to read no matter how jet-lagged that you are. Plus it is an instantly recognizable watch from a brand that many believe is the pinnacle of watchmaking. Click this link to see eBay’s selection of Patek Philippe Calatrava Pilot Travel Time watches that can be purchased through the escrow program.

Rolex Yacht-Master 42

As soon as you check in to your hotel you’ll likely be changing clothes (and watches) and heading to the pool. For poolside lounging we recommend the Rolex Yacht-Master 42. The obvious choice might be the Submariner but the “YM” is our pick. It packs all of the specifications and durability that you expect from Rolex including the updated caliber 3255. This gives it the same 70 hours of power reserve and magnetic and shock resistance of the Sub but in a larger and higher-end watch. Its matte-black 3D ceramic Cerachrom bezel insert looks more expensive but the Oysterflex bracelet will still pair well with any casual swimming attire.

The Yacht-Master’s 100 meters of water resistance should be plenty for the deepest of deep ends and having a chunk of white gold on your wrist should put you in the right mood to relax.

Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Chronograph 41mm

Once you’ve finished at the pool you’ll probably head back to your room to get ready for dinner. You’ll want to wear something that is more restrained but also something that feels really special on your wrist. We chose the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Chronograph 41mm version for this situation as it has a bit more presence than the standard model. And there aren’t too many shapes more recognizable than the Royal Oak with its octagonal port-hole bezel complete with exposed bolts. ABTW’s own Ariel Adams once described the RO as “men’s jewelry” and he meant that in a good way. The beautiful Tapisserie dial and distinctive brushed and polished bracelet would be a joy to wear even if it didn’t tell time. The number of hours required to finish each piece also makes it worthy of the “jewelry” moniker.

Despite using a chronograph module AP’s in-house caliber 2385 is still quite thin. The watch measures a slim 11mm-thick which is excellent for a chronograph and only 3mm thicker than the three-hand version. These watches are very much in demand at the moment but luckily eBay currently has a number of them available. Browse eBay’s selection of Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Chronograph 41mm watches here and choose the escrow option at check out.

Hublot Big Bang Unico Titanium Ceramic

After dinner you’ll want to change again into something more trendy to check out the local nightlife. You need a watch with some attitude and Hublot is a brand known for making just that. For after-hours activities we recommend the 42mm Big Bang Unico Titanium Ceramic.

The brand’s in-house HUB1280 movement features a column-wheel chronograph with a flyback function and 72 hours of power reserve. Hublot even developed a revolutionary new double-clutch mechanism that is more reliable and consumes less energy. The Unico’s lack of a full dial complete with a skeletonized date wheel and winding rotor means that you can get a good look at all sides of the movement and judge for yourself. A generous amount of lume also makes it easy to read after the sun goes down. The low weight of the titanium and ceramic case guarantees that it will be comfortable during a long night of dancing (or whatever else you might get into). A variety of Hublot Big Bang Unico watches are available through eBay’s escrow program at this link.

IWC Pilot’s Watch Perpetual Calendar Top Gun

Even if you had a late night you’ll want to get up early the next day and find adventure. Perhaps you’ll just go on a hike or do something more exciting like rock climbing or skydiving. Whatever you choose you should definitely bring along a watch that can handle anything. IWC’s Top Gun watches are made from ceramic which is nearly impossible to scratch. It’s often difficult to read the time let alone the date on a perpetual calendar watch but IWC created a very logical and high-contrast dial layout for the Top Gun. This means that despite being packed with information the Pilot’s Watch Perpetual Calendar Top Gun also has fantastic legibility. This makes it a great choice for outdoor adventure.

IWC’s Perpetual Calendar watches feature its in-house calibre 52615 which is made from 386 parts. This powerhouse of a movement displays the day date month numerical year and moon phase. Despite a relatively high beat rate of 28800 vph it will run for seven days when fully wound (the status of which is also displayed on the dial). If you still somehow let its power reserve wind down a stylus is not needed as everything can be adjusted with the crown unlike most perpetual calendar watches which can be very tricky to adjust. Luckily eBay has a number of them available through its escrow program.

Richard Mille RM 028 Diver

Sometimes people also use a vacation as the impetus to try out scuba diving. If you plan to do that you don’t want to wear just any watch. You’ll want to make sure that you have a serious diver strapped to your wrist (you know in case you get really good at diving really quickly). With a locking bezel variable inertia rotor and 300 meters of water resistance the ISO-certified Richard Mille RM 028 is a great choice for a vacation dive watch. The model number and hour markers are printed right on its sapphire dial giving a great view of the movement. The brand takes its construction even more seriously however. Countless proprietary (and tiny) titanium screws hold the watch together and the contours and finishing of the case are next-level stuff.

Richard Mille creates a lot of buzz by sponsoring professional athletes — not only does this make them extremely recognizable but it also proves that the brand builds watches that stand up to abuse. If your watch can survive a Formula 1 crash it can surely handle whatever you’ll throw at it on vacation. Some people might balk at strapping a 47mm-wide by 15mm-thick red-gold dive watch to their wrist but the appeal for many of RM’s customers is their easy recognition. The analogy of the supercar that you can strap to your wrist definitely applies here; it’s also very comfortable for such a large watch. This is due to a thick well-integrated rubber strap and a curved case back (complete with curved sapphire crystal display) that controls its mass by keeping it tight to your wrist.

It has recently received an important update which takes care of some rather annoying bugs.



eBay is one of the first big apps that have been released in the Windows Store for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 users and it has been downloaded by thousands of users across the world. The app looks absolutely stunning especially on Windows 8 tablets with good displays but it’s just as good on desktop Windows 8.1 devices such as my laptop. You can have a look at the video from below where I’ve included a fresh overview of the updated eBay app for Windows 8. Of course the app can be downloaded absolutely for free and has a size slightly bigger than 2 megabytes.

Windows 8 eBay app updated with bug squashes

The eBay app for Windows 8.1™ allows you to tap into the world’s largest online marketplace anywhere you are. Built upon simple intuitive design it will help you quickly navigate to whatever you want to do on eBay. Never miss a deal with the eBay app for Windows 8.1™ with alerts when you are outbid or auctions are ending. You can customize even more alerts so you stay on top of your shopping. Pinning ‘Live Tiles’ to the homepage provides updated information about your activity.

According to the official changelog of the app the latest version comes with “critical bug fixes” so you need to go ahead and download the latest version if you’re not running it already. eBay doesn’t detail what exactly the bug squashes consist in but I’ve had a thorough look at the negative reviews and most of them seemed to be pointing fingers at the Windows 8 version being slower than the Android counterpart; login difficulties and absence of the items that have been marked as “watching” or just acquired. I’ve tested the app and can confirm that all these problems have been taken care of.

When you will first open the app you will be require to pick the country where you’re located. You can use the app without logging in but obviously you won’t be able to buy or sell things. You can search bid and purchase items list them auction or sell and leave feedback. By enabling the Live Tile of whatever size you want because it’s obviously fully compatible with Windows 8.1 you can also receive notifications about your buying and selling activities. If you bought something you can also track your package.

They're calling it the ""Megadrought.""

Seven years ago in this space I profiled the drought that was baking California (and the companies working to combat it). It was California's worst drought in 500 years experts said at the time. But seven years later the worst has gotten even worse with 95% of the state experiencing ""severe drought"" conditions and 86% ""extreme.""

Things have gotten so bad that California's State Water Resources Control Board may vote on Aug. 3 to cut off water access to Central Valley farmers. Fires are breaking out across the parched state; the crowdsourced #FireMappers map shows literally dozens of blazes including the Dixie Fire which reached ""megafire"" status on Friday. No wonder the American Geophysical Union now says this seemingly endless drought is the most severe ""in the last 1200 years.""

And yet if you look at a map you'll see a very big (indeed an ocean-sized) potential solution to California's drought problems -- if only we can get the salt out.

The desalination solution

Through desalination oceanic salt water can be transformed into potable fresh water in either of two ways: You can boil it let the salt precipitate out and collect the condensation. Or you can filter the saltwater through a membrane to remove the salt.

It can be an expensive process. A gallon of potable water produced through desalination costs about twice what it costs to provide water from other sources. And yet this cost of desalination has fallen by half over the past 30 years -- meaning it's an increasingly viable solution. What's more when you consider the losses from not investing in desalination: California lost $5 billion in agricultural revenue from crops not grown during the last big drought from 2014 to 2015. That same $5 billion could have built five new desalination plants to help prevent the next drought.

In California nearly a dozen such desalination plants are already in operation (and 10 more are planned). The Carlsbad Desalination Plant -- still under construction when I last wrote about this drought -- has now been up and running for five years. Filtering 50 million gallons per day it's the largest desalination plant in the Western Hemisphere and supplies 7% of San Diego County's water.

Poseidon Water the company that built the Carlsbad plant is now planning to open a similar-sized plant in Huntington Beach -- albeit at a higher price. Carlsbad cost $1 billion but the Huntington Beach plant could cost $1.4 billion.

Seven desalination companies to invest in

Speaking of which investors looking to support (and profit from) the growing use of desalination technology to cure California's chronic droughts might want to start their search with Poseidon Water; according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence it's a subsidiary of the giant Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP 0.23%). With a $16 billion market capitalization but only $193 million in trailing profit Brookfield may not look like an attractive investment at first glance. But the company generated more than $1 billion in positive free cash flow (FCF) last year -- giving the stock an attractive valuation of 16 times FCF. Adding to the attraction Brookfield currently pays a generous dividend yield of 3.7%.

Brookfield is based in Bermuda and foreign companies tend to dominate the water desalination field. France's Veolia Environnement (VEOEY -0.03%) is the world's biggest desalination company having built more than 1950 reverse-osmosis desalination plants in 85 countries -- including the huge desalination plant in Sydney Australia that supplies 15% of that city's water. France's Suez Environnement (SZEVY) is No. 2 -- and earns a massive 23.4% EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) margin on its water business.

Among U.S. companies General Electric Company (GE -2.46%) remains one of the world's biggest suppliers of water treatment equipment. On Catalina Island southwest of Los Angeles GE built a 150000-gallons-per-day desalination plant for Southern California Edison a division of Edison International (EIX 0.17%). GE says the desalination process costs between $3 and $6 per 1000 gallons and that 70% of that cost is for fuel to operate the plants. However solar-powered desalination has the potential to cut that cost.

Speaking of energy costs you might also consider Energy Recovery Inc. (ERII 0.43%) which derives 77% of its revenue from reverse-osmosis desalination services. Through efficient operation the company says its flagship PX Pressure Exchanger ""saves water desalination customers approximately USD $2 billion annually in energy costs.""

Finally Ecolab (ECL -0.03%) based in Saint Paul Minnesota owns Aquatech International a Pennsylvania company specializing in water purification technology. It's a small subsidiary within a big company but still the 10th-biggest desalination company in the world.

They're calling it the ""Megadrought.""

Seven years ago in this space I profiled the drought that was baking California (and the companies working to combat it). It was California's worst drought in 500 years experts said at the time. But seven years later the worst has gotten even worse with 95% of the state experiencing ""severe drought"" conditions and 86% ""extreme.""

Things have gotten so bad that California's State Water Resources Control Board may vote on Aug. 3 to cut off water access to Central Valley farmers. Fires are breaking out across the parched state; the crowdsourced #FireMappers map shows literally dozens of blazes including the Dixie Fire which reached ""megafire"" status on Friday. No wonder the American Geophysical Union now says this seemingly endless drought is the most severe ""in the last 1200 years.""

And yet if you look at a map you'll see a very big (indeed an ocean-sized) potential solution to California's drought problems -- if only we can get the salt out.

The desalination solution

Through desalination oceanic salt water can be transformed into potable fresh water in either of two ways: You can boil it let the salt precipitate out and collect the condensation. Or you can filter the saltwater through a membrane to remove the salt.

It can be an expensive process. A gallon of potable water produced through desalination costs about twice what it costs to provide water from other sources. And yet this cost of desalination has fallen by half over the past 30 years -- meaning it's an increasingly viable solution. What's more when you consider the losses from not investing in desalination: California lost $5 billion in agricultural revenue from crops not grown during the last big drought from 2014 to 2015. That same $5 billion could have built five new desalination plants to help prevent the next drought.

In California nearly a dozen such desalination plants are already in operation (and 10 more are planned). The Carlsbad Desalination Plant -- still under construction when I last wrote about this drought -- has now been up and running for five years. Filtering 50 million gallons per day it's the largest desalination plant in the Western Hemisphere and supplies 7% of San Diego County's water.

Poseidon Water the company that built the Carlsbad plant is now planning to open a similar-sized plant in Huntington Beach -- albeit at a higher price. Carlsbad cost $1 billion but the Huntington Beach plant could cost $1.4 billion.

Seven desalination companies to invest in

Speaking of which investors looking to support (and profit from) the growing use of desalination technology to cure California's chronic droughts might want to start their search with Poseidon Water; according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence it's a subsidiary of the giant Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP 0.23%). With a $16 billion market capitalization but only $193 million in trailing profit Brookfield may not look like an attractive investment at first glance. But the company generated more than $1 billion in positive free cash flow (FCF) last year -- giving the stock an attractive valuation of 16 times FCF. Adding to the attraction Brookfield currently pays a generous dividend yield of 3.7%.

Brookfield is based in Bermuda and foreign companies tend to dominate the water desalination field. France's Veolia Environnement (VEOEY -0.03%) is the world's biggest desalination company having built more than 1950 reverse-osmosis desalination plants in 85 countries -- including the huge desalination plant in Sydney Australia that supplies 15% of that city's water. France's Suez Environnement (SZEVY) is No. 2 -- and earns a massive 23.4% EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) margin on its water business.

Among U.S. companies General Electric Company (GE -2.46%) remains one of the world's biggest suppliers of water treatment equipment. On Catalina Island southwest of Los Angeles GE built a 150000-gallons-per-day desalination plant for Southern California Edison a division of Edison International (EIX 0.17%). GE says the desalination process costs between $3 and $6 per 1000 gallons and that 70% of that cost is for fuel to operate the plants. However solar-powered desalination has the potential to cut that cost.

Speaking of energy costs you might also consider Energy Recovery Inc. (ERII 0.43%) which derives 77% of its revenue from reverse-osmosis desalination services. Through efficient operation the company says its flagship PX Pressure Exchanger ""saves water desalination customers approximately USD $2 billion annually in energy costs.""

Finally Ecolab (ECL -0.03%) based in Saint Paul Minnesota owns Aquatech International a Pennsylvania company specializing in water purification technology. It's a small subsidiary within a big company but still the 10th-biggest desalination company in the world. And it's part of Ecolab's largest and most profitable division (""global industrial"") where it contributes to that division's powerful 18.5% operating profit margin.

Sims 4: Cottage Living may have the answer,"Like a lot of people at the end of the Covid-19 restrictions I recently made the mistake of checking out a few self-catering holiday sites to try to book a late break for the family. I could almost hear the online availability calendars laughing at me. Anything that was still available would have required me to re-mortgage our own house and sell the car. Sadly it looks like we won’t be spending a week lounging around in a tiny leaky Dorset cottage living on a diet of cream teas and fish suppers. It’s almost unconscionable.

With amazing good timing however Electronic Arts has just released its Cottage Living expansion pack for Sims 4 the latest themed addition to the long-running life simulation series. As ever you create a sim character then build a house for them and guide there lives like a benevolent god or reality TV producer – but now there are lots of design components drawn from idealised English country house architecture. Stable doors stone-trimmed windows ancient oak floors and decorative country pub signs allow you to indulge your cottagecore fantasies. You can also choose to be off grid meaning there’s no electricity and you have to grow all your own vegetables – and you can keep cows and chickens for your milk and eggs and llamas for wool – although they are incredibly demanding requiring regular feeding cleaning and hugs. My sim had to abandon her career to look after them like a modern simulation of 1970s sitcom The Good Life. I got so into this idea I started a new game with two sims named Tom and Barbara who live completely off the land. Unfortunately they are permanently broke and their cow ran way because they couldn’t afford to give it treats.

What I love about the expansion is that it wants to simulate not just the appearance of country lifestyle but the sociocultural quirks too. There is a weekly country fayre where you can enter giant vegetable competitions – the village folk are also incredibly … um … present. Everyone seems to know each other and they drop round continuously sometimes bringing cake. I like the way this can become slightly uncomfortable at times – just like a real country holiday. When I first built my new cottage in the game’s Henford-on-Bagley village a couple of locals came by to say hello. I don’t know what quirk of AI caused this but while I was talking to one young woman about Victorian furniture (sims have their own nonsense language but a little speech bubble pops up with an icon representing the theme of the discussion) a man I didn’t know wearing a green body warmer and wellington boots like something out of Shooting Times magazine wandered off into my bedroom got into my bed for a second then walked through to the kitchen and raided my fridge. Naturally I was too polite to say anything because I thought maybe this is just how people behave in places called Henford-on-Bagley.

There’s also a neat favour mechanic which gets you to do little chores for villagers – delivering things growing specific vegetables visiting lonely locals – in exchange for money or other rewards. It enhances the feeling of a joining a closer community than the sprawling suburbs we’re used to in this series and the fact that you can form complicated relationships with other villagers makes the whole thing feel as if you’re living in a Joanna Trollope novel which in my experience is harder to achieve on a real-life self-catering holiday in Charmouth.

This evening I sat out on the balcony I built for myself watching rabbits frolic in the garden (if you’re nice to them they’ll eat your weeds for you) and waving as delivery boys wandered past. It is so relaxing this faux rural life – I get from it the same vicarious pleasure as watching Countryfile or Escape to the Country; designing a new stable complex provides a nice break when you’re working from home and already bored of the Olympics.

It’s weird how the locking down of the UK has been bookended by pastoral video game releases. At the beginning was Animal Crossing: New Horizons which allowed socially distanced friends to arrange virtual house parties or little walks together through sylvan woodlands. Now we have Cottage Living which gives you a naturalistic rural community to join livestock to rear and all the trappings of an English cottage holiday without the inconvenience of gridlocked single-lane roads overpriced pub food or actually having to leave your own house. Maybe next year we’ll get away on an actual holiday. Until then I have a really demanding cow that needs milking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL2xvdWlzdmlsbGUvZm9vdGJhbGwvbWFkZGVuLW5mbC0yMi1yYXRpbmdz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Madden NFL 22's Ratings for Former Louisville Players,"(Photo of Lamar Jackson: Scott Taetsch - USA TODAY Sports)

Eric Baptizat joined EA’s Motive Studio earlier this year to work on an unannounced project. However the Ubisoft veteran has now confirmed on social media that he’s acting as the game director for the newly-announced Dead Space remake.

Baptizat had worked at Ubisoft for 16 years most notably as the director of Valhalla and the lead designer for other Assassin’s Creed entries including Origins and Black Flag.

The most senior development figure on the Dead Space remake other than Baptizat is another Ubisoft veteran creative director Roman Campos-Oriola.

Campos-Oriola joined from Ubisoft Montreal last year where he was previously the creative director for online brawler For Honor. Before that he was lead designer for Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Future Soldier (2012) and Red Steel 1 and 2 (2006 2010).

Dead Space was announced during Electronic Arts’ EA Play Live showcase last month finally confirming the long-expected remake project. Following the announcement VGC analysis offered some context on who’s working on the Dead Space remake.

The art director in charge of the Dead Space remake’s visual direction is Mike Yazijian. Yazijian actually worked on the art for Dead Space 2 as part of Visceral’s now-closed Montreal division.

By Mary Bermingham

mary@TheCork.ie

As the Irish media industry continues to emerge from an extended lockdown west Cork-based production company Alchemy Electronic Arts has confirmed that filming will take place next summer on their long-awaited film-art project The Last Drop Falls. The film will look at the life of Nobel Prize-winning Irish playwright Samuel Beckett and in particular his relationship with his adopted city of Paris where he lived and worked for most of his life.

The film is being developed by visual artist and film producer David Bickley from a script by West Cork based screenwriter David Forsythe. Mr Bickley will be undertaking an arts residency at the Centre Culturel Irlandais Paris in 2022 where production work on the film will make up the core of his stay. The Last Drop Falls will be Alchemy’s third major film project on Samuel Beckett following 2006’s The Man Who Shot Beckett which focussed on the relationship between Irish photographer John Minihan and the famous playwright and the short film Walking for Godot in 2017 made with the Paris Beckett festival RTE Arts and UCC featuring actor Adrian Dunbar.

Commenting on the news Mr Bickley said “We are delighted to finally be able to move forward to the next stage with this film. It’s something that we have been developing for a long time. I’m really looking forward to using my time in residence at the CCI to make a film-artwork that will resonate with film ideas of the period and to explore Beckett’s adopted city through space and time revealing how it shaped the man and his work.”",,,

The Christian conservative group One Million Moms is urging parents to protest a one-minute ad released by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly which says the sex of a child is “randomly assigned at birth.”

“Because the body you are randomly assigned at birth shouldn’t determine how well you are cared for” says the ad titled “Lilly – A Medicine Company” featuring a woman with double mastectomy scars wearing an open shirt and identifying as a man.

“Can you imagine what goes through the mind of a child when he or she sees this ad?” asks a statement released by One Million Moms which regularly launches campaigns against organizations that produce questionable content.

“Lilly chose to air this commercial knowing it would be controversial” the group says. “We all know children imitate what they see and repeat what they hear. Lilly should be ashamed!”

One Million Moms warns that Lilly will “push away customers if it continues advertising in a repulsive manner that offends parents.”

“Parents” it adds “do not approve of this advertising tactic!”

To remove “this offensive commercial please share with your family and friends” it urges.

As of early Sunday more than 16400 people had signed a petition it launched against the ad.

“I’m not buying into your social agenda to push transgenderism. Your latest ad offends me and many other conservative consumers. I won’t be buying your products either. I’m taking Lilly off my shopping list since I will be purchasing from your competitors instead” it says.

In February tens of thousands of people backed the group’s online petition asking The American Girl company to scrap an LGBT storyline tied to its 2021 Girl of the Year doll.

One Million Moms launched the online campaign after Mattel named 10-year-old Kira Bailey from Michigan the “2021 Girl of the Year” in December.

The doll came with an accompanying book Kira Down Under.

In the book Kira visits an animal sanctuary in Australia operated by her great aunts who are in a same-sex marriage. The book details how the aunts got married after laws were changed in 2017 to allow for same-sex marriages.

“As Christians we know that even though something is legalized doesn’t make it moral or right” One Million Moms said at the time. “American Girl could have chosen another storyline or characters to write about and remained neutral in the culture war. American Girl is attempting to desensitize our youth by featuring a storyline with two lesbian aunts.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vaGVhbHRoL2hvcnNlc2hvZS1jcmFiLWxhbC1lbmRvdG94aW5zLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLzIwMjEvMDcvMzAvY2JjMGExNTgtZDUyNS0xMWViLTlmMjktZTllNmM5ZTg0M2M2X3N0b3J5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A horseshoe crab's blood is vital in testing drugs.

It’s not often that three members of the same family are honored at the same time. Mike Owen and his mother and father Louise and Archie were all named to the Evansville Vanderburgh School Corp. Hall of Fame for their prowess as teachers coaches and athletes through decades of service.

“Grandma Lou granddad Arch and dad all demonstrated to me the amazing influence that a teacher and coach can have on both a school and a community” said Andy Owen Mike’s son and current EVSC athletics director.

“During the almost 100 years of EVSC service they impacted numerous lives for the better. I like many of their former students players and colleagues celebrate this honor with a great sense of pride. Each of them wanted the best for their students and tried to be an advocate and friend throughout their entire lives.”

King the Owen’s and nine others will be inducted into the EVSC 2020 Hall of Fame class during the Evening to Remember celebration dinner on Sept. 30 at the DoubleTree by Hilton on Walnut Street. Social distancing protocols are in place to ensure safe practices.

""We're thrilled that Lil has earned this recognition"" said Mark King Lilly's father. ""She's proud to have come from the public schools. Being exposed to a diverse population at school has prepared her to interact with everyone she encounters in her daily life. We know that Lilly is especially excited to be included with the former principal Lana Burton.""

The biennially-awarded EVSC Hall of Fame honors distinguished individuals who exemplify outstanding achievement in their life’s work and who have made a positive impact on public education in the greater community. It also emphasizes the importance of service to the community and inspires EVSC students to seek excellence in their own education and careers.

“To say that we are extremely proud and humbled by the quality of the individuals in our Class of 2020 would be an understatement” EVSC superintendent David Smith said in a statement. “Their work in our community and the differences they have made are extremely impressive and we are truly honored for them to represent the EVSC in this manner.”

Lincoln County and much of Mississippi are under a “significant risk” of heat stress and stroke according to the National Weather Service in Jackson.

Saturday air temperatures are expected to reach the upper 90s to 100 degrees Fahrenheit with a peak heat index of up to 115 degrees.

The heat index is a measure of how hot it really feels when relative humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature.

Heat stroke is increasingly likely to occur with prolonged outdoor activity under a significant heat stress risk. Residents are urged to stay hydrated and avoid spending long periods of time outdoors during this prolonged heat wave.

The area under the significant risk includes Lincoln Lawrence Franklin Copiah and Jefferson counties extending into the central portion of the state and Louisiana.

An extreme risk where heat stroke is imminent with prolonged outdoor activity exists across much of the Mississippi River Delta.

Heat stroke will be a significant concern with prolonged outdoor activity NWS warns.

The National Weather Service suggests drinking plenty of water even if not thirsty; wearing sunscreen; wearing lightweight loose-fitting and light-colored clothing; and only working outdoors in the early or late day and only if necessary.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s region has notified utility companies to prepare for emergency conditions according to Entergy reports though a power shortage is not expected.

Extreme heat conditions may lead to increased power usage for air conditioning leading to generating stations tripping however. Residents are therefore asked to use appliances only as necessary throughout the heat warning period such as using a microwave instead of an oven or stove washing clothes only in the early morning or late evening turning off the heat dry setting on dishwashers and only drying clothes overnight.

Cool showers or baths are recommended to help cool down. Check on friends and neighbors especially those with known health problems or who are elderly. Never leave children or pets in vehicles — temperatures in a locked vehicle can reach temps higher than 140 degrees within minutes according to weather.gov.",,,,,,,,,,,,

They’ve put in $100000 and the bank has put in $400000 and the house is worth $500000. “When you’ve had the house for a period of time and you’ve been making repayments and the house value has gone up you might be in a position where your equity is say 30 per cent and provided you’ve got income to support a bigger loan the bank might say: ‘Well you’ve got the income you’ve got enough equity we’ll allow you to borrow another $100000 to lower that home equity to 20 per cent again.’”Mickenbecker says. You then use that money to buy shares. Instead of slowly buying small parcels of shares as you save you put a big whack of money in upfront to get access to compounding returns and use your future surplus funds to service the debt instead. It’s called “leveraging” or “gearing”. But wait there’s more. If you do this the interest you pay on the investment loan can be claimed as a tax deduction against your personal income.

Sound too good to be legal? No according to ATO assistant commissioner Tim Loh: “It is something that we see people do.” However you can’t just buy shares and claim part of your mortgage interest as a tax deduction (I asked). “You can’t do that because you don’t have a record to track how that money is connected” Loh says. Ok so how to do it? “You need to create a separate loan account and then use that account for a particular investment whether it is shares or Exchange Traded Funds. That way you can track interest that’s gone into that loan – the interest you can claim as a deduction.” If you do this says Loh you may also be able to claim other costs of building your portfolio such as subscriptions to investing journals bank charges broking fees and ongoing financial adviser costs (although not the upfront cost of advice on setting up the loan). “If you’re kind of doing it passively – you’ve just invested it and you’re not actively managing the investment portfolio – you probably can’t claim a deduction” warns Loh. “But if you are doing a bit more and the amount of capital increases over time then absolutely you can.“

Ok so you can do it. But should you? “Depends on if you think the equity market is going to rise or not” says Graham Hand managing editor of Firstlinks. And that in the short term is anyone’s guess. Hand warns about the potential losses from “leverage” investing: “Let’s assume a fairly simple example of someone gearing at what you would call 50 per cent. So say they put in $100 of their own money they borrow $100 and so they invest $200 in the sharemarket.” “Because their own money is $100 but they’ve put $200 into the market if the market falls 50 per cent they don’t lose 50 per cent of their own money they lose 100 per cent.” Hand has witnessed things go very badly for “leveraged” investors: “I was running a geared business during the Global Financial Crisis and the losses were horrendous... a lot of people just panicked. So it’s not for the faint-hearted.”

Loading But what if I just don’t sell? That’s simple to say but harder to do warns Hand. “If you talk to anyone who has been in a funds management business they’ll tell you that redemptions are at their highest when the market falls and applications are at their highest when markets are at their highest. It’s just people’s optimism” he says. The MoneySmart website run by corporate regulator the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) offers this stark advice about borrowing to invest: “Some lenders let you borrow to invest and use your home as security. Do not do this.” (The bold font is from ASIC.) Really?

I checked with ASIC’s Laura Higgins who heads the MoneySmart website who clarified that this is advice for newbie investors. “Some investors would absolutely be using equity in their home” says Higgins. But for newer investors or those with less-secure incomes offering their homes as security is no small thing. “The issue of a new investor to put their home at risk is I think significant. Can you imagine a young person starting out and then compromising their position in the housing market because they lose their house?” “I think when you’re starting out to invest you need to first understand where your money is what can you afford to invest and what makes sense for your personal circumstances” she says. Canstar’s Steve Mickenbecker is also cautious.",,,,,,,,,,,,

And with sites like  it is easier than ever for artists crafters and creators to turn their vision into profit. Think about it: It’s a central location where new small business owners can sell their goods without stressing over making their own websites and dealing with all sorts of tax shipping and sales issues that come along with that.

Interested? Kay we tapped several Etsy sellers to share their wins and mistakes to help you set up your own Etsy business.

(1) Take things slow-ish

thepairabirds Record Player Art Print $27 at Etsy

Now first things first: Etsy might not be the easy cash grab some creators hope for as they do charge fees for what you sell but on the upside they give you a worldwide exposure that is hard to attain with your own website or via social media. Tabitha Bianca Brown who has been creating beautiful illustrations and portraits for her shop for more than a decade has her own website but recommends using Etsy for the foot traffic. “Etsy is a large company that can afford huge ad campaigns to bring shoppers to the website” she says. “With my own site I have to personally do more advertising.”

“The mistake I made is one that a lot of sellers make: thinking that success is instantaneous” says Brown. “Just like a physical store you have to build up your inventory. You wouldn’t visit a store in the mall that just had one shirt sitting on a rack. The more inventory you have the more people are likely to come across your products while browsing on Etsy.”



“See your shop as a customer would” says Mai Solorzano a Mexican artist who makes contemporary jewelry pieces and has had her since 2011. “As if you are interested in buying something that way you can see where there is missing information.” When Solorzano started she didn’t know much about shipping costs or the time it takes and wasn’t initially clear about return policies. For those starting a shop she says the best thing they can do is take a step back and get a new perspective.

Kimberly Scott-Drayton has been selling her unique tumblers as on Etsy since January of this year. She’s been making tumblers for about two years since she saw one at a friend’s house and before she opened her Etsy shop she’d been selling mostly in local Facebook groups. For her setting up the listings was an initial hurdle. “I wasn’t using applicable keywords where people would search and find my stuff” she says. Scott-Drayton makes her products to order and recently set up a custom order listing to help with requests she was getting and found it made it a lot easier for her customers and helped her complete sales.

“We could have spent a little more time at the beginning making sure what we were doing is cost effective” says Scott and Zach Artice the couple often known by their drag personas Minnie and Tink who run and sell resin creations like Disney-themed Pop Sockets. They opened their shop in the midst of the pandemic in August 2020 and suggest that taking time to figure out costs and pricing is key. “Sometimes we got so excited with what we were making we weren’t checking if we would actually make any money” they explain. “So our profit margins ended up being pretty bad at first! We have since found more cost-effective ways of doing things.”

Dan Richardson the artist behind  a kawaii-style sticker shop launched his business in February 2020. He’d tried running several Etsy shops on and off since 2009 and often found it was easier to sell his variety of art products in person than online. But this time he’s had much more success. He chalks it up to luck but he also invested a lot in Etsy advertising and started getting sales before he was even fully prepared. “This time I didn’t even wait. I had eight stickers and five coloring pages and I was like let’s go” says Richardson. “I dove in blindly. I’m so happy that I did that and I believed in what I had.” Once he started getting good reviews and the Etsy algorithm was able to see he was delivering his products on time he was able to cut back on his advertising costs.



(2) Find your niche

thepairabirds Gemini Interior Art Horoscope Astrology Print $22 at Etsy

Even if you don’t have tons of money to invest in advertising the key can really be finding a way to make your shop stand out from the others. “I mainly sell artwork featuring Black women and girls” says Brown. “What makes my products stand out is the subject matter. It can be difficult to find bright and colorful artwork of Black women and girls happy carefree and enjoying nature. I make sure that my products showcase that joy.”



“Everyone’s making tumblers but I don’t really look at what other people are doing” says Scott-Drayton. “I try and put my own spin on things and make it really unique and different but still usable.”

Solorzano agrees: “I don’t really search for other similar shops. I try to be honest with my products and the history they have how I designed it”



(3) Invest in some good lighting—and freebies

“Take good photos! We truly love what we are making and we believe that shows in our product design and photos we use for the listings"" says Artice. “And offering free domestic shipping can be a plus to buyers. If you are shipping something with multiple items or a bigger order bite the bullet and pay for priority shipping or insurance. Things can get lost in the mail and that is devastating to your customer and your business.”



Don’t forget to offer worldwide shipping if at all possible too. “It’s a great tool to sell all over the globe” adds Solorzano. “It’s wonderful to be in contact with customers directly. It’s not like a shop where you only got orders to fulfill and you don’t have any idea where it’s going to end.”

(4) Ask for help

Make sure you have a partner or a sounding board who can help balance things out if the business side if things get overwhelming Richardson says. For him he relies on his wife. “I get overwhelmed because not only do I have the creative mind but I also have mental illness as well and that’s a huge focus in my shop” he admits. “ I look at things and I get instantly overwhelmed and then I shut down. My wife is there to say ‘Dan we have their money. You have to do this. There are no excuses. Get the heck up and go.’”



(5) TikTok = Your Marketing Team

While Etsy ads and great photos can go a long way into helping with Etsy’s algorithm sales will only come if you do a little marketing of our own and for many artists they turn to social media especially TikTok. The free platform gives them a voice and once they get an audience their new product launches can be a bigger success. “We also use social media in a strategic way to help get word of mouth out quicker “ say the Artices who can be found on TikTok and Instagram at @MinnieAndTink. “Creating interesting videos that show the process and final result can be fun for people.”

NeverNakedDesigns 3D Ice Lid Sparkly Lemon Yellow Melanin Made Tumbler $58 at Etsy

Richardson also uses his TikTok account to find out what his buyers really want to buy. He currently has more than 200 members of his monthly sticker club and regularly polls his followers. He also uses his platform @Chubblegum to help out other small businesses with advice about how to make products and how to navigate Etsy’s rules and tricky algorithms and he even ran a series of Craft Wars to help boost other small businesses.



Scott-Drayton uses her TikTok (@NeverNakedDesigns) to showcase all the new products she’s working on. But when her popular giraffe cup suddenly had more than 40 sales she wasn’t prepared. “I was pretty new to Etsy and learning Etsy and since I had one made I put the shipping as ready to ship within one to two weeks” she explains. “So for 40-something orders it said they’d be shipped in 1 to 2 weeks which is insane. There were so many sleepless nights because I wasn’t going to go back and tell people I made a mistake. It was my mistake. I owned it and got them all out in two weeks. It was a lesson definitely.”



(6) Two words: Time! Management!

maisolorzano Cardamom Sterling Silver Lariat Seed Necklace $225 at Etsy

The downside of being your own boss is well you are in charge of photos posting listings shipping running social media and making the product. Juggling can be tricky. “Time management has been huge for me” admits Scott-Drayton. “I have to write things down and Etsy is great for that because it gives me due dates.”

When you are starting out pick a small goal. “My goal was to make $50 a month to pay for me to find other little hobbies and to continue making stickers and whatnot” says Richardson. “In my eyes. I have succeeded beyond what I could have imagined so to me I am 100 percent a success.”



(7) And last don’t let one bad review derail you

“Don’t let criticism get to you or discourage you” adds Artice. “There is always something to be learned and ways to improve!” Happy selling!

Of those 67% started their side hustle within the last three years and 31% started it in 2020. Nearly a quarter of Americans 24% plan to start a side hustle in 2021.

One popular approach is building a stream of passive income or earnings that require an initial effort but only minor ongoing maintenance. When most people hear the words ""passive income"" they think about investments and rental real estate. But creating content like e-books and online courses can bring in passive income too.

Molly Espenan has always been crafty. Take an artistic mind like hers along with a habit and ability to monetize her hobbies and you get Wild Iris Crafts.

Wild Iris’s Instagram page is full of vibrant colorful pour painting pieces like coasters trays wall art and even cutting boards. Espenan creates the dripping effect by using a mixture of fluid art and resin which she gets from craft stores or other small businesses and Etsy shops.

Espenan is originally from New Orleans and moved to North Carolina for graduate school. She earned her masters degree in psychology from Wake Forest University and now works for UNC as a psychometrist and clinical research coordinator in the neurology department.

Wild Iris’s name comes from Louisiana’s state wildflower: the iris. Espenan adopted this name for her business to keep a piece of her hometown with her.

“I love North Carolina and I have definitely made a home here but I love that my business is a reminder of my first home” she said.”

Back in high school Espenan started her business by painting shoes for classmates and family members. In college she started painting coolers for Greek life events.

“My time after graduating from college was when I really found my niche in the geode art world” she said. “I was working a part-time job and it was the first time I really had time to devote to being creative.”

Espenan found inspiration both from YouTube videos and on Instagram and found her niche in geode-style pieces. And while she both learns through watching other artists on social media and runs her own page she does not let herself focus too much on stats.

“I’ve been on social media as a business owner for a few years and I try really hard not to let my engagement or lack thereof affect how I feel about my artwork and my validity as a professional artist” Espenan said.

Despite its downsides Instagram has connected her to many buyers and she takes custom orders through direct message and via Etsy.

Espenan sits in front of a three-panel wall piece. Pour paint trays and coasters. Espenan’s car coasters her bestselling item.

Wild Iris’s most highly requested piece are car coasters inserts.

“One of my returning customers asked if I could make some for her and at the time I didn’t even know what they were” Espenan said about the coasters. “Now those are my best selling items.”

Espenan runs her growing business through an extra room in her apartment that she converted into a studio. And while the space has worked she said she’s ready to expand.

While the studio expansion may come later Espenan has already started expanding her online presence and her business. She along with another artist named Alex started a podcast called “Wild and Spicy.” In each episode the artists share tips encouragement and their own stories.

“Selling handmade artwork is a very personal thing that artists put a lot of heart and soul into and I wanted to provide as much support and advice as possible to other artists because I know just how personal this business is” Espenan said.

Tesla may still be unsure about accepting bitcoin for its electric vehicles again yet cryptocurrency holders can tool around in other ways now that travel suppliers are warming up to the idea.

Airfare website Cheapair.com Latvian carrier Air Baltic and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic have long accepted bitcoin and Berlin-based tours and activity booking site GetYourGuide started taking dogecoin processed via BitPay in June as part of its expansion in the U.S.

Cryptocurrency transactions ""will really matter for travel"" and his firm is looking at accepting other coins going forward said Johannes Reck CEO and co-founder of GetYourGuide.

At a higher price point than Tesla’s two newer models these veteran EVs offer a combination of the efficiency performance and luxury that originally put Tesla on the map. Below is a thorough comparison of Tesla’s Model S sedan vs. its Model X mid-sized SUV.

What is the Tesla Model S?

The Model S sedan is Tesla’s longest running EV in production to date. It made its official debut in 2012 after years as a prototype for the automaker. Since then the sporty EV has held a reign as the best selling plug-in electric in both 2015 and 2016.

Sales of the veteran Tesla have slowed since the launch of the automaker’s more cost-friendly Model 3 and Model Y EVs but the Model S still sits as a premiere sedan that offers a variety of luxury and performance for those who can afford it.

Especially following its latest refresh and the introduction of the Plaid powertrain.

What is Tesla Model X?

Tesla describes its Model X EV as a “mid-sized SUV” that currently sits as the automaker’s second longest running model on its shared assembly lines with the Model S. The two EVs also share over a quarter of the same parts although they look quite different in design.

Originally unveiled in 2012 first deliveries of the Model X didn’t begun until 2015 due to a focus on the Model S production followed by a slew of delays.

While neither of these two Tesla models saw arguably overdue overhauls to their design in 2020 the new year said otherwise. In late 2020 Tesla had announced a complete production shutdown for both models through the holidays and into the new year. This move has led toward speculation about a possible refresh of both EVs. Finally Tesla came forth and confirmed a refresh was in fact coming for both veteran models.

Performance

As the two higher end EVs currently available from Tesla both the Model S and Model X have plenty to offer drivers under their floor. Both models now come with dual motor or tri-motor AWD Plaid (AWD) options to choose from. Let’s begin with the elder Tesla’s Model S.

Model S

The least expensive version of the Model S sedan is still a powerhouse of EV achievement. The current Long Range trim can travel 405 miles on a single charge hit a top speed of 155 mph and can fire from 0-60 mph in 3.1 seconds.

Previously the Model S came in a Performance trim focused on speed but that was dropped to make way for the upcoming Plaid powertrain.

Plaid and Plaid+

In the fall of 2020 Tesla confirmed an even higher end version of its banner EV with the unveiling of its tri motor “Plaid” powertrain. In 2021 Tesla surprised customers with the announcement of the Plaid+ powertrain. This version was advertised to offer the same speed as its Plaid counterpart but with a 520+ mile range on a single charge.

While tons of Tesla disciples put in their reservations for the Plaid+ the automaker scrapped the entire trim altogether as Elon Musk declared that consumers don’t need more than 400 miles of range and the regular Plaid is “just too good.”

The Plaid was originally scheduled to arrive in late 2021 but Plaid has sinced moved around quite a bit on the calendar. Currently the Plaid Model is is scheduled to deliver in September or October although the Long Range Model S has since been pushed to February or March of 2022.

Nevertheless the Plaid specs are still quite staggering as the new EV has already shattered some track records.

The Plaid Model S has ended up with a mere 396 EPA estimated range compared to the 520+ miles originally advertised on the Plaid+. That being said it can still hit a top speed of 200 mph and travel 0-60 mph in 1.99 seconds.

Here’s the latest to get you up to speed on the whole debacle:

Model X

Similar to the Model S before Tesla’s Plaid announcement the Model X came in two different trims focused on either range or speed. With the new refresh however the Model X is now available in either dual motor AWD or a tri motor Plaid option.

The dual motor Model X Long Range can travel 360 miles on a single charge (a slight downgrade of 11 miles from the previous Long Range Plus trim). I can however hit a top speed of 155 mph… if you upgrade to the 22″ Turbine Wheels for an additional $5500.

It’s 0-60 mph acceleration of 3.8 seconds loses its head to head battle with the Long Range Model S but is still an improvement of .6 seconds compared to its previous version.

Much like the Model S Tesla has dropped the Performance trim in favor of a tri motor Model X Plaid. This version can travel an EPA estimated 340 miles and reach a top speed of 163 mph with the Turbine Wheels upgrade. The Model X Plaid can also travel 0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds.

Truthfully this feels more like a rebranding than anything as the the Plaid powertrain offers nearly the same specs as the previous Performance trim. Plaid loses one mile of estimated range in exchange for .1 seconds saved on its 0-60. The top speed of 163 mph remains the same.

Additional Features

After reading above it’s clear that either Tesla option will offer you a drivetrain performance you’re looking for to get you where you need to go. Yes it’s obvious that one option is a five seat sedan while the other is a mid-size SUV.

There are more subtle differences between the two that may end up being the deciding factor in your EV search. Here are a few comparisons of the additional features available on our two Tesla models.

First let’s compare what these two Teslas have in common. Both come with standard black interior included although the X comes with carbon fiber trim while the Model S has Ebony Wood Decor. This surrounds new yoke steering offering a (mandatory) futuristic look for drivers.

Both refreshes have also seen new horizontal touchscreen displays as well as a second display in the back seat. Both models now feature Tesla’s heat pump and chrome delete trim.

Just recently Tesla revealed both the Model S and Model X are moving to 12 volt lithium-ion batteries offering more capacity and life.

Lastly both models still come equipped with a HEPA air filtration system to prevent viruses and bacteria from entering the cabin.

Differences between the Model X and Model S

The first feature the Model X can boast over its predecessor is its doors. The current Model X comes with self presenting and closing front doors as well as Falcon Wing rear doors. The latter provide easier access to the second and possible third row seats of the interior another feature available solely on the Model X and Model Y SUV.

In addition to the extra seats the Model X hosts a best in its class cargo space of 88 cubic feet. Its cargo space is quite a bit larger than the 28 cubic feet of extra room in the Tesla Model S. The Model X also comes with a tow hitch standard capable of pulling up to 5000 lbs.

The best feature on the Model S is its tri-motor Plaid option offering the very best in range and speed.

Overall the Model S and Model X share many of the same included features sure to offer any driver comfort and intuitive functions. That being said the Model X has more to offer in terms of additional features and upgrades all inside and out of a much larger interior.

Prices

Of course performance comfort and an interior loaded with features are all important when choosing an EV like a Tesla. More often than not however you quickly find yourself wondering how much does a Tesla cost?

The bottom line may be particularly important when comparing a Model S to a Model X since these two EVs are hands down the most expensive options in Tesla’s current fleet.

Below is a detailed breakdown of each trim to offer the full spectrum of how little or how much each of these Teslas can cost.

Please note: None of the prices include destination or documentation fees taxes or federal tax rebates.

Model X

Starting with the Model X Long Range trim the most basic model including white paint and zero added features starts at $94990. If you were to add all the most expensive additional features including red paint custom interior 22″ Turbine Wheels and full self-driving capabilities (FSD) the price jumps to $121490.

Note that this price includes the six-seat interior (most expensive option) for $6500. The seven-seat option would be $3000 less while the five seat interior comes standard.

The new Plaid trim picks up just above where the high end Long Range version left off at $119990 and can go as high as $146490 including the same wheels and six-seat captain’s chair interior.

For full perspective the most basic bare bones Model X will cost you almost $95000 and can go as high as $147000 all in.

Model S

Compared to the Model X Tesla’s Model S starts at a slightly lower price and can quickly hockey stick upward as you add more performance.

Starting with the Long Range trim this Model S starts at a purchase price of $84990 completely standard. If you were to add each and every additional feature such as the red paint 21″ Arachnid Wheels custom interior and FSD capabilities for an additional $10000 you’re looking at a price of $98990. We’re just getting started on price tags too we haven’t gotten to the Plaid yet.

For a brand new white Plaid Model S with only the included features you’re looking at $129990 off the bat. Adding all available features including the add-ons above and 21″ Arachnid Wheels the Plaid Model S can cost $148990.

That’s really only $2000 more than the fully-loaded Model X Plaid. To offer additional texture you could use that money to purchase three brand new Model 3 Standard Range Plus Teslas and still have nearly $28000 leftover for upgrades.

Which to choose: Tesla Model S or the Model X?

Overall these are Tesla’s longest produced vehicles for a reason. Both helped make the automaker a household name and provide the luxury and performance many other EVs have yet to match.

In terms of overall performance the Model S in any trim stands on its own. Head to head the Model S won on paper in nearly every category except price and cargo space offering more performance value for your dollar.

That being said the Model X SUV sits as a close second especially after this latest refresh. It offers impressive performance on a larger and heavier vehicle.

The Model X is also a clear winner in additional features tendering Falcon Wing doors best in class cargo space and multiple seating options to fit five to seven passengers.

If your preference is performance (particularly speed) the Model S is the better bet. However if you prefer to get behind the wheel of an EV that can haul a lot of cargo and/or passengers while still providing great range and speed the Model X is a no brainer.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was the David versus Goliath story. Activist investor engine number one waged a war with oil and gas giant Exxon Mobile and won. It gained three board seats something that would not have happened without the support of big investors BlackRock Vanguard and State Street. In a statement BlackRock said We believe more needs to be done. Exxon's long term strategy on reducing climate risk. At the same time Exxon was particularly vulnerable to this sort of pressure. Exxon has the vision of the world where fossil fuels are profitable in the long term and it sort of has refused to commit to zero out emissions. But that really stands in contrast to European rivals and other companies that are moving in a different direction moving in a different direction towards not zero as the main goal of engine number one. Where other bigger hedge funds had failed engine number one managed to effect change with capital worth just fifty million dollars. We spoke to CEO Jennifer Grant CEO about the campaign from an Exxon perspective. Our campaign at Exxon led by Charlie Penner at engine number one was about making sure the board had the right capabilities to understand how to manage every aspect of the company including how the company remains a great company through the energy transition. So I guess I would say about the current news cycle that we look forward to the new directors joining the board and the company managing for the future. Acknowledging some of the changes and transformations that have to happen there. And if I step back we built engine number one specifically because we see a real link between the impacts the company makes on workers and society and the community but also on climate and the environment on the long term financial value of these companies. But it's not just DAX on fresh off the firm's successful campaign. They're launching a new ETF to keep pressure on big public companies on ESG. One thing that we can do in engine number one is we can do an economic and impact oriented proxy campaign an activist campaign like what we did with Exxon and we launched the vote ETF. There's a little clue in the name there and we gave it the ticker vote. We launched this ETF because it's a way for people to stay invested in these big public companies over time. And then we as the manager will vote very actively. Shareholder activism may be increasingly a way for investors to turn up the heat on companies engine number one founder Charlie Tyner told Bloomberg. If you can get Exxon to change everybody else my industry has to listen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjIyNWJhdG9ucm91Z2UuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZXhjaXRpbmctb3Bwb3J0dW5pdGllcy1zdGFuZG91dC1zdHVkZW50cy10aHJpdmUtcGFpZC1pbnRlcm5zaGlwLXN1bW1lci1zcG9uc29yZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exciting opportunities: Standout students thrive in paid internship this summer [Sponsored],"Sponsored by ExxonMobil

ExxonMobil Baton Rouge has long been essential to the economic political and social landscapes of the community. This year ExxonMobil hired six graduating and incoming high school seniors as paid interns to introduce them to quality high-demand industry craft careers. Student interns are able to achieve craft certifications while working toward their high school degrees. This new approach to summer internships which is the first of its kind for ExxonMobil’s U.S. Gulf Coast sites is designed to provide students with a pathway into ExxonMobil and other industry careers.

“Our industry is full of opportunities for those seeking high-paying high-skilled craft careers and we are excited to share these opportunities with our Baton Rouge high school students” says ExxonMobil Baton Rouge Refinery Manager Dave Oldreive.“ We look forward to their success and to providing even more workforce development and career opportunities in Baton Rouge.”

During the eight-week summer internship students work with ExxonMobil craft specialists and mentors to explore career options like millwright electrician pipefitter welder and process technician. The students enthusiastically agree that the internship experience has been rewarding. “I realize now that my electrical engineering classes teach me the concepts” says intern Jakobi Davis. “I plan to continue summer internships like this through college to apply what I learn and keep growing.”

Broadmoor student Zariel Woods has been working with the analyzer group monitoring data from operations throughout the refinery. “I was originally planning to study nursing” Zariel says. “This internship has shown me how many different career paths exist at ExxonMobil and in the industry. After this summer I want to take more engineering classes!”

CREATING A CAREER PIPELINE

Beyond high school students can pursue an industry craft career in ExxonMobil’s North Baton Rouge Industrial Training Initiative (NBRITI). Graduating its sixth class of 37 electrical millwright pipefitting and welding students the initiative has produced over 300 graduates since 2012. Graduates receive National Center for Construction Education and Research (NCCER) Core Level I and Level II certifications through the free fast-tracked program. About 85 percent of NBRITI graduates are hired after completing the year-long training.

NBRITI is a collaborative effort between ExxonMobil and Baton Rouge Community College. NBRITI’s flexible 52-week program boasts 20 contractor partners—mostly in the industry but expanding to include small business city government and more. Sponsors include ExxonMobil Herb and Maxine Jacobs Foundation Excel Group Cajun Industries ISC Turner Industries Performance Contractors Jacobs Engineering Pala Group Triad Brock Group Geo Heat Exchangers Stupp Corporation GBRIA Associated Builders and Contractors and Employ BR.

“Also of significance in the quarter was the continuing market recovery which obviously underpins our results. As you will hear the organization remains very focused on continuing to leverage the changes we’ve implemented over the last several years and on delivering the plans we’ve discussed with you in March” ExxonMobil’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods yesterday told the company’s second quarter (Q2) Earnings Call.

“Earnings excluding identified items were (US)$4.7 billion an increase of approximately (US)$2 billion versus the first quarter primarily due to higher prices or margins and strong reliability…” Vice President of Investor Relations Stephen Littleton noted during the call.

Explaining that its operations in the Permian an oil-and-gas-producing area located in West Texas and the adjoining area of southeastern New Mexico are delivering positive free cash flow across a broad range of price scenarios Senior Vice President Jack Williams said this could see double-digit returns with a production cost of US$35 a barrel or less. He added that “the same low price resiliency” also applies to the deepwater developments in Guyana and Brazil.

On its Guyana operations he noted that the company has added three new discoveries since the first quarter including two at Whiptail announced this week.

“This additional resource will add to the 9 billion oil-equivalent barrels we discussed at Investor Day further increasing our confidence in the resource size and quality in the area east of Liza and supporting our view of an ultimate block-wide footprint of seven to 10 developments” he said.

He noted that the projects in progress remain on schedule with the expected arrival of the Liza Phase 2 Unity FPSO in Guyanese waters early in the fourth quarter

Payara the third major development on the Stabroek Block is on track for a 2024 start-up with topsides construction ongoing.

And pending government approval the company said that it was “targeting a final investment decision on Yellowtail” the fourth major development later this year with start-up planned for 2025.

And while the company has flared huge amounts of gas this year contributing to a large carbon footprint for Guyana ExxonMobil announced that in this quarter it signed an MOU to explore the development of carbon dioxide (CO2) infrastructure to help decarbonize the industrial basin in the Normandy region of France and an MOU to participate in the recently announced Acorn carbon capture project in Scotland. The collaboration in the Normandy region of France seeks to develop carbon capture technology with the objective of reducing CO2 emissions by up to 3 million metric tons per year by 2030.

Houston hub

“We are continuing to pursue several Gulf Coast opportunities including our Houston hub concept which are all gaining industry and third-party support. In addition to carbon capture and storage we’re advancing a number of options to produce low-emissions biofuels. These include new projects repurposing existing refinery units co-processing bio feeds and purchase agreements. These plans would enable the production of more than 40000 barrels per day of low-emission fuels by 2025.We also recently completed a successful trial to co-process bio feed across our existing refining circuit. Co-processing bio feeds is a key technology that can be rapidly scaled to help society quickly lower emissions provided the right policies are in place” Woods said.

As the company continues to advocate for new policies such as a carbon tax or low carbon fuel standard and develop future projects Woods said that ExxonMobil continues “to lead the industry in developing and deploying new technologies to address another important issue reducing methane emissions. To that end we have conducted more than 23000 leak surveys on more than 5 million components at over 9500 locations.”

ExxonMobil according to Woods is also the first company to file an application with the United States’ Environmental Protection Agency to use airplanes equipped with methane detection technology to conduct large flyover inspections and they are evaluating satellite technology in support of its 2025 reduction plans for both methane intensity and absolute methane emissions.

“These ongoing efforts to commercialize Low Carbon Solutions and reduce emissions are central to our long-term plan to grow shareholder value. As markets and policies continue to evolve we will be there playing our part contributing where we bring the most value” he said.

In the near term as we begin the development of next year’s plan our organization is focused on continuing to deliver industry-leading operating performance building on last year’s record results in safety and reliability and extending our trend of annual reductions in emissions intensity by accelerating the pace of reductions and establishing more aggressive objectives. This will enable us to reduce our own emissions at a pace faster than what the countries have committed to under the Paris Agreement. It will also help accelerate our objective of industry leadership in greenhouse gas performance by the end of the decade” he added.

Though it made these commitments yesterday ExxonMobil has raised the ire of local environmentalists by flaring in excess of 14 Billion Standard Cubic Feet (Bcf) of gas here this year from its Liza-1 well offshore as a result of faulty gas compression equipment. The environmentalists have argued that the government and regulatory authorities have been lenient with the oil company and had agreed only a paltry fine for flaring in excess of 14 Billion Standard Cubic Feet.

Meanwhile ExxonMobil last evening announced that flaring here had been cut to a minimum. In a post on its Facebook page it said “The full gas compression system on the Liza Destiny FPSO is now operating. We are currently reinjecting and consuming more than 96 percent of the gas produced. Production Manager Mike Ryan said the team continues to perform maintenance and optimization activities with the aim of keeping the flash gas compressor on-line and minimizing flaring until arrival of the new flash gas compressor at the end of the year”.

ExxonMobil is also embarking with the Guyana Government on a gas-to-shore-to-energy project which has raised environmental concerns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJzc25ld3MubmV0L2J1c2luZXNzLzg3MTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dhaka seeks US-investment in off shore's oil gas exploration | Business,"DHAKA Aug 1 2021 (BSS) - Adviser to the Prime Minister on Power

Is That the Fed's Problem? (Published 2021),"Robert S. Kaplan the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has been nervously eyeing the housing market as he ponders the path ahead for monetary policy. Home prices are rising at a double-digit pace this year. The typical house in and around the city he calls home sold for $306031 in June of this year Zillow estimates up from $261710 a year earlier.

Several of Mr. Kaplan’s colleagues harbor similar concerns. They are worried that the housing boom could end up looking like a bubble one that threatens financial stability. And some fret that the central bank’s big bond purchases could be helping to inflate it.

“It’s making me nervous that you’ve got this incipient housing bubble with anecdotal reports backed up by a lot of the data” James Bullard the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis said during a call with reporters Friday. He doesn’t think things are at crisis levels yet but he believes the Fed should avoid fueling the situation further. “We got in so much trouble with the housing bubble in the mid-2000s.”

Policymakers don’t need to look far to see escalating prices because housing is growing more expensive nearly everywhere. Buying a typical home in Boise Idaho cost about $469000 in June up from $335000 a year ago based on Zillow estimates of local housing values. A typical house in Boone N.C. is worth $362000 up from $269000. Prices nationally have risen 15 percent over the past year Zillow’s data shows in line with the closely watched S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index of home prices which rose a record 16.6 percent in the year through May.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Rusmaldy Jiminez-Hiciano and Erick Rodriguez set aside packages of high-end electronics repackaged them in new boxes and printed new FedEx shipping labels to send them to accomplices’ addresses a federal indictment states.

From October 2017 to May 2018 Jiminez-Hiciano and Rodriguez rerouted packages containing 1000 Apple iPads 912 Apple Series One watches and 285 Nintendo switches altogether worth more than $2 million the indictment states.

According to the indictment:

Jiminez-Hiciano and Rodriguez worked at the Walmart E-Commerce Distribution Center in the 2700 block of Commerce Center Boulevard. They unloaded items from incoming trucks moved them to secured appropriate storage locations for separation and repackaging and loaded them onto outgoing trucks.

The two men set aside targeted packages in unsecured out-of-the-way locations then later took the packages from those locations and reboxed relabeled and rerouted them. They sent about 55 packages that weighed 50-150 pounds.

They used one accomplice’s FedEX account to print the address labels and rerouted the packages to that person’s and another accomplice’s addresses in Allentown. FedEx and Walmart intercepted a delivery in May 2018 before it reached one of the addresses.

They’re charged with four counts of mail fraud.

The indictment orders Jiminez-Hiciano and Rodriguez to forfeit “all property real or personal which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to such offenses.”

With a market capitalization of $8.9 billion First Solar is amongst the top three solar manufacturers globally and its new facility in India will be its third venture in the Asian market.

However the company has not clarified whether it will be utilizing the central government's Rs 4500 crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to augment the solar manufacturing sector in India.

Moreover it hasn't been defined if the 3.3 GW facility will be segregated into producing solar cells or models.

""(India) is an inherently sustainable market underpinned by a growing economy and appetite for energy with a well-defined goal that will need over 25 GW of solar to be deployed every year for the next nine years"" First Solar CEO Mark Widmar was quoted in a report by The Economic Times.

Further Widmar added that India has also coupled its clean energy targets and efficient trade and industrial policy to empower self-sufficient domestic manufacturing and proper energy security.

""India stands apart in the decisiveness of its response to China's strategy of state-subsidized global dominance of the crystalline silicon solar supply chain. The country's comprehensive approach provides precisely the kind of level playing field needed for non-Chinese solar manufacturers to compete on their own merits and should be a template for other like minded nations"" the CEO said.

In June another US-based company CubicPV had declared its plans to establish a manufacturing unit in India. These recent measures augur well for the government's objective of achieving about 450 GW of renewable power by 2030.

The central government has taken active measures to reinforce the domestic manufacturing market by introducing the PLI initiative on ten critical sectors.

Of that Rs 4500 crore has been designated for the solar module manufacturers for five years. As per this scheme manufacturers will gain based on the efficiency and indigenous component of their panels.

To augur domestic production the government will raise basic customs duty on imports of solar modules to 40 per cent from the beginning of FY23.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1YW5jb2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3L3JlbmV3YWJsZXMtZ2VuZXJhdGVkLWVsZWN0cmljaXR5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Renewables for first time on Record generated more Electricity than either Coal or Nuclear in US in 2020: EIA,"Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) – The Energy Information Administration the primary authority in the federal government on energy numbers concludes that renewables primarily hydro wind and solar rose to become 21% of electricity generation in the US in 2020.

This is the first time on record that renewables were the second-largest generator of electricity in the U.S.

Renewables overall increased 9% between 2019 and 2020. About half of US clean energy now comes from solar and wind and the other half from hydroelectric power.

Wind generation increased by 14%.

Solar rocketed up even more with utility-scale solar projects of 1 megawatt or more growing by 26%.

Small-scale solar such as rooftop installations like the one we have increased by 19%.

The Clean Power Association says that America put in 26 gigawatts of renewables electricity plants in 2020 — 80% more than in 2019 — bringing total US renewables capacity to 170 gigawatts.

In the US some 78% of all new electricity generation was from wind and solar which are clearly the future of the American grid.

American renewables beat out coal now only 19% and nuclear at 20%. Coal is dirty and expensive and coal power plants have been replaced in droves by wind farms and by natural gas. It was the largest generator of electricity in the US until 2016 and has gone into a tailspin because renewables and natural gas are much cheaper.



h/t EIA

Natural gas which is only half as carbon intensive as coal is now the leading generator of electricity in the US at some 40%.

Coal electricity generation fell 20% from 2019 to 2020.

Between renewables and nuclear 41% of American electricity generation is now low-carbon or no-carbon.

While the increase clean gigawattage is impressive in American terms China added 136 gigawatts of new renewables capacity in 2020 dwarfing the US effort. This massive lead that China has in wind and solar translates into advantages in manufacturing distribution and sales of equipment like solar panels. The US for all that it is finally making some strides is going way too slow if it wants to be a leader in these industries and if it wants to do its part to keep global heating below an extra 3.6 degrees F.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vZXNhaHViYmxlLm9yZy93b3JkYmFuay9leG9wbGFuZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exoplanet | ESA/Hubble,"

Exoplanet

An exoplanet is a planet that is located outside our Solar System.

While there is currently no formal agreement on what exactly defines an exoplanet the word is used to indicate planet-sized bodies that are located beyond our Solar System. By convention exoplanets have sufficient mass to maintain a roughly spherical shape but not so much mass that nuclear fusion is triggered in them (as is the case for stars). They might orbit one star a pair of stars or multiple stars — or not orbit a star at all. The categorisation of exoplanets is also not formalised but certain categories are typically used including Hot Jupiters Super Earths and Mini Neptunes. The discovery of the first exoplanet was only confirmed in 1992 when two exoplanets were discovered orbiting a pulsar.

While not one of its original science goals Hubble has made a name for itself as an exoplanet explorer — in particular by studying the atmospheres of exoplanets. The chemical makeup of a planet’s atmosphere leaves a unique fingerprint on the starlight that passes through it which Hubble can study.

In 2001 astronomers using Hubble announced the first direct detection of the atmosphere of a planet orbiting a star outside our Solar System. The planet orbits a yellow Sun-like star called HD 209458 located 150 light-years away. The planet was not seen directly by Hubble. Rather the presence of sodium as well as evaporating hydrogen oxygen and carbon was detected in light filtered through the planet's atmosphere when it passed in front of its star as seen from Earth. These observations demonstrated that it is possible with Hubble and other telescopes to measure the chemical makeup of alien planet atmospheres and to search for the chemical markers of life beyond Earth.

In 2008 Hubble detected the first organic molecule on an exoplanet. This breakthrough was an important step towards one day identifying signs of life on a planet outside our Solar System. Hubble found the tell-tale signature of the molecule methane in the atmosphere of the Jupiter-sized exoplanet HD 189733b. Although methane has been detected on most of the planets in our Solar System this was the first time any organic molecule was detected on a world orbiting another star.

In 2019 in an exciting discovery Hubble data were used to detect water vapour in the atmosphere of a super-Earth within the habitable zone of its host star. K2-18b which is eight times the mass of Earth is now the only planet orbiting a star outside the Solar System or exoplanet known to have both water and temperatures that could support life.

“India is an inherently sustainable market underpinned by a growing economy and appetite for energy with a well-defined goal that will need over 25000 MW of solar to be deployed every year for the next nine years” said Mark Widmar chief executive officer First Solar.

If it receives incentives from the Centre the facility is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2023 the company said.

First Solar did not specify the scheme under which it is expecting incentives.

To ramp up domestic manufacturing the Union Cabinet has already approved the introduction of production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme in 10 key sectors under which Rs 4500 crore has been earmarked for Indian solar module manufacturers for a five-year period.

Domestic developers have preferred to import cheaper equipment mostly from China to build solar plants in the country. To boost domestic manufacturing the Centre had imposed a 25% safeguard duty on solar imports from China and Malaysia in July 2018 for two years which was extended till July 2021 at a rate of 15%. From the beginning of FY23 solar module imports will attract a basic customs duty of 40%.

Hyderabad-based Premier Energies recently said it intends to invest around Rs 1200 crore in the next two years to expand its solar module and cell manufacturing capacity and the planned unit will be considered for bidding for incentives under the PLI scheme.

Kolkata-headquartered Vikram Solar has also said it plans to “add another 3000 MW of integrated module cell and wafer manufacturing capacity in the next five years” which might be considered for PLI after “critical deliberations on the tenets of the scheme”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA4LTAxL25zdy1zb3V0aC1jb2FzdC1lbWVyZ2luZy1hcy1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZS1lbmVyZ3ktaHViLzEwMDMyOTIwNNIBKGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDAzMjkyMDQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hello poo-powered dairies goodbye recycling bins: The region emerging as a green hub,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-01/nsw-south-coast-emerging-as-alternative-energy-hub/100329204 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA4LTAxL25zdy1zb3V0aC1jb2FzdC1lbWVyZ2luZy1hcy1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZS1lbmVyZ3ktaHViLzEwMDMyOTIwNNIBKGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDAzMjkyMDQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

But the plan is meeting early resistance (Google).

CLICK IMAGES TO ENLARGE THEM

A parking lot with nearly 2000 parking spaces is proposed to be built on 18 acres of downtown lakefront land with parking spaces being placed right up next to the water’s edge of Lake Erie. That’s according to a building permit application submitted to the city this past week on behalf of the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission.

The application drafted by Osborn Engineering proposes to add 1175 parking spaces to the 775 spaces that are already existing along and immediately north of Erieside Avenue and First Energy Stadium home of the Cleveland Browns. The total number of parking spaces would be 1950 if the application is approved by the city’s Building Department.

Existing parking on the site is located more than 300 feet away from the water’s edge and for the most part was used by a smattering of workers at the Port of Cleveland stadium employees and visitors to North Coast Harbor. The existing and proposed parking lot land is owned by the City of Cleveland.

But most of the spaces were placed there for use by fans and workers attending eight regular season and one or two preseason Cleveland Browns football games per year. That is how the additional spaces are proposed to be used too.

Site plan for the parking lot expansion north of First Energy Stadium seen at bottom. Lake Erie is on the north. Port of Cleveland property is on the left and the Steamship William G. Mather Museum is at the right. This site plan was spread across two pages that were combined electronically for clarity (Osborne).

Neither Meredith Painter director of marketing and communications or Marketing Coordinator Rachel Gill both at the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission responded to requests for comments and additional information prior to publication of this article. However both acknowledged receiving the e-mailed requests.

In the permit application to the city Jon-Michael Lemon director of civil engineering at Osborn Engineering wrote “We are planning to restripe a large portion of the existing parking lot north of Erieside.”

However much of the site proposed for the additional parking spaces was never a parking lot. Until this winter there were two vacant port warehouses on the city-owned land. They were demolished their foundations removed and the site paved to host a temporary stage and support facilities for the National Football League’s 2021 Draft to select eligible players to play professional football.

Osborn Engineering estimated the cost of adding the 1175 parking spaces to the downtown lakefront at about $80000 according to the permit application. The parking lot is proposed to be “temporary” as the Haslam family owners of the Cleveland Browns are proposing a major redevelopment of the lakefront. Osborn is part of the redevelopment team. The Haslam’s Harbor Development Plan includes new housing offices hotels restaurants retail and public spaces.

In April the National Football League erected this temporary stage on the downtown lakefront where the proposed parking lot is now proposed to go. The stage and its ancillary structures were kept only briefly used for the football draft from April 29 to May 1 (NFL).

But some in the city and among lakefront advocates said such plans are years away from being realized. Instead they wondered why a temporary greenspace wasn’t proposed instead of a temporary parking lot. They vowed to fight the proposed parking expansion.

“Generally using our waterfront for parking is a terrible idea” said Ward 3 City Councilman Kerry McCormack whose ward includes downtown. “I would hope that we are trying to correct this type of use (surface parking) that we already have too much of in Cleveland.”

Dick Clough executive board chair of the Green Ribbon Coalition which promotes public access to and use of the lakefront responded angrily to the idea of putting a parking lot on the downtown waterfront.

“It just amazes me that we would devote prime lakefront land for eight Browns dates versus developing a public park that could be enjoyed every day during three seasons” Clough said. “As usual it’s a complete lack of vision and a huge missed opportunity.”

Proposed by the Haslam family which owns the Cleveland Browns football team this Harbor Development Plan would transform the downtown lakefront. But it will be years at best before this plan can be realized. Thus any “temporary” changes to the lakefront may remain for a long time (Browns).

He suggested that the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission should partner with the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) to encourage Browns fans to use public transportation to attend Browns games thereby reducing the parking needs.

Clough pointed out that the $80000 proposed to be spent on expanding the parking lot with 1175 parking could instead buy GCRTA day passes for 2000 fans for eight Browns regular season home games. Or they could sell the passes at a discount and make them last for two or more seasons he said.

“We could recreate the Donald Gray Gardens on that site” Clough added referring to a public gardens that existing on the north side of the old Cleveland Municipal Stadium that stood where First Energy Stadium is now.

“A great lakefront does not include dedicating prime land with lake access for a giant parking lot used for a few hours on a few days” Clough said. “We’re awaiting the implementation of the recently announced Browns Harbor Development Plan which is probably five or 10 years down the road. In the meantime the only temporary thing we should be creating is a public green space on the real estate north of the stadium.”

Giannis Antetokounmpo returned home to Athens bearing the NBA trophy on Sunday saying he was still “thirsty for victory”.

“It’s an addictive feeling to be a champion and we want to experience it again” Giannis who was accompanied by his brother and Milwaukee Bucks teammate Thanasis said at a short press conference at Athens airport.

Their triumph sparked joy and pride of Greek fans media and political leaders.

Giannis said he was “happy to bring the cup home” and promised to take the trophies to the working-class neighbourhoods of Sepolia and Zografou where he grew up.

The son of Nigerian immigrants who arrived in Greece in 1991 Giannis was born and raised in poverty in Sepolia a poor suburb of Athens.

“All our lives we saw our parents working they never stopped. We also strive to become better and better we work hard to do that” he said looking at his brother.

“I don’t know what the ceiling is for me but I know that tomorrow I will go back to the stadium I will train to be the best I can be.”

Giannis Antetokounmpo became a father in 2020 and his partner Mariah Riddlesprigger is expecting their second child.

He said that while he wanted to “relive those incredible moments” of victory he added that “the most emotional moment of my life was when I became a father”.

“No title can replace that emotion and I’m about to relive it in a while with the birth of my second child” he said.

In a complaint filed on Wednesday with the Federal Maritime Commission Easton Pennsylvania-based MCS Industries a maker of household furnishings also accuses China’s COSCO Shipping Lines Switzerland’s MSC Mediterranean Shipping and their competitors in the Asia-U.S. trans-Pacific trade of violating the U.S. Shipping Act since the beginning of the pandemic while increasing profits at the expense of their customers.

“MCS has experienced this misconduct by global ocean carriers firsthand as they have unreasonably refused to deal and negotiate with MCS” the company stated in its complaint. “In a stark break from pre-pandemic practice several ocean carriers refused to negotiate or provide service contracts to MCS and those that did provide such service contracts including Respondents [COSCO and MSC] refused to provide more than a fraction of the cargo capacity that MCS requested and needs despite the fact that the Respondents overall have continued to operate at or near pre-pandemic capacity.”

To make matters worse MCS states COSCO and MSC “then proceeded to engage in a common practice of refusing to perform even under those limited service contracts instead forcing MCS to buy space on the inflated spot market.”

We love pickups and no more so than the big boys that allow us to pack up our tools our lunch our water jug and our work crew and hitch up a trailer filled with livestock construction supplies or a John Deere 4066M. Modern - and 1-ton trucks support our electronics devices and wrap us in hushed comfort and high-tech safety.

And for all their width height mass and power they're a hoot to drive.

""The Ford F-350 King Ranch Super Duty is a monster of a truck. It takes a large step to get into and you sit high up enough to stare down at just about everyone"" said the Magnificent JJ also known as the world's best son-in-law Jonathan Justice.

""Being able to look into the cab of an 18-wheeler while passing is a strange but fun experience.""

Riding with the big boys

Ford let us play with a King Ranch Edition F-350 4x4. Base price is $62810 but our tester came with a 6.7L V-8 Power Stroke V-8 diesel ($10495) 12500-lb Warin© winch ($3000) Tremor off-road package ($3975) Tough© spray-in liner $595 and 397-amp alternator that's not a misprint.

Seriously 397 amps. Doesn't that options list just fire off your Tim-the-Tool-Man grunt?

That brought the delivered price to a shade less than $83000. We tried to spec out a similar RAM 3500 and it came in at $81000 but did not include a winch.

The Ford's rear-leaf-spring setup means it will never be as smooth as Ram's coil-over-shock one. If all you've known is the leaf springs of a Ford or GM truck the ride engineering of today's versions will feel sophisticated. And it is.

Just ask JJ.

""Despite the truck's bulk the turbocharged 6.7L diesel responds smoothly whether taking off or accelerating on the highway"" he said. ""Massive tires gobble up the road and while you will feel the shake and bumps of rougher roads it is an enjoyable way to travel.""

We kept finding things to drag around with this beast. The Pro Backup Assist standard on King Ranch trim is a thing of wonder: Just look in the backup camera lift off the brake and twist the dial in the direction you want the trailer to go. The doggone truck figures out the rest.

I'm as confounded by that as I am by a thermos jug: It keeps hot things hot and cold things cold but how does it know? That's almost as smart as the Ram engineers who eventually figured out how to copycat Ford's system.

Put in a gooseneck and the F-350 4x4 can tow 34700 lbs. That's more than 17 tons. The Ram 3500 4x4 will pull 37100 lbs.

Once underway the F-350 quickly demonstrates competence.

""With blind-side warnings on oversized telescoping tow mirrors it is easy to see what is around you without worry"" explained the J-Man.

Cabin-cruiser luxury

JJ may not be old enough to remember when pickup trucks came with rubber mats an AM radio and roll-down windows but I do. It seems incongruous to compare internal luxury rich fine materials sexy designs advanced electronics and careful craftsmanship are now de rigueur.

General Motors which also commits the cardinal sin of being less reliable still lines interiors with cheap plastics in design motifs created when Archie Griffin was winning Heisman Trophies look it up JJ but everyone else is offering large screens ambient lighting and switches and gauges galore. JJ and his always stylish wife the lovely Alyssa my favorite daughter of all time basked in the F-350's luxury.

""The truck feels almost like a tank when you are in and driving but it is the smoothest quickest responding tank ever"" he said. ""Comforts like heated and cooled leather seats ease the way. The backup camera and 360-degree view make parking and backing a breeze.

""In the meantime wireless charging Ford Sync and Android Auto make the experience smooth for listening to music books or our favorite podcasts"" he added.

""You feel like you could take on just about anything in it and be secure.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlYXJwYXRyb2wuY29tL2NhcnMvYTM3MDQ4Mzc4L2ZvcmQtbXVzdGFuZy1tYWNoLWUtY29sb2duZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford Goes Full 'Sex Panther' With New Mustang Mach-E Cologne,"Ford now makes a fragrance. Not Tom Ford mind you — the Ford Motor Company.

The Ford of Europe division — which for the record is based in Cologne Germany — revealed a fragrance it’s calling “Mach Eau“ at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. The scent a collaboration with fragrance consultancy Olfiction is meant to channel the “evocative smells of petrol cars” to soften the transition to the all-electric Mustang Mach E.

According to Ford the scent of gasoline is more popular than wine or cheese. And we’re told gasoline and exhaust notes are working their way into other fragrances. But Ford assures us the fragrance does not just smell like gasoline.

The full description sounds more than a bit Sex Panther-ish: “Mach-Eau is designed to please the nose of any wearer; a high-end fragrance that fuses smoky accords aspects of rubber and even an ‘animal’ element to give a nod to the Mustang heritage.”

Christopher Ison

Now we’re not fragrance experts here at the Motoring Desk. So we consulted our colleagues over at the Gear Patrol Style desk to get their thoughts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhZ2VydHkuY29tL21lZGlhL29waW5pb24vMTk3My1tZXJjdXJ5LW1vbnRlZ28tbXgtYnJvdWdoYW0tbWF4aW11bS1taWRzaXplL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1973 Mercury Montego MX Brougham: Maximum Midsize,"Once upon a time in America consumers could purchase a vehicle that wasn’t only available as a minivan pickup or crossover. While there are still some outliers here and there in 2021 motor vehicles they are rapidly shrinking. It seems like everybody and their dog wants a crossover and the more tortured the sheetmetal the better. But I digress. Anyway nothing could have been further from the truth in 1973 when this baby blue midsizer—full size or beyond by today’s standards—came off the assembly line.

Yes Mercury. Always the bridesmaid and never the bride. Ford got the fun stuff like the Bronco the pickups and the Mustang. Lincoln got the full zoot luxury treatment with Continentals Marks and Cavalry-twill vinyl roofs. Mercury for most of its life was caught in between. But it still made some interesting attractive and decent-selling cars—cars like the Cougar Marquis and Montego.

The Montego first appeared as the top-of-the-line midsized Mercury in 1968. Replacing the Comet nameplate almost entirely (only a single bargain-basement priced Comet remained; the rest were Montegos) it shared a redesigned body with its corporate sibling the Ford Fairlane along with its fancier Torino version. Like most domestic cars back then the Montego was available as a coupe sedan station wagon and convertible.

The basic ’68 body returned for 1969 primarily with new grilles and taillights to differentiate them but 1970–71 Montegos got new sheetmetal with a prominent pointy nose that proved vulnerable to parking mishaps. For 1972 an all-new Montego appeared.

As was the custom it was larger and quieter than its predecessors. Trim levels remained base Montego Montego MX and top-of-the-line Montego MX Brougham. A new fastback body style was added available as a Montego GT while the two-door hardtop could be had with a sporty Cyclone option package.

For 1973 the model year of today’s featured car Montegos mostly stayed the same with the exception of the federally mandated 5-mph front bumper. These so-called park-bench bumpers went on every new 1973 car but on many Ford Motor Company models they were particularly—ahem—noticeable.

The top model remained the MX Brougham available as a $3189 sedan $3209 coupe or $3606 Villager station wagon (that equates to $17575 $17685 and $19875 today). For comparison’s sake a base Montego coupe would have had a base price of $2926 ($16125). The midlevel MX coupe ran $3041 ($16759). A 250-cubic-inch straight six was standard on coupes and sedans; wagons got the tried and true 302 V-8. The Montegos rode a 114-inch wheelbase except for wagons which had a 118-inch span.

MX Brougham were differentiated from lesser Montegos by a flight bench front seat bright chrome upper body moldings deluxe wheel covers and a woodgrain-trimmed steering wheel along with the expected Brougham emblems. Popular options included air conditioning dual sport racing side view mirrors a vinyl roof luxury wheel covers (as seen on our featured car they cost an extra $17.64) and SelectShift automatic transmission.

Optional engines depending on the model included a 137-horsepower two-barrel 302 V-8; 161-hp two-barrel 351 V-8; 248-horse Cobra Jet 351 V-8; 168-hp two-barrel 400 V-8; and a 201-horse 429 V-8. The gas crisis in late 1973 had yet to appear and gas was still cheap. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Montego with the 250 six although I don’t see very many Montegos in the first place.

But I did see this most excellent nearly showroom-condition coupe back in 2014. I was in Davenport Iowa running errands and it was sitting at a repair shop with a For Sale sign in the window. As usual I had to stop immediately park and check it out.

I have a soft spot for these 1972–76 Montegos and their Gran Torino brethren because my dad’s first company car was bronze metallic 1973 Gran Torino four-door sedan.

At the time he also had a green 1960 Porsche 356B Roadster. A more different pair of cars would be hard to find!

As for the Montego it lasted through the 1976 model year with few changes save a matching biggie 5-mph rear bumper which was added in ’74. In 1977 both the Gran Torino and Montego got new more squared-off sheetmetal and were renamed the LTD II and Cougar respectively. As for that super nice ’73 coupe I have yet to see it again. All I can do is hope it went to the right home; it was a beaut!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvbmV3LTIwMjEtZm9yZC1icm9uY28tbWljLWhhcmR0b3AtcmF0dGxlcy1oZWFkbGluZXItaXMtYWxyZWFkeS1wZWVsaW5nLW9mZi0xNjY0MDEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New 2021 Ford Bronco MIC Hardtop Rattles Headliner Is Already Peeling Off,“We did have that kind of popping sound the second we picked it up” said Roman Mica. “I’m really not impressed with the quality at all on this one” added Tommy Mica referring to the felt-like headliner that is peeling off in many places. Adding insult to injury the senior discovers a sponge-like thing on the driver’s side of the roof which appears to be a makeshift way of suppressing the rattling/popping sound the hardtop makes while driving.As much as I love the sixth-generation Bronco - and I really do because it has forced Jeep to improve the Wrangler - this clearly isn’t a $63200 truck. Worse still for the Ford Motor Company’s golden goose there’s another set of strange noises coming from somewhere out back on the passenger side.Instead of going to the dealership and fix these problems under warranty The Fast Lane decided on another solution. More specifically Roman intends to give Bestop a call and see if they can sell TFL a good ol’ soft-top roof.To be honest I don’t blame Roman and Tommy for taking a sledgehammer approach to fixing this infuriating problem. There are dozens of Broncos parked at the Michigan Assembly Plant with “bad roof” written on the side windows and many customers have complained about a snakeskin pattern appearing on the outer laminate layer. Bronco customers have also reported misaligned latches raw outside edges etching in the glass warping around the mounting bolts cavities as well as… wait for it… headliner separation.Given these worrying circumstances waiting for the 2022 or even 2023 model year seems like the best way of getting a higher-quality Bronco

Here we are breaking down how to do a Costume or Cosplay of Ryan Reynold’s Free Guy.

Free Guy opens in U.S. theaters on August 13 2021.

Free Guy

Guy is a bank teller who discovers he is actually a background player in an open-world video game. He then decides to become the hero of his own story.

Guy played by Ryan Reynolds is a creature of habit. He has the same daily routine and has never done or accomplished anything extraordinary. Outgoing and perpetually cheerful but a tad naïve. Guy’s signature looks include a light blue shirt and khaki pants. Those looks have some variation to them. Reynolds credits his wife actress Blake Lively for the inspiration.

“I was looking to find a way to make Guy look and feel very real and grounded within his world but also iconic at the same time which is a tough thing to do” Reynolds explains. “We had him changing his outfit every day like everyone else in every other movie and then it was Blake who said we should think about a Halloween costume. So I started thinking about Guy through the lens of trick-or-treaters and Halloween and people dressing up and asked myself ‘What is something that everyone would just immediately recognize?’ and the blue shirt and khaki pants sort of stuck.”

Reynolds continues “From then on we stopped calling him Guy and started referring to him as the blue shirt guy which is even more of a generic thing to call somebody who doesn’t have an inner world or identity or anything which spoke to his journey as well.”

How to do a Bank Teller Free Guy Costume or Cosplay

Guy’s (Ryan Reynolds) bank teller look consists of a light blue button-down short-sleeved shirt with a chest pocket and beige-colored khaki pants. The shirt has white buttons and one chest pocket. Above the chest pocket Guy is wearing his bank teller name badge. The name badge is very simple it is a solid blue rectangle name badge with white lettering that says “Guy”. He has a wheat-colored tie with dark blue light blue and white stripes. The tie is being held to the shirt with a dull-colored gold tie clip.

Some extra accessories you could add are the belt and the glasses. One important distinction to point out is the fact that he wears a series of different glasses throughout the film. The belt is a woven belt with a square buckle. The buckle appears to be a silver color. The belt has one brown belt loop and a brown tip at the edge.

Finding these items online

Finding the screen-accurate items may be difficult. Many times costume designers buy items like this in bulk from ordinary retail shops (they need plenty for filming and for stunt doubles) or they have items custom-made. Costume designer Marlene Stewart has not as far as we know revealed the details of how to get these items. We have compiled a list of items that we think will work well for costumes and cosplays. Please note that Temple of Geek does earn a commission on some (not all) of these items.

The trip was remarkable to watch followed by the exciting celebration after landing.

But where did this all take place?

A small town situated between the beautiful Guadalupe Mountains called Van Horn Texas.

Image 1 of 3

Bezos celebrated the quaint town saying ""I also want to thank the town of Van Horn. This is a small and amazing little town. And you know we're making a dent in it. And we appreciate you for allowing us to be part of your town"" said Bezos after completing his 10 min trip to outer space on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket.

Bezos’ Blue Origin flight had been in the works for over a decade which makes us wonder why did he choose Van Horn Texas of all places?

BLUE ORIGIN ALREADY HAS $100M IN PRIVATE SALES AND 2 MORE HUMAN MISSIONS SET FOR THIS YEAR

The town is situated in West Texas located right off Interstate 10 with a population of a little over 2000. It is 458 miles from Austin Texas the lone star state’s capital and about 30 miles from the Mexico border.

In the mid-2000s Bezos actually bought more than 150k acres of land just 25 miles away from Van Horn thinking the land was perfect for designing and testing rocket engines according to NewsWest9.

Bezos also interviewed with a local newspaper back in 2005 where he expressed his desire for land in West Texas. He mentioned that as a young boy he spent his summers in South Texas at his grandfather’s ranch.

In terms of Van Horn he felt it was secluded and away from heavily populated areas making it the perfect spot to test rockets.

RETIRED ASTRONAUT ON BEZOS' BLUE ORIGIN LAUNCH: THE DOOR OF PRIVATE TOURISM SPACE FLIGHT OPEN

Only a short drive away from Guadalupe Mountains National Park the town's economy relies heavily on tourism. A little bit further about 60 miles to the north is Big Bend and Carlsbad Caverns as well as an ancient barrier reef that includes the four highest peaks in Texas which also frequents tourists.

According to the Texas State Historical Association an estimated 10000 vehicles pass through the town on Interstate Highway 10 making stops in the town's hotels restaurants convenience stores and truck stops while on their way to other destinations.

Interestingly one famous visitor who frequented the town was football commentator John Madden who mentioned in Time Magazine a favorite Mexican restaurant in Van Horn according to TSHA.

Mayor of Van Horn Rebecca Brewster said ""our biggest driving force is the tourism dollar. We often plug ourselves as the crossroads of the Texas Mountain Trail"" Brewster continued. ""[Van Horn] can be your hub for all your adventures in far West Texas.""

Besides tourism the town’s residents are also known for working in ranching mining and irrigated farming. The oil industry plays an important role in the economy as well.

A member of Culberson County Van Horn sits in the Permian Basin which is known as North America’s premier crude-producing region making it an active spot for corporations involved in the oil industry including Chevron Corp. Apache Corp and Conocophillips according to Bloomberg.

Now with Jeff Bezos making his mark on the town it will be interesting to see the economic stimulus resulting from Blue Origin if any.

Housing is lacking in Van Horn and Blue Origin hasn't helped the problem.

The median home value in Van Horn is estimated at just over $247k according to Zillow but much of the available housing has been rented out to Blue Origin employees in recent years. Although the employees are trying to co-exist with the locals this has posed a problem for the townspeople who now lack housing options.

BLUE ORIGIN VIRGIN GALACTIC SPACEX HUBS COULD HELP BOOST LOCAL REAL ESTATE PRICES

Blue Origin employees have made an effort to fit into the small community many joining the local school board and the town council as well as becoming volunteer firefighters but most of these people are still seen as outsiders to Van Horn.

Blue Origin itself said it has helped bring in more than one million for the Van Horn community through grants to benefit the school district food bank and town infrastructure according to Bloomberg. It has also voiced its plan to support higher education and jobs skills funding.

Despite this Mayor Brewster said there was barely any input from the town’s residents on whether they approved of the launch site being in their home land NewsWest9 stated.

Back in 2005 when Bezos came to Van Horn to talk through the FAA permitting process the residents didn’t show much resistance to Bezos’ plans NewsWest9 continued and soon after Blue Origin’s spaceport was built.

Few jobs at the spaceport have actually went to local residents and many say they have no idea what even goes on at the launch site. Additionally some feel Blue Origin has actually hurt the town making them ineligible for state and federal grants due to the influx of Blue Origin workers Bloomberg stated.

Historically a quaint town born on the Texas and Pacific Railway Van Horn has now garnered international fame for better or worse. It will be interesting to see if space tourism is in the cards for this small town's economy and future.

Here we are breaking down how to do a Costume or Cosplay of Ryan Reynold’s Free Guy.

Free Guy opens in U.S. theaters on August 13 2021.

Free Guy

Guy is a bank teller who discovers he is actually a background player in an open-world video game. He then decides to become the hero of his own story.

Guy played by Ryan Reynolds is a creature of habit. He has the same daily routine and has never done or accomplished anything extraordinary. Outgoing and perpetually cheerful but a tad naïve. Guy’s signature looks include a light blue shirt and khaki pants. Those looks have some variation to them. Reynolds credits his wife actress Blake Lively for the inspiration.

“I was looking to find a way to make Guy look and feel very real and grounded within his world but also iconic at the same time which is a tough thing to do” Reynolds explains. “We had him changing his outfit every day like everyone else in every other movie and then it was Blake who said we should think about a Halloween costume. So I started thinking about Guy through the lens of trick-or-treaters and Halloween and people dressing up and asked myself ‘What is something that everyone would just immediately recognize?’ and the blue shirt and khaki pants sort of stuck.”

Reynolds continues “From then on we stopped calling him Guy and started referring to him as the blue shirt guy which is even more of a generic thing to call somebody who doesn’t have an inner world or identity or anything which spoke to his journey as well.”

How to do a Bank Teller Free Guy Costume or Cosplay

Guy’s (Ryan Reynolds) bank teller look consists of a light blue button-down short-sleeved shirt with a chest pocket and beige-colored khaki pants. The shirt has white buttons and one chest pocket. Above the chest pocket Guy is wearing his bank teller name badge. The name badge is very simple it is a solid blue rectangle name badge with white lettering that says “Guy”. He has a wheat-colored tie with dark blue light blue and white stripes. The tie is being held to the shirt with a dull-colored gold tie clip.

Some extra accessories you could add are the belt and the glasses. One important distinction to point out is the fact that he wears a series of different glasses throughout the film. The belt is a woven belt with a square buckle. The buckle appears to be a silver color. The belt has one brown belt loop and a brown tip at the edge.

Finding these items online

Finding the screen-accurate items may be difficult. Many times costume designers buy items like this in bulk from ordinary retail shops (they need plenty for filming and for stunt doubles) or they have items custom-made. Costume designer Marlene Stewart has not as far as we know revealed the details of how to get these items. We have compiled a list of items that we think will work well for costumes and cosplays. Please note that Temple of Geek does earn a commission on some (not all) of these items.

The trip was remarkable to watch followed by the exciting celebration after landing.

But where did this all take place?

A small town situated between the beautiful Guadalupe Mountains called Van Horn Texas.

Image 1 of 3

Bezos celebrated the quaint town saying ""I also want to thank the town of Van Horn. This is a small and amazing little town. And you know we're making a dent in it. And we appreciate you for allowing us to be part of your town"" said Bezos after completing his 10 min trip to outer space on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket.

Bezos’ Blue Origin flight had been in the works for over a decade which makes us wonder why did he choose Van Horn Texas of all places?

BLUE ORIGIN ALREADY HAS $100M IN PRIVATE SALES AND 2 MORE HUMAN MISSIONS SET FOR THIS YEAR

The town is situated in West Texas located right off Interstate 10 with a population of a little over 2000. It is 458 miles from Austin Texas the lone star state’s capital and about 30 miles from the Mexico border.

In the mid-2000s Bezos actually bought more than 150k acres of land just 25 miles away from Van Horn thinking the land was perfect for designing and testing rocket engines according to NewsWest9.

Bezos also interviewed with a local newspaper back in 2005 where he expressed his desire for land in West Texas. He mentioned that as a young boy he spent his summers in South Texas at his grandfather’s ranch.

In terms of Van Horn he felt it was secluded and away from heavily populated areas making it the perfect spot to test rockets.

RETIRED ASTRONAUT ON BEZOS' BLUE ORIGIN LAUNCH: THE DOOR OF PRIVATE TOURISM SPACE FLIGHT OPEN

Only a short drive away from Guadalupe Mountains National Park the town's economy relies heavily on tourism. A little bit further about 60 miles to the north is Big Bend and Carlsbad Caverns as well as an ancient barrier reef that includes the four highest peaks in Texas which also frequents tourists.

According to the Texas State Historical Association an estimated 10000 vehicles pass through the town on Interstate Highway 10 making stops in the town's hotels restaurants convenience stores and truck stops while on their way to other destinations.

Interestingly one famous visitor who frequented the town was football commentator John Madden who mentioned in Time Magazine a favorite Mexican restaurant in Van Horn according to TSHA.

Mayor of Van Horn Rebecca Brewster said ""our biggest driving force is the tourism dollar. We often plug ourselves as the crossroads of the Texas Mountain Trail"" Brewster continued. ""[Van Horn] can be your hub for all your adventures in far West Texas.""

Besides tourism the town’s residents are also known for working in ranching mining and irrigated farming. The oil industry plays an important role in the economy as well.

A member of Culberson County Van Horn sits in the Permian Basin which is known as North America’s premier crude-producing region making it an active spot for corporations involved in the oil industry including Chevron Corp. Apache Corp and Conocophillips according to Bloomberg.

Now with Jeff Bezos making his mark on the town it will be interesting to see the economic stimulus resulting from Blue Origin if any.

Housing is lacking in Van Horn and Blue Origin hasn't helped the problem.

The median home value in Van Horn is estimated at just over $247k according to Zillow but much of the available housing has been rented out to Blue Origin employees in recent years. Although the employees are trying to co-exist with the locals this has posed a problem for the townspeople who now lack housing options.

BLUE ORIGIN VIRGIN GALACTIC SPACEX HUBS COULD HELP BOOST LOCAL REAL ESTATE PRICES

Blue Origin employees have made an effort to fit into the small community many joining the local school board and the town council as well as becoming volunteer firefighters but most of these people are still seen as outsiders to Van Horn.

Blue Origin itself said it has helped bring in more than one million for the Van Horn community through grants to benefit the school district food bank and town infrastructure according to Bloomberg. It has also voiced its plan to support higher education and jobs skills funding.

Despite this Mayor Brewster said there was barely any input from the town’s residents on whether they approved of the launch site being in their home land NewsWest9 stated.

Back in 2005 when Bezos came to Van Horn to talk through the FAA permitting process the residents didn’t show much resistance to Bezos’ plans NewsWest9 continued and soon after Blue Origin’s spaceport was built.

Few jobs at the spaceport have actually went to local residents and many say they have no idea what even goes on at the launch site. Additionally some feel Blue Origin has actually hurt the town making them ineligible for state and federal grants due to the influx of Blue Origin workers Bloomberg stated.

Historically a quaint town born on the Texas and Pacific Railway Van Horn has now garnered international fame for better or worse. It will be interesting to see if space tourism is in the cards for this small town's economy and future.

Find out more about how we review and recommend products.

Garmin’s reputation for making top-quality sports watches was well established before the arrival of the original Venu – but that was the device that signalled a serious move towards making attractive fitness smartwatches. The Venu broadly succeeded by putting Garmin’s sports tracking in a more desirable-looking watch with a vibrant and colourful AMOLED touchscreen while still offering three to four days of battery life. It had some worthwhile smart features too including music storage and proper Spotify integration (Fitbit’s smartwatches remain glorified remote controls) Garmin Pay and the Connect IQ app store though the latter is limited compared with the Apple or Google app stores.

With the Venu 2 Garmin hasn’t strayed too far from the formula of the original but has made some useful improvements. There are new health-tracking capabilities like more in-depth sleep tracking and fitness age which brings a metric buried in the Garmin Connect app to the watch.

Admittedly Fitness Age on the Venu 2 is also buried two menu screens deep where you’ll also find your VO2 max score but we’re hoping a widget – or “glance” as they’re called on the Venu – will turn up in time.

There’s also a new health snapshot mode which asks you to sit still for two minutes then returns information on your heart rate heart rate variability blood oxygen saturation stress levels and respiratory rate.

These new measurements are backed up by a new generation of Garmin’s Elevate heart rate sensor. The Elevate 4 intends to increase the accuracy of the optical heart rate tracking and pulse oximeter readings but we found the improvements on these fronts to be fairly small.

The watch also introduces new workout modes of which the most impressive is a HIIT training mode that includes preset timers for common HIIT sessions like Tabata EMOM (every minute on the minute) and AMRAP (as many rounds/reps as possible). You can also download guided HIIT workouts plus others like strength Pilates and yoga sessions from Garmin Connect to the watch and get on-screen animations to show you how to do the moves.

One feature I was pleased to see on the Venu 2 was an improvement in battery life. It’s listed as lasting up to 11 days in smartwatch mode (eight hours GPS plus music) compared with five days (six hours GPS plus music) for the original Venu.

However in practice I’ve not seen a drastic improvement. With the always-on screen activated and exercising outdoors a lot I had to charge it every three to four days. That was also with the screen set to medium brightness and even switching that to low mostly just got me four days.

I track outdoor activities with the GPS most days which does hit the battery life hard so you could probably get up to a week with runs or cycles every other day especially with the always-on screen set to off. However I still can’t see how the Venu 2 could last 11 days.

A legitimate battery improvement is the new fast charge feature which means 10 minutes of charging nets you a full day in watch mode or one hour of GPS plus music.

The Venu 2 comes in two sizes: the standard 1.3in (35mm) – larger than the original’s 1.2in (33mm) – and the Venu 2S at1.1in (28mm). The Venu 2S’s smaller size also means it has a shorter battery life than the Venu 2 at 10 days (seven hours GPS plus music) although both new watches have increased the storage available for music from 500 songs to 650.

I’ve also noticed a general improvement in the software on the Venu 2 which makes more use of the colourful screen than the original watch. The better graphics for everything from your widgets to the list of sports modes provides a more engaging experience.

In sports modes like running the screen becomes very basic with white numbers on a black background. When you set the screen to always-on this applies to activities too. However the screen is pretty dull until you turn it towards you and on my first run with the Venu 2 in bright sunshine it was impossible to read my stats until I turned my wrist and waited for it to brighten automatically. The gesture-to-wake function is pretty snappy but it’s not quite as easy to see your stats on the go as it is with either a normal sports watch or a brighter always-on display like the Apple Watch’s.

I had high hopes for the accuracy of the Venu 2’s heart rate tracking. The first run I did with it – a track session doing 8 x 1km reps – only raised those hopes further since the monitor tracked the rises and falls of my heart rate closely in line with a chest strap.

(Image credit: Unknown)

However since then the Venu 2 has regressed to more or less the standard level of accuracy I get from an optical monitor worn on the wrist which is to say not great. I’d regularly have inexplicable spikes or drops in my heart rate during runs and other activities which threw off my average and max readings for workouts. You can link up an external monitor via either Bluetooth or ANT+ and this will be worthwhile if you’re interested in using your heart rate to guide your exercise.

The Venu’s GPS accuracy seems to be a tad generous compared with other watches including other Garmins I’ve tested it against. However it’s generally within the margin of error and I think it’s OK for distance accuracy. For a regular track runner like me it’s disappointing that the Venu 2 doesn’t have Garmin’s Track Run sports mode which does produce more accurate results by locking on to the track.

The Venu 2 features the improved sleep tracking that was brought to watches like the Garmin Fenix 6 last year which includes a sleep score plus more details about your night’s rest on the watch itself. The data is well presented with a quick snapshot rating of your night plus a little more depth if you want it but like pretty much all other Garmin’s I’ve tested the Venu 2 consistently overestimated how much I’d slept. Periods spent watching TV or reading before dropping off are often given as light sleep and it would sometimes miss the times my daughter woke me up in the night too.

This data feeds into the Body Battery score on the watch which gives a simple rating out of 100 for how much energy you have based on stuff like your activity sleep and heart rate. It’s a nice idea but undermined a little by the optimistic sleep tracking which consistently had my Body Battery recharging to 100 even on nights where I slept poorly.

While it’s not a bona fide smartwatch like the Apple Watch mainly because the Connect IQ app store contains very few apps the Venu 2 does have all of Garmin’s smartest features on board. This includes music storage and the ability to link up with streaming services including Spotify so subscribers to those services can sync playlists over and listen to them offline plus contactless payments through Garmin Pay. You also get weather forecasts and smartphone notifications and while on iOS these notifications are one-way you can set up some replies to use on the watch if it’s paired with an Android phone.

Like its predecessor the Venu 2 is an attractive watch that brings Garmin’s sports tracking to a more appealing device with an AMOLED screen that’s a pleasing upgrade on the standard sports watch display. It’s a modest update on the original though even a little extra battery life is always welcome and the new HIIT mode is well done.

However one unwelcome change with the new watch is an increase in price. The Garmin Venu 2S costs £349.99 and the larger Venu 2 is £399.99 while the Venu is £329.99. This is despite the Venu 2’s inferior battery life and ease of use during activity compared with a sports watch like those in the Forerunner range. It’s also worth stating that the Venu 2 is no smarter than the original with regard to apps where true smartwatches like the Apple Watch Series 6 (from £379) leave it well behind.

Now I’ve arrived at a good place when it comes to recognizing and managing my condition but that certainly doesn’t stop it from impacting my daily life.

I’m far from alone in this – a 2016 report from the World Health Organization found that between 1990 and 2013 the number of people worldwide suffering from depression and/or anxiety increased by nearly 50% from 416 million to 615 million .

Of course some of this is down to population growth and greater awareness of mental health issues but there’s no doubt that now more than ever anxiety is on the rise.

For better or worse this is naturally a market that consumer tech companies want to tap into and which many already focus on – from Apple’s upcoming mindfulness revamp in the watchOS 8 update to the addition of stress and sleep tracking in the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 .

For myself and many others a telltale sign of anxiety is increased heart rate and heart palpitations and on an average day I’ll experience two or three periods of this at varying degrees of severity.

Most smartwatches include a heart rate monitor and this can be used for more than simply giving you feedback on your performance when you’re working out; and wearables are increasingly coming with stress level monitoring too.

I’ve been using the Garmin Forerunner 45 for a few months now to help me monitor my heart rate and stress levels and detect any patterns that emerge. Here’s what I’ve learned so far and how it’s already changed the way I operate day to day.

Heart rate and anxiety

Anxiety is the body’s natural response to a perceived threat but with an anxiety disorder these feelings are heightened and can be triggered by a wide variety of stimulants which can sometimes be irrational.

The knock-on effect of heightened anxiety is beyond mental fretting. Physically your autonomic nervous system (ANS) – also known as your fight or flight instinct – is triggered which can lead to physical reactions in the heart lungs digestive system and/or muscles.

It’s only been more recently that I’ve started to take these symptoms seriously as a way to both pre-empt upcoming panic attacks and identify stressors I could better avoid.

For example one of the first things I noticed about my heart rate was how rapidly and regularly it would increase before a meeting especially if I was headed to a session more than 30 minutes long.

By recognizing that my ‘10 minutes to go’ meeting notification triggered an irrational anxious response I’ve been able to create a routine that takes me away from my desk in the period prior to the meeting to make a drink freshen up and if I feel the need arrange my thoughts on paper. It’s not always possible but so far this ritual has decreased the regularity of pre-meeting heart rate spikes significantly.

While beats per minute (BPM) is a relatively straightforward metric to interpret – although not always accurate in smartwatches – stress indicators can be a little harder to unpack.

Some smartwatch producers vary in how they define stress level monitoring but most smartwatches use heart rate variability as an indirect indicator of how the body is doing.

Image 1 of 1

My Forerunner 45 and a number of other smartwatches use this metric to generate a ‘stress score’ which is presented as a number on a scale running from 0-100.

Again there’s a margin of error here – positive excitement can similarly trigger increased stress levels so I went into my next experiment with this in mind after doing some research.

Naturally throughout the day my stress levels would gradually increase but there were some interesting peaks and troughs. For example the last hour of my working day saw a significant spike in my stress levels which lasted all the way through to around 7pm.

This is usually around the time I start to look back on what I’ve done in a day and as someone who struggles with imposter syndrome I tend to get stressed about whether or not I’ve accomplished enough.

Seeing how the increase in my stress levels carried over beyond working hours and into my personal time made me realize just how much of an impact this particular anxiety was having on my day.

So instead of spending this time reflecting I now use the last part of my day to clear out small tasks and then start planning the next day’s workload.

Small though these changes may be I’ve noticed an overall improvement in my health and wellbeing as a result. My heart rate is now much more balanced throughout the day and as soon as I notice my stress levels starting to increase I know to take a step back and breathe before the anxiety really hits.

Too much of a good thing?

Smartwatches aren’t a cure-all for anxiety however. In fact they can sometimes add to stress levels. Increasingly reports are showing that BPM and stress level tracking can actually serve to heighten anxiety for many people.

A 2020 study from the University of Copenhagen investigating the clinical use of activity trackers in heart patients found that while their use drove overall lifestyle improvements and a better understanding of their illnesses anxiety levels also increased.

From increased paranoia around small potentially harmless bodily functions and changes to self-diagnosis from unrelated data that hasn’t been filtered through the medical lens there’s potential for smartwatches to do more harm than good.

The volume of data wearables can generate is immense but no replacement for clinical intervention (Image credit: Shutterstock)

This phenomenon is also recognized in studies of sleep too with orthosomnia – a medical term for an unhealthy obsession with getting perfect sleep – causing some smartwatch users to become addicted to sleep tracking.

Following heart rate and stress level patterns are also by no means a way to handle all types of anxiety or every instance of it. There were several occasions when I could feel my body gearing up its fight or flight responses while my smartwatch maintained my levels were normal.

Like most self-managed mental health strategies and practices using tech to monitor heart rate and stress levels is something worth trying but with a pinch of salt. While my experience with using a smartwatch for anxiety management equipped me with some new information on certain triggers in no way did it offer sufficient support or enough information to tear me away from my healthy relationship with doctors and therapists.

So while wearables and the health data they provide can be useful tools for many people they’re just a small part of a more comprehensive approach to managing and improving our wellbeing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZS1ibG9nLmNvbS9ydXNzaWFuLXBpbG90cy11c2UtdXMtbWFkZS1ncHMtcmVjZWl2ZXMtZHVyaW5nLWNvbWJhdC1taXNzaW9ucy1pbi1zeXJpYS_SAWVodHRwczovL2RlZmVuY2UtYmxvZy5jb20vcnVzc2lhbi1waWxvdHMtdXNlLXVzLW1hZGUtZ3BzLXJlY2VpdmVzLWR1cmluZy1jb21iYXQtbWlzc2lvbnMtaW4tc3lyaWEvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russian pilots use US-made GPS receivers during combat missions in Syria,"Russian military pilots use commercial GPS receivers during their combat operations in Syria according to Viktor Alksnis.

Recent images show the cockpit of the Russian Su-34 Fullback strike jet during combat missions in support of the Syrian Armed Forces in the north of the country. In the image Viktor Alksnis has spotted a commercial GPS receiver that was secured with a simple clamp in the cockpit of the Su-34.

Experts later determined that the photo shows a U.S.-manufactured GPS receiver developed by the Garmin company. Russian military pilots used the GPS receiver of Garmin’s popular entry-level eTrex Legend family.

Apparently the Russian military used an American GPS receiver to duplicate their onboard navigation systems which reportedly often malfunctioned in real combat conditions.

Garmin says that with its high-sensitivity WAAS-enabled GPS receiver eTrex Legend locates position quickly and precisely and maintains its GPS location even in heavy cover and deep canyons.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnQzLmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL2dhcm1pbi1hcHByb2FjaC16ODItcmFuZ2VmaW5kZXItcmV2aWV30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Approach Z82 Rangefinder review: the best of both worlds,"Here’s the Garmin Approach Z82 Rangefinder review in a sentence: this is one of the most technologically advanced pieces of golf kit out there and it would make for a quality addition to any golfer’s armoury. Unfortunately I don’t get paid (much) for one-sentence reviews so read on and I shall explain in more detail what this little marvel is capable of.

Rangefinders are one of the best gifts for golfers because even if no golfer needs one as such every golfer wants one. They are very much in vogue currently due to golf’s ‘powers that be’ allowing the pros to use them at the recent USPGA Championship. Usually they can only be used during practice rounds but in an attempt to speed up play the use of rangefinders was trialled at a major championship for the first time. It remains to be seen if this was just a one off or if it will eventually become the norm but it was fantastic publicity for the likes of Bushnell Garmin and other manufacturers of the product.

Garmin are best known for making some of the best golf watches money can buy but they also produce some other wonderful devices that make golf that little bit easier for both Sunday hacker and experienced club pro alike. The Approach Z82 is packed with useful features and much like the equally brilliant Garmin Approach S62 golf watch it makes for an invaluable companion out on the course.

So what is it that makes this device stand out from the competition? Let’s start with a little background. The Z82 is Garmin’s follow up to the highly successful Z80 which was the first device to combine GPS with Laser Rangefinder technology.

Since then other brands have gone down the ‘hybrid’ route but Garmin still leads the way and the Z82 took that cutting edge technology on to another level. This really is one of the most high end pieces of golf tech on the market.

Not all rangefinders are created equal though and the prices reflect that. They do all perform the same basic function which is you point it at the flag and it will tell you far away it is but the more high end models do much more than that and the Approach Z82 does a lot more than most.

Garmin Approach Z82: price and availability

The Approach Z82 is widely available in most golf retail outlets as well as online. You can also order direct from Garmin. Pricing is as follows:

Garmin Approach Z82: Features and functionality

The Approach Z82 is quite similar to the higher end Garmin GPS golf watches and shares many of the same features including score keeping course maps and shot tracking.

It’s simple to use as everything is controlled by three buttons. Two to navigate up and down through the menus and the other to select the desired option.

It comes pre-loaded with over 41000 courses and it provides a 2D map of each hole as you play it. It is accurate to a margin of nine inches from a distance of up to 450 yards. Impressive right?

You can use the Z82 as a stand alone device but pairing it via bluetooth with the Garmin app on your smartphone opens up a range of extra benefits including the capability of showing you where the wind is blowing from and how strong it is as well as being able to save your score and send various useful stats to your Garmin account.

Of course its primary function is to give you a precise distance to how far away the flag is but where the Z82 differs to most range finders is that it combines GPS technology with that simple ‘point and shoot’ aspect. Not only will it tell you how far away from the pin you are it will also show everything else you need to know about the hole you are playing.

A look into the view finder displays an enhanced view of what’s in front of you but also a 2D map overlay of the hole so you will be aware of any doglegs or hidden hazards as well as the distances to them. That’s just scratching the surface though this little beauty is packed with innovative features.

Stat tracking for instance which is available when paired with a compatible smartphone. This allows you to keep a record of your score and measure shot distances and you can even participate in weekly leaderboards with other Garmin users. I once had a third placed finish at my local course. Granted there were only two other Garmin users playing there that week but hey top three baby!

Driver distance is another feature that is also found on many of the Garmin watches. This comes in very handy on the course and is so simple to set up. Upon activation the device will ask you what your usual driving distance is so that when you look at the hole through the view finder an arc will show you where your ball is likely to go with a standard drive. So if there is a hazard in the fairway that might look out of reach to the naked eye a quick check with the Z82 will let you know if it’s safe to hit or if you need to drop down a club or two.

The Z82 also comes with a tournament mode option which is important for golfers who play in weekend competitions at their clubs. When playing competitively there are certain features on high end range finders and golf watches that are not permitted specifically the ‘Plays Like’ function which takes slope and wind into account when providing you with yardages.

Tournament mode deactivates those illegal features. An external indicator light lets you and your playing partners know when you’re in tournament mode so if you were thinking of cheating don’t!

I’ll elaborate further on ‘Plays Like’ though because features like this are what separates the best range finders from the rest. So how best to explain 'Plays Like'?

Ok so when you watch major golf tournaments on TV there are certain cool graphics that they’ll show to give you more information on the shot faced by the player. Phil Mickelson may be lining up his approach from the middle of the fairway and you’ll see a graphic showing you the wind speed and direction.

This adds to the viewing experience as it gives you more of an idea of what the player is facing. Well you can get that yourself when you look into the view finder on the Z82.

You do need to be connected to the Garmin app on your smartphone but the Z82 can then factor in the wind speed and direction in the yardages as well as the lay of the land to give you a true indication of the actual yardage of the shot you are facing and not just the official distance.

So for example 150 yards to an elevated green into a 15mph wind is not in reality a 150 yard shot. It plays much longer than that and may be more like 165 yards. This makes club selection tricky but the Z82 gives you both distances - the actual yardage and the ‘plays like’ yardage. Having this option is invaluable when playing in windy conditions but just remember to switch it off when playing your weekly medal!

Another nifty feature that is illegal in tournament play is ‘Pinpointer’ which is a compass that will show you exactly where the green is. This comes into its own when playing over trees or in any other situation when the green is not in view and you would otherwise be guessing. With ‘Pinpointer’ enabled you know exactly where to aim.

The Z82 comes with a USB charger and on a full charge you will get at least two full rounds (you may even get three) so it will meet all of your requirements even if you are on holiday and playing 36 holes a day. It also comes with a carbon fibre waterproof case with a drawstring for protection. There’s also a sturdy metal clip to fasten the device to your golf bag although there is a drawback to this which I will get to shortly.

Garmin Approach Z82: Performance

Full disclosure I prefer using a GPS watch so it took me a little while to get completely used to this device and everything it can do. It was only when I decided to leave the watch at home and fully committed to using the Z82 that I got a proper feel for it and realised that I didn't really need the watch at all. The Z82 had me covered.

I have used range finders before but nothing as advanced as the Z82 and my previous experience amounted to little more than just pointing at the flag to get a yardage. That's why having the numbers on my wrist has always been more desirable to me than constantly having to remove the device from my bag and scan the horizon looking for the pin. Watches offer so much more functionality than a basic laser device.

So I didn’t see any real benefit to using a range finder over a watch even though one of my regular playing partners swears by them and had been trying to convert me for a while. The Z82 succeeded where he failed and now I can absolutely see the attraction. I still prefer a watch but I had a lot of fun testing the Z82 and it has changed my view on rangefinders.

This will no doubt sound silly to anyone who doesn’t play the game but it made me feel like a better golfer than I actually am even though my score did not back that up. It’s like anything golf related really; when you’ve got the best gear it makes you feel more dare I say professional?

The truth is though that it’s only the higher calibre of golfer who need an exact yardage to the pin. For the rest of us numbers to the front middle and back are just fine most of the time. A scratch handicapper will know his exact yardage with each club down to an error margin of a couple of yards but for the less accomplished player the dispersion is much higher so a rough number is usually sufficient.

For instance if I hit a nine iron well I know it will carry somewhere between 125-130 yards whereas Tiger Woods will know his distance to within a few inches. So the better the player the more accurate the yardage needs to be. For most amateurs a GPS watch is fine most of the time but for the obsessive golfer who likes to have every little bit of information available prior to taking a shot the Z82 fits the bill perfectly.

There are also certain scenarios when a range finder will deliver for you in a way that even the best golf watch that money can buy simply cannot. I was testing out a golf watch last winter and it gave me the yardages to the front middle and back. The green was elevated with a bunker in front so it was impossible to see the location of the flag. I opted to go with the yardage to middle hit what I thought was a great shot right over the top of the flag only to discover when I got to the bunker that there was a temporary green and my ball had gone 50 yards past it. With a rangefinder that would never have happened.

It wasn’t a failing of the watch as golf courses are pre-loaded into these devices and if there are any temporary changes they obviously aren’t going to show up on the course map. A rangefinder removes that problem however as it doesn’t rely solely on pre-loaded maps. You are pointing at the actual flag regardless of where it is located so all yardages are spot on.

Garmin Z82: Some words of caution

(Image credit: Future)

The Z82 is a terrific device that offers all sorts of little extras you won’t find on the vast majority of range finders out there but beware if you attach it to your bag. Initially I used the device in the carry case and fastened it to the ring on my golf bag via the clip. Big mistake.

The location of the clip on the centre of the case caused it to hang at a 90 degree angle (see above photo) when I had the golf bag on my back and I had a huge scare halfway up the third fairway when I set the bag down went to reach for the Z82 only to discover an empty case! Oh no!!

I knew I had it when I was on the tee so it had to be somewhere along the third hole but I’d been in the trees following my tee shot (a regular occurrence) and if it had fallen out in there that was going to be the proverbial needle in a haystack scenario.

Panic was setting in but then I remembered there is a “find my Garmin” option on the smartphone app that fortunately I had enabled before using. I walked back towards the tee waiting for the app to finish buffering but thankfully in the meantime I spotted the little rascal lying in the middle of the fairway.

The ‘find my Garmin’ feature did eventually kick in as I reached it so at least I know that works.

The lesson learned here is always activate the ‘find my Garmin’ option and if you carry your golf bag keep the device in a sealed pocket rather than connecting it to the bag via the clip as it just isn't worth it.

I didn’t find any other negatives although if I was being super critical I could say that in relation to some other range finders the Z82 can be a fraction slower at locating the flag but we’re only talking a second at most here so it’s barely noticeable and certainly not a hinderance in any way.

It does take some time to fully get to grips with what it can do as unlike the more basic rangefinders this isn’t just a simple ‘point and shoot’ to get a distance to the flag. You can use it for so much more than that so obviously you need to familiarise yourself with the extra features and which ones you actually wish to use.

Garmin Approach Z82: Verdict

Let’s cut to the chase. Should you buy it? It all depends on your preference and your budget. Personally I still prefer using a GPS watch but if you’re a disciple of the rangefinder and you don’t mind paying for the best tech then absolutely you should invest in a Z82 as it’s one of the most technologically advanced pieces of golf equipment out there.

It really comes into its own on courses that you may not be too familiar with as it’s like having your own local caddie warning you of any hidden hazards and showing you the way on blind holes. On courses you know well you may not use all of the features the Z82 has to offer but it’s still reassuring to have them just in case.

If you only want to use the basics then a much cheaper device will meet your needs but for the obsessive golf nerd who wants to know everything about the shot they are facing this could be the device for you.

You can find cheaper alternatives that will do an excellent job but if you aren’t put off by the price you absolutely can’t go wrong with the Garmin Approach Z82 as in my humble opinion it’s one of the best of its kind and therefore justifies the lofty price tag.

You definitely won't be disappointed if you do invest in one and any golfer who you buy it as a gift for will love you forever.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy93aHktdGhlLWdhcm1pbi1pbnN0aW5jdC1zb2xhci1pcy1zdGlsbC1teS1hbGwtdGltZS1mYXZvcml0ZS1ydW5uaW5nLXdhdGNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the Garmin Instinct Solar is still my all-time favorite running watch,"One year ago Garmin released the Instinct Solar – a new version the chunky Instinct multi-sports watch with added Power Glass to stretch out its battery life. And after all that time and all the watches I've tested it's still my favorite.

I’m fortunate enough to be able to test a wide range of running watches and fitness trackers on TechRadar – from super-affordable entry-level activity bands through to top-end smartwatches equipped with advanced training tools. I always return review samples after testing but last year I tried a watch that I missed so much I bought my own shortly afterwards. It was the humble chunky Instinct Solar.

Here comes the sun

Garmin has introduced solar versions of its high-end Fenix 6 Enduro Quatix and Tactix lines in recent months along with the Instinct. Each is topped with Garmin’s Power Glass which harvests energy from the sun to keep the watch’s battery topped up and extend its life between charges. You’ll still need to charge your watch the regular way first but after that it’ll keep running for much longer than the regular Instinct with just a couple of hours of sunlight exposure each day.

The Instinct is the most frugal power-wise and in theory with the power-saving settings tweaked just so it could keep going indefinitely but in actual use you’re still looking at battery life measured in weeks rather than days.

The Garmin Instinct Solar has a chunky design but won't overwhelm smaller wrists (Image credit: Future)

Daylight from a window will do just fine but the Instinct Solar is built for getting outdoors and having fun. It’s not the most stylish watch Garmin makes by quite a large margin – in fact it’s fairly ugly compared to the likes of the Venu 2 or Fenix 6 – but it’s seriously rugged. I’ve taken it running cycling hiking paddleboarding and kayaking and despite taking some pretty hard knocks along the way it looks and works just like the day I unpacked it.

In fact it’s tougher than me – when I fell and broke my ankle in the Peak District it came away completely unscathed. Its stress monitoring app later informed me that I’d had ‘many stressful moments’ and should probably take it easier the following day.

Grayscale is A-OK

Much like its case the Instinct Solar's display isn’t the most attractive around (it’s a monochrome memory-in-pixel affair that helps conserve battery life) but despite lacking the glorious color and high resolution of Garmin watches like the Venu 2 or top-tier Forerunners it’s brilliant in its own way.

This is due to the dual-screen design with a small secondary display just large enough to show a number or an icon. You can pick which stat is shown here when the watch is idle (with options including date step count and temperature) but it really comes into its own when you’re browsing the Instinct Solar’s menus.

The Instinct Solar has no touchscreen; instead it's operated with a series of buttons that can be used with wet hands or while wearing gloves (Image credit: Future)

Like many rugged watches (the Coros Apex is another example) the Garmin Instinct Solar eschews a touchscreen in favor of physical controls that can be operated with wet hands or while wearing gloves. The upper right button performs dozens of different functions which could be a real headache to remember but the little secondary display always shows exactly what it will do in the current context.

It’s one of the watch’s biggest strengths though it could also have been of its greatest weaknesses as it means the Instinct Solar doesn’t support additional watch faces and apps downloaded through Garmin Connect IQ. Thankfully it has all the essentials I need in a running watch already – including great navigation tools.

Never walk alone

As you'd expect from a Garmin watch GPS is super accurate. It might have become synonymous with sports watches but this is a company that first made its name in marine navigation systems and whose first customer was the US Navy.

That particular tool has come into its own when I'm leading club runs. Following the same paths every week would make training seriously dull so it's important for me to come up with new routes to spice things up. That said there are few things more embarrassing than trying to memorize a route ahead of time only to miss a turning and have to sheepishly check my phone to see where I went wrong.

The Instinct Solar is super tough and mine has survived some serious knocks without a scratch (Image credit: Future)

With the Instinct Solar I can upload a route ahead of time and follow it with breadcrumb trails. The watch doesn't give super detailed maps but that's fine; the dual screen display makes it clear which direction to go and if something were to go wrong I could always use the TracBac feature to get the group back to the meeting point. This is also a handy tool for timed out-and-back runs.

It's far from flashy but the Instinct Solar still shines. If you're looking for a mid-range running watch then I highly recommend adding it to your shortlist."

Bash gave birth to twin girls on June 23 and with the support of family and others the couple is now navigating through double the fun of newborns.

Having twins isn’t new to the family. Bash’s husband has a twin brother Steve.

When the ultrasound revealed twins “we were so excited” she says. “We have wanted kids for so long it was double the blessing.”

While a pregnancy during a pandemic isn’t ideal for most couples Bash says everything worked out better than expected.

“It was nice — being isolated and pregnant” she reflects. “It was an easy pregnancy.”

They prepared for the twins with the typical baby showers but also a gender neutral-themed baby room.

“We didn’t find out the genders until they were born” Bash says. “We couldn’t go on a (planned) safari last year due to COVID-19. We decided to turn their room into a safari theme. We both are big into animals. It makes us happy every time we go into their room. We had a lot of fun with it.”

The twin girls Zayna (baby A) who Bash says “acts like it” and Zarina (baby B) had their names picked out by Queso their 1-year-old Cavadoodle (poodle and Cavalier Kings Charles mix) who she says is good with the twins.

“We had four or five — two boys and two girls names picked out” Bash says. They had Queso choose the names by plucking them out of a hat and those are the names he chose.

Zayna’s name means “beauty” and Zarina is “golden.”

Now that the babies have been home for a month the new family is developing a routine.

“You read all the books watch the videos and try to prepare as much as you can (before their birth) but nothing quite prepares you for feeding two babies at once.”

What has helped is having the babies on the same schedule and having breast milk pumped into bottles.

Bash says her twins were a few weeks early and are still practicing how to latch — something else that can be difficult to know until you have babies.

A lot of support from family and friends including a group called Westshore Mothers of Twins Club a nonprofit organization for parents of multiples has helped.

“It’s truly a special club — and to have that support and wisdom” Bash says.

Her mom Shehnaz has also been with her since the twins were born. “I would be lost without her” she says.

The twins’ personalities are starting to emerge which has been exciting for the family.

“Just looking at them grow day by day see their personality bloom they are very different girls” Bash says. “It’s a dream come true times two. It was a hard year for a lot of people and to have this light at the end of it has been great.”",,,,,,

They're calling it the ""Megadrought.""

Seven years ago in this space I profiled the drought that was baking California (and the companies working to combat it). It was California's worst drought in 500 years experts said at the time. But seven years later the worst has gotten even worse with 95% of the state experiencing ""severe drought"" conditions and 86% ""extreme.""

Things have gotten so bad that California's State Water Resources Control Board may vote on Aug. 3 to cut off water access to Central Valley farmers. Fires are breaking out across the parched state; the crowdsourced #FireMappers map shows literally dozens of blazes including the Dixie Fire which reached ""megafire"" status on Friday. No wonder the American Geophysical Union now says this seemingly endless drought is the most severe ""in the last 1200 years.""

And yet if you look at a map you'll see a very big (indeed an ocean-sized) potential solution to California's drought problems -- if only we can get the salt out.

The desalination solution

Through desalination oceanic salt water can be transformed into potable fresh water in either of two ways: You can boil it let the salt precipitate out and collect the condensation. Or you can filter the saltwater through a membrane to remove the salt.

It can be an expensive process. A gallon of potable water produced through desalination costs about twice what it costs to provide water from other sources. And yet this cost of desalination has fallen by half over the past 30 years -- meaning it's an increasingly viable solution. What's more when you consider the losses from not investing in desalination: California lost $5 billion in agricultural revenue from crops not grown during the last big drought from 2014 to 2015. That same $5 billion could have built five new desalination plants to help prevent the next drought.

In California nearly a dozen such desalination plants are already in operation (and 10 more are planned). The Carlsbad Desalination Plant -- still under construction when I last wrote about this drought -- has now been up and running for five years. Filtering 50 million gallons per day it's the largest desalination plant in the Western Hemisphere and supplies 7% of San Diego County's water.

Poseidon Water the company that built the Carlsbad plant is now planning to open a similar-sized plant in Huntington Beach -- albeit at a higher price. Carlsbad cost $1 billion but the Huntington Beach plant could cost $1.4 billion.

Seven desalination companies to invest in

Speaking of which investors looking to support (and profit from) the growing use of desalination technology to cure California's chronic droughts might want to start their search with Poseidon Water; according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence it's a subsidiary of the giant Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP 0.23%). With a $16 billion market capitalization but only $193 million in trailing profit Brookfield may not look like an attractive investment at first glance. But the company generated more than $1 billion in positive free cash flow (FCF) last year -- giving the stock an attractive valuation of 16 times FCF. Adding to the attraction Brookfield currently pays a generous dividend yield of 3.7%.

Brookfield is based in Bermuda and foreign companies tend to dominate the water desalination field. France's Veolia Environnement (VEOEY -0.03%) is the world's biggest desalination company having built more than 1950 reverse-osmosis desalination plants in 85 countries -- including the huge desalination plant in Sydney Australia that supplies 15% of that city's water. France's Suez Environnement (SZEVY) is No. 2 -- and earns a massive 23.4% EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) margin on its water business.

Among U.S. companies General Electric Company (GE -2.46%) remains one of the world's biggest suppliers of water treatment equipment. On Catalina Island southwest of Los Angeles GE built a 150000-gallons-per-day desalination plant for Southern California Edison a division of Edison International (EIX 0.17%). GE says the desalination process costs between $3 and $6 per 1000 gallons and that 70% of that cost is for fuel to operate the plants. However solar-powered desalination has the potential to cut that cost.

Speaking of energy costs you might also consider Energy Recovery Inc. (ERII 0.43%) which derives 77% of its revenue from reverse-osmosis desalination services. Through efficient operation the company says its flagship PX Pressure Exchanger ""saves water desalination customers approximately USD $2 billion annually in energy costs.""

Finally Ecolab (ECL -0.03%) based in Saint Paul Minnesota owns Aquatech International a Pennsylvania company specializing in water purification technology. It's a small subsidiary within a big company but still the 10th-biggest desalination company in the world. And it's part of Ecolab's largest and most profitable division (""global industrial"") where it contributes to that division's powerful 18.5% operating profit margin.

All of this goes to show: Even if drought poses a big problem in California desalination can be one (very profitable) way to solve it.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) these techniques are advancing the capabilities of cardiac MRI (CMR) to visualize a variety of different cardiac conditions and provide insights into underlying disease and cardiac dysfunction. CMR is frequently used because it provides clinicians with accurate anatomic information along with advanced soft tissue contrast. CMR is considered the reference standard for quantification of the cardiac chamber size and systolic function of the heart[1].

In a recent webinar hosted by Society of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) sponsored by GE Healthcare global experts in cardiology discussed clinical applications for CMR and their experiences using some of the newest AI technologies such as deep learning reconstruction in clinical cardiac MR practice. Alexander Hirsch MD PhD Assistant Professor and Principal Investigator of Cardiovascular MRI Imaging at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam Netherlands presented a number of cases to illustrate effective tissue characterization techniques using AI-enhanced image reconstruction including late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) T1 mapping and T2 mapping. Shreyas Vasanawala MD PhD New Division Chief Associate Chair and Radiologist-in-Chief for Pediatric Radiology of Stanford University in California highlighted how deep learning reconstruction can improve the pediatric cardiac experience with rapid and automated approaches to scanning this population.

Improving myocardial tissue characterization with deep learning reconstruction

Myocardial fibrosis is a commonly seen result of many cardiomyopathies and its impact on the heart is a major independent predictor of adverse cardiac outcomes[2]. It is critical for these patients that their clinicians can accurately image and characterize myocardial tissue which offers them insight into disease etiologies and the extent and stage of patients’ diseases.

Sophisticated CMR techniques are now in clinical practice that can provide myocardial tissue characterization beyond just confirming the presence of myocardial fibrosis[3]. These myocardial tissue characterization techniques include LGE T1 mapping and T2 mapping which provide insight into the pathophysiological changes of the myocardium. These statistical parametric mapping techniques are image analysis tools that assesses the significance of blood flow changes in the myocardium.

Until now the use of these techniques has been hindered by long acquisition times inefficient protocol standardization relatively low spatial resolution and high costs[4].

However new software solutions using AI-enhanced reconstruction algorithms have accelerated the imaging acquisition times for statistical parametric mapping of the T1 T2 and also extracellular and cellular volume mapping and improved image quality achievable using LGE. Originally developed to image myocardial scarring gadolinium contrast is often used to image tissue in patients with acute myocardial infarction. LGE is a useful tool for scar detection based on differences in the volume of distribution of gadolinium over time. The increased amount of gadolinium can be demonstrated by T1-weighted imaging in the time period of ten to thirty minutes after the contrast is administered.

Using GE Healthcare’s AIRTM Recon DL for AI-enhanced image reconstruction based on deep learning neural networks Dr. Hirsch makes full use of patients’ complete raw imaging data sets for maximum image quality. The introduction of AI-enhanced image reconstruction improves the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio and offers ringing suppression that preserves fine image details helping address two common pain points for radiologists and technologists—image noise and ringing.

Dr. Hirsch presented some of the cases that were used in his recently published study in the European Journal of Radiology. The goal of the study was to assess the effects of using a deep learning-based reconstruction algorithm on LGE image quality and to evaluate its influence on scar quantification.

“In our study we looked at 60 patients with known or suspected cardiomyopathy that underwent CMR using free-breathing LGE. Thirty of these patients had scars ischemic heart disease or a non-ischemic heart disease and fibrosis. We first looked at the sharpness of the images specifically at the septum where the blood goes into the myocardium. You can clearly see the improvements in the images that were reconstructed using the deep learning reconstruction. There is a remarkable increase in image quality at 25 percent noise reduction and it further increases as you continue to increase noise reduction. What’s nice is that using the deep learning algorithm you have a tunable noise reduction where you can set the noise reduction [to high medium or low.] Using the deep learning reconstruction you can see that the image quality was clearly improved.”

Dr. Hirsch explained that his research team assessed the image quality of the deep learning reconstruction images set at a 75 percent noise reduction level versus standard LGE images. The AI images earned high scores from the team with eight percent excellent 59 percent very good and 26 percent good versus the non-deep learning enhanced reconstruction images with less than 1 percent excellent 33 percent very good 58 percent good. In 30 patients for ischemic heart disease scar size was also quantified on the LGE scans. The research team concluded that LGE image quality improved significantly using a deep learning-based reconstruction algorithm[5].

Dr. Hirsch concluded that deep learning image reconstruction could also be used for patients’ prognosis for diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis and it positively impacts patient scan time as well.

“The deep learning reconstruction improves image quality by increasing image sharpness and reducing noise and Gibb’s ringing but what’s also possible is that you reduce scan time for your patients.”

Advantages of AI in Pediatric Cardiac MRI

According to Dr. Shreyas Vasanawala there is a strong need for shortened scan times and efficient protocols in cardiac MRI especially for the pediatric patients. They have limited ability to cooperate in the exam for example holding still or holding their breath while holding still. For these reasons pediatric cardiac MRI exams are often performed while patients are sedated with anesthesia.

The first of two rapid and automated pediatric MRI approaches discussed by Dr. Vasanawala was volumetric imaging. The goal of these congenital heart exams is threefold:

defining segmental anatomy quantifying flow in various vessels and assessing the ventricular functions and size of the ventricles.

Dr. Vasanawala is able to achieve these goals in a single imaging sequence called the 4D flow scan.

“This volumetric approach the 4D flow scan” explained Dr. Vasanawala “is performed with contrast enhancement and it is comprehensive. You’ll see that it provides both function and flow as well as anatomy. And it’s great for technologists because the workflow is much simpler. You don’t have to have a detailed understanding of cardiac anatomy and even better you don’t have to have a detailed understanding of abnormal cardiac anatomy. Using deep learning image reconstruction you get a volumetric scan that covers the whole chest and after the fact you can retroactively reformat images to see any plane you want.”

Dr. Vasanawala highlighted a single sequence acquisition that provided the same information as obtained by doing numerous conventional lengthy scans. Looking at a short axis two chamber and four chamber views the AI automatically detects the landmarks of the heart and then performs the reformatting into these standard chamber views. He then illustrated the automation in vessel segmentation which is automatically calculated to determine the flow in those vessels.

He pointed out that he can also segment out the ventricles and determine their cardiac output and ejection fractions even in a case where the patient’s heart rate was exceptionally high at 150 beats per minute with very good image quality. He went on to explain the patient’s detailed cardiac anatomical findings and calculations as well.

“So if we look at this case” Dr. Vasanawala concluded “from this single sequence we’ve obtained the following information. We know there’s a D-transposition of the arteries. We know it’s a bicuspid pulmonic valve we saw the patient ductus arteriosus and quantified the flow through it. We also saw that inter-atrial communication and also quantified the flow through it. We got a great look at the rich aortic arch and the anomalous left subclavian and also quantified the shunt ratio as 4.3 and gave ejection fractions and the ventricular volume. So very nice quantitative exam from a single sequence that just covered the whole chest and did not require dedicated technologist training in cardiac MRI.”

Another approach Dr. Vasanawala discussed is conventional 2D imaging using AI for scanning and automated processing and using a method that is free breathing and therefore less taxing on the patient. The imaging approach focuses on automatically getting into the short axis plane quantifying ventricular volumes and ejection fractions as well as getting into the four-chamber view. Using a deep learning technique the system automatically moves from an axial localizer into a pseudo two-chamber view and then from there into a four-chamber view followed by a short-axis view.

Typically Dr. Vasanawala explained these images are obtained requiring multiple breath holds by the patient. Not only are they uncomfortable for the patient they can lead to inaccurate quantification of ejection fractions. He has been working with GE Healthcare to develop a new deep learning approach that allows for greatly accelerated acquisition* and at the same time allows for respiratory triggering of the slices of those acquisitions so there is no need for the patient to hold their breath.

Dr. Vasanawala and his team compiled a prospective study to review this approach.

“[On a] particular case this was accelerated 12-fold and what you see is if you just perform a simple zero-filled reconstruction it’s highly accelerated and you have a lot of artifacts. Using a fully sampled acquisition the images are high quality but you can even with a 12-fold acceleration use more advanced reconstruction techniques such as compressed sensing or deep learning reconstruction and you can recover the images quite nicely.”

When comparing the two advanced imaging techniques Dr. Vasanawala highlighted the superior performance of the deep learning approach.

“What really matters to us at the end of the day is our cardiac output and ejection fraction measurements” Dr. Vasanawala explained. “In an example of compressed sensing reconstruction and deep learning reconstruction you can see that the tightness of the agreement in terms of the left ventricular ejection fraction versus a fully sampled scan is much tighter with the deep learning approach.”

Deep learning’s compelling data and future potential in CMR applications

Advances in MRI technology as well as AI-based innovations in image reconstruction have enabled compelling results thus far. As these solutions become more widely used across different CMR applications they can provide clinicians with new insights into cardiac disease and treatments.

The clinical cases presented by Drs. Hirsch and Vasanawala illustrate the powerful improvements in image quality and in spatial resolution that were made possible using deep learning image reconstruction techniques. These innovations not only allow for improved image quality but also ease the training burden on technologists with standardized image protocols support a better patient experience with shortened exam times and automate many of the calculations radiologists need to diagnose cardiac disease.

As innovation in AI for CMR applications continues it has the potential to help clinicians detect abnormalities that are much more subtle than can be seen with the human eye and continue to support radiologists’ role as an essential diagnostician in cardiology.

Introducing the newest members of the workforce Generation Z (Gen Z). Gen Z sometimes referred to as zoomers is a demographic cohort of people born between the late 1990s to 2010¹. By 2025 Gen Z is estimated to take up about a third of the total Vietnamese workforce².

Vietnamese Gen Z face a widening skills gap as a result of entering into the workforce during a period of rapidly changing technologies. While young Vietnamese people are tech-savvy many lack formal technical training and soft skills that are necessary to keep up with the evolving demands of jobs created by the new digital economy.

In the latest in our series of interviews with luxury leaders Céline Assimon CEO of De Beers Jewellers and De Beers Forevermark shines a light on the brand’s strategies during the pandemic and how it is connecting with clients in a new era.

There are two big changes. First putting creativity back at the centre of our value proposition. It takes a long time to develop jewellery and high jewellery in particular but we were able to make changes and pivot really quickly bringing more pieces that are bolder and bigger and overall pieces that are more creative than what we had done in the past.

The second is going back to our core values: safety and another value that is at the core of who we are as a brand – not just De Beers Jewellers but the group in general – sustainability. In other words how do we go back to who we are as a jewellery house and communicate more about what we do? Sustainability is at the core of our value proposition; we want our diamonds to be worn with pride and when I joined the brand I thought that the brand had been a bit silent about the beautiful things that we are doing.

What makes De Beers appeal to Gen Z? Photo: De Beers

We are supporting communities and we maintain acres and acres of land in South Africa. Yes the [diamond] mining process definitely has an impact [on the environment] but [we think about] how we can mitigate the impact and turn it into something positive for the community.

How has De Beers embraced digital platforms to reach customers?

We have been selling quite a few designs during lockdown [including] an over 10 carat yellow diamond which is a pretty significant price point. Some of those pieces were sold through virtual appointments.

I think the jewellery industry in general was a bit reluctant across the board to embrace digitalisation and I think this was an obstacle that all of us leaders in the industry had in our heads. We were worried that we would not be able to sell high jewellery in the digital network [but] I think the lockdown really broke the bias because customers got used to using technology. So for me the physical and digital experience will work hand in hand in the customer journey no matter what the price point. I really believe in that now.

Is China’s contribution to De Beers similar to its global luxury market share – close to 50 per cent?

Yes absolutely. A lot of global initiatives are now born in China because the Chinese clientele are getting more mature and daring with their choices. The global pandemic made us think again about how we welcome our clients the time we dedicate to them and the quality of the experience that we give to them. I think for many brands being authentic became a priority.

We are working on an upgraded client experience that we are rolling out in the second half of this year and it is very exciting to put back the local clients at the core of what we do which is also for China.

Do you employ different strategies for China Asia and the rest of the world?

I would not say that we have a specific strategy for China. We pay a lot of attention to the Chinese market because it embraces new trends and technologies way before the Western markets. We have learned so much from trading in China – from opening [on] Tmall at the end of last year to the WeChat Mini Programme that we have had now for a while – and I also have to say that our retail footprint is bigger in China than anywhere else in the world. We opened (our first store in) China in 2011 and we have just opened our eighth store in Chengdu in May.

China is a place where we see trend setting a lot. We have noticed through our Chinese clients and our Chinese fans that romantic jewellery should not be limited to women. When we announced our global ambassador Cai (Xukun)  he brought a freshness to how fine jewellery and high jewellery is perceived in the West which is very interesting. In a way we leverage a lot of what is happening in the Chinese market with new trends and bold new ways of looking at jewellery and we translate that in the West as well.

So how are you connecting with the younger generation?

When we look at millennials and Gen Z we know that for them choosing a brand and a product that is meaningful and choosing a brand that is acting responsibly is very important. When the clients know they are buying a natural diamond [they are concerned with] traceability – knowing that your diamond is contributing positively to communities to conservation programmes where they are being discovered and knowing that your diamonds are fairly good investments.

How much gender equality do you see in the luxury industry?

We have many powerful female leaders in the De Beers group. There is a long list of women who have very powerful roles at De Beers so I am joining the ranks of a great group. It is true that when you look at the number of female CEOs and look specifically at the luxury [jewellery] industry there is a handful of us females. It starts with education promoting women and encouraging them to want more and to be ambitious in their careers.

The company which launched in 2012 will roll out its new name visual identity products and website this month.

The rebrand reflects the company’s recent innovations and technological transformations using AI predictive intelligence and linguistic-based predictive algorithms that scan the digital universe of billions of conversations. With 2300 languages 4.5 billion people 48 countries and billions of social conversations happening each day Asia is the new epicenter of social media however no specialised tool has been created to master and track this region until now. Next-gen intelligence systems are needed to stay up to speed with the constantly shifting landscape and anticipate what is coming down the track.

The new offer is designed to serve brands in an unprecedented era of content proliferation—especially as platforms in Asia continue to grow and time spent on social media continues to increase. Asia’s innovative and fast-moving social media ecosystem makes it one of the most complex and challenging regions to navigate for businesses—especially from a language and sentiment tracking point of view but also the most valuable from an insights perspective. As the region’s fragmented digital landscape evolves companies are increasingly looking for better ways to analyse and utilise the wealth of data available online for strategy business intelligence and audience insights.

Prerna Pant Co-Founder & COO of Radarr said: ‘We are moving beyond real-time analytics. Clients are much more sophisticated and want partners with tech stacks to match. Our clients no longer only want to know about what is currently happening in the digital space in real-time they also want a Radarr to see what is about to happen so that they can anticipate the opportunities and challenges that could make or break their businesses.’’

Ram Bhamidi Co- Founder & CEO of Radarr explained that “At the core of Radarr’s new offer is an intelligence platform that delves deep into the billions of conversations happening online to deliver digital monitoring and predictive analytics. Bespoke dashboards provide targeted intelligence on select areas such as crisis monitoring or influencer management whilst industry-centric dashboards on topics like Crypto and Gaming provide a bird’s-eye view of trends emerging across specific sectors. This intelligence informs actionable data-driven recommendations for brands enabling them to anticipate the future effectively and act rapidly.”

Pant continued: “Our international clients now view Asia as the epicentre of social media development and innovation. In order to build a strong global strategy we’re seeing more and more brands focus their attention on understanding what is happening here in the region and then building out as opposed to the old way of executing North American or European strategies in Asia. Being able to preempt developments and predict trends in the social media world is becoming critical for businesses and Asia is at the forefront of where that change is happening fastest.’’

Most recently the Singapore and Bengaluru-based company had announced its Pre-Series A funding led by Inflection Point Ventures and several high-profile investors from the US Singapore and India.

​Montréal 1 August 2021 – Mr. Juan Carlos Salazar of Colombia officially assumed the office of ICAO Secretary General today succeeding Dr. Fang Liu of China.





He assumes this role as CEO of the UN’s specialized agency for civil aviation as the international flight network continues to assure the efficient global movement of food vaccines e-commerce and other essential supplies and personnel despite the air transport industry still being severely confronted by COVID-19 greatly diminished routes and slowly rebounding international air travel and tourism.





“It is a great honour to be assuming this role at this time and to have the opportunity to help governments and ICAO play an important part in how this sector builds back better and recovers from the global pandemic” Mr. Salazar commented. “We are still facing some tremendous challenges to the restoration of global air connectivity today and with many regions and populations all over the world facing prolonged economic social and emotional hardship as a result.”





Secretary General Salazar is a former Director General of Civil Aviation for Colombia and speaks fluent Spanish English French and basic Arabic. He has more than 26 years of experience in civil aviation public policy and the management of large and complex organizations and plans to work closely with the ICAO Council to further strengthen the agency’s governance and ethical framework to review the organizational structure of the Secretariat to build a digital transformation programme and to modernize the working methods of the Organization to keep pace with aviation innovation.





He has also promised to further strengthen ICAO’s global presence through its Regional Offices and support for key regional priorities and to assure that special efforts are undertaken through the Organization to support developing States that have suffered the most devastating impacts of the pandemic. The Organization will further support Member States in the implementation of CORSIA and other capacity building activities aiming at carbon offsetting and initiatives for reducing emissions from international civil aviation.





“It’s important that ICAO remains a key partner for the countries of the world as they work with this agency to recover from the pandemic to share their skies to their mutual benefit and to continuously improve the global aviation standards and practices which keep those skies as safe secure efficient and sustainable as the world expects. I will also work to innovate internally and improve the efficiency by which ICAO performs its important standard-setting role and to assure that it continuously improves in helping governments industry and civil society advocates to effectively consult coordinate and achieve consensus together.”





Mr. Salazar was appointed ICAO Secretary General in February of this year by the ICAO Council after its comprehensive assessment of a number of international candidates.





“The ICAO Council is very pleased to welcome Mr. Salazar as he officially assumes his new role and as Council President I look forward to working closely with him in helping to modernize ICAO and make it a more responsive and efficient agency at the service of its 193 Member States” noted ICAO Council President Salvatore Sciacchitano. The President also extended the Council’s sincere appreciation to the previous ICAO Secretary General Dr. Fang Liu recognizing her dedication and contributions to ICAO during her two terms as Secretary General.

Baker’s nearly 20 years of experience in cyber leadership talent development and risk management in the aerospace and defense industry as CISO have taught him the importance of building a strong cyber community and fostering collaboration. That’s what he hopes to bring to the CISO Council.

Baker has had two jobs in his life. He started his career as a consultant with EY where he worked with a variety of clients across the defense retail banking and technology sectors — which included 12 years across General Dynamics’ businesses providing cyber and IT services.

“It was an unbelievable place to start a career and learn the value of teamwork the importance of effective communication and the essential nature of collaboration across large groups and global industries” Baker said.

When he came to GDIT as CISO in 2015 he was quickly invited to join a collaborative group of CISOs serving similar companies across the industry that shared common challenges. From day one this experience taught him the importance of collaboration across the CISO position and industrywide and that it shouldn’t be feared or held as a competitive advantage.

“It should be something in which we continue to support each other and build each other up for the common defense of our customers and our companies” he said.

Baker learned a lot from jumping into the role of CISO with a community of support and collaboration and found a similar atmosphere within GDIT. He described General Dynamics as a community in and of itself across many different companies that produce different products and services.

“I believe the career experience working within that community within our company provides a lot of expertise on managing large cyber risks across a diverse portfolio of companies cyber teams and business needs” Baker said. These experiences lay the foundation for how Baker engages with the council and the topics he wants to explore.

The nation has seen an unprecedented number of sophisticated cyber events over the past couple of years and to truly protect public sector customers’ information Baker believes industry and government must work together. He plans to discuss the recent SolarWinds hack in the effort to improve supply chain risk management and software supply chain practices.

In addition to recent incidents Baker also wants to discuss the growing threat of ransomware zero trust architectures and emerging government compliance frameworks.

“We also need to continue to focus on compliance aspects as well” Baker added. The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification and President Joe Biden’s recent cybersecurity executive order impacts all of GovCon and how it works to serve government customers.

Facilitating these discussions with the council goes back to building a sense of community within industry so members can get to know each other on a deeper level and feel comfortable reaching out to one another for assistance.

“Having that network is something that is extremely valuable to the CISO role” Baker said. “In this job you are striving every day to assess risk and apply capabilities as part of your cyber program. The ability to take a quick pause and talk to another team working towards the same goal or aligning with your customer about those expectations provides tremendous returns in ensuring our industry is continuously improving to meet our current threats.”

Cyber is a complicated subject matter; it’s highly evolving and capabilities and suppliers change daily. Making meaningful connections with peer companies helps to better understand customer expectations and roadmaps.

And because the government is setting the tone for national defense requirements and cybersecurity execution connecting with government officials is valuable.

“Anytime that we can get in front of our customers or other government officials to see where they’re going is another opportunity to validate that we are headed in the right direction with our own programs” Baker said.

To facilitate these connections Baker intends to foster a more social atmosphere in the council meetings and hold conversations that transcend cybersecurity tools and trends.

“We’re a fellowship as a group of people who experience the same stresses of the job and the same unique demands” Baker said. He wants to focus on the human elements of the CISO role like what it means to lead retain and drive a team within the D.C. GovCon market and how to foster a diverse and inclusive workforce.

Ultimately Baker’s end goal as CISO Council chair is to form a trusted community in which CISOs can feel comfortable asking their peers any question and hold transparent collaborative discussions. The nation is facing an adversary that is motivated highly funded and very sophisticated. A breach of one company is a breach of national security and according to Baker it takes a full industry effort to truly secure the nation.

“People who are in this group will feel supported in this highly demanding role and have a network of people to lean on when they need extra assurance or help with a certain problem regardless of company affiliation” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRheS5jb20vcGhvdG8tZ2FsbGVyaWVzLzIwMjEwNzMxL2VsZWN0cmljLWJvYXQtY2hyaXN0ZW5zLXZpcmdpbmlhLWNsYXNzLXN1Ym1hcmluZS1oeW1hbi1nLXJpY2tvdmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric Boat christens Virginia-class submarine Hyman G.

Undersecretary of the Navy James F. Geurts said construction of the new submarine during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a testament to the dedication of America’s shipbuilders and sailors.

“We did not close a shipyard public or private for one day during the pandemic” Geurts said. “The sustained commitment to excellence displayed by this workforce shows in the construction of this boat and adheres to the culture of excellence promoted by Hyman G. Rickover.”

Construction of the Navy’s 22nd Virginia-class submarine began in September 2015.

Electric Boat President Kevin Graney said despite the pandemic shipbuilders at the company’s Quonset Point facility in North Kingston Rhode Island constructed the engine room deck in 12000 fewer hours than five previous ships The Day of New London reported. Also the welded pipe joints were completed in Groton earlier than two previous ships."

It’s his sixth puzzle for The Times and his second Sunday crossword all from 2021 (you may remember “Karaoke Bars” which spun through some pop favorites). I think today’s puzzle is a lot of fun and I found it to be one of the more difficult big grids that we’ve had recently.

There’s a lot of off-kilter cluing in the fill for starters and the theme is limitless — as Mr. Stock says in his notes it’s one of those sets that looks full of possibilities until you figure out that it isn’t whether you're solving or constructing. I only got one theme entry without a majority of its squares filled; the rest I got backward with crosses. This is fine! It’s a good brainteaser and it brought to mind the “choice paralysis” that all of us capitalist rats deal with daily turned on its head.

Tricky Clues

This grid is strewn with loopy and crunchy elements that make the fill really fun. Loopy to me is a clue like “Qualification shorthand” — which makes me think of academic abbreviations on a résumé — solving to FWIW meaning “For what it’s worth” which I use when I dispense great advice that I know someone will never ever take. Crunchy entries include a lot of excellent trivia: interesting names of note botany and numismatics.

A $3 million donation by Nature Valley allowed the foundation to restore 10000 miles of national park trails over the past three years.

Through the initiative National Parks Foundation service corps crews were able to remove invasive species clear corridors repair structures and manage other repair projects to make 19 park trails across 16 states more accessible to visitors. Sites aided by the initiative include Yosemite National Park in California Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming and Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico.

“From admiring wildlife and landscapes to connecting with history and culture trails are such important and memorable elements of a national park experience for the 330 million people that visit each year” said Will Shafroth president and chief executive officer of the National Park Foundation. “Thanks to Nature Valley’s support we’re making it possible for visitors to explore even more as we continue our work together for the benefit of parks and people.”

To celebrate the project’s milestone Nature Valley partnered with musician and actor Daveed Diggs to rework the song “I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)” by The Proclaimers. A promotional video also was created to accompany the new version of the song and promote visits to national parks.

“We are delighted that these restored trails will enable more people to find solace or recharge in America’s treasured national parks and we hope the catchy remake of ‘I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)’ inspires more people to visit a park get outside and explore” said Kristin Atherton brand experience director Snacks & Natural/Organic General Mills.

Here's the history behind the tradition.,"The history behind the tradition of Olympians appearing on Wheaties boxes

It's the extra honor bestowed upon many Olympic athletes: After you win gold you may end up on a box of Wheaties.

At the 1976 Summer Olympic Games in Montreal Bruce – later Caitlyn – Jenner won gold in the decathlon and became a household name. Later that year Jenner received another coveted honor: being featured on a box of Wheaties cereal.

Scores of other top Olympic athletes have also shared that distinction. Now with the Tokyo Games entering their second week will any current Olympians be joining them?

Jon Nudi the president of North America Retail at General Mills said his marketing team is watching competitors go for gold in Japan in hopes of finding new box-cover stars.

""Clearly the Olympics are an exciting time in sports so we're certainly watching and seeing what's happening over there and which champions might emerge"" he told CBS News' Elaine Quijano. ""In the history of Wheaties we've actually had over 70 Olympians on the box.""

It's a big year for the cereal itself. The flakes that make up Wheaties were discovered entirely by accident exactly a century ago.

In 1921 a health clinician in Minnesota spilled a wheat bran mixture on a hot stove and watched as it turned into a crispy flake. He brought his discovery to the predecessor of General Mills who saw the potential for a new healthy breakfast food. Three years later Gold Medal Whole Wheat Flakes hit the market in 1924.

Later renamed Wheaties early boxes featured a fictional character named Jack Armstrong. In 1934 the company switched to real athletes beginning with legendary Yankees slugger Lou Gehrig.

In the 1950s Olympic pole vaulter Bob Richards was the first to appear on the front of the box. He was one of over 850 athletes who have earned the honor from Olympic stars like Shaun White and Apolo Ono to the winners of soccer's 2019 Women's World Cup to pro athletes like LeBron James and Serena Williams.

Some sports superstars like Tiger Woods and Michael Phelps have appeared multiple times. But the all-time champ is none other than Michael Jordan who's shown up on 18 boxes.

When it comes to choosing box-cover athletes Nudi explained that General Mills wants athletes who are making history both in and outside of their competitions.

""We want great athletes that's important"" he said. ""But champions are champions not only in the ring or on the mat but champions of communities around the world as well.""

""Jay died sitting on a horse ready to rope a steer in the movie Treasure Valley in Idaho. The way of a true cowboy. Jay wrote the story and starred in it. He was also coproducer with myself and Vernon Walker. He will be truly missed. Ride like the wind partner [sic].""

Mills also praised Pickett and spoke highly of working with him on the movie.

""As so many of us know Jay was an incredible man. He was kind sweet and generous. He was one of the best actors I ever worked with and it was an honor to collaborate with him"" he continued. ""Everyone who met him even for the briefest moment could feel his warmth his wonderful spirit. It is difficult to find the words right now to say more. His closest friends have said that he was very happy making Treasure Valley and my hope is that he truly was. He was doing what he loved: acting riding horses making movies. And he was magnificent.""

Pickett began his soap opera career as Dr. Chip Lakin on Days of Our Lives and later portrayed Det. David Harper on General Hospital in the 2000s. His most prolific work was playing Frank Scanlon on the ABC soap (and GH spinoff) Port Charles for over 700 episodes. Pickett also made guest appearances on series like Dragnet Mr. Belvedere Matlock Dexter NCIS: Los Angeles and Queen Sugar.

Pickett was born in Spokane Wash. in 1961 and grew up in Caldwell Idaho. He received his bachelor's degree in acting from Boise State University and his MFA in acting from UCLA with a focus in theater at both schools. Pickett is survived by his wife and their three children.

Scott excitedly relayed to Mission Control that he had collected an important sample at the Hadley-Apennines landing site. Dubbed the Genesis Rock it was identified as anorthosite a piece of the moon’s primordial crust and it’s estimated to be an astonishing four billion (with a capital B!) years old.

This and myriad other discoveries would not have been possible without the lunar roving vehicle or LRV that made its debut on that fourth spaceflight bound for the moon. Stowed aboard the final three Apollo missions the “moon buggy” experienced a mishap on the Apollo 17 landing that would have been a disaster if not for the inclusion of a decidedly analog tool on the spacecraft: duct tape.

GM engineer Frank Pavlics and lunar rover boss Sam Romano Romano family (used with permission)

That’s right: duct tape ruled the day once again two years after Apollo 13 astronauts saved their own lives with it. A hammer on the bulky spacesuit of Commander Gene Cernan (who nearly lost his place on the mission due to a helicopter mishap) had snagged on the right rear fender of the rover and popped it off. As a result the wheel shot ""rooster tails"" of dust into the air exposing Cernan and Lunar Module Pilot Jack Schmitt to the spray. That might not sound like a big deal until you learn that moon dust spreads quickly and absorbs massive heat from the sun; it would easily harm both the vehicle and the astronauts’ space suits at a rapid clip.

“Ohhh you won’t believe it” Cernan says in the recorded audio (check it out at 36:30 in the video below). “Ohhhh there goes a fender. Oh shoot.”

Back in Houston engineers had to figure out how to instruct the astronauts to rig the materials they had on hand to create a surrogate fender to save the mission. Using four of the 28 geological maps duct tape and two clamps from the optical alignment telescope the astronauts fashioned a new fender extension to keep the lunar dust at bay.

Apollo 15 alone cost NASA close to $450 million in 1971 and the LRV-1 project accounted for less than three percent of that. Some journalists of the day called it “the most expensive vehicle ever made” since it required millions of dollars and could only be driven for three days on the surface of the moon. The diminutive vehicle made all the difference though.

Starting with Apollo 11 in July of 1969 NASA completed six missions during which 12 astronauts set foot on the moon. During the first three they walked short distances from the lunar landing sites partly hindered by spacesuits that were 21 layers thick. Moving in the suits was exhausting costing the astronauts precious metabolic energy.

“It would be like putting on a dozen raincoats and then pumping them full of air to the thickness of an all-season radial tire” says Earl Swift the author of the just-released book Across the Airless Wilds: The Lunar Rover and the Triumph of the Final Moon Landings. “Even to bend your arm took muscle and the suit weighs more than they did. If you look back at old footage they’re bunny hopping around but you can’t see that they’re working their butts off to get from point A to point B.”

NASA

Tack on the confusing surreal proportions on the moon that makes everything feel like you’re looking through Alice in Wonderland’s skewed perception and it's a wild place.

“The horizon is weirdly close at only two miles away and a mountain might be ten miles away but looks like it’s right next to you” Swift says. “The sky is utterly black. In the absence of clouds and trees– everything that gives you proportional aspects–it’s difficult to judge distance. It’s crazy up there.”

Adding the LRVs changed everything allowing the astronauts to collect a sample then rest while the moon buggy rolled over foot-high rocks crisscrossed the Marsh of Decay and explored the edge of a mile-wide canyon. On Apollo 11 astronauts could only venture 65 yards from the spacecraft. By Apollo 17 the LRVs took the men about 17 miles in total. So much more could be explored with this tiny rover.

“The lunar rovers fulfilled the whole promise of Apollo” Swift told me on the phone. “Compare the first three moon landings [during which they explored on foot] to them driving it’s night and day.”

National Archives

Primitive compared to modern standards the lunar rovers had to be foldable and incredibly lightweight (a dirtbike design was even on the table). When the project went out to bid Swift says Chrysler was the low-ball option but what it proposed was not what NASA had in mind. Chrysler’s design required the driver and passenger to sit back to back with no room for gear and no way for the other astronaut to take over should the driver become suddenly incapacitated.

That left the General Motors/Boeing team with the lowest bid of the rest of the contenders. According to Swift GM didn’t dominate the categories but came in a close second in each so they won the project on points and price. Plus GM had a long relationship with NASA on rover studies all through the 60s and GM had demonstrated that it understood what was needed.

Built to carry twice its weight the LRVs were like mighty worker ants. Each weighed 460 pounds on Earth and only one-sixth of that on the moon which allowed the astronauts to pick it up and move it around. The rover folded over like a business letter and then again to fit into a wedge-shaped space in the cargo area. It’s about the size of a pup tent when folded Swift says and it was about two-and-a-half feet shorter than a Miata when unfolded.

“The contraption had to work with the reliability of an expensive watch every time” Swift wrote in his book. “It had to happen quickly and require little muscle from the astronauts for time and effort were precious. That aside there was the vehicle itself insofar as there was very little to it—it was tiny its seats looked like lawn chairs and it lacked a body or a roof or a steering wheel or much of anything besides wheels that typically define a car.”

Speaking of wheels the GM team came up with stainless steel wire-mesh wheels that weighed 12 Earth pounds each including the rim. Four motors ran the LRVs with one horsepower barely more than a weed whacker; it was enough to propel them on the lunar surface. If one or two of its motors failed it could run on the remaining motors Swift says. If three failed it might even limp along on one.

NASA

The work was arduous and extremely time-consuming for those who worked on the LRV project. Frank Pavlics the rover chief engineer at GM says he didn’t see his kids much during the accelerated 17-month development period. In the process he came up with the LRV’s wire-mesh wheels and schematics necessary to squeeze the rover into the compact cargo bay on the lunar module. Now 93 Pavlic is humble about his accomplishments; Swift says the one flourish of self-promotion was that the undercarriages of all three rovers bear his signature.

Beyond space exploration and automotive advancement the LRV project was also the wellspring of studies into miniaturization.

""The laptop I’m using today would look far different had that first foundational work not occurred with the space program"" says Swift. ""Shrinking down microprocessors to tiny sizes is related to this project as well as managing heat generated by electronics. All of that 'unsexy' development is critical to technology today.""

Stay tuned because there are more space-age developments coming from GM with the next space mission slated for 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8wOC9ob3ctZ20tZGVhbGVycy1oYW5kbGUtZW5naW5lLXZhbHZlLWxpZnRlci1pc3N1ZXMv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9nbWF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIxLzA4L2hvdy1nbS1kZWFsZXJzLWhhbmRsZS1lbmdpbmUtdmFsdmUtbGlmdGVyLWlzc3Vlcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How GM Dealers Handle Engine Valve Lifter Issues,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/08/how-gm-dealers-handle-engine-valve-lifter-issues/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8wOC9ob3ctZ20tZGVhbGVycy1oYW5kbGUtZW5naW5lLXZhbHZlLWxpZnRlci1pc3N1ZXMv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9nbWF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIxLzA4L2hvdy1nbS1kZWFsZXJzLWhhbmRsZS1lbmdpbmUtdmFsdmUtbGlmdGVyLWlzc3Vlcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3doYXQtZXZlcnlvbmUtZm9yZ290LWFib3V0LXRoZS1sb3R1cy1jYXJsdG9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Things Everyone Forgot About The Lotus Carlton,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3doYXQtZXZlcnlvbmUtZm9yZ290LWFib3V0LXRoZS1sb3R1cy1jYXJsdG9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoZS1jaGV2eS1iaWdibG9jay12OC1yZXR1cm5zLW9uLXRoZS0yMDIyLWNvcG8tY2FtYXJvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Chevy Big-block V8 Returns On The 2022 COPO Camaro,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoZS1jaGV2eS1iaWdibG9jay12OC1yZXR1cm5zLW9uLXRoZS0yMDIyLWNvcG8tY2FtYXJvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Even models whose production has been discontinued for several decades continue to be cherished by large numbers of customers all over the world and continue to actively support lives livelihoods and more fulfilling lifestyles. However recent years have seen a shortage of spare parts with Land Cruiser owners expressing fears they will no longer be able to drive their vehicles.

For this reason TOYOTA GAZOO Racing has made the decision to reproduce parts for which there is greatest demand and need so that customers can continue to drive their cherished vehicles in safety and with peace of mind. The company has carried out preliminary surveys with exclusive Land Cruiser dealers and fan club representatives from across the globe and as a result of these activities it is advancing preparations to reproduce and sell parts related to the critical functions of driving turning and braking for the 40 Series Land Cruiser. These parts will be supplied as ""heritage parts"" and will include engines drivelines and exhaust systems. Availability of parts will be launched as preparations have been completed with a target launch date of the beginning of 2022.

Additionally TOYOTA GAZOO Racing is preparing a questionnaire form on its website* where customers can submit their reproduction requests. This feedback will be used in the selection of the next parts to be reproduced.

TOYOTA GAZOO Racing has previously supplied heritage parts for the A70 and A80 Supra and the 2000GT but this will be the first time it has reproduced spare parts for the Land Cruiser. In addition to the 40 Series the company intends to discuss reproduction of parts for later generations of the model.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYXV0aG9yL1BoaWxsaXAtS2FuZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phillip Kane's Articles | Inc.com,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/author/Phillip-Kane on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYXV0aG9yL1BoaWxsaXAtS2FuZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Square just bought it for $29 billion,"New York CNN Business —

Jack Dorsey’s Square (SQ) is spending $29 billion on an Australian buy now pay later firm — a massive purchase that will help his company build out its global payments empire.

Square — the financial payments company known for its popular Cash App — said it plans to merge Afterpay with its existing apps. That will give “even the smallest of merchants” the ability offer buy now pay later services at checkout among other offerings.

The acquisition is Square’s largest ever.

Afterpay was founded in 2015 and launched in America in 2018. It’s best known for its buy now pay later offerings — a service that allows customers to divide retail and online payments into installments.

Such offerings have grown in popularity as a way to reach younger consumers and keep up with the rapid shift to online shopping in the pandemic. Payment analysts have pointed to the trend as particularly popular among Millennials and Generation Z who are wary of taking on credit card debt.

Afterpay meanwhile is among the most prominent companies in the space. Square says 100000 merchants globally use the platform and that it has more than 16 million customers.

Square said it expects the all-stock deal to close in the first quarter of 2022. The acquisition is not only Square’s largest ever but it’s also the largest acquisition of an Australian company ever — according to data from Refinitiv.

Dorsey who serves as Square’s CEO in addition to Twitter (TWTR)’s said Square and Afterpay have a “shared purpose.”

“We built our business to make the financial system more fair accessible and inclusive and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles” he said in a statement. “Together we can better connect our Cash App and Seller ecosystems to deliver even more compelling products and services for merchants and consumers putting the power back in their hands.”

Afterpay co-CEOs Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar said the move “marks an important recognition of the Australian technology sector as homegrown innovation continues to be shared more broadly throughout the world.”

“By combining with Square we will further accelerate our growth in the U.S. and globally offer access to a new category of in-person merchants and provide a broader platform of new and valuable capabilities and services to our merchants and consumers” they said in a statement.

Square has been in acquisition mode this year. Back in March it agreed to acquire a majority stake in Jay-Z’s streaming music service Tidal for $297 million. And in July it acquired frontline employee platform Crew though details of the purchase were not available.

The purchase price is based on the closing price of Square common stock on July 30 which was $247.26. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 contingent upon certain closing conditions. It values Afterpay at more than 30% premium to its latest closing price of A$96.66.

Square co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said in a statement that the two fintech behemoths “have a shared purpose.”

“We built our business to make the financial system more fair accessible and inclusive and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles” he said in the statement. “Together we can better connect our Cash App and Seller ecosystems to deliver even more compelling products and services for merchants and consumers putting the power back in their hands.”

The combination of the two companies would create a payments giant unlike any other. Over the past 18 months the buy now pay later space has essentially exploded appealing especially to younger generations drawn to the idea of not using credit cards or paying interest and instead opting for the installment loans which have become ubiquitous online and in retail stores.

As of June 30 Afterpay served more than 16 million consumers and nearly 100000 merchants globally including major retailers across industries such as fashion homewares beauty and sporting goods among others.

The addition of Afterpay the companies’ statement said will “accelerate Square’s strategic priorities” for its Seller and Cash App ecosystems. Square plans to integrate Afterpay into its existing Seller and Cash App business units so that even “the smallest of merchants” can offer buy now pay later at checkout. The integration will also give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App. Cash App customers will be able to find merchants and buy now pay later (BNPL) offers directly within the app.

Afterpay’s co-founders and co-CEOs Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar will join Square upon closure of the deal and help lead Afterpay’s respective merchant and consumer businesses. Square said it will appoint one Afterpay director to its board.

Shareholders of Afterpay will get 0.375 shares of Square Class A stock for every share they own. This implies a price of about A$126.21 per share based on Square’s Friday close according to the companies.

Will there be more consolidation in the space? That remains to be seen and Twitter is all certainly abuzz about what deals could be next. Here in the U.S. rival Affirm (founded by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin) went public earlier this year. On July 30 shares closed at $56.32 significantly lower than its opening price and 52-week-high of $146.90.

The Texas rookie hit his second walk-off homer in as many games right after a tying two-run shot from Andy Ibanez in the ninth inning and the Rangers rallied again to beat the Seattle Mariners 4-3 on Sunday.

""If I keep doing this it's going to be a pretty good year"" Heim said after becoming the first Texas player and first major league rookie with walk-off homers in consecutive games according to the Elias Sports Bureau.

Heim and Ibanez both connected against reliever Erik Swanson who hadn't allowed a run since now-former Texas slugger Joey Gallo went deep against him in the same ballpark on May 8.

Swanson (0-1) who had gone 12 2/3 innings without allowing a run while spending more than a month on the injured list with a right groin strain didn't even get an out while seeking his second save.

Dennis Santana (1-1) pitched a scoreless ninth for Texas.

The noise from the passing severe storm in the late innings was about the only thing for interest for fans who thought they were watching yet another loss for the last-place Rangers in their $1.2 billion stadium.

Instead Nathaniel Lowe opened the ninth with a single before Ibanez sent a liner down the line in left field for his second homer.

The switch-hitting Heim pulled a 2-2 fastball into the Texas bullpen in right-center field for his eighth homer. It landed in about the same place as the first walk-off hit of the rookie's career -- a two-run shot in the 10th inning of a 5-4 win the night before. Heim connected on a two-run homer from the right side earlier in Saturday's game.

The most recent big leaguer with consecutive walk-off homers was Albert Pujols with St. Louis in 2011. Heim gave the Rangers just their third victory in 17 games and consecutive wins for the first time in a month.

""You can't find words to describe it"" Texas manager Chris Woodward said. ""Just the energy that brings the clubhouse the fans. Obviously it's been a rough year. Those two games are pretty special.""

Marco Gonzales allowed one run in six innings and was in line to win his third consecutive start after the Seattle left-hander had gone more than three months without a win.

Gonzales gave up five hits and struck out four -- all in the middle of a Texas batting order missing Gallo after the rebuilding Rangers sent the slugger to the New York Yankees in a deadline deal.

Right before the homers from Ibanez and Heim Dylan Moore and J.P. Crawford struck out with the bases loaded in the ninth for the Mariners.

""We had a lot of opportunities offensively to stretch the lead a little bit. Just weren't able to get that big hit to spread the gap"" Mariners manager Scott Servais said.

Seattle which finished 5-5 on a 10-game stretch against AL West rivals still has the best record in the majors in one-run games at 23-10 despite the consecutive final-inning setbacks.

""When you get a roll like that winning those close games you just expect it to happen every night"" Servais said. ""We just didn't get it done these last couple of days.""

Abraham Toro had three hits to improve to 9 of 18 since joining Seattle in a deal with Houston before the trading deadline. He scored for a 2-0 lead on Moore's bases-loaded walk against Mike Foltynewicz in the second inning.

Jake Bauers' RBI single put Seattle in front in the second and Kyle Seager made it 3-1 with a two-out bunt single to score Crawford in the seventh inning.

FALTERING BULLPEN

Swanson's rough outing came a night after Diego Castillo newly acquired from Tampa Bay allowed Heim's 10th-inning homer to end a streak of 11 outings without allowing a run.

IMPROVED FOLTY

Foltynewicz who started the day tied for the second-most losses in the AL with 10 gave up two runs in five innings after allowing 16 runs -- 15 earned -- in 5 2/3 innings over his previous two outings. The right-hander had a 10.42 ERA in July.

UP NEXT

Mariners: RHP Chris Flexen (9-5 3.81 ERA) is scheduled for Monday's opener of a three-game series at Tampa Bay. Flexen's road ERA (5.92) is more than three runs higher than his home mark although he is 3-1 away from Seattle.

Rangers: RHP Dane Dunning (4-7 4.20) is set for Monday's opener of a four-game series at home against the Los Angeles Angels. Dunning pitched a season-high 6 1/3 innings in his previous start a 5-4 win over Arizona that ended Texas' 12-game losing streak.

I was a really healthy guy. I spent my 38 years doing the things one does to optimize their health. Eat well. Exercise often. I thought of these habits as doing everything I could to increase the probability of a long and healthy life. By all accounts the odds of me developing cancer were extraordinarily low. So when the sore in my cheek turned out to be a malignant tumour I was shocked. The abstract concept of my life ending suddenly became real. Life is a game of chance and I was dealt a rotten hand. What I learned from cancer is that how you play the hand you’re dealt makes all the difference.

My wife and I were desolate for a few days after the diagnosis. The brilliant life we had worked so hard to build for ourselves was in jeopardy. How would we tell our two young boys? Googling “oral cancer survival rate” led to wormholes of negativity best left untravelled. Fortunately we quickly realized that desolation is a fool’s game when you’ve got a battle to fight. In a tearful conversation late one night we resolved to change our attitude from “why us?” to “we’ve got this.” That same night I printed out the poem Invictus by William Ernest Henley and kept it with me everywhere I went. I recited the poem to myself in MRI machines waiting rooms and hospital beds. I always savoured that brilliant finale: “I am the master of my fate I am the captain of my soul.” The poem helped me discover the silver lining of the months of cancer treatment that followed: hospital beds are conducive to deep thought (especially with no visitors thanks to COVID). The cocktail of anxiety pain fear and hope that came with a life-threatening illness narrowed my focus and led me to some reflections that will shape the rest of my life.

Life is short and unpredictable. In a matter of days a sore in my mouth upended my life and had me fighting to survive. Life is full of chance and there’s nothing we can do to change that. All we can do is spend the time we have left the way we want. I’ve lived so far believing my supply of remaining time was abundant not appreciating how quickly that can change. I may have 40 years left to live but maybe I only have two. This is true for everyone. In either scenario allocating any remaining time to pursuits I don’t value is squandering my most precious resource. Cancer has brought the brevity of life into clear view. As I’ve progressed through treatment the initial shock of potentially having my life shortened has been replaced by the feeling that I just don’t want to leave the party – I would miss everyone too much. In the time I have remaining I know now more than ever before that the highest and best use of my time is spending it with family and friends. When I was fighting a battle with the highest stakes possible I realized they were the reason I was fighting at all.

You’re always luckier than you think. All my doctors agreed that I was unlucky to develop a cancer for which I had none of the risk factors and at a relatively young age. Immediately after my diagnosis I agreed with them. Now with the benefit of months of cancer treatment behind me I recognize that cancer taught me just how lucky I am. The outpouring of support I received mostly during COVID stay-at-home orders moved me to tears on a daily basis. My wife immediately picked up our family and carried us on her back. Volumes could be written on how lucky I am to have her. Our two boys were too young to understand what was happening to their daddy and their blissfully ignorant playfulness was a constant source of the best kind of comfort. Going forward no matter how bad my own situation is I will always consider myself lucky if those boys are happy and healthy. My wonderful close family and incredible friends put together motivational video messages set to the Rocky theme song (a personal favourite). There was so much food delivered to the porch of our house that our freezer was bursting and my family didn’t cook a meal for months. Friends who I hadn’t heard from in years reached out with helping hands. A friend’s mom who I hadn’t spoken to in over a decade knit me a quilt. It was like the scene at the end of my favourite Christmas movie It’s A Wonderful Life. The lowest low of my life led me to truly appreciate how lucky I am. All that support helped me believe that even with cancer I have lived and plan to continue living a wonderful life.

You don’t know what you have until it’s gone. Cancer treatment takes things from you. It takes some big things like your health but sometimes even more painful are the small things. The little pleasures that you take for granted. In the hospital after surgery my feeding tube prevented me from eating or drinking for 10 days. I missed the sensation of food and drink in my throat. The first sip of hospital-grade apple juice I had postsurgery was heaven! When radiation temporarily took my ability to talk I missed communicating with people especially reading bedtime stories to my boys. Try as we might to keep what we have things get taken from us. This is beyond our control. What we can control is our appreciation for what we have while we have it. For me this means slowing down and constantly expressing gratitude for the people and things I have in my life.

What I learned from cancer will guide the rest of my life. I’m optimistic about my prognosis but the fear that it will recur will be with me forever. That fear can be all-consuming at times but life is short and I can’t control recurrence. Thinking about it is a wasted pursuit so I’m determined not to. Instead I’m focusing on recovering from the toll cancer has taken on me. During my recovery so far another line from Invictus has been my mantra: “under the bludgeonings of chance my head is bloody but unbowed.”

The banking giant and its Belgium-based partner Immobel SA are buying an office and retail building in one of the city’s priciest neighborhoods for the equivalent of $119 million Bloomberg reported.

The six-story building at 277 Rue Saint-Honoré is just one block away from the Place de La Concorde in the 8th arrondissement a chic neighborhood that also comprises one of the city’s primary business districts.

Goldman will use client funds and its own capital in the investment which is considered an opportunistic play.

Tavis Cannell co-head of Goldman’s Europe Middle East and Africa real estate operation said the firm “never believed that cities were going to die through Covid and that everybody was going to move to the suburbs.”

“We do believe in the future of the office and continue to see bifurcation between high-quality buildings and everything else” he said.

Last fall Cushman & Wakefield projected that European office rents will continue to fall through 2022.

But investors see deals in the wake of the pandemic. Earlier this year Singapore-based Mapletree Investments launched a European office fund aiming to raise about $606 million.

Brookfield Asset Management KKR & Co. and Tishman Speyer Properties LP are similarly buying up properties that can be turned into offices in cities around the world in the hope of attracting tenants as employees are summoned back to physical workplaces.

Demand is set to surge on the back of climate-change investment and mega-producer China -- which accounts for more than half of global output -- is cracking down on smelting to reduce pollution and meet green targets.

Those combined forces mean the oversupply that's dominated the market for more than a decade is on the way out leaving buyers bracing for a new era of scarcity and higher costs. With aluminum a feature of everyday items from food packaging and beer cans to iPhones and cars what's playing out in markets has implications for inflation and consumers' pockets.

It's already jumped 26% this year to about $2500 a ton one the best performers on the London Metal Exchange. Goldman Sachs is among those seeing more gains ahead forecasting record prices above $3000 by late next year.

In the short term the global economy's post-pandemic rebound and demand in the automotive and construction industries are eating into inventories. But while in the past supply kept pace with additional demand that could change once China's cuts kick in leaving the market in a deep deficit by 2024 according to trading giant Trafigura Group.

""It takes quite a mindset change -- some viewed buying aluminum similar to buying groceries in the supermarket"" said Philippe Mueller head of aluminum trading at Trafigura. ""It's not going to work like this anymore.""

The metal isn't alone in facing short-term issues. The combination of soaring demand and spluttering supply after covid-19 disruption has upended many raw materials markets all of which is feeding the global inflation scare that's taken hold in some corners this year.

For aluminum China's actions are key. The government started cracking down in 2017 capping smelting capacity at 45 million tons a year and its subsequent carbon emissions targets have dashed any expectations that policymakers might ease off on the sector.

""The government is serious this time"" Alison Li co-head of base metals research at Mysteel said by phone from Shanghai. ""Now China has its carbon neutrality mission we think they will stick to that limit.""

Actual production will reach about 40 million tons in China this year so for now producers still have some room to boost output according to Goldman Sachs. But the industry is likely to hit the ceiling by 2024 and from then on the Chinese market will move into deficit.

Producers elsewhere could help to plug the gap but prices will need to rise substantially to make investment worthwhile given higher costs for environmental compliance.

Trafigura estimates aluminum needs to hit $3500 within the next year to prevent shortfalls given the timelag to build new smelters. Logistical bottlenecks higher freight costs as well as taxes and tariffs are also at play right now wreaking havoc in the spot market.

United Co. Rusal International the biggest aluminum producer outside China may curb shipments because of a new Russian levy on exports.

There's been a staggering rise in the premiums that companies need to pay on top of LME prices to get hold of the metal meaning buyers are already facing near-record all-in prices for specialized products like aluminum billet.

There's even a shortage of aluminum cans thanks in part to the shift to dining at home during the pandemic. As a result firms have been forced to import from East Asia and South America at a time when freight rates are soaring adding to costs.

""The supply-chain complexity of bringing cans in from across the world is intense not only from a cost perspective"" John Hayes chief executive of can-maker Ball Corp. said on an earnings call in May.

For those counting on market dislocations proving temporary lumber offers some hope.

Having rallied to a record in May on the back of a U.S. homebuilding boom prices are now fast tumbling back toward pre-pandemic levels. But Rob Van Gils CEO of Austria-based Hammerer Aluminum Industries sees no let-up for aluminum yet as customers snap up his specialist products even with near-record prices.

Like many in the industry Van Gils was forced to make deep cuts to headcount and output when the pandemic struck but plants are now back at full capacity and orders have never been so strong.

""The whole supply chain is very much stressed from beginning to end"" Van Gils said by phone. ""It's created this situation where premiums have skyrocketed because the availability is just not there.""

The surge in aluminum premiums could unravel quickly if end-consumer demand starts to drop away and construction will be the key sector to watch according to Van Gils.

But for now sales are booming. Rising demand from the largely dormant aerospace sector as well as the long-term environmental shifts could yet lend further support when the post-Covid-19 demand boost starts to ebb in other areas.

""It's a seller's market out there"" said Mueller. ""If you look at the next 10 years we're in a massive transition phase in the aluminium market.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5ndmlld3MvYWZ0ZXJwYXlzLTI5LWJsbi1zcXVhcmUtZGVhbC10YXBzLW5ldy1yZWFsaXR5LTIwMjEtMDgtMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breakingviews - Afterpay's $29 bln Square deal taps new reality,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/afterpays-29-bln-square-deal-taps-new-reality-2021-08-02/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5ndmlld3MvYWZ0ZXJwYXlzLTI5LWJsbi1zcXVhcmUtZGVhbC10YXBzLW5ldy1yZWFsaXR5LTIwMjEtMDgtMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbnNtZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvaWNhcGl0YWwtbmV0d29yay1yYWlzZXMtNDQwbS1pbi1mdW5kaW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,iCapital Network Raises $440M in Funding,"iCapital Network a global financial technology platform focused on alternative investing for the asset and wealth management industries raised US$440m in funding.

The blaze at a single-family Cape at 360 South Main Street at the corner of Boswell Road was reported by multiple nearby residents and people driving by. The first call was received at 8:06 p.m. Priest said.

The West Hartford Fire Department West Hartford Police Department and American Medical Response all responded to the fire said Priest. Police arrived first reporting visible fire coming from the second floor and Battalion Chief Eric Munsell called for additional resources that quickly arrived on the scene.

The first fire units arrived at 8:11 Priest said.

A couple who were driving by on South Main Street told We-Ha.com that they saw flames coming from the home and called 911 and Priest said multiple 911 calls reported visible fire and also informed dispatchers that occupants had safely evacuated.

A witness at the scene said there had been two people in the house but that number could not be confirmed.

Fire crews immediately began to extinguish the fire from the exterior and at the same time search the interior to ensure there were no additional occupants.

According to Priest the bulk of the fire was knocked down by 8:20 p.m. and it was completely under control by 8:49 p.m.

Eversource the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) and Connecticut Natural Gas (CNG) responded to the scene along with all on-duty West Hartford fire companies. New Britain and Farmington fire departments covered the town while West Hartford units were committed Priest said.

The residence is uninhabitable and Priest said assistance has been offered to the occupants.

The West Hartford Fire Marshal’s Office and West Hartford Police Department are investigating the cause of the fire.

Today the junk is gone and overhead cranes stand idle more than a decade after the scrap yard’s closing. But Wednesday the city took control of the 34-acre property — the city’s largest tract of land ripe for redevelopment — in a foreclosure for unpaid property taxes. The city has already begun planning for what could become a major project with residential commercial and industrial incubator space.

The development which would likely be constructed in phases would build on the revitalization efforts already underway in the nearby Parkville neighborhood. Those include arts cultural and entertainment spaces incubator space the addition of new apartments the opening of a full-service grocery store and the Parkville Market.

An abandoned warehouse tagged with graffiti sits on a 34-acre industrial site in the Parkville neighborhood.

Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said the old scrap metal yard’s proximity to I-84 the busway and to the Bartholomew Avenue corridor in Parkville makes the property strategically important. The property fits well with a plan for the city that included the Parkville Arts and Innovation District as one of the 10 projects that could transform the city by the time Hartford reaches its 400th anniversary in 2035.

“We want this piece of land to be part of it” Bronin said. “We’ve had our eyes on this parcel for years and have long hoped that we might have the ability to control its future and position it for future development.”

An abandoned ATM tagged with graffiti sits at a former scrap metal recycling yard in Hartford that officials are targeting for redevelopment.

The city expects to hire a consultant this fall to start formulating a redevelopment plan and then developers would need to be chosen. One key consideration will be the contamination on the property since it was an industrial site for decades. Cleanup could cost millions of dollars and at least some of that price tag would require public funding such as from the state’s brownfield remediation program.

Bronin said he could not speculate on how long it might take to fully develop the property or how much it might cost.

“Any large-scale economic development requires a lot of work and time” Bronin said. “But it is our responsibility to identify those long-term opportunities that can be game-changers for the city and start down the path of making that happen.”

The former scrap metal yard runs between Flatbush and Bartholomew avenues and could connect the two thoroughfares long desired by the neighborhood. The site is also across Flatbush from the Charter Oak Marketplace shopping center and within sight of the Apple Cinemas the former Bow-Tie Cinemas on New Park Avenue.

An abandoned warehouse is one of several structures at a former scrap metal yard in Hartford set for redevelopment.

Over the town line in West Hartford one “transit-oriented” development of mixed-income apartments on New Park Avenue along the busway has been built and a second is under construction.

The Bronin administration has been watching the scrap yard property for five years and prior administrations have expressed interest in the property going back to the late 2000s.

The scrap metal business which traced its roots in the city to 1899 and the old Suisman & Blumenthal metal recyclers moved to a new location in the North Meadows in 2010.

Longtime city arts patron Michael Suisman had already sold the business by the time of the move. But Suisman kept ownership of the property because he also saw development potential. Suisman worked with the city but a deal never came together with a developer. Suisman died in 2016.

Just before the pandemic hit the city filed for foreclosure with unpaid property taxes that eventually topped $3 million. The foreclosure was held up because the courts were closed and the matter was not resolved until Wednesday when the city was given the keys to the property.

Walking through the site Thursday the ruins of the recycling plant that helped solidify Suisman as a philanthropist are all-around.

An abandoned warehouse is tagged with grafitti.

The former office is almost completely obscured by saplings that have grown up. A half-dozen buildings that once handled different aspects of recycling are pocked with broken windows and tagged with graffiti. Asphalt driveways are cracked with weeds and wildflowers pushing their way up. The property is now so wooded that two deer sauntered by near an abandoned building.

It wasn’t always this way. Glenn Geathers a longtime member of the city’s development department remembers well-maintained grounds when his father worked at the plant in the 1970s and his family lived nearby at the Rice Heights public housing complex.

Glenn Geathers a longtime member of city’s development department said it’s like memory lane for him to drive through the former scrap metal yard in the Parkville section of Hartford. His father worked at the site in the 1970s.

“All this overgrown brush wasn’t here” Geathers said showing visitors around the property. “They kept the property up. They kept clear lines of sight. This company supported a lot of families for a very long time. It fed a lot of families paid a lot of mortgages and put a lot of kids through college.

“Now we’ve come full circle and it can be something again.”

Ghost Whistle?,"



I’ll preface this by saying that often in the industry toys come out as part of a license that has nothing to do with the property they’re connected to. Sometimes companies have stuff in the pipeline that gets redirected or reused to help pad out the store shelves or product line. So when I saw a stink happening about a product associated with Ghostbusters: Afterlife I knew what to expect.

With the third Ghostbusters film hitting this Thanksgiving the official merchandise push has started. Over the past week we’ve seen new Plasma series figures announce several toys for kids who want to roleplay busting some heads in a spiritual sense.

One of the oddities is this thing—the Ghost Whistle.



Who you gonna scare off? All the ghosts around with the new Ghostbusters Ghost Whistle roleplay item inspired by the Ghostbusters: Afterlife movie! Featuring over 20 spooky and hilarious sounds kids will have ghosts flying for the hills. By using the dial to select the classification of ghost to scare off kids can blow into the accessory to activate the ghost-repelling call!

At first I thought it was a Fisher-Price toy. Seriously. That’s not a dunk on the toy but having a kid myself it has a lot of hallmarks of a toddler toy. I really doubt this will be a thing in Afterlife. If it does however that will be kind of silly.



Moving on to the other stuff that’s a bit more in line with the film.

During the Real Ghostbusters era of the ’80s Kenner delivered a bunch of roleplaying toys. Hasbro has taken up the same line but at a decidedly more price conscience angle. This time around the idea is that kids are building their own Ghostbusting gear. There’s no all-in-one set now. Instead the proton pack proton blaster and PKE meter are all sold separately.



Now you can be the one they’re gonna call! The Ghostbusters Afterlife Proton Pack takes the famous anti-ghost technology from the movies and brings it home in a wearable package for fans ages 5 and up.

With the Ghostbusters Proton Blaster from Hasbro kids can now imagine joining the team with the one piece of gear any would-be Ghostbuster cannot be without! The Ghostbusters Proton Blaster features a mechanism that lets kids imagine the ever-changing wavelengths of a proton stream allowing them to play out the fantasy of catching ghosts in the proton blast!

Inspired by the Ghostbusters: Afterlife movie this Ghostbusters PKE roleplay item from Hasbro is an essential part of the Ghostbuster arsenal! Featuring movie-inspired deco light and electronic sound effects kids can press a button to activate features to find ghosts.

The oddity here is that the PKE Meter is now referred to as the PKE Taser. This must be for the Ghostbuster who is afraid of walking down a dark alleyway.

There are two versions of the proton blaster. The one shown above is pretty bare-bones but similar to Hasbro’s Saber Forge line of lightsabers; this one has different attachments.



Kids can imagine busting ghosts all kinds of ways with this modular and customizable Ghostbusters Proton Blaster M.O.D. (“Made on demand”) role-play toy from Hasbro. The primary blaster complete with sound and light effects comes with two attachments – the Blast ‘n Trap and the Plasma Stream. When kids attach either accessory unique lights and sounds are activated. Attachments can be placed in three locations: on the front side or back of the main blaster so kids can customize their blaster to fit their Ghostbustin’ adventure.

The last of the kids’ RPG toys is a new take on the classic Kenner Ghost Popper.



Mini-Puft popping action is back with the Ghostbusters Mini-Puft Popper from Hasbro and NERF! Inspired by the Ghostbusters: Afterlife film kids can imagine themselves as part of the Ghostbusters team undergoing eerie encounters with this must-have roleplay gear. The GhostbustersMini-Puft Popper comes with three soft foam Puft Popper projectiles inspired by the mischievous Mini-Puft characters from the 2021 film for ghost-poppin’ action and adventure.

OK if the Ghostbusters load up the Mini-Pufts into a gun and shoot them around I’d quite enjoy watching that. However the more we emphasize the Minis the more convinced I was wrong that the Walmart scene is a dream sequence. Hopefully these little guys won’t be a marketing distraction in the movie.

For older kids and people on a budget for cosplaying at conventions three new replicas are all under $20 apiece. These include the ecto goggles PKE meter and ghost trap. None of these are functional but is a great lightweight alternative to the more screen-accurate replicas produced by Hasbro and Mattel over the years.

- Advertisement -

Davis recently promoted to colonel in the U.S. Army grew up with a single mother who did her best to provide for him but according to him they were living below the poverty level.

“We ran into some hard times” Davis said. “My mom worked very hard.”

Davis was 8 years old when a recruiter from the Milton Hershey School approached him and his mother at that soup kitchen and set his life on a new path

Davis felt conflicted about attending. “I was excited about doing this new thing but didn’t want to leave my mom” Davis said.

The Milton Hershey School is a residential school meaning that the children live there. The students live with houseparents who work for Milton Hershey. Students experience structured living they go to school do extracurriculars and chores.

The school serves students from pre-kindergarten through 12th grade they are divided into divisions: the elementary division middle division and senior division.

After reassurance from his mother that this would be the best step for him Davis enrolled in third grade at Milton Hershey. His mother moved to the Northeast soon after. Suddenly Davis had access to nutritious meals his grades went up he played sports and did other activities.

His mother moved to Frankford and he returned home to visit the Northeast on major holidays.

“A bus trip home was like a mini excursion” Davis said.

Davis would often come home to the Northeast and visit with local friends and relatives.

“My friends and I loved playing sports and hanging out in the local area” Davis said.

Davis’ house parents Betty Ann and Robert Cayer raised him during his high school years. They praised Davis “He was always cooperative and respectful” Betty Ann said. “He got along with everyone.”

Robert added that Davis was not resentful of his mother but was grateful she made the decision to send him to Milton Hershey.

“He [Robert] was there for my last four years when I needed a father to guide me” Davis said.

Davis spoke of what he referred to as “hard rights and easy wrongs.” He said the values instilled in him at Milton Hershey from the structured environment and his houseparents enabled him to always choose the hard right.

After Davis graduated from Milton Hershey he went on to Shippensburg University where he joined the ROTC program there. He graduated from Shippensburg in 1998 as a second lieutenant in the Army.

Davis served all over the world during his time in the Army. He was in Iraq Syria and Afghanistan six times.

“It was scary but I was determined” Davis said. “The mission was important — I feel blessed to be able to have served.”

Now Davis is honored to be promoted to colonel in the Army. “I would not have achieved this rank without having the best mentors the most selfless peers and outstanding soldiers” Davis said.

Davis now mentors students at Milton Hershey and recent graduates who are interested in the military.

“It’s my way of giving back” Davis said. ••",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vbXVzaWMvbXVzaWMtbmV3cy9ndW5zLW4tcm9zZXMtbm92ZW1iZXItcmFpbi1maXJzdC1jb3ZpZC1lcmEtc2hvdy0xMjA1Nzc2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Guns N' Roses Play 'November Rain' at First Covid-Era Show,"Guns N’ Roses played their first show since the start of the pandemic Saturday night at Hershey Park Stadium in Hershey Pennsylvania. The band basically stuck with the standard setlist they’ve been doing since reuniting with Slash and Duff McKagan in 2016 for the Not In This Lifetime tour though they did premiere a cover of the Stooges’ “I Wanna Be Your Dog” during the portion of the night where Duff takes over on lead vocals.

Check out fan-shot video of “November Rain” above. It begins with Rose having a little trouble with his mic placement and calling out a tech to fix it. Earlier in the set they played the Use Your Illusion I deep cut “Dead Horse” a cover of Velvet Revolver’s “Slither” and “Welcome to the Jungle” which opened with a bit of Link Wray’s instrumental classic “Rumble.” The sole encore was “Paradise City” making the set a few songs shorter than a typical Guns show.

The band is staying on the road in North America through mid-October playing a mixture of football stadiums basketball arenas and festivals. They head to Australia and New Zealand in November and then Europe in the summer of 2022. This is technically a different tour than the Not In This Lifetime tour of 2016 to 2019 but it’s the same exact lineup of musicians and the staging and setlist remains virtually unaltered.

Guns N’ Roses haven’t released a new album since 2008’s Chinese Democracy. Slash had said that the band has cut demos for new tracks but nothing has been heard by the public. “Duff and I did some jamming and we also worked on the Guns record” Slash said in December 2020 “and I’ve had a couple of ancillary recordings and jams on top of that so there’s been a lot of stuff going on. I’m really not good at slowing down and just sitting around.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdWx0aW1hdGVjbGFzc2ljcm9jay5jb20vZ3Vucy1uLXJvc2VzLWZpcnN0LXNob3ctMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guns N' Roses Mammoth WVH Kick Off Summer Tour: Videos Set List,"So here’s the scene: It’s Saturday night and the tram driver points out that on the right you can spend 12 minutes learning how to make chocolate.

It was a no-brainer to choose Guns N’ Roses. After all the veteran group was performing their first live concert in 17 months — with Wolfgang Van Halen’s Mammoth WVH in tow — for their tour opener in Hershey Pa.

First the choice stage intro which found the announcer bellowing “Hello Hershey! You wanted the best. Well they couldn’t make it. Here’s what you get — from Hollywood Calif. Guns N’ Roses!”

If they were working to shake off any rust from their downtime it was hardly visible in the performance which found the hard rock titans turning in a set that ran for nearly two and a half hours doling out 20 choice cuts from their legendary catalog.

Frontman Axl Rose was in a playful mood telling the near-capacity crowd “We’re just trying to remember how we do this thing up here. Get back in the swing of things.""

He would carry that theme forward later in the night slipping somewhat awkwardly into introducing the band as his microphone was briefly turned off. “I’m new at this” he quipped.

Running through the band intros he paused when he got to a longtime bandmate bassist/vocalist Duff McKagan. “On the bass um Duff. Yeah that’s it!”

He took even longer to reveal the identity of Slash to the crowd. “See I’m milking it” he beamed with his intro of the guitar legend.

But shades of ‘90s bad boy Rose were also in the air with the notoriously cantankerous vocalist greeting the Hershey fans initially after the first three songs “How you guys doing? My fellow political pandemic prisoners” as his lead-in to “Welcome to the Jungle.”

He didn’t linger on the moment instead leaving the music to do most of the talking — which is what you do when you’re Guns N’ Roses and have that body of work.

But anyone hoping for some setlist changes was left mostly hanging with the lone exception being the premiere of a fantastic gritty punked-up garage rock version of “I Wanna Be Your Dog by the Stooges. (McKagan took the vocal lead on the classic plucked from the setlist playbook of his other band Loaded.) It was good clean fun watching McKagan and Slash become honorary Stooges for a moment to make a different kind of noise.

Appetite for Destruction of course figured heavily in the setlist and deeper album cut “You’re Crazy” always a crowd pleaser delighted the Hershey crowd with fans dancing with their hands in the air singing every word. The moment would be reprised later in the set as Rose encouraged the fans to join in on the Illusion-era “Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door” — something they were quite happy to oblige.

“Don’t it feel good to get out of the house a little?” he asked.

Rose himself seemed particularly energized adding extra bits of mojo to the “Yow-za” at the end of “Mr. Brownstone” while smiling and leaning on Slash as the band stormed through the raunch of the title track from Chinese Democracy.

And it was almost like vintage 1988 Axl was in the house swinging and swaying back and forth just as you’d hope he might. Vocally he has to really reach for some of the notes these days but he was in otherwise strong voice.

Instrumentally Mckagan and Slash anchor the current version of Guns N’ Roses stable since the initial reunion in 2016 and also featuring mainstays Dizzy Reed on keyboards guitarist Richard Fortus drummer Frank Ferrer and keyboardist/vocalist Melissa Reese. Both the Appetite and Use Your Illusion eras of GNR left a lot for the present day grouping to live up to as memories hold a very specific vision.

No worries — they’re up for every ounce of that challenge matching the relentless attitude and swagger of the old days. Fortus in particular is a real secret weapon — the guitarist (now in the lineup for nearly 20 years) has some real Izzy mojo with how he carries himself and collaborates with Slash to deliver the guitar parts faithfully while still putting his own stamp on things.

Looking from fan to fan as the night progressed it was clear the band was hitting the mark — lighting it up for every generation including the young kid we saw with a mohawk air drumming to “You Could Be Mine.”

While some groups of their ilk are out just playing the hits Guns N’ Roses continue to take a different tactic. They’ll give you the trusted warhorses you’re waiting for but also it’s refreshing that they go deep and aren’t afraid to get weird. You would think it would be a select few that would be stoked about Illusion cuts like “Estranged” and “Dead Horse” but look left to right and you’ll find audience members faithfully mouthing along with every word.

Mammoth WVH made the night a doubleheader to remember with their rapid-fire 50-minute opening set converting numerous GNR fans who came through the door with only a passing knowledge of the group. “Holy shit” was the reaction of one fan near us midway through the band’s performance only their third show to date — and their first in front of a large audience following two last-minute warm-up club gigs earlier in the week.

Wolfgang Van Halen was grinning ear to ear as he and the band tore through the initial moments of “Don’t Back Down” with the crunchy riffing taking things in a heavy direction from the get-go giving the GN'R crowd their first taste of what the group is all about.

While Van Halen recorded the entire Mammoth WVH album himself playing all of the parts he’s assembled an impressive lineup of players for the live version joined by guitarists Frank Sidoris and Jon Jourdan bassist Ronnie Ficarro and drummer Garrett Whitlock.

The chemistry and connection between the band members has been building behind closed doors for quite a while. You could really feel the enthusiasm and excitement from all involved that they’re finally getting to take these performances outside of the practice space and in front of an actual live audience.

Their 10-song set was all aces admirably presenting the bulk of the material from the debut album. The sludgy jammy “Stone” was just one of many highlights with the group digging through the intricate sections with precision.

If it’s possible to only have one album and leave ‘em wanting more (it is in fact) Mammoth WVH did just that. It’s a moment reminiscent of the first tour in 1995 by another group that spawned from one-man-band beginnings — and just like the Foo Fighters one can easily predict that Van Halen and Mammoth WVH are just beginning what will be an incredible run of success.

As of July 29th Intel has shipped its last batch of Itanium processors to customers and thus ended the era of this processor family.

Intel Itanium is a 64-bit processor family based on IA-64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). In a joint venture with Hewlett-Packard (HP) Intel decided to develop a new type of processor that would better suit the modern workloads and implement some new ideas in the processor architecture realm.

Itanium-based systems were pushed heavily by the enterprise branch of HP called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) which produced many server systems that contained Itanium processors. HPE called its Itanium-based systems ""Integrity"". Several other vendors have been involved in the production of Itanium-based systems as well but HP was the primary driver of the platform growth.

HP even developed its own special HP-UX operating system (OS) based on Unix System V. This OS was used to power HPE Integrity servers running Itanium processors and PA-RISC instruction set architecture which was also highly specialized ISA exclusive to HP.

IA-64 processors promised more efficiency because they lacked the massive legacy software support that x86 processors carry. Being a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) architecture the Itanium architecture relies on a software compiler to calculate in advance which instructions can be executed in parallel so the processor doesn't waste instruction cycles.

In theory this would work well but in practice it resulted in limited software support for everyday server workloads due to the need for special compilers. HP's own HP-UX OS support is ending with the Integrity servers based on Itanium processors which are supposed to be supported until December 31st 2025. On that date the latest version of HP-UX 11i v3 (B.11.31) will be at the end of life.

As the processor family has made its last shipments this year just a few days ago we are witnessing the end of an era that lasted for over 20 years. Itanium launched in July 2001 and the latest version called Itanium 9700 ""Kittson"" has made its final destination on July 29th when Intel decided to stop any further shipment of the Itanium generation. This marks an era where currently Intel is using only the x86-64 architecture in its server processors going forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvYmFua2luZ3JhdGVzLmNvbS9tb25leS9idXNpbmVzcy9jZW9zLXNhdmVkLXN1bmstbWFqb3ItY29ycG9yYXRpb25zL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvYmFua2luZ3JhdGVzLmNvbS9tb25leS9idXNpbmVzcy9jZW9zLXNhdmVkLXN1bmstbWFqb3ItY29ycG9yYXRpb25zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk Marissa Mayer and 25 More CEOs That Have Saved or Sunk Major Corporations,"For a company to achieve success it needs a strong leader at the helm. Top-performing CEOs can transform sinking businesses into profit-making corporations — but not all leaders have the magic touch. Some CEOs are now known for turning failed companies around whereas others are largely credited with the demise of the corporation they founded or led.

One company currently facing an uncertain fate is Tesla led by CEO Elon Musk. The savvy electric car company beat Wall Street earnings estimates for the first quarter of 2021 Investors Business Daily reported. However it was the sale of regulatory credits and Bitcoin and not electric vehicle sales that drove the company’s profits.

Although Musk noted in the Q1 earnings statement that Tesla would begin delivering its Model S vehicles in May it was June before delivery began. And now barely a week before Tesla is due to announce its Q2 earnings deliveries are on hold according to Electrek with no clear indication of how long or why. But experts see positive signs for the company ahead of the July 26 earnings release.

Hotel 1000 in Seattle had previously been owned and operated by Loews Hotels but has been acquired by Lighthouse Investments and ESI Ventures with equity financing from Kildare Partners and will be reflagged under the LXR brand in August.

The 120-room hotel is located at the intersection of First Avenue and Madison Street next to the city’s waterfront in downtown Seattle. The property features All Water Seafood and Oyster Bar a spa and fitness centre and seven events spaces as well as an “all-weather greenhouse terrace”.

Hilton launched its LXR Hotels and Resorts brand in 2018 and added its first US property earlier this year.

A second US hotel (Crockfords) was recently unveiled within the Resorts World Las Vegas complex which also features properties under the Conrad and Hilton Hotels and Resorts brands.

Commenting on the news Feisal Jaffer global head LXR Hotels and Resorts said:

“As the debut LXR Hotels and Resorts property in the Pacific Northwest Hotel 1000 signals Hilton’s commitment to expanding our luxury portfolio in sought-after urban and resort destinations.

“During the course of 2021 we will welcome five hand-picked new members to the LXR collection a testament to our focus on curating a selection of independent hotels and resorts that offer a bespoke experience for our discerning guests and drive superior returns for our owners.

“LXR embraces properties with unique aesthetic and design while amplifying their position within the destination as an authentic immersive experience.”

Wyndham’s net income was $68 million in the second quarter compared to a net loss of $174 million in second quarter 2020. The company’s second quarter adjusted net income was $89 million compared to $9 million in the same quarter of 2020. Its global RevPAR increased 110 percent compared to second quarter 2020 but declined 17 percent compared to second quarter 2019 in constant currency.

Also in the second quarter Hilton’s net income was $128 million and its RevPAR increased 233.8 percent on a currency neutral basis for the second quarter from the same period in 2020. The company’s EBITDA was $400 million.

Wyndham on the rise

Wyndham’s fee-related and other revenues increased 67 percent to $321 million during the quarter compared to $192 million in the second quarter of 2020. Rising demand for travel raised its global RevPAR to 83 percent of 2019 levels including domestic RevPAR at 95 percent of 2019 levels.

“With continued increasing demand from our leisure and everyday business travelers our select-service franchise business model generated another strong quarter of adjusted EBITDA and cash flow allowing us to increase our dividend by 50 percent” said Geoffrey Ballotti president and CEO. “Our brands continue to capture market share gains above pre-pandemic levels while our economy brands here in the U.S. actually exceeded 2019 RevPAR for the quarter. We opened over 70 percent more rooms than we did last year while growing our development pipeline by 6 percent vs. prior year and by 2 percent sequentially to over 190000 rooms.”

The company awarded 154 new contracts this quarter compared to 116 in the second quarter of last year and 173 in the second quarter of 2019. This follows a first quarter of continued growth as well.

Wyndham’s global development pipeline contained more than 1400 hotels with more than 190000 rooms as of June 30. Approximately 64 percent of the company’s development pipeline is international and 74 percent is new construction of which approximately 34 percent has broken ground. Year-to-date deletions ran 27 percent below 2019 levels putting the company on track with its goal of achieving a 95 percent retention rate for the full year 2021.

Hilton hits the high notes

For the six months leading up to June 30 operations at about 300 hotels primarily located in the U.S. and Europe were suspended for some period of time. That compares to approximately 1205 hotels that closed during the six months prior to June 30 2020 according to the company’s earnings statement and as of June 30 all but approximately 100 of Hilton’s system-wide hotels were open.

System-wide comparable RevPAR increased 23.2 percent during the six months before June 30 as a result of a rise in occupancy. Fee revenues increased 28 percent during the same time as a sign of the ongoing recovery.

“We are excited about our strong second quarter performance which reflects our ongoing recovery from the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The broader distribution of vaccinations and the easing of travel and other restrictions have allowed for renewed interest in travel and tourism with families embarking on long-delayed trips and businesses scheduling in-person meetings again” Christopher Nassetta Hilton’s president and CEO. “While the pace of recovery varies by region particularly with the uncertainty surrounding coronavirus variants we expect continued strength in leisure demand and further upticks in business travel to drive continued resurgence in the back half of the year. We are also increasingly optimistic on our development with net unit growth for the full year expected to be between 5 percent and 5.5 percent.”

The company approved development of 25900 new rooms during the time period bringing Hilton’s development pipeline to 401000 rooms as of June 30. It fully repaid the $1.19 million outstanding debt balance on the Revolving Credit Facility during the second quarter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzAxL2hvd3MtdGhlLWZvb2QtYmV2ZXJhZ2UtY3JlZGl0LWluc3RlYWQtb2YtYnJlYWtmYXN0LWlzLXdvcmtpbmctZm9yLXlvdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How's The Hilton Food & Beverage Credit Instead Of Breakfast Working For You?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://loyaltylobby.com/2021/08/01/hows-the-food-beverage-credit-instead-of-breakfast-is-working-for-you/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzAxL2hvd3MtdGhlLWZvb2QtYmV2ZXJhZ2UtY3JlZGl0LWluc3RlYWQtb2YtYnJlYWtmYXN0LWlzLXdvcmtpbmctZm9yLXlvdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi7QFodHRwczovL2x1eHVyeWxhdW5jaGVzLmNvbS9jZWxlYnJpdGllcy93aXRoLTM1MG0ta2F0aHktaGlsdG9uLWlzLXRoZS1yaWNoZXN0LXJlYWwtaG91c2V3aXZlcy1vZi1iZXZlcmx5LWhpbGxzLWNhc3QtbWVtYmVyLWJ1dC13aG8taXMtdGhlLXJpY2hlc3QtaGlsdG9uLW1vdmluZy1hd2F5LWZyb20taGVyLTIwMDAtYW50aWNzLXBhcmlzLWhpbHRvbi1ub3ctaGFzLTUwLXN0b3Jlcy1hbmQtaXMtd29ydGgtMzAwbS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With $350M Kathy Hilton is the richest Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast member. But who is the richest Hilton ...,"

Whether it’s the famous Hilton hotel brand the OG influencer and reality star-turned-businesswoman Paris Hilton or Kyle and co on The Real Housewives it’s hard to escape the influence and magnitude of the Hilton family empire. Let’s not forget even Kim Kardashian started off as Paris’ assistant.



The story behind their wealth is as fascinating as the people themselves. Barron Hilton Paris and Nicky’s uber-rich grandfather was chairman of the board and president and CEO of the company and in 2007 sold Hilton Hotels to the Blackstone Group for US$26 billion.



However when he passed away in 2019 he left most of his fortune to charity. In fact he left just 3 per cent of his wealth to his eight children 15 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren – including Paris Nicky and co.

The other 97 per cent went to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation honouring his father’s wishes taking the family charity’s endowment from US$2.9 billion to US$6.3 billion.

So with the bulk of the Hilton family fortune out of the picture who is left with what and who earned their own empires? Here’s how rich the Hiltons (and Richards siblings) really are …



Rick 65 and Kathy Hilton 62

Estimated net worth: US$350 million

As the parents of Paris Hilton close friends of former US president Donald Trump and even Michael Jackson Rick and Kathy Hilton are the stalwarts of the Hilton family empire.

And they’ve got the bank balance to prove it. According to Celebrity Net Worth Rick and Kathy’s combined net worth is an estimated US$350 million making Kathy by far the richest cast member to ever appear on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

They may have missed out on the Hilton family billions but the couple certainly aren’t crying over spilled milk. These days Rick is the chairman and co-founder of Hilton & Hyland a real estate brokerage firm based in Beverly Hills. Kathy on the other hand is the ultimate Hilton housewife. As a former actress she now focuses on philanthropy sleeping in and living her best life (RHOBH viewers will know exactly what we’re talking about).

While Rick has always preferred to remain out of the spotlight Kathy’s recent appearance on RHOBH has given us a rare insight into their OTT and somewhat kooky luxury lives. And we can’t get enough of it.



Paris Hilton 40

Estimated net worth: US$300 million

Love her or hate her one thing is for sure – Paris Hilton’s “dumb blonde” party girl image initially duped us all. As of 2021 Paris’ net worth is estimated to be US$300 million which means she’s fast catching up to her wealthy parents.

A big chunk of her income comes from her various retail businesses which include over 50 stores and 19 product lines internationally that have generated over US$4 billion in sales.



And while she’s definitely calmed down a lot since her mid-noughties antics alongside the likes of Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan Paris is still a party girl at heart. The only difference is she gets paid a lot more these days. Since debuting as a DJ almost a decade ago she has been paid up to US$1 million for a single DJ set and in 2014 she earned an impressive US$2.7 million for four nights’ work during her residency in Ibiza.

Paris turned “famous for nothing” into an art and she’s still laughing all the way to the bank.



Kyle Richards 52

Estimated net worth: US$100 million

She may not be a fully fledged Hilton but as Kathy’s half sister with an impressive net worth of around USD$100 million (combined with her husband) Kyle certainly deserves her spot on this list.

Ever since she joined The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in 2010 Kyle’s net worth has increased significantly. It’s no wonder she’s the last original cast member on the show still raking in the big bucks.



Of course Richards’ husband Mauricio Umansky is a successful property agent which doesn’t hurt. Mauricio has been involved with high profile properties including the Playboy Mansion and Walt Disney estate through his own real estate firm The Agency. He previously sold extravagant properties to mega celebrities like Michael Jackson and Prince back in the day.



Nicky Hilton Rothschild 37

Estimated net worth: US$50 million

Paris’ sister Nicky is a successful fashion designer model author and mum of two and she’s worked just as hard as her big sis. She’s done everything from fashion and cosmetics lines to jewellery and bags earning her an impressive US$50 million on her own.



But there’s a twist: Nicky is probably the wealthiest Hilton richer than all of them combined. Or at least she eventually will be as the wife of James Rothschild from the uber-rich Rothschild dynasty – a London banking family. The Rothschild family had the largest private fortune in the world in the 19th century as well as throughout history at the time.

As of 2021 the net worth of James Rothschild is estimated at around US$1.5 billion. So let’s be honest – Nicky really doesn’t need to hustle any more. At all. Ever.



Barron Hilton II 31

Estimated net worth: US$5 million

Living in the shadow of your ultra-famous sisters can’t be easy for a young guy growing up but it seems Barron Nicholas Hilton II is perfectly happy keeping things low key.

Of course being a handsome young Hilton he models. He is often seen doing print ads and walking the runway. In 2015 he made a short horror film called En Passant and he also started a foodie account on Instagram called Barron’s Bites.



Barron who is now worth around US$5 million married German countess Tessa Gräfin von Walderdorff in 2018 and they welcomed their daughter Milou Alizée in March 2020.



Kim Richards 56

Estimated net worth: USD$500000

Kathy and Kyle may be rolling in cash but their other sister Kim is only worth US$500000 according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Kim was a successful actress throughout the 70s and 80s and appeared on the first five seasons of RHOBH but in recent years it’s her troubled personal life that has made headlines (and drained her bank account).

In 2015 Richards was famously arrested and charged with trespassing public intoxication resisting an officer and battery on a police officer at the iconic Beverly Hills Hotel. A few months later she was caught allegedly shoplifting at a Target department store and paid a second visit to jail for the year.



Conrad Hilton III 27

Estimated net worth: unknown

Not much is known about the youngest Hilton sibling except for some troublesome headlines over the years and he is widely believed to be unemployed.

Last year Conrad was sentenced to prison for using drugs violating his parole stemming from a 2015 arrest for causing a disturbance on a flight from London to Los Angeles (he proceeded to threaten cabin crew and called fellow passengers “peasants” – ouch).

Let’s hope he can get back on track so he can start raking in big bucks like the rest of his family. Or just stay healthy and out of trouble at least.

Every set of data has important information to convey. Whether or not you can see it depends on how successfully you have visualized it.

A picture says a thousand words and never has this been truer than when it comes to data. The ability of businesses to capture terabytes worth of data about every aspect of their business has remarkable potential but visualizing that data remains a challenge.

When viewed in dry table form it can be difficult to see the story that data is trying to tell. However by taking it out and presenting it in a visual format data comes to life driving actionable value for companies their employees and their customers.

Retail: The Home Depot

The Home Depot has about 2500 stores across the U.S. However no two stores are the same and both workers and customers can sometimes find it difficult to locate items.

To improve their stock replenishment strategies Home Depot turned to Google Cloud and BigQuery to keep more than 50000 items well stocked across all their stores. It provides clear information about stocking levels and availability as well as issuing alerts when stock needs to be reordered.

Using mobile devices they can also draw on that data to bring visibility to the most important items customers need such as where to find products in the store. When their associates need to find an item they simply fire up their mobiles and the artificial intelligence (AI) takes them where they need to go.

With the help of Google Cloud they have transformed the notion of what a data warehouse can do and created one of the most sophisticated stock replenishment systems in the world.

It has taken their query performance down from hours and days to minutes and seconds according to David Narayan distinguished engineer The Home Depot.

Government: Singapore

Singapore has been praised the world over for its response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

One of the key elements of that has been its use of technology. With the help of SAP and PCI they created a comprehensive track-and-trace solution that allowed people to follow the spread of the virus via an app in just eight weeks.

The solution relied on a small portable device that fits into people’s pockets and provides complete accurate and encrypted contact history. It helped provide residents with more information about the spread of the virus giving them the details they needed to keep themselves and their loved ones safe.

Insurance: Emblem Health

Emblem Health is one of the leading nonprofit providers of health insurance in the U.S.

It wanted access to real-time data to inform its human resources strategy but found itself constrained by its existing systems. But managers found it difficult to see data in real-time and understand information presented in Excel spreadsheets. Reports were fragmented and resulted in out of date and inaccurate information.

Emblem Health used the Oracle Cloud to get complete real-time information across multiple data elements and platforms.

Instead of the previous situation where human resources ran stand-alone human capital management (HCM) reports for an ever-growing number of business users Oracle Analytics Cloud is now a single source of information that helps them make critical real-time decisions. From a situation where managers had to use data that was four or five days old they now have access to information instantaneously.

Banking: Members First Credit Union

For Members First Credit Union understanding branch performance is crucial to the value they can offer their clients. Their existing manual reporting mechanisms however made it difficult to understand and analyze their data.

They turned to Microsoft Azure to bring automation to their systems and visualize their data into clearly defined and actionable reports. To do this they used Power BI a data analytics solution that provides interactive visualization and business intelligence capabilities. It empowered employees to create reports and dashboards without having to rely on IT staff or database administrators.

The team required about five months to use Power BI to create data visualizations for their branch reports. They have made it quicker and easier to gain insights and eliminated discrepancies in reports caused by manual errors. Data is quick and easy to access enabling anyone in the organization to view branch reports on demand.

Energy: Geospatial

Geospatial is a venture by semiconductor manufacturer Intel focusing on electric utilities and oil and gas companies.

It used Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create an open cloud-based infrastructure using AI to visualize and analyze geospatial data compiled by satellites and drones.

It uses data to create an immersive 3D visualization tool that could highlight issues around a network. For example one geospatial customer with an oil field needed a more effective mechanism to identify oil leaks. These could be expensive and damaging to the environment so every second counts. Oil leaks are also difficult to identify. They can often look like shadows generating false-positive alarms. Using AI the system learned to identify the key characteristic of the oil spill enabling it to locate problems and arranging for swift maintenance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3RoZXBhcmlzbmV3cy5jb20vZnJlZS9hc2hsZXktaG9tZXN0b3JlLWV4dGVuZHMtZ3JhbmQtb3BlbmluZy10aHJvdWdoLWF1Zy0yL2FydGljbGVfZWIxNWRkODItZjI0Yi0xMWViLTljYjktN2JmMTcwNWFhN2JiLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ashley HomeStore extends grand opening through Aug. 2 | Free | theparisnews.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

City leaders announced plans Friday to turn a once abandoned plot of land in St. John's neighborhood into a multi-use space with affordable housing and services.

It is a big move for affordable housing with gentrification a major issue in Austin and throughout Texas. While this project has been in the works for many years the St. John community has been in need of support since it was first purchased by freed slaves more than a century ago.

No one can tell you the history of the St. John neighborhood like Thelma Williams.

""It was difficult. We had to haul water; we had no running water no electricity"" Williams said.

Around here the 80-year-old community activist is known as ""Grandma Wisdom"" — and for good reason. She's spent her life educating youth and the community about the history of systemic racism affecting the neighborhood.

""I want my grandkids my great-grandkids to know the sacrifices that were made so that they can be the best of the best"" she said.

Williams' home tells its own history. The one-story house and front yard is basically an outdoor art gallery playground and museum.

""This swings is more than 30-years old"" she said.

Williams lives on the same plot of land that her parents raised her on. The original foundation of her childhood home which is about the size of a studio apartment has been turned into a colorful stage.

""That was the way the houses were built then. You didn't have a bunch of room"" she said.

She bought the property from her mom and dad for $10 in the 1980s and built the home she lives in today. Now Williams is one of the few remaining original Black residents of St. John's that still lives there.

""They don't want to live in a struggling poor community anymore"" she said.

Emancipated slaves bought 300 acres of land in 1894 and founded the St. John neighborhood. In 1931 Reverend Black sold his plots to Black sharecroppers. Williams' grandfather is one of those people.

His house is a few blocks down the street from Williams and it still has its original exterior. When Williams was building up her home in the '80s Black families were moving out and Latino immigrants moved in. With redlining segregation lack of funding from the government and gentrification most people have left and the neighborhood never fully flourished.

But an abandoned parking lot might change all that. On Friday morning a group of city leaders nonprofit organizers and residents came together at St. John Park to unveil plans to build hundreds of affordable homes. They also will build retail and nonprofit space at an old Home Depot the city purchased about 13 years ago.

It was initially going to be a courthouse but Austin Councilman Greg Casar said the community wanted something to help St. John thrive.

""To me it really is a symbol of us going from a history of neglect to a future of respect"" Casar said.

The project proposal also states: ""The project will also require Right to Stay and Right to Return policies which allow working-class families currently living in the gentrifying neighborhood to find permanently affordable places to stay and also allow displaced families with historic ties to the neighborhood to be preferred for affordable units.""

Travis County Commissioner Jeffrey Travillion said it's important to build communities and not just housing and while this is progress there's not enough.

""One project absolutely does not heal all of the ills created by public policy and public officials but it is a first step"" Travillion said.

St. John residents and leaders behind this project also say this isn't just a win for St. John.

""I think if we can get this done here it's something we can get done in many parts of the city"" Casar said.

Williams said that she finally feels hopeful for the first time since campaigning for this project years ago.

""Believe it or not I didn't think it was possible until Greg became councilmen"" she said.

So when she's telling her grandkids the story of St. John's maybe it will have a happy ending. Austin City Council voted to move forward with the developer for the St. John project Thursday but it's still in the preliminary stages.

Construction is expected to begin in 2022."

Here's What You Can Do to Stop Them,"USB Cyber Threats Are on the Rise. Here’s What You Can Do to Stop Them

By Paul Griswold 1 August 2021 Security Technology August 2021

The year 2020 was an unprecedented one on many levels. Alongside the devasting health impact of COVID-19 the pandemic unleashed a wave of new cybersecurity challenges as many businesses shifted to a work-from-home model. One of those challenges was rising USB threats that can cause serious and costly business disruptions. These threats rose dramatically during a year in which the usage of removable media and network connectivity skyrocketed as more and more employees worked remotely.

Indeed the work-from-home revolution led to a growing dependence on removeable media. That’s likely one of the reasons the use of USB media climbed by 30 percent in 2020 compared to the previous year according to the 2021 Honeywell Industrial USB Threat Report. The report based on anonymized cybersecurity threat data collected aggregated and analyzed from hundreds of industrial facilities globally also found that 37 percent of cyber threats in 2020 were specifically designed to utilize removable media—almost doubling from 19 percent in 2019.

The research highlights the growing and pernicious nature of USB-borne threats. In fact 79 percent of cyber threats found on USBs in 2020 were capable of causing critical disruptions in operational technology (OT) environments up from 59 percent the previous year. Along with USB attacks the report reveals a rising crescendo of cyber threats associated with USB removable media including remote access Trojans and content-based malware which all have the potential to severely cripple industrial infrastructure.

Sneaking Through the Back Door

The reality is that even though many industrial and OT systems are air-gapped or cut off from the Internet to shield them from cyber threats adversaries are using removeable media and USB devices as an initial attack vector to penetrate networks and open them up to major attacks. And once those back doors are open cybercriminals can then establish remote connectivity to download additional payloads exfiltrate data and establish command and control.

Thirty-seven percent of cyber threats in 2020 were specifically designed to utilize removable media.

Another interesting trend identified in 2020 is the growing number of threats targeting altered or infected documents with 12 percent of the total threats detected leveraging native document structures with embedded scripts and macros. This rise in content-based malware likely corresponds to the shift toward remote work in 2020 and underscores the fact that cyber criminals were savvy enough to make adjustments to take advantage of these organizational changes.

Several factors clearly indicate that the bad guys are deliberately targeting USBs to circumvent the air gap that protects industrial environments. The first indication is the use of malware specifically designed to propagate via USB media. Combined with a high concentration of malware that seemed to target OT and an even higher concentration of malware designed to establish persistent remote access it’s easy to infer the intent. Clearly adversaries see USBs as an initial penetration vector and are leveraging removable media as part of a larger cyber-attack campaign on industrial operators.

Improving Detection

So what can be done in the face of USB-borne cyber intrusions that are growing in strength and volume? Well organizations must adopt a formal security program to protect against intrusions and avoid potentially costly downtime.

To combat USB-related threats organizations need several layers of OT cybersecurity that can deliver advanced threat detection for critical infrastructure by monitoring protecting and logging use of removable media throughout industrial facilities. This includes the ability to monitor for vulnerabilities such as open ports or the presence of USB security controls to strengthen endpoint and network security while also ensuring better cybersecurity compliance.

Detecting malware is more complex than ever and unfortunately no single malware detection tool or technology will ever be completely effective. This is especially true as new malware variants come on the scene at alarming rates—as many as 220 million per year. The sheer volume of threats in existence makes it ever-more difficult to maintain strong detection efficacy.

However organizations can improve detection by using a layered detection and response strategy. This involves leveraging the specific strengths of certain techniques against specific classes or families of malware. One such approach is to use a tool that proactively combines and correlates the latest security research to identify emerging threats as early as possible in a malware’s lifecycle. Doing so allows organizations to gain visibility into these early day threats. These are threats that many commercial anti-malware software solutions might not catch simply due to the growing volume of sophisticated malware that is capable of evasive behaviors.

The bottom line is that more threats are attempting to enter industrial environments and these threats are more sophisticated than ever resulting in a clear and present danger to operations. USBs are a prime target because they provide an easy entry point that can then be exploited by the bad guys to wage larger cyber campaigns against industrial targets. Organizations are advised to be aware of these attacks and show continued diligence is defending against the growing USB threat.

Denso and Honeywell Aerospace



American Airlines and United Airlines have both committed to flying electric vertical takeoff and land aircraft or eVTOLs.

The helicopter-like electric aircraft aim to fly over highway traffic without onboard pilots.

Startups and aerospace giants are still deciding on how they'll get the public to accept the new technology.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

United Airlines became the first major US airline to place an order for electric take-off and land aircraft better known as eVTOLs in February and its early adoption kicked off a trend in the industry. American Airlines soon followed with a $1 billion preorder with Vertical Aerospace for up to 250 eVTOLs.

Behind these high-profile orders is an industry of startups dedicated to making the dream of true air taxis a reality even though countless hurdles stand in the way. Helping them along however are aerospace giants like Honeywell Aerospace that are developing the systems to power the aircraft.

The reality of eVTOLs flying paying customers according to companies like Joby Aviation and Volocopter will arrive as soon as 2024. It's a timeline that Stéphane Fymat vice president and general manager urban air mobility and unmanned aerial systems at Honeywell Aerospace told Insider is ""realistic"" and that if not by 2024 at least by the end of the current decade.

But the questions remain who will fly them and who will fly on them? The compact flying machines are a brand-new technology that are often smaller than helicopters powered solely on battery power and intended to be flown autonomously with no pilot.

Volocopter's electric takeoff and land aircraft.

Volocopter



It's a proposition that will be entirely new to most travelers and Honeywell is already thinking about how to overcome hurdles in public perception starting with putting pilots in the aircraft. While autonomous flying without any onboard pilot is the goal of most eVTOL companies Fymat believes the first aircraft will need pilots to make customers feel comfortable.

""Consumer acceptance comes down to a few things in my mind it comes down to a sense of control and trust"" Fymat said. ""If we went immediately automatically to completely autonomous air taxis with no pilot onboard passengers would have no sense of control.""

But with a resurging pilot shortage that the pandemic merely painted over it hasn't been decided whether certificated pilots will be at the controls or rather trained ""operators."" In either case Honeywell is making cockpits that are easy to use as possible.

Fymat says eVTOLs will incorporate ""simplified vehicle operations"" in cockpit designs to make them ""simple intuitive aesthetic"" and ""cool."" The goal is to both enable a ramp-up of pilots or operators while hopefully easing the minds of flyers.

Honeywell is already leading the charge on advanced cockpit systems including multi-touch display screens and voice-controlled cockpits. Dassault Aviation's new Falcon 10X is powered by Honeywell avionics and designed to eventually fly with only one pilot during cruise flight once regulations allow.

If flyers can understand what they're looking at in the cockpit they may be more amenable to the idea of flying on the aircraft. Under the hood however will be existing fly-by-wire technology that's used on commercial airliners and makes dangerous maneuvers like high-bank turns or stalls nearly impossible.

Simplified however doesn't mean unsafe as safety will be paramount to the success of the new mode of transport. Many aerospace firms are choosing to comply with European Union Aviation Safety Agency certification requirements that have become stricter than the FAA's in the wake of the Boeing 737 Max scandal.

The public will soon become accustomed to eVTOLs as these startups near the finish line and begin to fly their products just as the public has accepted small drones delivering packages as Fymat pointed out and autopilot on airplanes.

And for those on the ground they'll barely notice the aircraft shuttling passengers above.

""These things when they take off the design target is as quiet as your dishwasher at home"" Fymat said. ""And then when they're flying overhead you don't hear them.""",,,,,,,,,

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The widespread availability of hacking tools in the cybercrime ecosystem is being driven by widespread malware piracy or ""cracking"" allowing anyone to use tools without paying HP Wolf Security said in a new report.

In the first half of this year there was a 65% increase in hacking tools downloaded from filesharing websites and underground forums compared to the second half of 2020 the report said.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % HPQ HP INC. 29.72 +0.07 +0.24%

IBM: COST OF DATA BREACHES HIT 17-YEAR HIGH

The top malware delivery file type in the first half of this year were archive files such as ZIP files while Excel spreadsheets were the second most popular file type for malware delivery according to the report.

Behind all of this are underground forums and chatrooms where bad actors share tactics techniques and procedures and/or buy and sell stolen data or unauthorized access.

Long list of stealthy malware

In March HP Wolf Security detected a user downloading a cracked copy of Sentry MBA from a Turkish-language cracking forum. This is a popular hacking tool is used for credential stuffing a tactic where hackers try to break into accounts using stolen lists of credentials such as usernames and passwords. Sentry MBA takes advantage of a bad habit among average users: using the same password for multiple accounts.

As part of a ""multi-stage Visual Basic Script (VBS)"" malware campaign senior business executives were targeted via email with a malicious ZIP attachment using their first and last names.

""Only 21% of anti-virus scanners…detected it as malicious"" the report said.

""Snake"" is a keylogger – malware that records keystrokes – and a credential stealer. Malicious spam campaigns distributing this malware family have been regularly spotted by HP researchers. An analysis of Snake’s code revealed similarities with other keylogger families.

They are speculative drawings based on prototype models we’ve spied as well as intel we’ve obtained and are neither related to or endorsed by Ferrari.

More than 20 years after Porsche’s Cayenne revolutionized the high-rise high performance four-door market Ferrari is finally getting ready to reveal its first SUV.

Ferrari ignored the SUV boom for years claiming the concept didn’t match the company’s brand values and still managed to build a hugely profitable business. But now every big luxury and supercar-making rival (bar McLaren) has one in its line-up and customer demand is huge and still growing. If Ferrari doesn’t offer its customers an SUV they’ll buy one elsewhere and now that it has shareholders to keep happy that simply won’t do. Here’s what we know so far.

It’s Called Purosangue… Maybe

Purosangue (say poo-row-sann-gway) means pure blood which could be Ferrari’s way of telling us that this might be the company’s first production four-door car but it’ll still drive like a true Ferrari.

Or it could be Ferrari reminding us that the Purosangue will ride on a true Ferrari platform while rivals like the Bentley Bentayga and Lamborghini Urus can trace their DNA to the relatively humble VW Touareg. Either way it should be on sale before the end of 2022.

Related: When Enzo Said No One Collector Built His Own Ferrari SUV In 1969

The slight snag is that the Purosangue name is owned by an anti-doping charity and if Ferrari’s legal challenge to use the name fails it’ll have to come up with a new one. Ferrari Famiglia anyone?

The Purosangue Isn’t Really An SUV

Ferrari hates the SUV word and prefers to call the Purosangue an FUV or Ferrari Utility Vehicle. Well when you’re 20 years late to the party you need to have at least a good reason why. Ignoring the fact that many people already think every Ferrari is an FU vehicle the company kind of has a point.

While we don’t know exactly how tall the Purosangue is it’s clear even from these spyshots of development cars hiding under Maserati Levante bodywork that it’s more of crossover than an SUV and features a lower roofline than an Urus or Bentayga. That should give it a lower center of gravity that lends itself to coupe-like dynamics.

It Shares More Than Headlights With the Roma

The Purosangue is the first front-engined car after the Roma to use the new modular platform the company announced in 2018. Although the aluminum architecture has been scaled to create space for four passengers rather than the Roma’s two it still features a sports car layout with the engine up front and the transmission mounted together with the differential at the rear.

So far Ferrari has been careful to hide its Purosangue test cars under Maserati Levante bodywork but we expect the real thing to feature a wider track and a more striking bodywork with a hood that drops right down between its two fashionably skinny LED headlights. The rear gets a liftback fifth door for access to the trunk.

Launches With V12 Hybrid V8 And V6 Versions To Follow

Reports suggest the Purosangue will launch with a naturally aspirated V12 a configuration no rival offers giving Ferrari significant bragging rights. The automaker’s chief marketing officer suggested to Auto Express that adding hybrid power to the V12 would add too much weight so expect this one to run without electrical assist though with as much as 800 hp it’s not going to be short of punch. Count on zero to 62mph in around 3 seconds and a 200 mph (320 km/h) top speed.

More in keeping with the times but probably arriving a little later is a hybridized V8 option that borrows tech from the 4.0-liter SF90 Stradale but with its plug-in hybrid unit mounted at the rear with the dual-clutch transmission. But since the SF90’s power units combine to deliver 986 hp they’d presumably be significantly de-tuned so as not to overshadow the V12 model and the Roma’s milder 612 hp 3.8-liter V8 seems a better base for a GT car. It’s also very likely that a version of the 296 GTB’s 803 hp hybrid V6 powertrain will be added later in the model cycle.

All-Wheel Drive And A New Driving Mode

Combining the naturally aspirated V12 with a simple rear-wheel drive transmission and four-wheel steering in effect making a four-seat 812 Superfast would certainly create a point of differentiation for Ferrari’s first SUV and deliver a true sports car experience.

But people expect certain things from their SUVs and they include the ability to sink your foot into the firewall and feel the tires hook up so we think the Purosangue will likely be all-wheel drive or at least most versions will be.

The SF90 uses e-motors on the front axle but the Purosangue’s front-engine layout means there’s probably no room so hybrid models will have their motor mounted at the rear. Instead expect Ferrari to take power for the front axle from the front end of the V12 and V8 as it did with the now-dead GTC Lusso.

Height Adjustable Suspension

Even the most supercar-like SUV needs to be able to hitch its skirt up for some light off-road action so the Purosangue will feature Ferrari’s first height adjustable suspension system. Air springs are the most obvious choice but does Ferrari have something different planned? Information released to investors claimed the Purosangue would have a “new innovative suspension” so we’ll have to wait and see exactly what that means.

Roomy Roma-inspired Interior

Ferrari says the Purosangue’s interior will be “spacious and comfortable” for four adults and we’ve heard unconfirmed rumors that the rear doors might be rear-hinged as on the Rolls Royce Cullinan. There should also be more headroom and legroom than in the GTC4 Lusso pictured here.

Back seat passengers will have the option of rear entertainment system while the dashboard and console will be far less driver-focused than the ones fitted to the 296 GTB and SF90 sports cars.

So while it will feature the same digital instrument pack head-up display and new-generation multi-function steering wheel as the SF90 there will also be a conventional infotainment system in the console perhaps like the one pictured here in the Roma plus a separate screen for the front seat passenger above the glovebox.

You’ll Need Deep Pockets To Buy One

Ferrari’s most affordable car is the $222000/£172000 Roma and we don’t expect the Purosangue to change that. How much more you’ll have to pay to add rear doors to your Ferrari remains to be seen but for reference the recently departed GTC4 Lusso which the Purosangue effectively replaces cost $263k in V8 guise and $303k with a V12 under the hood.

Two Further Ferrari SUVs Are In The Works

Still struggling to get your head around the idea of a Maranello-bred SUV? Then get ready for another bombshell because the UK’s Car Magazine claims that Ferrari will follow the Purosangue with two additional all-electric SUVs codenamed F244 and F245 in 2024 and 2026.

Car says the platform can accommodate up to four e-motors will kick off with a 610 hp power output and draw from a scalable battery pack with a base capacity of 80 kWh (which sounds kind of puny).

The Ferrari Purosangue’s Exotic Rivals

Ferrari would like to tell you the Purosangue has no direct rivals but the reality is the four-door exotic market is crammed with high performance sedans crossovers and SUVs buyers will also be considering. Let’s run through the key contenders.

Aston Martin DBX – from $179986 (£158000)

Engine: 4.0 twin-turbo V8

Power: 542 hp

Torque: 516 lb ft

Zero to 60mph: 4.3 seconds

Top speed: 181 mph

Like Ferrari Aston was late to the crossover party but it’s making up for lost time with demand for the DBX boosting the company’s output by 224 per cent this year.

The DBX appears taller than the Purosangue and is powered by an AMG-sourced twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8. The infotainment system also comes from Benz but unfortunately it’s a generation behind so there’s no touchscreen functionality.

Bentley Bentayga W12 – from $245000 (£ na in UK)

Engine: 6.0 twin-turbo W12

Power: 626 hp

Torque: 664 lb ft

Zero to 60mph: 3.9 seconds

Top speed: 190 mph

The Bentayga might not look as athletic or change direction as eagerly as the Purosangue but its badge has the right kind of credibility to take the Ferrari on and it’s definitely not lacking in performance.

Most buyers find the $177000 542 hp V8 (4.4 seconds to 60mph) and new 443 hp hybrid (5.2 seconds) more than adequate but for an additional $68k Bentley also offers a 12-cylinder option.

Lamborghini Urus – from $207326 (£177641)

Engine: 4.0L twin-turbo V8

Power: 641 hp

Torque: 627 lb f

Zero to 60mph: 3.2 seconds

Top speed: 190 mph

Ferrari’s archenemy kicked off the whole super-SUV thing back in the 1980s but that’s where the similarities between the crude Countach V12-powered LM002 and the Urus end.

The current Lambo SUV shares its platform with the Bentley Bentayga and Porsche Cayenne though the angular supercar-like styling means only car geeks would ever know. There’s no V10 or V12 option and we’re still waiting for the PHEV variant so the sole engine option is a twin-turbo 4.0-liter VW Group V8 but tuned to deliver the kind of power you expect from a Lamborghini.

Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 – from $161550 (£164870)

Engine: 4.0 twin-turbo V8

Power: 550 hp

Torque: 538 lb ft

Zero to 60mph: 4.8 seconds

Top speed: 155 mph

Strip away the Maybach GLS 600’s gaudy grille and $60k from the sticker price and you’re looking at a regular Mercedes GLS 550. Which should make the Maybach far better suited than the Ferrari to shuffling between fancy hotels in London but not much fun in the mountain roads above Nice even with its V8 boosted to 550 hp.

Mercedes also offers an AMG GLS 63 with 603 hp for almost $30k less. But no Ferrari buyer wants to be mistaken for a soccer mom with a horsepower habit so if it’s an AMG SUV you’re after we’d take the boxy G 63 instead.

Porsche Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo – from $187600 (£140360)

Engine: two electric motors 93.4 kWh battery

Power: 750 hp

Torque: 774 lb ft

Zero to 60mph: 2.7 seconds

Top speed: 155 mph

Not convinced an electric wagon is a viable alternative to a Ferrari? Take another look at the Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo’s zero to 60 mph figure. The Taycan might not sound like a supercar but it’s the only car here that truly performs like one in a straight line and with its low slung crossover vibe the Purosangue is arguably closer to the Porsche (both in spirit and inches) than it is some of these other USV rivals.

Rolls Royce Cullinan – from $384750 (£264000)

Engine: 4.0 twin-turbo V8

Power: 563 hp

Torque: 627 lb ft

Zero to 60mph: 5.0 seconds

Top speed: 155 mph

The Cullinan wouldn’t know a racetrack if you rammed one up its tailpipes but this is imperious stately home on wheels is arguably the Ferrari’s nearest rival based on price and badge kudos.

Performance is respectable given the gargantuan near-6000 lbs curb weight and the personalization options mean that $385k MSRP can rise sharply.

To commemorate a million followers on its Japanese Twitter handle The Pokemon Company has made a replica of the bicycle from its first generation of games.

Unfortunately there’s only one of the original Pokemon bicycle. And The Pokemon Company is giving it away via lottery for fans who follow said Twitter account and post the appropriate hashtag. To further shatter the dreams of fans outside of Japan the company says that it is only shipping the prize within its home country.

All that being said whoever wins the thing will only be getting a prop ultimately. As it turns out The Pokemon Company did not make a rideable bike. Notably missing from the bicycle replica is the bike chain. It doesn’t look like you can move the kickstand either. But it’s quite the impressive prop with a lot of attention to detail. For example there are prints of the various PokeBalls on the tyre thread.

Overall the full sized model of the original Pokemon bike will make for quite the conversation piece. Especially since it can actually play its own ig-game theme.

The reigning world champions advanced to the quarter-finals at the Tokyo Olympics with a straight-sets (21-13 21-13) win over Spain's Liliana Fernández and Elsa Baquerizo in their opening knockout match at Shiokaze Park on Monday.

Pavan set the tone with seven block points and eight attack points while Humana-Paredes racked up 15 attack points and 10 successful digs. The duo is now 4-0 at Tokyo 2020 with momentum continuing to grow after not dropping a set all tournament.

Pavan and Humana-Paredes are on a collision course to potentially face fellow Canadian duo Heather Bansley and Brandie Wilkerson but first they have to take care of business against Australia's Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar on Tuesday at 9 a.m. ET.

Bansley and Wilkerson will face Latvia's Tina Graudina and Anastasija Kravcenoka in the quarter-finals on Tuesday at 8 a.m. ET and a win could set up an all-Canadian semifinal showdown. The duo advanced with a comeback win over No. 3-ranked Americans Kelly Claes and Sarah Sponcil on Saturday.

""Normally at this stage you see two Americans two Brazilians"" Pavan said. ""Here you're seeing two Canadians now and I think that says a lot about our program and our federation and as a country we should be really proud of where we are in beach volleyball.""

The opening set started close with Spain drawing first blood but it wasn't long before Canada began to pull ahead.

A dominant spike from Pavan gave Canada a 6-4 lead and she put her team in the driver's seat with multiple highlight blocks. Pavan put her six-foot-five frame to full use while shutting down the Spanish duo giving Canada a 14-6 advantage after consecutive blocks.

Pavan continued to extend the Canadian lead with impact plays at the net and Humana-Paredes followed it up with her sixth ace of the tournament to move her team two points away from the set victory.

Humana-Paredes secured set point with a shot down the middle. Fernández extended the set by dropping a shot over Pavan's block but the Canadians responded and quickly closed it out.

'She makes my job really easy'

Pavan continued where she left off in the second putting Canada up 7-3 with her second block of the set. Canada brought relentless pressure and errors began to hinder the Spanish attack. The Canadians took full control with a 14-7 lead at the technical timeout.

""I definitely wouldn't want to be on the other side of Sarah. She's just so good at what she does and she makes my job really easy"" Humana-Paredes said.

""Knowing the space that she's taking and just her presence and her dominance has such a huge impact in the game. She makes me look really good so I love it. It also makes the rallies a lot quicker which is great.""

A big spike from Humana-Paredes put Canada three points away from victory with a 18-9 lead and she followed it up with another ace against Fernández.

Spain held on to save a match point and Fernández stepped up with an ace of her own. But Humana-Paredes secured the victory with a tip off the net sending the Canadian team to the quarters with a perfect record.

""It's never easy. If it looks easy it's because we took advantage of the opportunities that we had. We played very low error; we blocked and dug a lot of balls and our side out was very consistent"" Pavan said.

""Every chance we had we took advantage of it and we're very happy with that result.""

The Canadians were coming off a victory over Switzerland's Joana Heidrich and Anouk Vergé-Dépré to close out the group stage. They started the tournament with wins over Dutch duo Katja Stam and Raisa Schoon and Germany's Julia Sude and Karla Borger.

Their Australian opponents in Tuesday's quarter-final match went 2-1 during the group stage starting the tournament with consecutive straight-sets victories over Cuba's Lidianny Echevarria Benitez and Leila Consuelo Martinez Ortega and Italy's Marta Menegatti and Viktoria Orsi Toth.

They are coming off a straight-sets win over China's Wang Xinxin and Xue Chen in their opening knockout stage match.

""They are excellent from the service line so we're gonna have to be very mobile and really communicative on our services"" Pavan said. ""They also run a really varied offence. They're not traditional they're running plays all over the place so we're going to have to be really steady and stay balanced with our block defence.""

Pavan competed alongside Bansley at the previous Summer Olympics in Rio but they dropped their first knockout match after going undefeated in the group stage. The duo went their separate ways following the defeat ending a four-year partnership.

Canada's only previous Olympic medal in beach volleyball came in 1996 at the inaugural Olympic tournament where John Child and Mark Heese won bronze.

Beach volleyball teams advance to quarterfinals at Tokyo 2020

Both Canadian duos will compete in the women’s beach volleyball quarterfinals at Tokyo 2020.

The team of Sarah Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes defeated Spain’s Liliana Fernandez Steiner and Elsa Baquerizo McMillan 2-0 (21-13 21-13) in the Round of 16 earning them a spot in the quarterfinals. They’ll join fellow Canadian duo Heather Bansley and Brandie Wilkerson in the quarters who earned their spot with a dramatic 2-1 (22-24 21-18 15-13) upset win over third-ranked Kelly Claes and Sarah Sponcil of the United States.

It’s been a fairly smooth ride for Pavan and Humana-Paredes who finished first in their preliminary round group with a 3-0 record. The two had little trouble with Spain in the Round of 16 winning both sets 21-13 in a quick 38 minutes. Canada earned seven block points in the victory compared to Spain’s one.

Pavan and Humana-Paredes have yet to lose a set in Tokyo. The reigning world champions are the top-ranked team remaining in the tournament. They’ll face Australia’s Mariafe Artacho del Solar and Taliqua Clancy in the quarterfinals.

“It’s been really special to play the way that we’re playing and keep looking forward” said Humana-Paredes. “We’re in the quarterfinals. We have a great opportunity in front of us. These are the moments that we’ve dreamed of and that we’ve worked for and that we live for.”

Humana-Paredes added that she expects the quarterfinal matchup against Australia to be a challenging one.

“I’m excited. I know this is going to be a really good game. It’s going to be against a really tough opponent and we’re going to have to bring our ‘A’ game – which I think we’re trending in the right direction.”

Bansley and Wilkerson finished third in their group with a 1-2 record which was good enough to earn a spot in the Round of 16. After dropping the first set 24-22 to the United States the Canadians — despite trailing by as many as six points — climbed back to take the second set 21-18.

“I think it goes to show the experience and even the leadership from Heather” Wilkerson said. “I can speak for myself where we just had to kind of look to each other for advice confidence and just sticking to the plan and staying very present to each point. Anything can happen in these games these are high-level games you can never really ever be comfortable even with something that seemingly seems like such a large gap. So I think we were just ready to win today and we weren’t going to give it up.”

Canada had a strong third set trailing only once en route to a 15-13 win.

One of the keys to Canada’s victory was maintaining focus after a lengthy challenge late in the third set — which ultimately went in Canada’s favour. Bansley said the tournament is often more challenging mentally than it is physically.

“This whole tournament is about managing emotions and expectations and so I think that Brandie and I definitely did a better job as a team of doing that today compared to our play in pool play.”

Bansley and Wilkerson will take on Latvia’s Tina Graudina and Anastasija Kravcenoka in the quarterfinals.

“We want to play our best” said Bansley. “And I think that’s been our goal. And we’re just taking it one match at a time and especially (in the Round of 16) it was really point by point. And it paid off for us and we’ll look to play similar and play our best.”

The Canadians are on the same side of the playoff bracket so a semifinal showdown is on tap if they both win their quarterfinals. That would guarantee Canada its first Olympic medal in women’s beach volleyball and the first since John Child and Mark Heese won bronze in the sport’s debut at Atlanta 1996.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNwMjQuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jYW5hZGEtcy1wYXZhbi1odW1hbmEtcGFyZWRlcy1tYWtlLXF1YXJ0ZXJmaW5hbHMtb2Ytb2x5bXBpYy1iZWFjaC12b2xsZXliYWxsLTEuNTUzMTYzONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canada's Pavan Humana-Paredes make quarterfinals of Olympic beach volleyball,"

John Chidley-Hill The Canadian Press





TOKYO -- Trust is the foundation of defence and defence is the focal point of Melissa Humana-Paredes and Sarah Pavan's strategy in beach volleyball.

The Canadian duo dispatched Spain's Liliana Fernandez Steiner and Elsa Baquerizo McMillan 2-0 in a round-of-16 match at the Tokyo Olympics on Monday overpowering their opponents 21-13 21-13.

Pavan's dominant play at the net was the key to victory but said after the match that she can't commit to blocks without knowing her partner will have her back.

""Honestly in beach volleyball a defensive system is all about trust"" said Pavan at Shiokaze Park overlooking Tokyo Bay. ""If I don't trust Melissa I'll start trying to do too much at the net. If Melissa doesn't trust me she'll be out of position.

""We trust each other implicitly that we're going to do what we say we're going to do.""

Canada is the only country with two teams left in the tournament.

Toronto's Humana-Paredes and Pavan of Kitchener Ont. will face Australia's Mariafe Artacho Del Solar and Taliqua Clancy in the quarterfinals on Tuesday.

""(Australia) runs a very varied offence they're not traditional they're running plays all over the place"" said Pavan. ""We're going to have to be really steady and stay balanced with our block defence.""

That match will be held right after Heather Bansley of London Ont. and Toronto's Brandie Wilkerson play Latvia's Tina Graudina and Anastasija Kravcenoka in their quarterfinal matchup.

""Normally at this stage there would be two Americans or two Brazilians but you're seeing two Canadians now and I think that says a lot about our program and our federation"" said Humana-Paredes. ""I think as a country we should be really proud of where we are.""

Pavan and Humana-Paredes the reigning world champions have not dropped a set in Tokyo winning all three of their pool matches 2-0.

They have been dominant since they first partnered together five years ago. They've reached the finals at 14 international events and won seven including the 2019 world title and a 2018 Commonwealth Games gold.

That world title qualified Pavan and Humana-Paredes for the Tokyo Olympics two years ago then the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the Games by a year.

""They're a very favoured team right now and I think they can get a medal and if not they're going to be very close"" said Fernandez Steiner.

Monday's first set was tight for the first 14 points but then the Canadians began to overwhelm their Spanish opponents. Pavan in particular was dominant getting four blocks as part of a 7-1 run that gave the Canadians a 14-7 lead.

Pavan said that success was due to lots of preparation analyzing video of their opponents in advance of a match.

""I spend a lot of time watching the hitter's body and where the pass goes the trajectory of the set"" said Pavan. ""A lot of the time I do know what they're looking for but sometimes it's about just dropping my hand in a little bit further.""

The Canadians didn't let up in the second set quickly taking an 11-4 lead.

A Humana-Paredes spike just inside the boundary line made it 20-11 before giving up two points to Spain. A return by Humana-Paredes off her opponent's fingers sealed the win for Canada.

""(Pavan) makes me look really good"" said Humana-Paredes who laughed as Pavan shook her head no. ""As a hitter 100 per cent her presence makes a difference.""

Canada didn't qualify a duo on the men's side of the beach volleyball event.

Huntington Bank regularly offers bank promotions to attract new customers. Bank bonuses are a relatively easy way to earn some extra cash. You can earn hundreds of dollars by merely opening a new account and meeting other account requirements in many cases.

Currently Huntington Bank has two bank promotions available through October 7th 2021. New customers can earn $150 or $200 by opening select checking accounts and making at least $1000 in total deposits during the offer’s timeframe. Here’s a closer look at Huntington Bank’s current bank bonuses and what you need to know to earn some extra cash through the bank.

Huntington Bank Bonuses

Huntington Bank is known for offering incredible bank bonuses for new customers who open select accounts. Right now you can earn up to $200 through two bank bonus offers at Huntington. Here’s what you need to know about both bank bonuses.

Asterisk-Free Checking $150 Bank Bonus

huntington bank promo

Right now you can earn a $150 bank bonus when you open a Huntington Bank’s Asterisk-Free Checking account. Like most bank bonuses you’ll need to meet the bank’s specific requirements to earn the bonus. For this particular Huntington bonus you’ll need to:

Open a new Asterisk-Free Checking account by October 7 2021

Make cumulative new money deposits of at least $1000 to your checking account within 60 days of account opening

Keep your account open for at least 90 days

Huntington will deposit the $150 bank bonus into your checking account within 14 days of meeting the specified requirements.

Bonus Expiration

To qualify for the bonus you’ll need to open an eligible checking account by October 7 2021. You also need to meet the bank bonus deposit requirements within 60 days of account opening.

About Asterisk-Free Checking

Asterisk-Free Checking is a standard checking account available through Huntington Bank. With no monthly fees and no minimum balance requirements you can bank however you want without extra costs. There’s also no minimum opening deposit requirement so you can open an account regardless of how much money you have to add. Huntington’s Asterisk-Free Checking comes with access to several tools to help you manage your money.

Automated savings

Money Scout is an automatic savings tool that analyzes your spending habits and upcoming expenses to find unused funds to transfer over to your savings account.

Overdraft protection

Huntington helps you with overdrafts in two ways. First you have access to a 24-hour grace period that gives you more time to fund your account and avoid costly overdraft fees. You also have access to the $50 Safety Zone which allows you to have a negative balance (up to $50) for five consecutive days or longer with an extended overdraft fee. It’s good to know Huntington Bank has your back during the moments you need a little extra help.

Digital tools

Huntington Bank’s hub is home to all of the bank’s digital tools. As a checking customer you have unlimited access to savings and budgeting tools designed to help you set and save for money goals and improve your money management skills.

Online Bill Pay

Huntington customers have a convenient one-stop-shop for paying bills online. Bill payment is available through your online account or Huntington’s mobile app.

Huntington 5 Checking $200 Bank Bonus

huntington bank promo

Huntington’s other bank bonus offer is for opening a Huntington 5 Checking account. New customers can earn a $200 bank bonus right now by meeting the following requirements:

Open a new account by October 7 2021

Make cumulative new money deposits of at least $1000 to your checking account within 60 days of account opening

Keep your account open for at least 90 days

Huntington will deposit the $200 bank bonus into your checking account within 14 days of meeting the specified requirements above. Huntington 5 Checking also comes with a free debit card and check writing privileges with checks available for a fee.

Bonus Expiration

Like Huntington’s other bonus customers need to open an eligible checking account by October 7 2021 and meet the offer’s deposit requirements within 60 days of account opening.

About Huntington 5 Checking

Huntington 5 Checking is an interest-bearing checking account. Besides the bonus offer the account comes with several valuable benefits.

Free ATM Withdrawals

Customers receive five free non-Huntington ATM withdrawals each month. That means you can still withdraw money without a fee even if you’re aren’t near a Huntington Bank or one of its ATMs. Keep in mind this only waives the fee typically charged by Huntington not any fees incurred from the ATM owner.

Free Credit Scores

Huntington 5 customers also get access to free VantageScore credit scores each month along with additional quarterly credit scores.

Digital Tools

Huntington 5 Checking accounts also have access to the bank’s hub of digital tools. That includes Huntington Heads Up a tool that provides real-time insights and alerts so you can manage your money more effectively. It even keeps track of subscription accounts so you know when free trials end or when renewals are coming up.

Extended Deposit Hours

Both checking accounts come with access to All Day Deposit which means the deposit day ends at midnight not early cutoff times like other banks.

On Wednesday night however the Gophers quarterback was camped out with 11 teammates in the parking lot of a Lakeville strip mall barbecue joint smack dab between a taqueria and a laundromat.

All the while Morgan was quietly leading and giving making sure his offensive linemen were getting some love.

Since July 1 when the NCAA read the shifting culture and stopped preventing student-athletes from making money off their name image and likeness players throughout the country have started to enter into deals. Morgan quickly hooked up with the video-sharing social network Cameo to deliver personalized messages. At Alabama quarterback Bryce Young reportedly has agreements worth more than $800000.

Realizing he'll have more opportunities to make NIL money than his teammates Morgan along with running back Mohamed Ibrahim decided to include the offensive linemen in on the action coming up with the idea of an autograph session at Baldy's BBQ with all proceeds going to the big fellas.

""I reached out to Baldy and asked him if there was something we could do for our offensive line to profit off this name image and likeness before the season starts'' Morgan said. ""He was like 'Yeah of course.' We got it going and it was perfect combination. It was cool for our guys to come out here and sign some autographs.''

Baldy is Brian ""Baldy'' Wheeler a former placekicker for Joliet (Ill.) Junior College and the University of Missouri. ""Broke my leg in three spots and never got to play'' at Missouri Wheeler said. He moved to Minnesota in 2003 started Baldy's BBQ in 2009 and helped coach Lakeville South's quarterbacks and receivers when future QB Mitch Leidner was playing for the Cougars. He became a Gophers fan is a regular at tailgates and has catered events for the team.

Wheeler also became friends with Morgan's father Ted who died July 12 after battling brain cancer. ""[Tanner] called me the day after the funeral and said 'Let's get this thing together. I need to get this for my linemen' '' Wheeler said. ""He said 'I'm getting some opportunities Mo's getting some opportunities but my linemen they ain't seeing the love.' ''

At Wednesday's event fans could receive autographs from the linemen for $10 per item and during the two-plus-hour session an estimated 250 people showed up. Wheeler gave the Gophers group 15% of the restaurant's proceeds from 5 p.m. and on which augmented the amount the players received from autographs. The 10 linemen split a total of roughly $2000.

The linemen of course applauded the efforts of Morgan and Ibrahim.

""Thank you very much for Tanner and Mo'' senior guard Blaise Andries said. ""It's really cool that they were willing to do that for their offensive line. When you think of NIL you think of the top three or four players on the team getting most of the deals. We're lucky enough to have great people on our team helping us out.''

Added senior guard Conner Olson ""We appreciate it. Tanner's been our guy through this.''

The players have received advice in dealing with NIL opportunities from the athletic department and coach P.J. Fleck and his staff but the decisions are made at the player level. They've consulted the university's NCAA compliance officials for help and are mindful of tax implications of NIL money.

""I remind these guys: If your parents file your taxes or you have somebody who files your taxes be sure to give this information how much you're making to them'' said Andries an Academic All-America selection who is working on a master's degree in applied business analytics.

'The heartbeat'

Morgan's leadership on the field will be a key for the Gophers who begin preseason camp on Wednesday in advance of their Sept. 2 season opener against Ohio State at Huntington Bank Stadium. With a deep veteran offensive line and Ibrahim the reigning Big Ten running back of the year the Gophers have the ingredients for a powerful running game.

Morgan is seeking to return to the form that saw him complete 66% of his passes for 3253 yards and 30 touchdowns with seven interceptions during the 11-2 season in 2019.

""We've just got to continue to take the next right step and that starts with me being able to execute at a higher level'' said Morgan who completed 57.9% of his passes for 1374 yards and seven TDs with five interceptions as the Gophers slumped to 3-4 in 2020. ""We need to connect the dots to take the stress off [Ibrahim]. I've got to be better from where I was last year.''

In 2019 on the way to a top-10 finish in the final Associated Press poll the Gophers had an embarrassment of riches at wide receiver with Tyler Johnson now a Super Bowl champion for Tampa Bay and Rashod Bateman a first-round draft pick by Baltimore along with Chris Autman-Bell. Now Autman-Bell (78 career catches six TDs) and sophomore Daniel Jackson (12 career catches) are expected to be the go-to targets.

Fleck calls Morgan ""the heartbeat of this football team'' and is confident in the signal-caller who's been the starter since the eighth game of the 2018 season. Others are noticing too. Morgan is on the watch list for the Wuerffel Trophy college football's top award for community service.

""The way he's handled what he's gone through in the last year-and-a-half especially the last week with his father just shows what type of person he is'' Fleck said from Big Ten media days. ""There's a person behind that number and that arm leading the team and I couldn't think of a better person leading our team than Tanner Morgan.''

Morgan though shares praise with teammates and on Wednesday his linemen were the recipients.

""They're the ones who make it happen'' Morgan said. ""Without them nothing happens.''",,,,,,,,,

Earlier this year IBM (IBM 0.53%) claimed to have developed the world's first 2nm chip technology. That sounded like a remarkable achievement since Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 4.53%) -- the world's most advanced chipmaker -- only started mass producing 5nm chips last year.

But investors shrugged and the news was quickly forgotten just like IBM's introduction of the world's ""first"" 7nm chip in 2015 and 5nm chip in 2017. Meanwhile IBM's stock declined more than 10% over the past five years as it struggled to expand its higher-growth cloud businesses rapidly enough to offset the sluggish growth of its legacy software hardware and IT services divisions.

Let's take a look back at Big Blue's chipmaking breakthroughs why investors were indifferent to those milestones and whether or not these announcements actually matter to the company's future.

IBM's oft-overlooked chipmaking business

IBM once designed and manufactured PowerPC CPUs which emerged from the AIM (Apple IBM and Motorola) alliance in the 1990s. The AIM alliance introduced PowerPC as an alternative chip architecture to challenge Intel's (INTC -0.80%) dominance of the CPU market.

The alliance collapsed in the mid-2000s after Apple switched its Macintosh computers from PowerPC CPUs to Intel's CPUs. But IBM continued to design new Power chips and the architecture lived on in the OpenPOWER foundation -- an open source consortium that counts IBM Alphabet's Google the Chinese server maker Inspur and the Russian server maker Yadro as its platinum members.

IBM manufactured Power chips until 2014 when it agreed to pay GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion to take over the unprofitable unit. It also agreed to exclusively use GlobalFoundries to produce 22nm 14nm and 10nm chips for its own hardware. However GlobalFoundries gave up on developing 10nm and 7nm chips after AMD its former parent company outsourced its most advanced chips to TSMC instead.

GlobalFoundries' decision sparked a lawsuit from IBM which had expected the foundry to manufacture 10nm and 7nm Power chips for its Power System servers. That clash caused IBM to abandon GlobalFoundries and outsource the production of its newer Power chips to Samsung instead.

Today IBM's Power CPUs are mainly confined to its Power Systems business one of the three main pillars (along with its IBM Z mainframes and storage systems) of its Systems business. IBM generated $6.98 billion in revenue or 9% of its top line from its Systems business last year.

Why IBM's chip advancements are largely meaningless

IBM's creation of a 2nm chip would be significant if it could mass produce and sell them on its own or install them into its own Power systems. But IBM doesn't manufacture its own chips anymore it already shares its chip designs with other companies through the OpenPOWER consortium and its most advanced 7nm Power chips are produced by Samsung -- which certainly can't mass produce 2nm chips yet.

In other words IBM's 2nm chip is just a lab experiment. IBM claims that compared to modern 7nm chips its 2nm chips can boost performance by 45% at the same power levels or deliver 75% more power at the same performance levels. It also claims its chips are slightly denser than TSMC's upcoming 3nm chips which are scheduled for mass production next year.

But shortly after IBM revealed is 2nm chip TSMC fired back with a report detailing its own theoretical breakthrough with 1nm chips. However TSMC doesn't expect to actually hit that milestone anytime soon -- it plans to mass produce 2nm chips in 2023 but anything beyond that is uncharted territory.

So what should IBM's investors focus on?

IBM's development of a 2nm chip sounds impressive but it ultimately means nothing. Instead of being distracted by that flashy headline IBM's investors should focus on three main things.

First they should see if its cloud revenue which rose 19% to $25.1 billion last year and accounted for over a third of its top line continues to rise. Second they should see if IBM's renewed focus on hybrid cloud deployments and AI services -- accelerated by its takeover of Red Hat two years ago -- will feed that growth and widen its moat against the public cloud giants.

Lastly investors should focus on IBM's upcoming spin-off of Kyndryl which will remove the slow-growth managed infrastructure services division from IBM's core business. That move could streamline the ""new"" IBM and enable it to aggressively expand its hybrid cloud and AI businesses -- but it could also result in lower dividend payments in the future.

Keeping track of these three things will help investors determine if IBM's stock is undervalued at 12 times forward earnings. Anything else including its claim of creating the world's smallest chip is just noise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3LzMxL25hdGlvbmFsL3NjaWVuY2UtaGVhbHRoL2phcGFuLXF1YW50dW0tY29tcHV0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japan's first commercial-use quantum computer starts operations,"The University of Tokyo and IBM Corp. have started operations of Japan's first commercial-use quantum computer making a foray into a fiercely competitive field led by the United States and China.

An Illinois megachurch pastor has released a new book in which he hopes to help Christians discover their “royalty” status in Jesus Christ and quit living what he calls the “low life.”

Pastor Bill Winston of the Living Word Christian Center in Forest Park has written a new book titled Revelation of Royalty: Rediscovering Your Royal Identity in Christ that was released earlier this month.

The former fighter pilot and IBM marketing representative wrote in the book's preface that he believes “many Christians still have an image of inferiority and shortage that entered mankind when Adam and Eve fell in the Garden of Eden.”

“Let me remind you who you are. You are a member of the royal family of God the sovereign over all the universe” wrote Winston in Chapter 1. ""Let's embrace our original image and walk in our kingly and queenly assignments.""

In an interview with The Christian Post on Thursday Winston discussed his new book some of the ways he sees Western values conflicting with Christianity and his views on the controversial topic of the prosperity gospel.

CP: What led you to write this book?

Winston: As we look at the Christian community I think there’s an absence of teaching on the new creation — that once believers get born again they just got born again into a royal family. The wealthiest in the universe.

I feel that a lot of the reason most of the Church is not enjoying their promised land the inheritance what Jesus died to provide is because of image. And we have by and large seen ourselves born again but not seemingly developed in our thinking about what the total result of that born again experience would be.

And so we live what I call the “low life.” That we live a life of mere human existence compared to life of the supernatural the life of Christ.

CP: In Chapter 2 you wrote that Christians need to disconnect from ""Western modes of thought"" saying that they ""invalidate the form and structure of God's government."" How do you believe Western thought can ""invalidate"" God's government?

Winston: I think that more and more we’re influenced by technology rather than faith. I think that when I go to Africa or some other places they can more adapt to the Word of God and believe it because they unlike the West don’t have all of the advantages. They don’t have the technology; they don’t have all the things that have I think “civilized” us out of how God intended for us to think.

If you go to the Middle East ... or [talk to] somebody who is Jewish and understands Abraham and the covenant God made with him and the promise of Abraham’s seed they take it literally.

Here it hasn’t been looked at as being something of value. And thus a lot of the scriptures have been looked at the same way. It becomes a book for helping with moral behavior and so forth something like that but not a book of promises that will elevate you to be one of the wealthiest people wherever you go.

CP: In Chapter 3 you wrote ""Unfortunately some born-again people observe the ways of 'successful' unsaved people read their books and emulate their practices."" Some among them Darvin Wallis of the Mission Church have echoed this concern in asserting that the reason many evangelical megachurch pastors fall to scandal is because they rely on a secular corporate leadership model rather than a biblical leadership model. Do you agree with this assessment?

Winston: Well to some degree.

I think God’s model is flatter than the corporate model and that causes this huge long chain of command to be broken and that the flat model is there because everybody has Christ.

One of the privileges we have is that the same Holy Spirit that speaks to me will speak to somebody who is assisting me. And I won’t have to tell them everything to do. They can stay ahead of me in that. So therefore we don’t have to have some of the chain of command that we have in corporate.

The other thing is that in the megachurch environment I think the tendency is for the leadership to be accused sometimes of not being touchable anymore. That they have now gained such status and such branding now it is impossible for them to relate to the new believers.

I think that happens in that environment that is corporate.

I came through IBM for 14 years before I did this. I have the history of IBM. I understood how T.J. Watson who started IBM would go down on the shop floor and talk to Joe about his mother needing dental work and so forth. And I’ve always felt that no matter how large we get I want to remain somewhat personable if you will with the congregation and not think that I’ve gotten so big and even proud sometimes that I don’t have time to discuss things and give some personal advice.

I saw that in IBM because I saw some of the chief executives come down to the branch office and how they had me because I was doing well to pick up the president of one of the divisions from the airport and bring him on in and chat with him and so forth.

I just saw a more personable model even in the corporate space.

CP: In Chapter 8 you wrote ""There comes a time when you start reaping the royal inheritance that you have decreed by faith."" Is it possible for a Christian to never truly make it to this point?

Winston: Yeah it is but here’s the deal here’s the way this works. Vision is extremely powerful. That’s why it says “without a vision the people perish.” It’s extremely powerful. The way God functions is brought out in the Scriptures.

He starts with the end in mind. And when you can start with the end in mind then you can enjoy your journey. If an end becomes real enough in your vision you can enjoy the journey.

Abraham can only sacrifice Isaac when he saw him in a vision being raised up. I could only leave IBM when I saw 10000 people [in my church]. And I’m saying that you may not get there but as Martin Luther King said “I have seen the Promised Land and because of that I am no more afraid of dying.” So the sacrifice can take place the joy can take place all of that even though you may not get there. I believe in Heaven you’ll get credit for it.

CP: In Chapter 8 you had a section titled ""Without wealth your royalty is in question."" What is your opinion of what is oftentimes called the ""prosperity gospel""?

Winston: It’s been used sometimes I think almost as a scam and people have been taken advantage of even people who can’t even afford to lose anything. It has really been that.

But the prosperity is a part of the Gospel. We can’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. God said that the blessing of Abraham is on the seed that we have the blessing of Abraham. If we belong to Christ then you're Abraham’s seed and heirs according to the blessing. That means that the portion that Abraham had is the same portion his seed will have.

And so Isaac had it Jacob had it but once Jesus came it brought everybody into it it brought the Gentiles into it.

Now I said “without the wealth your royalty is in question” because you’ve never seen a poor king; it doesn’t exist. God never intended for His people to be poor. Why? Because they’re going to take care of the poor. They’re going to be the ones.

The government of the United States was never meant to take care of the poor. The poor were meant to be taken care of by the Church. This whole business of having telethons and raising money is not even in the Scriptures it’s not even in the Book. Because God’s people are supposed to be so blessed ... they have all that they need. And [develop] wealth creation opportunities like the Joseph Business School and wealth creation businesses so that they can fund the Kingdom. That’s what they’re supposed to be doing.

And so I'm saying that because if somebody mentions that I am a king but Jesus is the King of kings and the Lord of lords king rules by decree but lords rule by ownership. And if there is nothing there how can you validate the fact that you’re a king other than the fact that you can say it?

So what people have done is they’ve taken this prosperity gospel if you will and taken everything out of it. They’ve taken out the stewardship part — that you’re being blessed so that you can be a blessing. They’ve taken out the integrity part and some of them get blessing outside of this whole idea of having integrity in your ministry and your messages. Pieces they have taken out and given this thing a bad name.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zdC5jb20ubXkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wOC83MTQwNzUvbm9raWEtbmFtZXMtcmF1Zi1uYXNpci1sZWFkLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtbWFsYXlzaWEtbWFsZGl2ZXMtc3JpLWxhbmth0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnN0LmNvbS5teS9hbXAvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wOC83MTQwNzUvbm9raWEtbmFtZXMtcmF1Zi1uYXNpci1sZWFkLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtbWFsYXlzaWEtbWFsZGl2ZXMtc3JpLWxhbmth?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nokia names Rauf Nasir to lead operations in Malaysia Maldives & Sri Lanka,

Don’t panic when stocks collapse.

That investing maxim proved absolutely correct during the rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic panic of early 2020.

Remarkably shares of 57 of the 75 largest North Carolina-based public companies increased by at least 30% during the year ending June 30. Five tripled in value while another 12 doubled. The star performer was Belmont-based Piedmont Lithium which shot up more than 11-fold aided by a big contract to supply electric automaker Tesla.

Only four of the 75 stocks lost ground during that period.

We expanded this annual list from 50 companies to 75 this year reflecting the market’s increased bullishness.

A dozen companies are new to the list led by No. 7 Trane Technologies which was spun off from Ingersoll Rand. Trane is based in Dublin Ireland but senior executives work in Davidson. Five newcomers emerged after initial public offerings: nCino Driven Brands Krispy Kreme Bioventus and Fathom Holdings.

Other newcomers include companies that relocated their headquarters. Hayward Holdings moved from New Jersey Phreesia from New York and Avaya from California.

Departures included Raleigh-based BMC Stock acquired by Builders First Source and Charlotte-based Extended Stay America which was sold to Blackstone and Starwood Capital.

As of July 29th Intel has shipped its last batch of Itanium processors to customers and thus ended the era of this processor family.

Intel Itanium is a 64-bit processor family based on IA-64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). In a joint venture with Hewlett-Packard (HP) Intel decided to develop a new type of processor that would better suit the modern workloads and implement some new ideas in the processor architecture realm.

Itanium-based systems were pushed heavily by the enterprise branch of HP called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) which produced many server systems that contained Itanium processors. HPE called its Itanium-based systems ""Integrity"". Several other vendors have been involved in the production of Itanium-based systems as well but HP was the primary driver of the platform growth.

HP even developed its own special HP-UX operating system (OS) based on Unix System V. This OS was used to power HPE Integrity servers running Itanium processors and PA-RISC instruction set architecture which was also highly specialized ISA exclusive to HP.

IA-64 processors promised more efficiency because they lacked the massive legacy software support that x86 processors carry. Being a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) architecture the Itanium architecture relies on a software compiler to calculate in advance which instructions can be executed in parallel so the processor doesn't waste instruction cycles.

In theory this would work well but in practice it resulted in limited software support for everyday server workloads due to the need for special compilers. HP's own HP-UX OS support is ending with the Integrity servers based on Itanium processors which are supposed to be supported until December 31st 2025. On that date the latest version of HP-UX 11i v3 (B.11.31) will be at the end of life.

As the processor family has made its last shipments this year just a few days ago we are witnessing the end of an era that lasted for over 20 years. Itanium launched in July 2001 and the latest version called Itanium 9700 ""Kittson"" has made its final destination on July 29th when Intel decided to stop any further shipment of the Itanium generation. This marks an era where currently Intel is using only the x86-64 architecture in its server processors going forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLWFsZGVyLWxha2Utcy1kZXNrdG9wLWNwdS0xNi1jb3Jlcy0yNC10aHJlYWRzLXNwb3R0ZWQtb24tcGFyLXdpdGgtaTktMTE5MDBrL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLWFsZGVyLWxha2Utcy1kZXNrdG9wLWNwdS0xNi1jb3Jlcy0yNC10aHJlYWRzLXNwb3R0ZWQtb24tcGFyLXdpdGgtaTktMTE5MDBrL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Alder Lake-S ES Desktop CPU With 16 Cores & 24 Threads Spotted Up To 3.05 GHz Clocks & On Par With i9-11900K,"A new Intel Alder Lake-S Desktop CPU entry featuring 16 cores and 24 threads has been spotted over at UserBenchmark by TUM_APISAK. The said chip seems to be an early Core i9 variant and rocks its performance matches existing high-end Core i9 chips.

Intel Alder Lake-S Desktop CPU Spotted With Benchmarks 16 Core & 24 Thread ES Chip On Par With Core i9-11900K

The sample tested here is an Intel Alder Lake-S Desktop CPU which features 16 cores & 24 threads. This means that the chip houses 8 Golden Cove cores (8 Core / 16 Thread) and 8 Gracemont cores (8 Core / 8 Thread) and rocks 30 MB of the L3 cache. These specifications are close to the Core i9-12900K though the clock speeds are rated at 3.05 GHz which means that either this is an early i9-12900K ES variant or another Core i9 SKU (Core i9-12900). Both the base (1.8 GHz) and boost (3.05 GHz) clocks are very low compared to existing Rocket Lake CPUs which boost beyond 5.0 GHz but that is to be expected from early samples.

We know this from recent reports that the Intel Alder Lake-S Desktop QS samples will be out soon. As for the performance of this particular ES chip the single-core score is reported at 112 points while the multi-core score is reported at 1724 points. The thing with UserBenchmark is that it is only good if you are comparing the performance of the same manufacturer which is why we will be excluding AMD Ryzen CPUs from the comparative list. The Intel Alder Lake chips are going to offer very competitive performance versus the AMD Ryzen 5000 lineup if rumors are to be believed like the one we reported here.

Intel Alder Lake-S 16 Core / 24 Thread ES CPU UserBenchmark Performance (Single-Core) UserBenchmark (Single-Core) 0 40 80 120 160 200 240 0 40 80 120 160 200 240 Intel Core i9-11900K 188 Intel Core i9-10900K 152 Intel Core i9-12900 (ES) 112

Compared to the Core i9-11900K the Intel Alder Lake-S Core i9 ES CPU scores just about the same multi-core score but loses out in the single-core tests. Same is the case with the Core i9-10900K in single-core tests but the Alder Lake chip is beaten in multi-core tests too. This is due to the lower clocks and an early test platform configuration which comprised of dual 8 GB DDR5-4800 memory DIMMs. We can definitely expect performance to improve when the final QS variants hit the street which should be around next month.

The Intel Alder Lake Desktop CPUs and the Z690 platform are expected to launch on the 27th of October & will be the first mainstream consumer platform to utilize PCIe5.0 and DDR5 technologies along with a new hybrid architecture approach something that Microsoft has optimized for its Windows 11 operating system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9jb21tdW5pdHkvdG9waWNzL2ludGVscy1pdGFuaXVtLWlzLWZpbmFsbHktZGVhZC4yNzAzNjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel's Itanium is finally dead,"Looking back: After 20 years of failing to make a mark on the wider computing world Intel finally stopped shipping its Itanium processors this past Thursday. While the company shifted its focus back to the more familiar x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) back in 2004 it kept Itanium going for another decade and a half until it was put on the chopping block in 2019.

Itanium was the offspring of a 1990's partnership between HP and Intel back when the range of ISAs in use was far more diverse than the x86 and Arm titans of today. The IA-64 architecture was designed to push forward into the realms of then-exotic 64-bit computing as well as replace the proprietary solutions in use by many individual companies.

However the project was quickly dubbed ""Itanic"" for the amount of cash being spent on it its ambition and its eventual results. Itanium's promise ended up sunken by a lack of legacy 32-bit support and difficulties in working with the architecture for writing and maintaining software.

The dream of a single dominant ISA wouldn't come about until a few years later but it would come about thanks to the AMD64 extension to the incumbent x86 instruction set. Then-senior VP (and now-CEO) Pat Gelsinger was steering the Intel's Digital Enterprise Group at the time and when 64-bit capability and multi-core computing came to x86 the company's Xeons proved much better suited to the market's demands.

The rest is history -- ol' reliable x86-64 remains the ISA of choice to this day only challenged by Arm and ended up substantially outpacing its Itanium cousin handily in both core counts and clock speeds. Even so Intel continued to work on Itanium over the years until the last generation was announced in 2017.

That has finally come to a conclusion this week when the last Itanium silicon shipped. But if you're an extremely brave enterprise user with a very specific platform from two decades ago The Register seems to have spotted a whole load of Itanium parts on the second-hand market. Go wild.

Day 1 with the @intel Israel team in the books. Great views…incredible opp to see @GetThunderbolt innovation …a validation lab tour and time with the team…can’t wait to see what tomorrow brings! pic.twitter.com/GKOddA6TNi — Gregory M Bryant (@gregorymbryant) August 1 2021

EVP and GM of Intel’s Client Computing Group Gregory Bryant is this week spending some time at Intel’s Israel R&D facilities in his first overseas Intel trip in of 2021. An early post on Sunday morning showcasing Bryant’s trip to the gym to overcome jetlag was followed by another later in the day with Bryant being shown the offices and the research. The post contained four photos but was rapidly deleted and replaced by a photo with three (in the tweet above). The photo removed showcases some new information about next-generation Thunderbolt technology.

In this image we can see a poster on the wall showcasing ‘80G PHY Technology’ which means that Intel is working on a physical layer (PHY) for 80 Gbps connections. Off the bat this is double the bandwidth of Thunderbolt 4 which runs at 40 Gbps.

The second line confirms that this is ‘USB 80G is targeted to support the existing USB-C ecosystem’ which follows along that Intel is aiming to maintain the USB-C connector but double the effective bandwidth.

The third line is actually where it gets technically interesting. ‘The PHY will be based on novel PAM-3 modulation technology’. This is talking about how the 0 and 1s are transmitted – traditionally we talk about NRZ encoding which just allows for a 0 or a 1 to be transmitted or a single bit. The natural progression is a scheme allowing two bits to be transferred and this is called PAM-4 (Pulse Amplitude Modulation) with the 4 being the demarcation for how many different variants two bits could be seen (either as 00 01 10 or 11). PAM-4 at the same frequency thus has 2x the bandwidth of an NRZ connection.

So what on earth in PAM-3?



From Teledyne LeCroy on YouTube

PAM-3 is a technology where the data line can carry either a -1 a 0 or a +1. What the system does is actually combine two PAM-3 transmits into a 3-bit data signal such as 000 is an -1 followed by a -1. This gets complex so here is a table:

PAM-3 Encoding AnandTech Transmit

1 Transmit

2 000 -1 -1 001 -1 0 010 -1 1 011 0 -1 100 0 1 101 1 -1 110 1 0 111 1 1 Unused 0 0

When we compare NRZ to PAM-3 and PAM-4 we can see the rate of data transfer for PAM-3 is in the middle of NRZ and PAM-4. The reason why PAM-3 is being used in this case is to achieve that higher bandwidth without the extra limitations that PAM-4 requires to be enabled.

NRZ vs PAM-3 vs PAM4 AnandTech Bits Cycles Bits Per

Cycle NRZ 1 1 1 PAM-3 3 2 1.5 PAM-4 2 1 2

PAM-3 has similar limitations to NRZ.

The final line on this image is ‘[something] N6 test-chip focusing on the new PHY technology is working in [the lab and] showing promising results’. That first word I thought was TSMC but it has to be about the same width as the ‘The’ on the line above. So it doesn’t look like I’m right there but N6 is a TSMC node.

Intel’s goal with Thunderbolt is going to be both driving bandwidth power and utility but also right now it seems keeping it to the USB-C standard is going to be a vital part of keeping the technology useful for users who can fall back on standard USB-C connections. Right now Intel’s TB4 is a superset that includes USB4 so we might see another situation where TB5 is ready to be a superset of USB5 as well however it seems that USB standards are slower to roll out than TB standards right now.

Special thanks to David Schor from WikiChip for the tipoff.

Intel's Next Unit of Computing (NUC) platform has been around long enough that it's probably lost its ""next"" status but that doesn't stop the company from continuing to churn out new versions as its Core processors get refreshed. With each new iteration of the NUC we can expect an NUC Extreme version designed for gamers and other high-performance PC users housed in a compact case with a skull logo etched on it and code-named with a scary-sounding Canyon-based moniker.

Following in the lineage of such predecessors as Skull Canyon Hades Canyon and Ghost Canyon the new Beast Canyon has just been released under the official name of NUC 11 Extreme Kit. As with its predecessors the kit is based around the latest top-performing Intel Core processors housed in a small-form-factor chassis with room for a full-size graphics card up to 64GB of RAM and a number of storage options via a quartet of M.2 slots. The chassis is branded with the signature (removable) skull logo complete with RGB lighting to customize it to your taste. It features Intel's Compute Element which packages the CPU motherboard and memory and storage slots into a single card-like unit that can be swapped out for a different version.

The Beast Canyon NUC is available in two configurations based on your eight-core Tiger Lake processor choice -- either an unlocked Core i7-11700B or a Core i9-11900KB. (Note that both are 65W chips so they won't be as blazing as the beefier 125W full desktop versions.) While you supply the RAM graphics and storage the kit does come with a 650-watt power supply and a trio of 92mm fans to handle the components you add (up from the 80mm fans in the Ghost Canyon NUC). It also supplies a range of connectivity options including a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports eight USB 3.1 ports HDMI 2.0b port and Wi-Fi 6E AX210 and Bluetooth 5.2 wireless antennas.

Beast Canyon also comes with a beast of a price tag considering you'll have to spend a hefty amount on the high-performance memory GPU and storage this system demands. Intel's starting price for the Core i7 version is $1150 while the Core i9 edition will start at $1350. If you want to find out if it's worth the cost check out our sister site CNET's hands-on preview of the NUC 11 Extreme Kit."

Here's why it's unlikely to come to Wall Street anytime soon,"The push for a four-day workweek has gained traction during the coronavirus pandemic even grabbing the attention of Congress but a shorter workweek may be difficult to implement on Wall Street.

The finance sector has ""always been a culture of heavy hours and working a lot"" said Jason Snipe founder and CIO of Odyssey Capital Advisors. ""Now that we've been forced to stop to a certain degree and reorient ourselves because of the Covid environment it has allowed us to reexamine what that culture is.""

Proponents of a shorter workweek point to the harm overworking does to a person's physical and mental health as a reason to shift to fewer hours.

James Angel associate professor of finance at Georgetown University said he would be surprised if U.S. stock exchanges shortened their trading hours.

""If anything we might see longer trading hours"" he said. ""People trade more when the market is open and the industry knows this. So they certainly are going to be in no hurry to shut down the cash register.""

The stock market does have a history of changing trading hours. In 1952 the New York Stock Exchange got rid of Saturday trading hours and it added a half-hour to the trading day in the 1980s.

There could be potential benefits to shortening hours such as attracting more diverse talent to the industry.

""How can we make the business more attractive to women and other people who've previously been discriminated against in the industry?"" Angel said. ""One of the things floating around in Europe is the idea of shortening their trading hours.""

Longer hours on the other hand could be beneficial to certain market participants such as West Coast investors.

There are some regulatory caveats for exchanges looking to change their hours. If an exchange would like to alter its trading hours it would have to first get approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange declined CNBC's request for comment.

When it has been enquired upon the realist perspective[1] has dominated: international sport was seen as another clash of billiard balls and this clash was studied for its implication on diplomacy security military power etc. (Budd and Levermore 2004: Introduction 8). In recent times with an increase in the political economic and social influence of sport there has been a diversification of sports actors due to the rise of domestic leagues and sports clubs. This trend urges us to look beyond the nation-state boundary when studying the intersection of sport and international relations. This paper aims to examine one such domestic sports league the National Basketball Association through the lens of mediascape[2] and uncover the tactics employed to project it as a global superior but American brand. The paper also unpacks the recent controversial interaction between China and the NBA that highlights its unique selling point.

The NBA: History and Background

Today the NBA a domestic league in the USA is inseparable from basketball. It is the most widely-watched league with the best players in the world. The NBA is not only the biggest league in basketball but also one of the most significant spectacles in the history of sports with fans around the globe. In the 2017-18 season the league had more than 1 billion unique viewers. Furthermore more than 35% of the visitors to their official website NBA.com are from outside North America (Murray 2019). The NBA’s global presence and financial success however are the result of a long journey.

The 1970s and early 1980s were challenging times for the NBA as it battled with financial losses low ratings and high drug usage among players (Jackson and Andrews 1996). In 1984 as David Stern became NBA Commissioner he brought in a series of reforms such as a stern anti-drug policy and salary caps that were accompanied with the opportune arrival of a new generation of exceptional players vanguarded by Larry Bird and Magic Johnson that put a dying league on the path to recovery and eventual global growth (Jackson and Andrews 1996). The most significant factor in the popular rise of the NBA was broadcasting organised by the league’s administrators and masterminded by David Stern. He understood the global power and influence the American culture held and that this culture depended heavily on imagery. Using the expanding avenues of media and employing a particular brand of imagery Stern strove to attach the NBA to the ‘American’ making it a popular commodity-sign transcending its economic value to become a cultural icon.[3] By the early 1990’s the NBA had established itself as a “basic American pastime” (Jackson and Andrews 1996: 58). The league’s revenue grew as a result of ticket sales corporate sponsorships television contracts and licensed merchandise retail. The NBA’s gross income grew tenfold in a decade as it leaped from $110 million at the start of the 1980s to over $1 billion by 1994 (Jackson and Andrews 1996). Around the same time having saturated the domestic market the NBA decided to go global and transformed into the transnational conglomerate we see today.

The NBA — An American Mediascape

At the heart of the success of the NBA we see a powerful connection between the association and the United States of America as a country. It is only natural that the location of an international league would have a strong influence on the league itself. Still in the case of the NBA we see a disproportionate amount of importance given to the brand of ‘America’ evident from the use of the colours of the USA national flag in its logo. The association is surprising considering the NBA is a private corporation owned and managed by the team owners who belong to various countries. An explanation emerges if we see the NBA as an ‘American mediascape’. Arjun Appadurai coined the term ‘mediascape’ to describe mediums of mass communication and information dissemination and the images projected through these mediums. According to Appadurai

What is most important about these mediascapes is that they provide (especially in their television film and cassette forms) large and complex repertoires of images narratives and ‘ethnoscapes’ to viewers throughout the world in which the world of commodities and the world of ‘news’ and politics are profoundly mixed.” Appadurai 1990: 299

The NBA becomes one such mediascape as it presents to its global audience a complicated yet unified narrative via television and radio newspaper coverage billboard and online advertisement merchandise shops and products. This image-centric narrative which is based on “strips of reality” offers its audience a “script of imagined lives” (Appadurai 1990: 299). The NBA helps its audience imagine a life of their own as well as certain others whether it be a player a coach or a fan in the USA. The mediascape subsequently shapes itself according to the behaviour of its audience. The primary reason for the NBA’s obsession with its sports stars is the fan reactions to them. Today the entire league revolves mainly around these famous players evidenced by the NBA’s policy instituted in 2019 that does not allow teams to rest marquee players during nationally televised games (Golliver 2019). Fans stay involved in the personal lives of the players via social media. The lives of successful athletes living in the USA is of great popular interest. LeBron James one of the most successful players in the league has 54 million followers on Instagram (Gallo 2019). Through social media platforms and all the other forms of mass communication the audience of the NBA at a distance from direct experience of the league perceive the ‘imagined world’ of the NBA and the fictional landscape of America.

The Global American NBA

Even though the Americanisation of the NBA and its impacts across the world are the results of a post-Cold War ongoing process of global cultural homogenisation the league makes a concious effort to project its American identity. This attempt is interesting because unlike the NBA a lot of American transnational corporations holding global currency owing to their roots often follow a policy of “global localisation” (Jackson and Andrews 1996). This approach helps companies with an international market to blend with the local culture to make their product more appealing and to blend with the native milieu. The NBA on the other hand follows an ideology of cultural exception. The NBA’s popularity is grounded in retaining and exhibiting a sense of difference rather than assimilating in the local culture. Josh Rosenfeld a former PR director for the New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers articulated the NBA’s exaggerated American identity and global appeal for this commodity-sign when he said “people in other countries … like the NBA because they want the American look and the American image. And that’s what they get with the NBA … Americana a piece of America (Jackson and Andrews 1996: 62).” The NBA and basketball are marketed to foreign audiences as a sport inextricable from the US.

The NBA is also presented as a “credible and desirable commodity within the global sports marketplace” that seeks “cosmopolitan identification” (Falcous and Maguire 2006:73). These two processes together invariably reinforce American cultural hegemony. Falcous and Maguire in their text ‘Imagining ‘America’: The NBA and local-global mediascapes’ analyse the mediated presence of the NBA in the UK and identify the processes mentioned above being put to use. By looking at the NBA game broadcasts they notice an attempt to establish the NBA as a ‘world class’ sport in comparison to ‘local’ sports (Falcous and Maguire 2006). One such game commentary displayed the subordination of locally popular sports and aggrandising of the relatively culturally-marginalised sport of basketball:

Turner: What a wicked weekend for sports fans there’s the speed of Formula One from Australia . . . Redmond: Or the power of international rugby in the Five Nations . . . Turner: Or there’s the glamour of the quarter-finals of the FA Cup — how big is that? Remond: but there’s one sport that has got it all — speed power and glamour. Turner: It’s the NBA here on ITV.” NBA ’99 06/03/99

There was also a constant presence of educational elements and stereotyping of America in the NBA mediascape in the UK as noted by Falcous and Maguire. An authentic US commentary was edited to place local cultural references and explanations of American basketball terminology. Pre-game visuals consisted of images of US cities malls freeways and stadiums cheerleaders etc. with familiar themes of opulence conspicuous consumption pleasant climate and immense love for basketball. Falcous and Maguire note “this comparison of ‘ways of life’ reinforces stereotypes of materialism consumption and wealth in the US a ‘land of opportunity’ contrasted with stereotypes of the UK as ‘slower paced’.” (Falcous and Maguire 2006:73)

The joint association of the NBA as global and American results in frequent slippages between the two. This slippage is perhaps best represented by the NBA World vs. USA match that takes place during the All-Star Weekend every year where the best athletes in the NBA from the USA and the rest of the world compete in a globally televised game. While the title of the event may suggest the odds being stacked against the USA the reality is the opposite as the international players are only about a quarter of the total players in the NBA thereby offering a smaller pool to select athletes from. In the past two years Team USA has dominated Team World winning games by a considerable margin of 20 points (ESPN 2019 2020).

The presentation of the NBA as an authentic global sporting spectacle yet profoundly tied to the ideascape of America emerges as a consistent feature in the NBA’s global marketing. However the marketing plan of the NBA cannot be implemented in a similar manner everywhere. Different local markets and countries respond differently. The central argument of Imagining America is that “no matter how apparently powerful the global it is obliged to negotiate with the local especially when the ‘local’ is a former ‘super-power’ with a well-established media industry” (Falcous and Maguire 2006: 75). The result of this negotiation is that when this repertoire of imagery of the NBA is exported to ‘other’ societies from some “mythical simulated [American] homeland” these images to some extent become indigenised and consumed according to the “conjunctural specificities of the local culture” (Jackson and Andrews 1996:63). The negotiation between the global NBA and the local aspect of an increasingly powerful China is explored later in this paper.

What Does the ‘America’ of the NBA Project Look Like?

Having understood how the NBA functions as a mediascape it is equally pertinent to give closer attention to what mediated narrative it exports especially in recent times. Since the first stage of the NBA’s global expansion a narrative that has persevered until today is the already discussed one of wealth and decadence. Originating from the US the NBA mediascape is deeply rooted in capitalist ideology. It is interesting how the NBA not only exports America but also embodies it. The NBA as a global stage for basketball presents itself as a highly competitive yet rewarding space. The NBA is the ultimate league with the best players for which the NBA G League Euroleague Bundesliga and all other leagues around the world act as training grounds. The televised NBA Draft where the thirty teams select new players from US colleges G-league and other international avenues and where every pick is accompanied with cheers claps and tears illustrates that making it to the NBA is a victory in itself. The NBA thus becomes an instrument of upward mobility. In 2019 an advertisement by Nike featuring Greek player Giannis Antetokounmpo the league’s recent Most Valuable Player shows his journey from living in “a single room with his entire family” to dreaming of playing in the NBA as a teenager to becoming the NBA’s best player. (Nike 2019) The league advertises itself as a path to and benchmark for success where the only determinant is one’s merit in the game. This narrative closely resembles the widely held notion of the ‘American dream’ — the idea that success in American society is predicated upon skill or worthiness not luck or heritage.

The ‘American dream’ was championed as a true meritocracy with the lack of systemic barriers to specific groups. The NBA is often marketed as such an egalitarian space. The league proudly boasts its hundred-plus international athletes and the fact that three-quarters of its players are non-white. The administration’s ban of a team owner in 2015 for racist remarks and subsequent life-bans on fans have given the league its progressive image. There has been a conspicuous effort to promote women’s basketball and the WNBA; homophobic speech has been vehemently curtailed and Martin Luther King Jr. Day is annually celebrated (Garcia 2018). All these efforts are laudable but the NBA is by no means a perfect institution: two-thirds of head coaches are white and all of them men the league office staff is majority white and as of 98% of the majority owners were white (Chalabi 2014). The details of the NBA’s checkered history with race and gender are not the focus of this paper. However it is essential to note that the NBA’s efforts to present itself as the “superficial bastion of forward-thinking liberalism” are all geared towards the NBA American brand (Garcia 2018: 105).

The China Controversy

Through its liberal capitalist image the NBA co-opts the cultural flow of ‘America’. The interaction of ‘America’ with various local cultures has been studied extensively. One such interaction of keen academic and political interest is the juxtaposition with communist illiberal China. The moral crisis of conducting business with the economic giant that is China has been a widely contested issue. The NBA faced a similar crisis recently one that was perhaps the most significant litmus test for the corporation as it threatened its $4 billion business with the country (Bhat 2019). On 4th October 2019 Daryl Morey General Manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted in support of the ongoing Hong Kong protests a sensitive topic for China. This tweet blew up into an international diplomatic incident as the Chinese state-controlled media channel CCTV cancelled all NBA broadcasts and Tencent a private streaming partner cancelled all NBA games. The tweet which was taken down almost immediately triggered condemning remarks from Chinese authorities Chinese media and Yao Ming former NBA legend and chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association. The NBA responded with a strong defense for the freedom of speech of the Houston Rockets GM as well as those across the aisle. The league commissioner Adam Silver also quickly dispelled Chinese demands to fire Morey.

China has a history of bullying multinational corporations into retracting controversial political statements and even apologising for them due to the size of its market. Companies like GAP Swarovski Coach Delta Marriott Apple Blizzard and others have been punished in the past and so foreign businesses in China have learned that there is a line not to be crossed (Business insider India 2019). Whenever this line has been crossed companies have prioritised their business interests and stood down. The NBA however did not do so. Adam Silver told reporters in Tokyo: “I do know there are consequences from freedom of speech; we will have to live with those consequences. For those who question our motivation this is about far more than growing our business.” (Elizabeth 2019) However a conflict with China will hamper more than just growth in business. China is the second-largest market for the NBA and the league has invested in the country through building free courts and giving away broadcast rights for free and sending players for pre-season games and tours for years (Kludt 2020). Instead of protecting these business interests the NBA’s decision to refuse to back down makes the NBA one of the first major U.S. corporations to do so. It can be argued that the NBA’s proximity to the notion of ‘America’ explains this anomaly.

Liberalism emerging from its American roots is a central feature of the NBA and its global presence and the league when put in a tight spot chose to maintain it. In a press conference Silver said “at the end of the day though I am an American and there are these values that are deeply rooted in the DNA of the NBA and that includes freedom of expression for our employees.” (Pennyccw YouTube 2019)

The league received widespread appreciation for standing by its principles. However it can be argued that the NBA’s decision was not a principled stance rather an attempt at furthering the NBA’s liberal image. This superficiality explains the league’s efforts to curtail free speech at home after putting up a spirited defense for it. Journalists were not allowed to ask questions related to the controversy and several fans were expelled from games for their ‘Free HK’ posters and chants (Bonesteel 2019).

By choosing to keep its liberal American perception intact the NBA has again displayed its policy of cultural exception. The interaction of its global mediascape with the local cultural specificities of China presented an irreconcilable difference for the NBA. The NBA instead of reconfiguring its strategy as multiple corporations had done in the past retained and flaunted differences. The promise of a piece of ‘Americana’ can be attributed to the league’s global success in the past. However we are yet to see the complete results of this policy in the case of China. There are signs of easing tensions though — as of February 2020 Tencent has resumed streaming NBA games (Kludt 2020). The Chinese consul general expressed gratitude for the league’s $1.4 million donations to Hubei Province the epicentre of the Coronavirus pandemic (Kludt 2020). The future of this tenuous relationship depends on China’s response to difference.

Conclusion

The global cultural flow of ‘America’ has a strong presence in the mediascape of the transnational corporation NBA. The league has hegemonised basketball and latches onto the cultural icons of ‘America’ and the ‘American dream’ to cater to global audiences. A study of NBA broadcasts in the UK reveals the varied tactics employed to present the basketball league as a global superior American product. A closer look at this product reveals its capitalist and liberal brand image a result of its marketing as an American commodity-sign. These observations explain the corporation’s behaviour in its most controversial period owing to its stand-off with China. This perspective not only strengthens our observations but also sheds some new light on the incident.

More importantly the enquiry into the China controversy aids our understanding of both the place sports occupies in global politics and how it reflects global politics. The gradual acquiescence of China and the NBA’s clampdown on speech surrounding Hong Kong are indicators of the negotiation between the global and the local. In the end these negotiations are a function of power differentials. The global is powerful. The power of the global in this case the NBA stems from the “specific charisma of a particular sport and nation” (Falcous and Maguire 74) However no matter how influential the outsider has to make concessions to the indigenous. The degree of these concessions depends on the power of the local. While this model can be useful to study a lot of processes linked to globalisation this paper outlines the scope of sports to study the global-local dichotomy and cultural flows.

[1] A feature of realism is maintaining the level of inquiry at the nation-state and looking at the actions of these countries in the international sphere. This approach has been touted as the billiard ball or black box approach as realism refuses to look inside a nation-state. Sports has also been seen in the same perspective and therefore the study of international tournaments and events like the Olympics or the World Cup has dominated enquiry in this field.

Pulmac Systems International Brings the Information Age to Pulp and Paper

by Janice St. Onge president of the Flexible Capital Fund

The pulp and paper industry is not known for its cutting-edge technology or pushing the frontiers of innovation. In fact little has changed in the 150 years since wood pulp was first used to make paper at the Smith Paper Company. But where others may see an aging industry Pam Cowan chief marketing and financial officer at Pulmac Systems International sees one that is ripe for change.

Pulmac was founded 50 years ago by Pam’s grandfather Elijah Cowan an engineer who consulted with the pulp and paper industry to improve efficiency. Over the decades the business was passed down through the generations evolving to meet the needs of the industry it served. Pam’s father Wavell transformed Pulmac into a manufacturer of instruments that improve paper quality and mill productivity many of which the company still sells today. More recently Pam along with her brother Joff and husband Bob brought the company into the information age incorporating technologies that allowed mills to use data to operate more efficiently and produce stronger lighter materials.

“Our core competency has always been fiber knowledge” said Pam Cowan “and our mission now is to use that knowledge to move the industry toward a culture of innovation.”

Improving Efficiency and Sustainability

With increased demand for lighter stronger materials that reduce a company’s shipping costs and carbon footprint and in the context of corporate America’s move toward sustainable use of both energy and raw material Pulmac is focusing on technologies that allow mills to diagnose and improve the qualities of the end product.

“Imagine you are Anheuser-Busch and you need to buy boxes to move your product around the world” explained Cowan. “You want those boxes to have compressive strength tear strength and bonding strength—and you want them to be thin and light so they don’t add weight to your shipping costs. That all starts with the quality of the fibers in the pulp which we can diagnose and adjust before the pulp hits the press.”

In 2015 Pulmac developed the FiberRouterTM a data and equipment system that allows mills to produce paper using 30 percent less raw material by removing weaker fibers from the pulp. In addition to producing a stronger product the FiberRouterTM promised reduced waste improved utilization of both pulp and recycled material and reduced energy costs. The company saw an opportunity to commercialize the new technology and turned to Janice St. Onge at the Flexible Capital Fund for funding.

“At that time my brothers and I were not in agreement about the direction of the company” said Cowan “and most traditional lenders would look at the family dynamics and say ‘no thank you’ but Janice looked beyond all that to the core value of our product and stayed at the table. We would not have survived if she had not shown that confidence in us.”

The Flexible Capital Fund invested a $200000 term loan plus a royalty kicker allowing Pulmac to complete a lab trial and put into motion the next phase of testing which led to a patent for the FiberRouterTM in 2018 a second patent in 2019 and a third in 2021. A fourth patent is expected later this year.

Though the first sale of the $5 million dollar piece of equipment fell through Cowan had a second buyer from Montreal seriously interested—and then COVID-19 hit. “Almost immediately Americans were not able to cross the border” she said “and we could not get there to close the deal. It almost sunk us.”

Pulp and Paper 4.0

Although sales dropped by 50 percent during the pandemic the company did not sink. In fact the global “pause” gave the company a chance to take a step back and evaluate their business. Cowan participated in regular calls organized by the Flex Fund to tap into the support of other entrepreneurs and leaned into the fresh perspectives offered by her advisors and board members including St. Onge.

“We had some time to look at our products and to think about the common thread which is data” said Cowan. A strategist by nature Pam’s husband and business partner Bob began to explore ways to organize data for mills that would allow them to identify and solve small production problems which she refers to as “pulp and paper version 4.0.”

Today the company has a new supply chain software that keeps track of every step of the process from the purchase of raw materials through to loading boxes on the truck allowing mills to quickly locate and resolve production problems. The data is all collected through smart devices and streams the information back to mill owners.

“Helping the mills collect data also informs our own thinking and product development” said Cowan. “The more we understand our customers’ pain points the better we can serve them.”

For the first time in a while she is optimistic about the future. “2019 was a difficult year and then the pandemic hit” said Cowan. “When you’re running a company you’re constantly on the treadmill. The pandemic allowed us to take a breath and start moving in an exciting direction that is about sustainability and innovation. We came out of the pandemic ready to run and energized about our future.”

When we popped up out of the subway near the stadium I asked him for my ticket. That’s when it got complicated.

I learned that the Yankees no longer believed in paper tickets. I had to download the Ticketmaster app and then engage in a weird dance of ask-permission-grant-access with my friend’s phone which held two digital tickets. It was a clunky process and rather non-intuitive but I eventually got my ticket to display correctly on my iPhone and I was able to show the barcode to the guy at the gate. Frankly it was a bit of an ordeal but if the Yankees were doing it then it was obvious that I’d seen the future.

“Cool” I thought. But I was also annoyed because it meant that I wouldn’t have a souvenir ticket stub from my Yankee experience.

Ever since my first concert — KISS with guests Cheap Trick at the Winnipeg Arena on July 21 1978 — I’d kept the stub from every show I’d ever attended. I began by carefully taping them to the wall in my bedroom eventually creating a timeline of my live music experience. By the time I moved out there were dozens of stubs in a series of vertical rows: KISS Rush Elvis Costello Aerosmith The Eagles Goddo more Rush Van Halen Nazareth Cheap Trick Trooper Supertramp still more Rush and a series of festival tickets.

People would marvel at my wall. “Have you really been to all these shows?” they’d ask. To which I’d reply. “Yep. I’m a concert-goin’ freak.”

Each stub was a story in itself. In those days in Winnipeg you bought tickets at Attractions Box Office (ABO) Celebrity Box Office (CBO) the box office at the venue (Winnipeg Arena Playhouse Theatre the Convention Centre etc.) or from a cool record store like Autumn Stone. All purchases required trips through time and space — no online selling back then! — and were almost always bought with cash. They needed to be stored somewhere safe until the day of the show. In the weeks leading up to the show you might take them out of the envelope and gaze at them in anticipation of the gig. And each ticket told a story.

There was the time I was so awed by seeing Elvis Costello at the Playhouse Theatre on Nov. 15 1978 that I waited outside the stage door to meet him after the show. I have an extra un-torn ticket from a Yes show on April 30 1979 that was supposed to go to a girl but she turned me down. Imagine how I felt next to that empty seat when I saw her on the floor with another guy.

The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world.

I was with a group of friends who lined up on the sidewalk overnight in the spring of 1981 to get Styx tickets only to lose our place in line when the crowd stampeded toward the doors at 9 am. Getting heatstroke on a tarp-covered field waiting for Heart to appear at a festival called August One on (naturally) Aug. 1 1981.

Those experiences and many many more were memorialized by those stubs on my bedroom wall.

When I left home I carefully peeled each stub off the wall gingerly removed the tape and put everything in a shoebox vowing to keep collecting such things and promised myself that one day I’d give them all a proper display maybe in a giant picture frame like I’d seen some do. And I kept saving my ticket stubs for years even after my radio gig began getting me into shows without hard tickets.

The box grew heavy with torn cardstock. David Bowie’s Serious Moonlight Tour Winnipeg Stadium Sept. 14 1983. Amnesty International with Bruce Springsteen Sting Peter Gabriel and more Maple Leaf Gardens Sept. 15 1981. U2 Joshua Tree Tour Exhibition Stadium Oct. 3 1987. New Order CNE Grandstand July 7 1989. Lollapalooza Exhibition Stadium Aug. 9 1991. Pearl Jam Washington-Grizzly Stadium Missoula Montana June 20 1998. And there were many in between and many since.

The paper in that box was a physical record of my musical journey. In an era before the internet and sites like Setlist.fm this was how you kept track of your concert-going life and maturing (or not) as a music fan.

But then somewhere around the turn of the century I started to get careless probably because (and I don’t mean to brag here) I was put increasingly put on a guest list rather than given a hard ticket. When I did need to flash some paper it was more often than not a barcode that I printed out from an email. Not very collectible you know?

As the world became more digital and scalping/counterfeiting/theft became more of a problem hard tickets started disappearing. Some anti-scalping measures involved tying a ticket to your credit card that you’d have to swipe upon entry to the venue.

And not long after that after we end up with me and my buddy outside of Yankee Stadium trying to figure out how to work the Ticketmaster app.

Post-pandemic storing tickets on smartphones is becoming more and more popular as Ticketmaster venues and promoters try to sell tickets that are more secure and digitally tied to the actual purchaser. Festivals now rely on RFID bracelets that you activate online and then tap to get in. And until the public started freaking about potential privacy breaches a number of companies were working on facial recognition technology. (“No more piece of paper! No more bracelets! Your face will be your ticket!”)

Perhaps you know of someone with one of these shoeboxes. The last time I looked at my collection many of the tickets had faded to the point where they couldn’t be read. A few had disintegrated into off-white pieces of nothing. I really should have kept better care of them like a few friends who did the picture frame thing. One has his ticket stubs pressed between two panes of glass that form a lovely coffee table.

Collecting concert ticket stubs will soon be extinct much like the notion of B-sides liner notes and album artwork. Instead our memories will be preserved as selfies taken at our seats or video recordings of the gig that we never watch. Yes there are T-shirts programs and an endless supply of tchotchkes at the merch tables but they all cost money. A ticket stub came with its own memories built into the cost.

The last hard ticket I’ll probably ever collect is for a U2 show at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on August 25 2010 a hologram-adored thing that could be used as a skateboard in a pinch. That one didn’t go in the box. It’s in a frame by itself on the wall.

Meanwhile I’ve put that shoebox someplace very dry and safe. I’ll get those stubs in a frame. One day.

But because our canine friends seemingly cannot convey complex thoughts (to us) their interior lives thoughts and dreams — or lack thereof — remain mysterious to us humans. What are they saying when they bark at each other? How do they feel when they look at us while panting or lick us with what seems to be affection? What are they thinking when they sniff random objects — or each other's butts?

Or are they even thinking anything?

Fortuitously canine experts have been pondering this very subject for years. And it turns out that scientists and behaviorists actually know quite a lot about dogs' interior lives — and even what they are ""saying"" when they bark at each other. Or how they use their anal glands like Facebook pages in which a sniff reveals a trove of personal data.

Even something as seemingly simple as a bark masks a much more complicated meaning.

""They bark primarily when they are alarmed or excited about something and this is also the context in which their ancestors wolves tend to bark though barking in wolves is less common and much more subdued"" Dr. James A. Serpell Professor of Ethics & Animal Welfare University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine told Salon by email. Hence barking may serve as a warning to others about a possible threat or danger making a threat themselves (such as to that pesky mailman) or expressing sympathy for other dogs barking about possible threats or dangers.

Dr. Erica N. Feuerbacher an Associate Professor at Virginia Tech's Department of Animal & Poultry Science told Salon that dogs like birds will perform ""mobbing calls"" meant to call their peers to attention.

""Humans are able to detect differences in some (but not all) dog barks and could often correctly identify the situation the dog was in based solely on its bark (e.g. was it barking at an intruder or was it a happy playful bark)"" Feuerbacher explained.

And while humans don't understand the context and meaning of these barks their fellow canines likely do. Studies appear to confirm that.

""Few studies have looked at whether other dogs can gain information from the barks of other dogs but they do seem to respond differently when they hear a bark from a dog barking at a stranger or a dog barking while alone and they seem to be able to detect individual differences in who the barking dog is"" Feuerbacher said. ""They respond differently to familiar and unfamiliar dogs.""

And when it comes to communication dogs aren't as voice-centric as humans. In fact they often use body language.

""Dogs communicate primarily through body language"" Dr. Catherine Reeve a lecturer on animal welfare and behavior at Queen's University Belfast's School of Psychology wrote to Salon. ""A lot of this communication is subtle and goes unnoticed by most owners.""

When dogs bark at each other according to Reeve it can mean anything from a request for personal space or desire for play to communicating that it is frustrating about being stuck on a leash.

That said dogs do not primarily communicate through barking or body language but olfaction — their sense of smell.

""When sniffing one another dogs are getting all the information they need about other dogs' sexual status health status age etc."" Reeve told Salon.

As Serpell pointed out canine noses are so sensitive to odors that it is difficult for humans to even conceive of how their perception of reality differs from ours.

""It is hard to fully imagine the world from a dog's perspective but not impossible"" Serpell explained. ""Humans after all possess a sense of smell even if it is greatly inferior to that of dogs. So while we derive most of the information about the world around us through our eyes and ears dogs can access an additional layer of information via their noses that we are essentially 'blind' to.""

On the other hand because dogs have poor color vision our eyes are able to process realities that they are literally blind to.

""I think one of the features they use to identify individual humans or dogs is odor"" Feuerbacher wrote. ""I had a dog who had reactivity issues and she occasionally would show affiliative behavior to someone that she didn't know (which was strange for her) and once she smelled them they didn't smell like anyone she knew and then she would bark. We see dogs that don't like going to see veterinarians do the same thing—if you smell like a vet they might not respond as well to you.""

This incidentally may be part of the reason why some dogs will seem to inexplicably hate other dogs or people even if they've never met them. They may smell something ""off"" about that individual that their human friend doesn't notice. This may sound like a recipe for trouble but the reality is that if you want your dog to be happy you should let your canine companion sniff out the world.

""Because of the importance of scent to them I let my dogs do a lot of sniffing on our walks and hikes"" Feuerbacher told Salon. ""It's great enrichment for them. Alexandra Horowitz at Barnard College has written about the importance of letting our dogs sniff. As to how we can start to relate to our dogs she actually got down on her knees and tried to smell where her dog was smelling to try to understand the richness of these experiences for them.""

That richness of experience even extends to the doggie behavior that perhaps causes the most chagrin to human owners: sniffing other dogs' butts.

""Dogs have scent glands around their butts that convey information about the individual"" Serpell explained. ""Butt-sniffing is therefore the canine equivalent of small talk; a way of getting to know more about somebody you've just met.""

Other disgusting dog behaviors — like eating feces vomit insects and other gross things they casually stroll past — also have grounded scientific explanations.

""They evolved as scavengers and are omnivores so this likely is carried over from that—finding smelling things reinforcing is useful in finding food (dogs will often eat gross things—protein is protein!) finding mates and knowing if there are other dogs or predators nearby"" Feuerbacher wrote to Salon.

Many dog behaviors stretch back to their days as wolves. When your dog finds a bone or a toy that it really likes it will bury that object. This is because its DNA is still encoded with instructions from its ancestors' days in the wild.

""Dogs bury things (including food inside the home when there is no dirt) because it is a leftover behavior pattern from their wolf ancestry"" Reeve explained. ""Behavior patterns are kind of like an automatic series of behaviors that are elicited or 'set off' by a particular stimulus."" When your dog buries something it is engaged in a behavior called ""caching"" intended ""to preserve valued items much like a wolf would bury prey they've killed but not eaten in full. Our dogs will do this with their food toys and treats because they are highly valued items.""

This brings us to perhaps the most important question for dog pals: How can we figure out whether our dog likes us or not?

""To understand what our dog is likely feeling we really need to pay attention to many parts of the dog"" Feuerbacher told Salon. ""If they are lip licking excessively panting avoiding our gaze showing us the whites of their eyes tucking their tail cowering and a myriad more behaviors they are likely stressed and uncomfortable. We typically want to see a dog that is balancing it's weight nicely on all four legs (not leaning back or forward) with easy rhythm of breathing maybe a loose wagging tail a loose body (no tension) head not carried abnormally high or low and soft eyes to know they are comfortable.""

Feuerbacher added ""We might get more energy and excitement when our dog is really happy such as when we grab the leash for a walk.""

Serpell made similar observations noting that ""dogs sometimes lick their owners affectionately just as wild canids often groom other members of their families or social groups.""

He also answered the question posed in ""The Secret Life of Pets"" — namely what dogs do when we are out of the house. Do they throw giant parties and have zany madcap adventures?

Probably not. As Serpell told Salon they are ""mostly sleeping unless the dog suffers from separation anxiety in which case it may be destroying the interior of your home or driving your neighbors crazy by barking and howling.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc2NlbmVzdGFyLnR5cGVwYWQuY29tL3NzLzIwMjEvMDcvbmV3LW11c2ljLXZpZGVvLWJpbGxpZS1laWxpc2gtaGFwcGllci10aGFuLWV2ZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Music Video - Billie Eilish ""Happier Than Ever""",ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://thescenestar.typepad.com/ss/2021/07/new-music-video-billie-eilish-happier-than-ever.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc2NlbmVzdGFyLnR5cGVwYWQuY29tL3NzLzIwMjEvMDcvbmV3LW11c2ljLXZpZGVvLWJpbGxpZS1laWxpc2gtaGFwcGllci10aGFuLWV2ZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ) has a number of compelling reasons to consider it as a long-term investment.

It's one of the larger exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with net assets almost $2.1 billion.

This investment is provided by BetaShares one of the biggest providers of ETFs in Australia.

But size is not one of the key factors why it could be worth considering Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF.

Here are three to think about:

Diversification

The S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) is dominated by two industries: financials and resources. Within that there are a few sizeable businesses including Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) Westpac Banking Corp (ASX: WBC) BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) and Rio Tinto Limited (ASX: RIO).

But the Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF is very different. It has 100 non-financial businesses in its portfolio. Resources don't feature in the portfolio either. Almost half of the portfolio is classified as 'information technology' with another 19.7% in 'communication services' and 17.3% in 'consumer discretionary'.

But those classifications may not be exactly what you're thinking. Amazon and Tesla count as consumer discretionary businesses whilst Alphabet (Google) and Facebook count as communication services businesses.

Not only can an investor get exposure to 100 businesses outside of the ASX but those underlying earnings are being generated from right across the world. Think how many countries there are where people can use Google Search. Facebook is also in most countries in the world. And so on.

High-quality businesses

But this ETF isn't just about diversification for the sake of being different.

Many of the businesses in the Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF portfolio are among the best if not the best at what they do.

Apple is one of the global leaders in smartphones computers and the extra services it offers. Microsoft is very strong in numerous categories like office software cloud computing and gaming. Amazon has online retail cloud computing and so on.

However there are quite a few great companies in there not just the 'FAANG' shares.

PayPal is a huge player in the payments and online retail space. Adobe has a number of important offerings.

Broadcom Qualcomm Texas Instruments Intuit Moderna Applied Materials Advanced Micro Devices Intuitive Surgical Zoom and so on.

There are so many quality names in the portfolio that are generating strong profit growth and creating very powerful economic moats.

Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF's strong returns with a reasonable fee

Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF has an annual management fee of 0.48%.

The portfolio of quality names has produced sizeable returns over the shorter-term and longer-term.

However it's important to note that past performance is not an indicator of future performance.

Over the last 12 months the ETF has seen a net return of 31.6%. Since inception in May 2015 Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF has delivered an average return per annum of 22.5%.

However investors will have to wait and see what the next few years of returns looks like.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The updated ruling additionally axed the NFL's mandatory mask mandate for unvaccinated players participating in outdoor practices.

According to Tom Pelissero from the NFL Network ""The NFL informed clubs today of updated COVID protocols including allowing players and staff to have family members on the field after practice and at social events and removing the mask mandate for unvaccinated players during outdoor practices per source.""

Per the new memo released by the NFL:

""For clubs with fewer than 90% of their players fully vaccinated (as reflected in the IQVIA vaccine portal)

The original mandate regarding unvaccinated players prohibited visiting family and friends from engaging with players during team practices and all team-related activities unless approved by the NFL and NFLPA.

The NFL defined Tier 1 personnel as coaches and all participants expected to have direct communications with players. Tier 2 trickles down the same restrictions to personnel that interact with members from Tier 1.

Regarding activities on the field the NFL maintains that unvaccinated players — not actively participating in outdoor practice sessions — will be required to wear masks on the sideline during all outdoor meetings and all indoor settings.

The NFL's backpedaling on mandatory masks provided some leniency for unvaccinated players after various teams and teammates stepped up to criticize the inconsistent mandates. Following a league-wide ruling for teams to openly identify their unvaxxed players — based on the franchise's preferred system — the ruling snowballed into delegating colored bracelets to unvaccinated players for teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",,,,,,,,,,,,
IRM,Iron Mountain,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlyb25tb3VudGFpbmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDcvd2hlcmUtaXMtbmFuY3ktcmVua2FzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where is Nancy Renkas? | News Sports Jobs - The Daily News,"IRON MOUNTAIN — The two women were going to see a camper. On that they all agree.

In early afternoon of July 18 2016 Nancy Renkas met Louise Wender in the parking lot at Midtown Mall in Iron Mountain. Renkas the common-law wife of Wender’s late brother had recommended they both check out a camper she’d seen in the Norway area Wender said.

Renkas’ two children say their mother left their Florence Wis. home that day to buy the fixings for a filet mignon dinner in celebration of the pending sale of their Tranquil-Vista campground in Pembine Wis.

But the family also discussed purchasing a camper that would let them spend nights at their Christmas tree farm in Pembine Wis. rather than having to drive home after long days of trimming trees Kaylyn Renkas said. The trailer too could be used by their grandmother who had slipped on ice outside her home and broken her hip Joseph Renkas said.

Wender maintains that was the primary reason for considering the camper so her mother could live next to her home while still keeping some independence.

A surveillance camera July 18 2016 would show the 47-year-old Renkas getting into a white SUV that Wender acknowledges was her 2010 Lincoln Navigator which then headed east on U.S. 2.

Wender said they never located the camper so after driving around she returned Nancy Renkas to the Midtown Mall parking lot.

Kaylyn Renkas said she texted her mother about 1 p.m. asking another item be added to the shopping list but never got a reply.

“She usually responded right away” Kaylyn Renkas said.

“She would respond instantly” Joseph Renkas added.

Still they expected their mother to return home by 4 p.m. When she didn’t Joseph Renkas said he left work at 4 p.m. to join his sibling the former Marvin Renkas in attempting to reach her.

They had hoped the battery in her cell phone was drained or maybe she decided to visit a friend and was running late they said.

The next morning the Renkas siblings said they contacted family members friends area hospitals and jails in their search before calling the Florence County Sheriff’s Office to report their mother as missing.

“Then we were driving all around just trying to find her” Kaylyn Renkas said.

But July 18 2016 was the last day they saw their mother they said.

Five years later what happened to Nancy Renkas is still unknown despite signboards set up along several prominent travel routes in the Iron Mountain area and her children’s repeated attempts to keep her disappearance in the public eye.

Five years later

Few further details in the Nancy Renkas case have been made public. Detective Lt. Derek Dixon of the Dickinson County Sheriff’s Office told The Daily News he was not permitted to speak to media about the investigation without authorization. Dickinson County Undersheriff Scott Metras later stated by email the sheriff’s office had no comment.

In July 2018 Dixon and Metras said they chose to be selective on what they made public to avoid compromising the investigation and possible future prosecution.

The two officers did say then Nancy Renkas last was seen about 12:30 p.m. July 18 2016 in the parking lot outside Super One Foods. That she left perishable groceries in her vehicle indicated she believed it would be a brief trip Metras said at the time.

The SUV driver was classified as a “person of interest” early in the investigation and was interviewed by both Florence and Dickinson County law enforcement Metras said in 2018 adding authorities later determined that person provided “false and misleading” information regarding contact with Nancy Renkas on July 18 2016.

That prompted law enforcement to search the person’s SUV and cell phone and raise the investigation level from a person of interest to a “suspect” Metras said in 2018. That suspect then retained an attorney and did not cooperate further with law enforcement he said.

In August 2020 Dixon testified during an online court hearing that suspect was Louise Wender who had sought a protective order against another woman she claimed was harassing her on social media about the disappearance.

The Daily News previously had not published Wender’s name because she had not been charged with a crime.

But Wender — who is Kaylyn and Joseph Renkas’ aunt — and her attorney Jeffrey Paupore spoke to The Daily News earlier this month saying her name now has been so widely circulated as the suspect that they wanted to tell her side of the story.

“The bell has been rung” Paupore said on the name being made public. Wender and her family have been marked in the community he said.

‘She’s just innocent’

They claim Louise Wender has been followed targeted and intimidated with authorities questioning family and staff at Super One Foods where she’s been a bookkeeper for more than 30 years.

Strangers have shown up at her workplace shouted accusations at her Wender said. She’s been decried on social media had garbage thrown in her driveway.

“It’s ruined our life. It has ruined our life” Wender said. “We put on a brave front but there isn’t a day that I don’t hear a siren and my insides turn to Jell-O.”

Her Lincoln Navigator and iPhone were impounded for more than four years until Dickinson County Circuit Judge Julie LaCost ordered they be released this past April on the grounds the original search warrant didn’t include seizing the items.

They dispute the portrayal of Wender as making “false and misleading” statements to investigators. “That’s their side of the story. That’s their spin on it. There was no untruthfulness at all” Paupore said.

“So far no charges” Paupore said. Yet her name continues to be tied to the Nancy Renkas case.

“Florence County Iron Mountain PD Dickinson County Sheriff and the FBI have had this case for five years and they can’t even name a crime” Paupore said. “But they name a suspect without proof. That is so wrong.”

They contend Wender was on good terms with Nancy Renkas that she would regularly come into Super One to talk with her — enough that two Super One employees recognized and reported seeing Renkas at the store two days after her disappearance when Wender was not working. Those employees have filed sworn affidavits on the sighting Wender said.

“The police were provided with these affidavits — copies of them — by previous counsel” but investigators dismissed those claims Paupore said.

The surveillance footage that shows Nancy Renkas getting into Wender’s vehicle came from the Krist Food Mart across the street from the Super One parking lot Paupore said. Neither Paupore or Wender know if any footage exists showing Nancy Renkas’ return.

Nancy Renkas was “fine — and I told investigators that –“ when Wender left her back in the Midtown Mall parking lot that day Wender said.

She now prays that Nancy Renkas will reappear to show Wender has been truthful these past five years Paupore said.

“She’s just innocent of any wrongdoing” Paupore said adding “the only thing she’s guilty of is being with Nancy that day.”

Seeking closure

Nancy Renkas’ children who now live in Missouri declined to comment on their aunt’s statements. But they too hope for a conclusion to their mother’s disappearance five years ago. It came less than a year after losing their father Mark Barker in October 2015 at only age 54.

“I know there’s got to be somebody out there that knows something” Kaylyn Renkas said. “My brother and I struggle with this every day and July is especially painful for us because it reminds us of what could have been.”

“We’d like to get it resolved and find out what happened to our mom” Joseph Renkas said. “Just so we have closure.”

“She was always the guiding light for us and for this to happen has just been catastrophic for the both of us” Kaylyn Renkas said.

Specifically petroleum oil and lubricant experts will spend the next few weeks preparing to refuel aircraft from across the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's area of responsibility.



""Our team is here practicing new operations and concepts while ensuring the smallest footprint possible to actively accomplish our mission"" said Tech. Sgt. Patrick Barlow 366th Logistics Readiness Squadron deployed from Mountain Home Air Force Base Idaho acting fuels section chief. ""Our number one priority is to safely provide fuel support to our mission partners during operation Pacific Iron.""



Barlow arrived on Tinian early and began operating in a multi-capable Airmen role immediately.



""Along with being responsible for my POL team here part of being a cross-functional team means I am also the acting on-ground liaison ensuring all units are communicating and mission-ready. This is just one example that demonstrates the MCA skill set which allows us to be more agile and flexible when performing operations.""



Barlow is coordinating operations with five Air units on Tinian as well as local government officials in order to make the mission successful for the whole force.



The team worked for days in scorching heat and torrential downpours to ensure the equipment is operational for when aircraft arrive.



""This team is actually brought together from different bases but from the same career field"" said Staff Sgt. Darren Albrecht 36gth LRS fuel operations supervisor. ""We are all learning from each other and operating as multi-capable Airmen. This is one of the more challenging operations we have done so our team coming together and working so cohesively so quickly has made this a really rewarding experience.""



The ability for small groups of Airmen to refuel aircraft using bulk fuel bladders from any location assists the use of agile combat operations generating resilient airpower in contested environments.



According to Barlow having the capability to arrive at a location and be operational within 24 hours is key to achieving the main goal.



""We are using the fuel bladder to store the fuel we receive and then are able to deliver it to any aircraft who comes into our area of operations and requires it"" he said.



Albrecht further explained by saying that getting equipment set up in a short amount of time is essential to air superiority so the aircraft can get back into the air and take the fight to the enemy anytime anywhere.



""This is such a unique opportunity to practice these skills"" he said. ""Tinian is a beautiful island and the local residents are so friendly and helpful. We really appreciate their hospitality and are taking advantage of this chance to perform such a dynamic and challenging mission.""



Being able to get fuel across the USINDOPACOM theater of operations is important due to its vast size. The command’s area of responsibility is more than 100 million square miles or roughly 52% of the Earth’s surface stretching from the west coast of the United States to the west coast of India and from the Arctic to the Antarctic making this an important capability.



""I'm excited to take these experiences concepts and lessons back to Mountain Home Air Force Base and pass them on to the Airmen there"" Albrecht said. ""This helps us to ensure long-term warfighting readiness around the globe.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcm9ubW91bnRhaW5kYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9sb2NhbC1zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wNy91cyVFMiU4MCU4OG9seW1waWFuLXN0aWxsLWEteW9vcGVyLWF0LWhlYXJ0LXdpbnMtc2lsdmVyLWF0LXRva3lvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Olympian 'still a Yooper at heart' wins silver at Tokyo,"A U.S. Olympian born in Iron Mountain earned a silver medal in women’s 10-meter synchronized platform diving at the Tokyo Games.

Delaney Schnell 22 of Tucson Ariz. was the bronze medalist in individual platform at the world championships in 2019. At the Olympics on Tuesday she teamed in the 10-meter synchronized event with Jessica Parratto 27 who had helped end Schnell’s Olympic hopes in 2016.

Their second-place finish marked the best U.S. performance in the event’s Olympic history

“Jess and I just ended up making it work” Schnell said. “Took a lot of faith in each other a lot of trust in each other that paid off.”

Born in Iron Mountain in December 1998 to Robert and Cynthia Schnell the future Olympian soon moved with her family to the Menominee area where she would spend the first three years of her life.

Although Schnell’s school years were spent in Arizona she told WJMN-TV earlier this year that she is “still a Yooper at heart.”

“Every time I go back I just feel so at peace” she said. “That’s my happy place. I love going back up there and visiting family there.”

Parratto and Schnell were competing for just the third time together having teamed suddenly at the U.S. trials after Schnell’s partner got hurt.

They each had past success on their own. Schnell a first-time Olympian was the first U.S. female individual medalist in the 10-meter platform at a World Championships since Olympic gold medalist Laura Wilkinson in 2005.

Parratto was seventh in individual platform at the Rio Games in 2016. She earned a berth in the synchronized event at Rio by beating Schnell and her partner at trials.

Parratto and Schnell were next to last after their first dive Tuesday but worked their way higher over the next two rounds to earn the first U.S. medal in the event with 310.80 points.

“Not a scoreboard watcher but honestly I knew we were kind of behind” Parratto said. “That lit my fire. I knew we could hit the dives.”

China couldn’t be caught for the gold with Chen Yuxi and Zhang Jiaqi leading all the way.

Chen and Zhang totaled 363.78 over five rounds. They received two perfect 10s for execution on their second dive in the mostly empty 15000-seat Tokyo Aquatics Centre. Gabriela Agundez Garcia and Alejandra Orozco Loza of Mexico earned bronze at 299.70.

Schnell a University of Arizona student was the 2021 Pac-12 Diver of the Year. Her planned major is psychology with a career ambition in occupational therapy.

As the top U.S. qualifier she is slated to compete in the individual 10-meter platform dive beginning Wednesday in Tokyo.

Winning the bronze medal in individual 10-meter platform at the 2019 World Championships was the “turning point” Schnell said in boosting her confidence.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWNhZi5hZi5taWwvTmV3cy9BcnRpY2xlLURpc3BsYXkvQXJ0aWNsZS8yNzE2NDY1L3BhY2lmaWMtYWlyLWZvcmNlcy1jb21tYW5kZXItdmlzaXRzLWFpcm1lbi1wYXJ0aWNpcGF0aW5nLWluLXBhY2lmaWMtaXJvbi0yMS1vbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pacific Air Forces commander visits Airmen participating in Pacific Iron 21 on Guam Tinia,"U.S. Air Force Gen.

The Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award recognizes employers who go above and beyond in their support of employees who are National Guard or Reserve service members.

Of the 15 awards handed out to both businesses and municipalities Minnesota had two companies selected for going far beyond the requirements of the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act: Marcus Construction of Willmar and Medtronic of Minneapolis.

“It is a distinct honor for two Minnesota employers to receive this award” said Gov. Tim Walz. “I’m grateful to Marcus Construction and Medtronic for ensuring that when their employees who serve in the National Guard are called to duty they are supported and appreciated at home.”

Award recipients include small and large employers in both the private and public sectors. They are nominated by a National Guard or Reserve component employee who works within their organization.

“Knowing my dad and my grandpa (Marcus has) always been an employee-first family-style culture” said Taylor Marcus business development manager for Marcus Construction. “So I think we recognize the sacrifices that (service members) ... make. I think for us it's just 'how do we help? How do we pitch in?'”

Dan O’Meara works for Marcus Construction as a safety compliance officer and company pilot. For at least one weekend a month and two weeks a year he is better known as Lt. Col. O’Meara with the Minnesota National Guard’s 34th Infantry Division currently assigned to Division Headquarters.

O’Meara said that after being in the National Guard for 29 years “it's all the little things” that Marcus Construction does to make the company stand out as an employer.

Many of the employers who were honored offer enhanced pay and benefits packages; flexible scheduling and generous leave policies; and pre-and post-deployment support.

“Being an officer and an aviator the whole ‘one weekend a month two weeks in the summertime’ thing that went out the window a long time ago” O’Meara said. “I get phone calls all throughout the week or I'll have meetings during the week. You know there's always something going on and (Ross Marcus CEO of Marcus Construction) is very accommodating to what I need to do in order to keep both careers going.”

With the award ceremony at the national level being canceled this year due to COVID-19 concerns awards will be presented at the state level. Marcus Construction is scheduled to receive its award Aug. 18 in Willmar.

The 2021 Freedom Award recipients will be recognized by Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve state chairs.

“I am proud to salute the outstanding employers who have earned the distinction of being named Freedom Award recipients as we mark the 25th year of this highly coveted recognition” said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in the news release announcing the awards. “The men and women of the National Guard and Reserve make significant contributions to our communities and our national security through their civilian and military careers. We owe a debt of gratitude to these exemplary employers who by valuing and supporting their employees’ military service enhance the strength readiness and diversity of our National Guard and Reserve forces.”

Selected companies have implemented robust training to equip human resources professionals and managers to support their organization’s military serving employees; stayed connected to deployed employees by sending care packages; and have taken care of their employees’ families during deployments by assisting with household repairs including them in company functions or providing financial assistance.

JKHY,Jack Henry & Associates,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbmFseXN0LWVzdGltYXRlcy1oZXJlcy1icm9rZXJzLXRoaW5rLTExNDUyNzY2MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Analyst Estimates: Here's What Brokers Think Of Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) After Its Third-Quarter ...,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) shareholders because the company has just released its latest quarterly results and the shares gained 4.0% to US$169. It was a credible result overall with revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 both in line with analyst estimates showing that Jack Henry & Associates is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

Check out our latest analysis for Jack Henry & Associates

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a solid 8.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 11% to US$5.75. Before this earnings report the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$181 showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Jack Henry & Associates analyst has a price target of US$200 per share while the most pessimistic values it at US$170. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting Jack Henry & Associates is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 6.7% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 3.6% per year. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady in line with previous estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$181 with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.

Following on from that line of thought we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St we have a full range of analyst estimates for Jack Henry & Associates going out to 2026 and you can see them free on our platform here..

Yet the prosperous and relatively urbane Jewish community of England was recently split into two warring camps in a dispute over precisely this tenet. For the offense of having called it into question Dr. Louis Jacobs one of the most prominent of the younger Orthodox rabbis in England was hounded out of the United Synagogue the country's largest and hitherto most latitudinarian synagogal organization. As a further consequence the management committee of Jacobs's congregation—made up of some of the most distinguished figures in public and Jewish life—was removed from office by the United Synagogue's governing council. In the course of the struggle this council combined with the Rabbinical establishment (which is composed mainly of recent immigrant stock) to rout the old patrician Anglo-Jewish families who had founded the United Synagogue and previously dominated it.

The Jacobs affair was significant on various levels. As a theological dispute it involved a clash between fundamentalism and revision reform modernization—there seems to be no neutral word for religious change. As an exercise in ecclesiastical politics it was worthy of a C.P. Snow novel presenting as it did the spectacle of moderate reformers being out-maneuvered by diehards with greater political zeal and fewer scruples. Finally and most importantly it was a symptom of a deep and persistent crisis within the Anglo-Jewish community. For the passions aroused by the Jacobs affair indicated to what a large extent the process of Anglicization is felt by many people to be a threat to Jewish survival itself.

_____________

Orthodoxy in England is by no means limited to “Torah-true” Jews as those who are Orthodox in the American sense frequently call themselves; the latter account for only about 10 per cent of the membership of the United Synagogue.1 A second group within that organization is roughly comparable to the right-wing of American Conservative Judaism but most members of the United Synagogue do not fall into either of these categories. For them Orthodoxy simply means residual Jewishness an unwillingness to break away completely from the religious community combined with an insufficient concern with religious matters to affiliate with Reform or Liberal Judaism.2 The United Synagogue officiates at bar-mitzvahs weddings and funerals; it provides minimal religious instruction and serves as a focus for whatever communal life there is. That is all that most of its members ask. Only about 10 per cent of them regularly attend Sabbath services and half of those who do drive to synagogue. It is doubtful whether a majority observes kashrut in the home.

Thus Britain's pattern of synagogue affiliation differs considerably from that of the United States even though the Jews of both countries come from similar backgrounds and enjoy similar levels of economic achievement and acculturation. The difference can be traced to the role of the old patrician Anglo-Jewish families who founded the United Synagogue in 1870 as a Jewish equivalent to the Church of England. These families—the Rothschilds the Montagues the Samuels etc.—were rarely observant Jews but they gave their names money and time—in approximately that order—to the United Synogogue out of a sense of duty: it was the thing to do for any English gentleman who happened to be “of the Jewish faith.” Being more or less indifferent to religious matters they had no objection to the nominally Orthodox nature of the United Synagogue. Paradoxically enough therefore the United Synagogue was for decades led by men who neither believed in its doctrines nor practiced its rituals.

The changes which finally culminated in the Jacobs affair were slow to occur and slower to be noticed. After 1880 masses of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe streamed into England—and into the United Synagogue—coming finally to constitute a majority. However even after they had found their feet economically and politically they remained culturally and psychologically far less Anglicized than the old families.

Neither group really understood the other. The patricians considered themselves “Englishmen of the Jewish faith” (an adequate enough description) and expected the immigrants to become more and more like them as they became less and less “foreign.” The immigrants however had never been Poles or Russians of the Jewish faith but always Jews of the Jewish faith. Now in England they regarded themselves as the only authentic Jews; the old families simply seemed de-Judaized. (There were to be sure many among the newcomers who wished no more than to become Englishmen or Anglicized Jews but they were by the nature of things the ones least active in communal life.) As their numbers and power increased the “authentic” Jews came increasingly to resent the domination of communal and synagogue life by the “inauthentic” old families. Meanwhile the process of Anglicization began to work on the children of the immigrants eroding religious observance and Jewish identification and confirming the “authentic” Jews in their suspicion of all aspects of assimilation as well as in their opposition to patrician rule.

In the course of time a number of new synagogues all belonging to or affiliated with the United Synagogue were established in Jewish middle-class and lower-middle-class neighborhoods. These congregations composed almost entirely of new families were usually run by the more devout among them—the element most hostile to the rule of the old families. The new synagogue officers however were not alone in this hostility. They found an ally in the growing class of professional religious functionaries (rabbis dayyanim kashrut and shechitah supervisors beadles kosher butchers and caterers Hebrew teachers etc.) who also strongly favored “the old-time religion” and who resented their subordination to undevout unlearned Jews. The alliance was further strengthened by the influx of militantly Orthodox refugees from Central and Eastern Europe in the 30's and 40's and by a group of newly rich Jews of East European stock who in some cases were a good deal wealthier than many of the old families without however having been socially accepted by them.

It was this coalition which last year proved too much for the then President of the United Synagogue Council the Hon Ewen Montagu a judge and the scion of a family which had been ennobled before the First World War. Montagu surrendered his post to Sir Isaac Wolfson a multi-millionaire of the new class in the hope that Wolf-son's wealth and standing among the “new men” would allow him to control an increasingly rebellious Council. The Jacobs affair began under Montagu's presidency; with the election of Wolf-son the stage was set for its culmination.

_____________

Dr. Louis Jacobs the favorite son of modern Orthdoxy has an unusual background. Though born into a non-religious working-class family in Manchester he became devoutly religious as a boy and eventually studied at a yeshiva and then at Jews' College (the seminary jointly maintained by the United Synagogue and other London synagogal organizations). Nor was his education confined to Jewish studies; he also managed to acquire a thorough grounding in philosophy psychology and comparative religion. In 1954 at the age of thirty-four he was called to the pulpit of the New West End Synagogue in London's fashionable Bayswater district where his erudition piety and zeal made an immediate impact. He was especially adept in dealing with the skepticism of the Oxbridge-educated younger generation being able—unlike many rabbis—to offer them more than admonitions and platitudes. And his success with the young was especially important to an older generation whose main concern was that their children might drift away completely from Judaism and even “marry out.”

This concern is by no means peculiar to the old families who have generally worked out a viable Identity as English Jews over the years. As a matter of fact it mainly plagues the second-generation English Jews who are still in the midst of an exciting but unsettling transition from one identity to another and for many of whom “Jew” still seems an alternative to “Englishman.” Themselves the products of an Orthodox upbringing by parents who really meant it they have tried to pass on as much as possible to their children but they lack the wholehearted belief without which Orthodoxy loses its power. While the diehard Orthodox still hope to bring their sons up to be as strictly Orthodox as they themselves are the second-generation parents of Bayswater know that only a Judaism that is English and modern yet able to match Christianity in spiritual fervor can maintain its hold on the third generation. Under other circumstances they might have turned to Reform or Liberal synagogues but with Rabbi Jacobs in the pulpit of the New West End Synagogue they were spared the necessity of breaking with their past affiliations. They could enjoy the best of both worlds: a congregation sedately Anglo-Jewish and yet nominally Orthodox.

Jacobs's writings especially We Have Reason to Believe and Principles of the Jewish Faith have as their primary intention an effort to restate traditional Judaism in terms that seem plausible to the 20th-century mind. Operating on the assumption that Judaism is fully consistent with reason Jacobs raises major objections to only three of Maimonides's thirteen articles of faith. First he questions the Mosaic authorship Sinaitic origin and textual accuracy of the writings after the Pentateuch though accepting them as works of divine revelation. Second he rejects the belief in physical resurrection though affirming the soul's survival after death. And finally he disputes the concept of punishment in the world to come. At the same time he differs from Reform and Liberal Judaism on a number of important questions. For example he places a high value on consensus continuity and the avoidance of abrupt changes which he says can serve only to bewilder the faithful; he also lays an almost Jungian stress on the therapeutic importance of ritual justifying the continued observance of even those practices which in his view are based on a misreading of the Bible (e.g. the prohibition of mixing milk with meat); and he hopes—ironically as things turned out—for a “Catholic Israel” united under the “broad umbrella” of Anglo-Jewish Orthodoxy.

Whereas Jacobs regarded his writings as a necessary reinterpretation of Judaism for the modern believer the fundamentalists saw them as the beginning of apostasy—and so did the second-generation families in the suburbs where Orthodoxy faces a different challenge than in Bayswater and other fashionable districts. The young people in these suburban congregations do not go to public schools or to Oxford and Cambridge and hence are in no danger from the intellectual Christianity fashionable in those places; what endangers their Jewish identification is the secularism of English society in general. To their parents Jacobs seemed just one more threat to the old way of life. More specifically they feared that his writings would undermine the authority of the Chief Rabbi and of the whole synagogue.

_____________

The Jacobs affair proper began in 1959 when Jacobs accepted an appointment as Tutor of Jews' College with the understanding that he would eventually replace the principal who was shortly due to retire. At the time Jews' College was in dire straits faced with a declining enrollment and possessing neither the academic resources of a university nor the fervor of a yeshiva. The officers of the college headed by Sir Alan Mocatta a judge and a member of an old Sephardic family hoped that Jacobs could do for Jews' College what he had done for the New West End Synagogue. They had reason to understand that Jacobs's future appointment as principal would secure the Chief Rabbi's consent as the college's constitution requires though they did not actually have a commitment from him.

The Chief Rabbi Dr. Israel Brodie is today castigated as the villain of the piece by supporters of Jacobs and hailed as the champion of Orthodoxy by the very fundamentalists who had once scorned him as an “imitation clergyman.” Dr. Brodie was appointed Chief Rabbi in 1948 because he was considered safe tolerant and unlikely to cause embarrassment. British-born and Oxford-educated he is of distinguished appearance and has a good speaking voice and accent. Moreover he served as chaplain to the armed forces in both World Wars. In the 50's however he came increasingly under the influence of the fundamentalists and began to fulminate against Reform and Liberal Judaism which he described as “no Judaism at all and the greatest danger to Jewish survival.” Previously he had mellifluously pleaded for toleration; now he joined the Orthodox rabbinate in refusing to participate with Reform or Liberal ministers in any function whatsoever even under the auspices of the Council of Christians and Jews where he had once pleaded for interfaith harmony. Furthermore he refused to worship at synagogues which employed mixed choirs and he forbade microphones and the use of the Sephardit (modern Israeli) accent at services.

Had Brodie either opposed or approved Jacobs's appointment from the start events would have taken a different course. Instead he sat tight hoping that the problem would solve itself. (At one point it seemed that Jacobs would accept one of the attractive offers he was getting from Conservative institutions in the United States.) The stalemate at Jews' College continued for two years. Brodie would not approve Jacobs's appointment as principal; the officers of the college would not appoint anyone else. In December 1961 after pressure on Brodie from various sources including the influential Jewish Chronicle had proved ineffective Jacobs relinquished his tutorship whereupon all the honorary officers of Jews' College but one resigned in protest. The fundamentalists had won the round.

For a time it seemed that the Jacobs affair had run its course and that Brodie's term of office—he was due to retire in 1965—might draw to a peaceful if ineffectual close. But it was not to be. In 1963 Rabbi Pearl Jacobs's successor at the New West End Synagogue and a man who shared Jacobs's views but was more discreet in expressing them accepted an appointment in the United States. The management committee acted to return Rabbi Jacobs (then busying himself with the Society for the Study of Jewish Theology newly founded by his supporters within the United Synagogue) to his old post. According to the United Synagogue constitution ministers must be certified as proper persons by the Chief Rabbi before they take up an appointment. The management committee however argued that this was not an appointment but a re-appointment and that neither the letter nor the spirit of the constitution required the re-certification of Rabbi Jacobs. Sir Isaac Wolfson held otherwise and referred the application to Brodie who predictably enough refused to certify Jacobs.

Three months later when the Jacobs affair had caught the attention of the national press Rabbi Brodie attempted to justify his decision: “Those who are appointed rabbis and teachers of communities must by their very vocations and terms of their ordination as rabbis be the exponents of God's word embodied in the Torah written and oral with the sanction and authority attached thereto.” The Chief Rabbi's pronouncement marked the first time that acceptance of fundamentalist tenets was made a condition of appointment in the United Synagogue. The significance of Brodie's dictum becomes clear when one remembers that the constitution describes the United Synagogue spirit as one of “progressive conservatism” and that three-quarters of its members believe in nothing beyond a vague deism. Since Jacobs's views were already well known in 1959 when he joined Jews' College without any protest by Brodie this statement was conclusive evidence that a decisive “swing to the right” had taken place.

The management committee reacted to Dr. Brodie's rebuff by calling a members' meeting of the New West End Synagogue in the course of which an overwhelming majority of members voted to invite Jacobs back over the Chief Rabbi's ban. In response to this Wolfson hurriedly summoned the United Synagogue Council to consider a motion removing the management committee from office. The meeting was a triumph for Wolfson and Brodie particularly the former. Though they encountered intense opposition—led by Edmund de Rothschild scion of the United Synagogue's founders and past presidents and by some of the most famous names in Anglo-Jewry including Sir Bernard Waley-Cohen a former Lord Mayor of London—the victory went to Wolfson the self-made millionaire who declared himself a “traditional” Jew acting for all “traditional” Jews.

It has been said that Wolfson's insistence on a show of hands as against a closed ballot was decisive for the outcome of the vote (120 to 90 in favor of the motion). A number of delegates either work for Wolfson do business with him—particularly his chain-stores—or hope to in the future and perhaps voted against their convictions rather than incur his displeasure. This may well be true but it does not detract from Wolfson's victory. On the contrary it shows how far the balance of power in the community has changed with the new money overtaking the old or with wealth now counting for more than the social distinction of the old families.

_____________

While it is clear that Wolfson Brodie and their supporters won a great victory—shaking all of Anglo-Jewry in the process—one might nevertheless question the long-run value of their triumph for their control of the United Synagogue may well result in a decline in its power and usefulness. Since being removed the management committee of the New West End Synagogue and a majority of the congregants have founded their own independent New London Synagogue headed by Rabbi Jacobs. The new congregation is attracting wide support and has just acquired permanent buildings. Some who for years had been on the brink of defecting from Orthodoxy have been shocked by the Jacobs affair into joining Reform or Liberal synagogues. Others admit frankly that all that keeps them in the United Synagogue is the fear of losing the right to be buried in its cemeteries. Most English Jews do not believe in the doctrine of complete Sinaitic revelation but many were quite happy to share the “broad umbrella” of the United Synagogue with those who did. Now that the Chief Rabbi has declared the doctrine compulsory he has forced large numbers of these people to examine their own beliefs and to draw the necessary conclusions.

It is of course conceivable that Rabbi Brodie's successor will reverse this trend and effect a reconciliation but there are two factors that make such an outcome improbable. First the next Chief Rabbi will be chosen by Sir Isaac Wolfson and secondly the fundamentalists having tasted blood are not likely to become more conciliatory. Nevertheless time is working against the fundamentalists. The security and prosperity which the younger generation has known from birth is not conducive to religious fervor obsessive devotion to ritual and intolerance toward other Jews. These youths who will eventually constitute a majority are likely to ask for a Judaism which does not unduly separate them from their Gentile compatriots which makes use of ritual but is not dominated by it and which provides moral and intellectual edification that is relevant to life in 20th-century Britain. Before the Jacobs affair it was thought that such a Judaism was obtainable under the “broad umbrella” of the United Synagogue. If however this body becomes increasingly indistinguishable from an ultra-Orthodox organization it will lose a great many of its members.

If the younger generation should follow in the footsteps of the substantial number of professional men and patricians who have already made their way into Reform and Liberal synagogues the Jacobs affair will have contributed to the “Americanization” of English synagogue organzation by creating a division along the lines of Orthodoxy Conservatism and Reform. Unfortunately however there is no certainty that Jews who find the United Synagogue uncongenial will join another organization. Even now some half of all Jewish families are unaffiliated with any synagogue; had it not been for the past structure of the United Synagogue that number would almost certainly be greater. Thus the Jacobs affair may bring about a general decline in the religious affiliation of England's Jews and the fundamentalists will then have won a pyrrhic victory indeed.

1 As many again belong to purely Orthodox—“Torah-true”—synagogal groupings which have never recognized the Chief Rabbi's authority.

But he upset the odds to scorch to victory in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Stadium winning in a new European record of 9.80. Five minutes earlier his Italian team-mate Gianmarco Tamberi shared high jump gold with Mutaz Essa Barshim. And then in the most prestigious event of them all Jacobs beat a star-studded field to end 25 years of dominance by sprinters from the Americas. Jacobs is the first European to win the Olympic 100m title since Britain's Linford Christie at Barcelona 1992 and Italy's first Olympic sprint champion since Pietro Mennea took the 200m at Moscow 1980. Read on to find out five facts about the man who can now proudly carry the tag of 'World's Fastest Man'.

Born in the USA but definitely Italian Lamont Marcell Jacobs was born on 26 September 1994 in El Paso Texas to an Italian mother and American father. His mother Viviana told Corriere Della Sera ""I met Marcell's father in Vicenza. He was a soldier in the US Army. I was 16 and he was 18. We got married and moved to Texas. ""After about three years Marcell was born. But 20 days later his father was transferred to South Korea. It was impossible to follow him so I decided to go back to Italy. Marcell wasn't even a month old."" Jacobs has spoken about going to the United States to meet his father but admits his English is not very good. ""I feel Italian in every cell of my body I even struggle to speak English!"" Young Marcell tried a number of sports before he eventually settled on athletics. His mother continued ""Coming from a family of motorcyclists I always advised against that choice. For the rest he tried everything from swimming to basketball: I wanted him to discover his passion. Plus I had to make him tired because he did not stand still even while he slept!"" Jacobs recalled to Corriere della Sera the words of his school coach ""Since I wasn't particularly skilled at football but I was fast he told me: 'Why don't you try another sport like athletics?'""

A sprinter and long jumper The young Jacobs made his first impression in athletics at national level in the long jump. At the 2016 Italian Championships he took victory with a distance of 7.89m with his personal best 7.95m although he also jumped 8.48m with a +2.8m/s following wind that year. But he made real strides on the track in 2018 claiming his first national 100m title and going close to the magic 10-second barrier. During the Covid lockdown of 2020 he trained at a house close to Lake Garda with a mini-athletics arena including a 90m track and long jump pit. Those sessions paid off as he made an impact right at the start of the 2021 season.

Jacobs announces himself at European Indoors Jacobs was far from a household name at the start of 2021 but he soon put a change to that. At March's European Indoor Championships in Torun Poland he produced a power-packed display to take men's 60m gold in 6.47 the fastest time in the world this year and a new Italian record. And in his first outdoor meeting of the year in Savona he set a new Italian 100m record of 9.95 seconds. After that he told Corriere della Sera ""I am going to Tokyo to win a medal. Bolt is not there Coleman is not there there's not a clear favourite it'll be a battle. I can't stop dreaming now...""

What do Jacobs' tattoos mean? Scaling 1.88m and weighing over 80kg Jacobs is one of the bigger sprinters of the circuit. But perhaps more striking at the number of tattoos the Italian has which are clearly visible around his race vest. He calls the tattoos a representation of his ""American"" side with one reading ""Famiglia. Dove nasce la vita e l'amore non ha mai fine"" which translates as ""Family. Where life is born and love never ends."" On his chest he has a rose and in Italian the famous Charlie Chaplin quote ""What is really good is to fight with determination embrace life and live it with passion! Lose your battles with class and dare to win because the world belongs to those who dare."" Also on his body are the names of his three children with the youngest Meghan on his right bicep. On his back is a tiger representing ""strength passion and beauty"" and on his arm is a cross with the word 'Believe'. Just below his neck he has the words 'CrazyLongJumper' which is also his nickname on Social Media.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vcmFpZGVyc3dpcmUudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMzEvcmFpZGVycy1yYi1qb3NoLWphY29icy1uby1sb25nZXItc2V0dGluZy1yZWNlaXZpbmctZ29hbHMtd2hhdC1jaGFuZ2VkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raiders RB Josh Jacobs no longer setting receiving goals. What changed?,"Following Josh Jacobs’s rookie season in 2019 he set about trying to up his game. The one aspect of his game he wanted to add was as a receiver out of the backfield. He even set the lofty goal of 60 catches. Though his receptions totals improved last season (33) from his rookie year (20) he fell well short of his goal.

This season Jacobs has abandoned his receptions goals.

“Not really from a stats standpoint” Jacobs said of his goals. “More of just putting my stamp on this offense becoming a leader in this offense and for this team. That’s really where my head’s been at.”

Upping his game as a receiver was what the coaches wanted from him last season. What changed? Well they added Kenyan Drake first and foremost.

“I feel like Kenyan is a change-of-pace type of back. He has that what I call X-factor type of explosiveness” Jacobs said of Drake. ”

Just to see him come in and give what he has to the team to see him line up in the wide receiver spot in the slot it’s definitely going to be huge for our team.”

Ironically Jacobs had more receptions last season than Drake. But that was not what you usually expect from him. The two previous seasons he had over 50 catches each season. And that’s what Gruden wants from him now. Let Jacobs focus on running the ball while Drake brings the receiving abilities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1ZmZwb3N0LmNvbS9lbnRyeS9sYW1vbnQtbWFyY2VsbC1qYWNvYnMtMTAwLW1ldGVyc19uXzYxMDY5N2FiZTRiMDAwYjk5N2UyYzc5MdIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1ZmZwb3N0LmNvbS9lbnRyeS9sYW1vbnQtbWFyY2VsbC1qYWNvYnMtMTAwLW1ldGVyc19uXzYxMDY5N2FiZTRiMDAwYjk5N2UyYzc5MS9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs Wins Olympic 100 Meters In Stunning Upset,"LOADING ERROR LOADING

Bromell ran his semifinal heat in 9.996 seconds to finish third and said “I’m not really sure what I could’ve done better but the race went the way the race went.”

The day’s other gold medal went to Gong Lijao of China who bested American Raven Saunders of the United States. Saunders who is openly gay and wears an “Incredible Hulk” mask when she competes closed out the medals ceremony by lifting her arms above her head and forming an “X” with her wrists.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is on record saying he doesn't anticipate passing a nationwide abortion ban if Republicans achieve a majority in both chambers of Congress in November. Why it matters: Johnson's remarks shared in an interview Politico published Friday coincide with those former President Trump made against a national abortion ban.

""President Trump said this is in the states' purview now"" Johnson said. ""After the Dobbs decision I think that's where it is.

Yes but: Johnson in 2022 co-sponsored federal legislation to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat was detected and last January posted on X that ""[w]e will get the number of abortions to ZERO!!"" in Louisiana because of the fall of Roe v Wade.

Trump took credit for the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022 an act made possible after he appointed three conservative justices to the court.

The other side: Democrats have consistently laid blame at Trump's feet for restrictive abortion laws and an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that temporarily froze in vitro fertilization services.

What he's saying: ""Look I am a lifelong pro-lifer. I'm a product of a teen pregnancy. And so I believe in the sanctity of human life"" Johnson said during the interview.

""It's also an important article of faith for me. But I have 434 colleagues here.""

Speaking on the second second season of the Netflix series ""Full Swing"" Johnson believes those golfers who were handed tens and some hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund are the ones who ""took the risk."" One reason is the criticism those golfers received from joining a league financed by a country with atrocious human rights violations.

Johnson who lives in Jupiter also wonders why those who remained on the tour — many turning down those multimillions — should be compensated if the two sides one day unite.

""No I don't"" Johnson said on the episode when asked whether PGA Tour players were owed compensation if LIV players returned to the tour.

""The guys that went to LIV we took a lot of criticism. We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously if this merger comes along there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.""

With no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.

PGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises' equity share plan. Large as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth according to the The Telegraph.

When it comes to legacy reputation and their safety Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.

Paulina Gretzky Johnson's wife revealed that the couple received death threats after her husband joined LIV.

""People sending death threats and awful awful awful things"" she said. ""People were aggressive that’s for sure. But that’s when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don’t need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.”

But financially … Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV while Johnson Phil Mickelson Bryson DeChambeau Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.

And many others will earn tens of millions such as Tyrrell Hatton who reportedly signed for around $65 million.

Officially 64-year-old Ray Johnson’s cause of death in February 2022 was ruled drowning the leading cause of death for tourists in Hawaii by a coroner according to Patti Johnson’s lawsuit.

But her attorney Jay Stuemke told Fox News Digital the experienced snorkeler’s last moments did not resemble a traditional drowning at all.

“He told a friend ‘I’m having trouble breathing’ and they tried to bring him in” Stuemke said Wednesday. “A friend helped him to shore but he died on the beach [in Maui.]”

“He told a friend ‘I’m having trouble breathing’ and they tried to bring him in” Stuemke said Wednesday. “A friend helped him to shore but he died on the beach [in Maui.]”

“Hypoxia induced by Rapid Onset Pulmonary Edema (ROPE) is the cause of some probably most snorkel related fatal and near fatal drownings” the study’s authors wrote in their interim report which is cited in Johnson’s lawsuit.

Stuemke said waiting three days after disembarking from their plane before donning a snorkel can greatly reduce the risk of “preventable death.”

“There’s barely a minute in my life that goes by that I don’t think about him” said Patti Johnson according to ABC7.

Generally tourists fly at least five hours to get to Hawaii according to the study and given that airplanes are pressurized at an equivalent of up to 8500 feet elevation “the permeability of the lung’s membranes may be affected in a way that predisposes toward the development of ROPE.”

“Ray should’ve been told that he was at particular risk of this for a variety of reasons including the fact that he’d just flown in” Stuemke said. “They were going to be in there for two weeks. His wife has told me if they knew about this safety study and what it said they would just hang out by the pool and drink Mai Tais for a couple days.

“Most people don’t just come in for a weekend to snorkel. They come for a period of time and have a number of things they want to do” Steumke said. “If they’re told they should wait they will.”

But according to Johnson’s lawsuit Hawaii’s tourism authority and other groups have done little to forewarn tourists “despite having knowledge of the risks and ready-to-use warnings at hand from this industry-funded study.”

“The [tourism authority hasn’t] shared those warnings. They aren’t prominently featured on any website or featured in any brochures or videos or anything” Stuemke said.

Between 2012 and 2021 184 tourists died in snorkeling accidents compared to just 20 local residents.

“It’s impossible on autopsy to determine if someone died by a traditional drowning or this sudden onset pulmonary edema” Stuemke said. “Either way there’s fluid in your lungs and a lack of oxygen.”

Two factors make ROPE deaths more common for snorkelers than those participating in other water activities according to the 2017 study — the swimmer’s prone position in the water and the narrow tube of their snorkels which creates resistance to inhalation.

Dr. Foti wrote in his findings that “[g]enerally the simpler the snorkel the less resistance it generated.”

5 “There’s barely a minute in my life that goes by that I don’t think about him” said Patti Johnson. Patti Johnson via ABC7

However “other factors sometimes not visible such as the size at the narrowest opening or the design of the valves made visual determination of resistance unreliable.”

The Hawaii House of Representatives attempted to pass a bill that would require first responders to record data on the types of snorkels used by tourists who drowned during the activity. But the bill was never passed according to the Hawaii State Legislature website.

The type of mask and snorkel used were only recorded in 16% of snorkeling-related deaths Foti wrote.

While a full face mask was used in five of these cases and a traditional two-piece mask was used in eleven the 2017 study noted that full face masks can’t be removed in urgent situations and users can’t “spit” their snorkel out to improve their breathing.

Stuemke said Patti had begun to print small cards with details about ROPE.

In doing so she “has been in a very real way doing more to try to educate about this than what the state of Hawaii and the tourism industry have done.”

“Any time she hears someone is going on a snorkeling trip she gives someone one of these cards and says ‘Please don’t let what happened to Ray happen to you. Wait awhile and follow these other tips'” Stuemke said.

The Hawaii Tourism Authority Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau the Fairmont Kea Lani Maui and Accor Management did not respond to a request for comment on the pending lawsuit.

Each of the five areas will include specific guidance suggested reference architectures and technical code that can help streamline service approval of EKS in its environment which may need to be adapted to your specific use case and environment.

Amazon EKS gives you the flexibility to start run and scale Kubernetes applications in the AWS cloud or on-premises. EKS helps you provide highly-available and secure clusters and automates key tasks such as patching node provisioning and updates. AWS customers include JPMorgan Chase  who uses EKS to run their risk calculations; Fidelity who uses EKS for their Platform-as-a-Service; and Snap Intuit GoDaddy and Autodesk who trust EKS to run their sensitive and mission critical applications.

EKS runs upstream Kubernetes and is certified Kubernetes conformant for a predictable experience. You can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to EKS without needing to refactor your code.

The security and compliance of Amazon EKS is assessed as part of multiple AWS compliance programs. Amazon EKS is compliant with:

AWS leverages the AWS shared responsibility model and customers need to ensure workloads running in the AWS Cloud are using the appropriate security controls to meet their compliance needs and security posture. AWS customers are responsible for their security in the cloud. They control and manage the security of their content applications systems and networks. AWS manages security of the cloud providing and maintaining proper operations of services and features protecting AWS infrastructure and services maintaining operational excellence and meeting relevant legal and regulatory requirements.

Amazon EKS has several different deployment methodologies where the level of shared responsibility in the Kubernetes stack shifts to AWS as the Kubernetes cluster become more managed. AWS Fargate with EKS for example would shift more management responsibility such as worker node OS management to AWS. This blog will focus on EKS with self-managed worker nodes which provide customers with the most flexibility and ability to manage lower level components in their Kubernetes clusters. The shared responsibility model when running EKS with self-managed worker nodes is outlined in the following diagram:

Figure 1: Shared responsibility model when running EKS with self-managed worker nodes

The EKS control plane is located in an AWS managed Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) (the right side of the diagram). Amazon EKS runs a dedicated (single-tenant) Kubernetes control plane for each cluster. The control plane infrastructure is not shared across clusters or AWS accounts. The control plane consists of at least two API server instances and three etcd instances that run across three Availability Zones within a Region. The customer is responsible for managing the Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies on the EKS clusters.

Data Protection with EKS

Encryption is a commonly used mechanism to protect data in transit and at rest. Customers should consider encryption a best practice for all workloads whether they are highly sensitive or not.

Data in Transit

Amazon EKS clusters’ Kubernetes management API is available via Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.2 and higher only. When managing EKS clusters through AWS API endpoints encryption of data in transit is provided by TLS 1.0 or higher. We recommend using a minimum of TLS 1.2 which is configurable within your TLS clients.

EKS clusters integrate with Network Load Balancers (NLB) to provide encryption of data in transit for all communication with the applications deployed onto EKS from outside the cluster. Regulated workloads demand end-to-end encryption for data in transit in the entire application stack and TLS can be used for encryption of data in transit between Kubernetes ingress controllers and the pods they target. Customers can use service mesh communication technology like AWS AppMesh to ensure services are encrypted in transit between EKS services running on the same or different EKS clusters using mutual TLS (mTLS)  without the need to add encryption into your applications code or configuration.

Data at Rest

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) makes it easy for you to accomplish data at rest by creating and managing cryptographic keys and controlling their use across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications. We recommend customers use AWS KMS in EKS environments to provide a defense in depth style approach to security. AWS KMS supports CloudTrail for audibility and can automate yearly key rotation with a customer managed AWS KMS key (formerly known as CMK) to meet compliance requirements.

Amazon EKS allows customers to use AWS KMS to encrypt Kubernetes secrets stored within your Kubernetes clusters to help protect them from unauthorized access by using envelope encryption with your KMS keys. AWS KMS may also be used to encrypt the Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes Elastic File System (EFS) and FSx for Lustre filesystems used by EKS clusters. Container images can be encrypted and stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

Isolation of compute environments with EKS

Amazon EKS service API

EKS service APIs are accessible over the internet in regionally specific URLs. The EKS service API is used for actions like creating/deleting EKS clusters and scheduling cluster version upgrades. The EKS service API permissions use AWS IAM for access management.

The aws eks commands from the AWS CLI and the eksctl tool call the Amazon EKS service API. kubectl commands call the Kubernetes cluster management API.

Amazon EKS has two compute components: Control plane nodes and Worker nodes.

Control plane nodes

Kubernetes control plane nodes are managed by AWS and are hosted in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) that are protected by the AWS global network security procedures described in the Introduction to AWS Security whitepaper.

Customers can choose to expose the cluster management API endpoint of the EKS cluster over the internet with an allow list of CIDR blocks to only allow connections from approved network locations or with a private IP address inside of a customer managed Amazon VPC. When configured to use a VPC customers can use security groups (SGs) and network access control lists (NACLS) to control connectivity to the EKS cluster endpoint. EKS clusters can be deployed with both an internet facing and a private VPC API endpoint.

Private EKS cluster API endpoints can be accessed from on-premises via AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN Gateway or from an Amazon VPC via Amazon EC2 Bastion Host or AWS Cloud9 IDE.

Worker nodes require access to the EKS cluster endpoint to communicate with the Kubernetes control plane. We recommend deploying the EKS cluster API with an in-vpc private API endpoint as that simplifies the connectivity. See this blog for details on various ways to configure the Amazon VPC to run EC2 worker nodes for your Kubernetes cluster managed by Amazon EKS.

Worker nodes

EKS worker nodes run in a customer managed Amazon VPC where the customer has full control over the network. The customer has control over what their workloads running on their EKS worker nodes can access over the network. Customers can control what can be accessed using Amazon VPC network security controls such as SGs NACLs and routes.

Customers have full control over traffic between pods running on their EKS nodes via Kubernetes configuration. In Kubernetes Pod to Pod traffic is open by default. Following is an example network policy configuration which restricts all communication between pods.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: default-deny namespace: default spec: podSelector: {} policyTypes: - Ingress - Egress

Amazon VPC Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin for Kubernetes assigns an IP address from your Amazon VPC to each pod. CNI allows for better separation of worker nodes and pod traffic by configuring a second ENI in a different VPC CIDRs. Kubernetes network policies operate at layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model. Network policies use pod selectors and labels to identify source and destination pods but can also include IP addresses port numbers protocol number or a combination of these. Policies should be designed to restrict network traffic only to what is required by the workloads and pods running. Customers can use Calico which is an open source policy engine from Tigera that works well with EKS and can provide layer 3 – 7 network security when operated with Istio. Network Policy such as deny from other namespaces provide a layer of isolation between workloads running on the same cluster.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: namespace: default name: deny-from-other-namespaces spec: podSelector: matchLabels: ingress: - from: - podSelector: {}

Customers can also leverage Security Groups on Pods on Nitro enabled EC2 instances to grant access to other AWS resources through IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA). IRSA provides fine-grained roles at the pod level rather than the node level using AWS IAM by way of OpenID Connect (OIDC). By default the Amazon EC2 instance metadata service (IMDS) provides the credentials assigned to the node IAM role to the instance and any pod running on the instance. It is a best practice to remove access to these credentials from pods and provide pods with least privilege access through network policies.

At the pod level example:

apiVersion: policy/v1beta1 kind: PodSecurityPolicy metadata: name: restrictive spec: privileged: false allowPrivilegeEscalation: false hostnetwork: false

Note: Pod Security Policy (PSP) is deprecated as of Kubernetes 1.21 and is being removed in Kubernetes 1.25.

AWS recommends that customers implement policy as code to place guardrails and improve maintainability on network and security policies as a best practice. In planning for the future customers should evaluate replacements like Gatekeeper to replace Pod Security Policy (PSP).

Automating audits with APIs with EKS

AWS Config monitors the configuration of resources and allows customers to monitor their AWS resources for compliance to their security requirements. AWS config comes with rules for EKS built-in and also allows customers to provide their own custom config rules. We recommend customers enable the built-in config rules to make sure their clusters are not publicly accessible and that Kubernetes secrets are encrypted using KMS keys.

Calls to the Amazon EKS API are logged in AWS Cloudtrail create a trail to record activity for a specified amount of time to meet compliance requirements. Cloudtrail will log all management events for EKS that are performed through the AWS API endpoint such as (but not limited to) CreateCluster UpdateClusterConfig and DescribeCluster. Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request.

Customers can specify which logs from EKS clusters are sent to AWS Cloudwatch where they can be viewed or downloaded. AWS recommends that customers enable logging on all EKS clusters control plane.

Customers can use the following CLI command to turn on all cluster logging

aws eks update-cluster-config \ --region <region-code> \ --name <prod> \ --logging '{""clusterLogging"":[{""types"":[""api""""audit""""authenticator""""controllerManager""""scheduler""]""enabled"":true}]}'

Logs sent to CloudWatch include:

Kubernetes API server component logs ( api ) – Your cluster’s API server is the control plane component that exposes the Kubernetes API. For more information see kube-apiserver in the Kubernetes documentation.

AWS Audit Manager allows customers to simplify auditing their AWS environments. Audit manager automates the collection of evidence for audits and can capture relevant Cloud Trail logs and AWS config history of EKS clusters for use in audits. AWS Audit Manager could be used to capture all the Cloud Trail logs for the ‘createCluster’ and ‘updateClusterConfig’ actions to show the configuration history of your EKS clusters. This may be useful when attempting to prove compliance over time with PCI DSS control 1.3 to ensure that card holder systems are restricted from the internet.

The following screenshots illustrate the configuration of a custom control’s data source for a custom compliance framework in AWS Audit Manager. This control records Amazon EKS ‘createCluster’ and ‘updateClusterConfig’ actions which could prove that the EKS cluster control plane has never been configured to accept connections directly from the internet.

Operational access and security with EKS

AWS customers in the financial services industry require detailed logging and assurance of access of critical data. Customers can review third-party auditor reports such as the AWS SOC 2 Type II report ISO 27001 and others in AWS Artifact.

Control plane access

Amazon EKS uses IAM to provide authentication to your Kubernetes cluster but it still relies on native Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization. This means that IAM is only used for authentication of valid IAM entities. All permissions for interacting with your Amazon EKS cluster’s Kubernetes API is managed through the native Kubernetes RBAC system.

When EKS clusters are created the role or user that was used to create a cluster is granted the system:masters entitlement which provides full administrative access to the Kubernetes cluster. Customers have full control of their EKS cluster configurations and can specify which IAM roles or users have administrative access to their EKS clusters with Kubernetes configurations. The following example grants the system:masters entitlement to the IAM roles listed:

apiVersion: v1 data: mapRoles: | - userarn: <arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/exampleCICDRole> username: <CICD> groups: - <system:masters> - userarn: <arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/exampleops-user> username: <ops-user> groups: - <system:masters>

AWS recommends creating the cluster with a dedicated IAM role and regularly audit who can assume this role. This role should not be used to perform routine actions on the cluster and won’t appear in the ConfigMap. Instead additional users should be granted access to the cluster through the aws-auth ConfigMap for this purpose. After the aws-auth ConfigMap is configured the role can be deleted and only recreated in an emergency / break glass scenario. This can be particularly useful in production clusters in reducing administrative access. Customers can leverage an existing identity provider and identity management lifecycle through an OIDC configuration to manage user access to a cluster reducing AWS IAM needs.

Worker nodes access

Customers can also restrict the Amazon EKS worker nodes to the instance types that are built on The AWS Nitro System. Nitro System is a collection of AWS-built hardware and software components that enable high performance high availability and high security. The Nitro System’s security model is locked down and prohibits interactive access reducing the possibility of human error and tampering. The list of EC2 instances that are built on the Nitro System can be found here.

Conclusion

In this post we reviewed Amazon EKS and highlighted key information that can help FSI customers accelerate the approval of the service within these five categories: achieving compliance data protection isolation of compute environments automating audits with APIs and operational access and security. While not a one-size-fits-all approach the guidance provided can be adapted to meet your organization’s security and compliance requirements and provide a consolidated list of key areas to focus on for Amazon EKS.

The tool has faced scrutiny from lawmakers and some employees inside Amazon who said they were worried that it led to unfair treatment of African-Americans. Amazon has repeatedly defended the accuracy of its algorithms.

When Amazon announced the pause in June it did not cite a specific reason for the change. The company said it hoped a year was enough time for Congress to create legislation regulating the ethical use of facial recognition technology. Congress has not banned the technology or issued any significant regulations on it but some cities have.

The Hong Kong-based company's stock sale will be co-sponsored by JPMorgan Chase HSBC and China International Capital Corporation (CICC) according to a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange without providing financial details.

The IPO plan is a long time coming for Biel's founder Yeung Kin-man who had planned to raise between US$2 billion and US$2.5 billion either in Hong Kong on mainland China. While the company did not need to raise capital a stock market listing would boost its profile Yeung said in an interview last year with the South China Morning Post.

The timing appears to be more fortuitous for the glass manufacturer as Hong Kong's first-half bank deposits ballooned by 11.5 per cent to HK$7.87 trillion (US$1.01 trillion) on the heels of two consecutive quarters of economic growth marking the city's recovery from the coronavirus outbreak. The jump in deposits reflected a net inflow of capital into Hong Kong in anticipation of a flurry of Chinese companies going public as they turn to the world's fourth-largest capital market for funds.

""Investors have appetite for IPOs depending on [whether] the company is unique"" said Louis Tse Ming-kwong managing director of Wealthy Securities in Hong Kong.

Biel founded by Leung in 1987 supplies the glass used in smartphone screens smartwatches augmented reality and virtual reality glasses and vehicles counting Apple Samsung Electronics and Huawei Technologies as among its customers. The company got the first break in when it supplied the glass to Motorola's Razr cellular phones.

Profit grew by about 71 per cent to HK$3.16 billion in the financial year ended March from HK$1.85 billion a year earlier Biel said in its filing.

""The adoption of 5G technology is expected to stimulate the trend of replacing 4G smartphones with 5G [devices] which in turn will lead to an increase in global shipments"" the company said.

Story continues

Worldwide shipment of smartphones grew 13.2 per cent in the second quarter to 313.2 million devices according to research firm IDC.

Biel had originally planned to go public in 2018 but postponed the plan just as tensions began to escalate between Washington DC and Beijing as then president Donald Trump slapped import tariffs on China setting off a tit-for-tat trade war between the world's two largest economies.

Yeung was awarded the 2017 Businessperson of the Year honour by the DHL-SCMP Hong Kong Business Awards.

Yeung and his wife Lam Wai-ying are among Hong Kong's wealthiest people according to Forbes' latest rankings. Their wealth rose 133 per cent to US$18.6 billion last year making them the city's fourth-wealthiest persons and the only ones in the top 5 whose wealth was not directly associated with property development.

In 2017 the couple paid HK$2.8 billion for a mansion on The Peak in Hong Kong that measured 51000 square feet (4738 square metres).

Joe Biden’s stimulus package did more to help working people than almost any other piece of legislation in the last few decades. Of course that’s a pretty low bar. But through direct payments and extended unemployment benefits the American Rescue Plan boosted incomes for most working-class and middle-class Americans. It created a temporary child tax credit. It extended generous unemployment benefits through September. And it bailed out state and local governments to prevent a return to austerity. Biden’s stimulus bill was a big shift from Barack Obama’s stingy response to the 2008 crisis and Donald Trump’s tax cut orgy. But the question for working people is not where Biden’s heart is at. It’s this: who holds the power in his administration? The answer to that question will determine the opportunities and limits for reform in the next four years. So far every indication we have suggests that business is still calling the shots in Washington DC.

Biden Backs Bidenomics For decades big business has wanted politicians to pursue austerity when it comes to people’s needs. Slash budgets for education. Cut back on health care. Whittle away at unemployment benefits. But last year the COVID crisis and the specter of economic collapse forced business to change its tune. And it’s this change in business’s policy preferences that should get the credit for Biden’s stimulus. From the start of the 2020 election business was on board with the Biden agenda. A Yale poll of directors at America’s largest companies found that 77 percent planned to vote for Joe Biden. CEOs also coupled their support for the Democratic Party with their wallets. Data suggests that CEOs from larger companies giving to Biden outnumbered those giving to Trump two to one. Large donors as a whole accounted for 61 percent of Biden’s war chest. As soon as Biden was elected the business world quickly closed ranks behind the administration and demanded a new and massive stimulus package. Michelle Gass CEO of Kohl’s put the matter bluntly in explaining her support (and the support of other major retailers) for a new stimulus package targeted at regular people: “Anything that puts money into the pockets of our consumers is a good thing.” In early February Biden organized a meeting of corporate leaders to discuss the stimulus package. Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan Chase Doug McMillon of Walmart Tom Donohue from the Chamber of Commerce and Marvin Ellison from Lowe’s were among the CEOs courted. Business rejoiced in its newfound closeness to the White House. Josh Bolten CEO of the Business Roundtable gushed about the administration: “The communication with the business community is good and the tone is good.” Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute noted: “My CEOs have been pleasantly surprised at the level of engagement that the industry has received so far.” Biden didn’t have to wait long for this courting of big business to pay off. The corporate world was happy to offer its blessing for the stimulus. In late February 170 business leaders in New York City signed a letter to congressional leaders enthusiastically endorsing the relief plan. David Solomon of Goldman Sachs Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone and Larry Fink from BlackRock were among the signers. The $1.9 trillion act was finally signed into law in March. A quarterly poll by the Business Roundtable showed a sharp jump in CEOs’ confidence in the economy. Plans to hire and invest were back on. The Business Roundtable’s CEO called it “among the sharpest and quickest recoveries in optimism in the history of our survey.” A Yale poll of eighty CEOs in the middle of March showed 71 percent support for the stimulus. That was about the same as the 70 percent of the public who supported it. The poll also found retailers and leisure industry executives excited about the possibility of direct payments to consumers translating into rising profits. By the end of March big business’s big bet on Biden seemed to be paying off.

Will Biden Win Round Two? The question now is what comes next. In the spring Biden and the Democrats announced new goals of boosting infrastructure spending and expanding the social safety net. But unlike the relief bill which was paid for by borrowing money these new initiatives initially were to be paid for with higher taxes. The corporate tax rate would go up to 28 percent from 21 percent. And various taxes on the wealthy would be increased. Business would have none of it. Right out of the gate the Chamber of Commerce denounced the proposed corporate tax increases as “dangerously misguided.” (Even though the plan would not even restore the rates to their pre-Trump level of 35 percent.) The CEO of Raytheon warned of a 20 percent cut in the company’s investments if the hike went through. After learning about the administration’s plans to double the tax rate on the wealthiest various investors weighed in. They described the plan as “insanity” a threat to “the golden goose that is America” and a “slap in the face of entrepreneurs.” The administration immediately began to cave. Right after announcing the plans Biden officials responded to corporate pushback by insisting that they were open to scaling back their ambitions. Brian Deese from Biden’s National Economic Council told Fox News Sunday: “If people think this is too aggressive then we’d like to hear what their plans are. It’s something we want to have a conversation about.” (By “people” Deese presumably meant corporate leaders.) Speaking to more than fifty CEOs from Google AT&T Dell Ford Intel and other companies Biden’s secretary of commerce said of negotiations with the corporate world: “I’ve been encouraged. Nobody likes to talk about the pay-fors but there is room for compromise.” It seems now that Biden and his team have reached that compromise. The White House dramatically scaled back its ambitions in order to get a package that even some Republicans could support. A corporate tax hike is nowhere to be found in that proposal. Since its release congressional Democrats have also put forward a major new package investing in social programs but its fate remains very uncertain. There should be no doubt that in the fight to define what the Biden administration is about the corporate world is on the offensive. If business gets its way no major move that encroaches on its power will be tolerated. Hopes for significant increases in corporate taxes or big steps to strengthen the labor movement seem dim."

Just over a year later following the fifth wettest June on record for coastal Alabama local TV media reports attributed some of the stormwater overflows to face masks being flushed down toilets and clogging the pipes. But Daphne Utilities and the Mobile Area Water and Sewer System (MAWSS) in recent interviews with AL.com are setting the record straight: The biggest culprit are flushable wipes.

And these headaches are not concentrated to the soggy Gulf Coast. Throughout Alabama and the rest of the U.S. sewer operators and environmental advocates are sounding the alarm over a product commonly found in the “beauty” or “cosmetic” aisles of big-box retailers grocery stores and pharmacies.

Are flushable wipes really flushable?

“Flushable wipes are an oxymoron” said Cade Kistler interim director with Mobile Baykeeper.

Said Jessica Walker spokeswoman with the city of Fairhope which operates its own municipal sewer system “There is no such thing as a flushable wipe. There never has been such thing as a flushable wipe.”

Welcome to the new war on flushable wipes where municipal utility operators are scrambling to find ways to remind customers not to flush what is marketed as “flushable” down their toilets.

The argument goes like this: Flushable wipes – a product that has risen in usage over the past decade and has become an even more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic – are a major source of clogs and damage to sewer and water utility infrastructure. A National Association of Clean Water Agencies report from last year estimates that wipes are causing $441 million in additional operational costs each year for wastewater utilities nationwide.

Fatbergs

The images of the clogged systems can be downright gross. Utilities say the wipes when they flush through a home sewer’s pipe will congeal with grease and other cooking fats that are also sent improperly through sewer systems. The combination of the waste creates what is called “fatbergs” that will block pumps and pipes and which are a major cause of sewer backups and overflows into waterways.

Giant fatbergs have been reported in large-city utility systems such as in London where one particular “monster” took workers eight weeks to clean out.

“These types of materials are not designed to go into a sewer system because of the fact they do not disintegrate in water like toilet paper does” said White. “They don’t fall apart when you put them in water.”

‘Industry-wide problem’

In Alabama utility operators continuously divert their workforce to the cleanup of clogged pumps and wipes are often blamed. The effort requires in some cases extra manpower and equipment and increased power demand. Some utility operators say the effort leads to higher expenses that are often passed along to the consumer in the form of higher sewer and water bills.

“It’s a utility industry-wide problem and is of course not just here” said Samantha Coppels spokeswoman with Daphne Utilities.

Messy sanitary sewer overflows are common along Alabama’s Gulf Coast and they often occur when a utility’s pumps stop working while taking in heavy loads during downpours.

“When there are heavy rainfalls we will see heavy flow coming in” Coppels said. “We need these pumps on. So when one pump is not working and it cannot do what it can when it’s 100% operable it could (lead to) overflows.”

The collection of wipes Coppels said is “almost like anything that gets (stuck) in a motor. If something is wrapped in there and entangled it could cause damage to the equipment.”

Utility operators in Auburn Alexander City and beyond are frustrated and are left with few options on how to avoid the problem aside from public information campaigns.

There are no federal or Alabama government regulations on the wipes though some states legislatures are taking action. In Oregon lawmakers approved a bill last month that requires disposable wipes to be labeled with “Do Not Flush.” It became the second state to do so after Washington where lawmakers approved a similar bill in 2020. Illinois California Maine Massachusetts and Minnesota have entertained similar provisions and a federal “Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act of 2020” also includes a labeling requirement.

‘Pee poop and toilet paper’

Alabama utility operators are relying on pamphlets banners and bill inserts to educate the public. In Alexander City Sewer Director John McWhorter said the outreach and an “aggressive preventive maintenance” program helped with reducing sanitary sewer overflows in the Tallapoosa County city of 14800 residents.

Other cities such as Madison are looking into outreach programs to educate the public about the wipes.

David Denard director of environmental services in Jefferson County – who oversees 23 municipal sewer systems including parts of Shelby and St. Clair counties – said his agency repeatedly reminds the public of the “Three P’s” of what is allowed to be flushed down a toilet: “Pee poop and (toilet) paper.”

He added “The reality of flushable wipes is it’s a designation the wipe manufacturers come up with on their own” Denard said.

He said that Jefferson County experiences similar overflows as Mobile County and that flushable wipes are upfront when it comes to casting blame alongside improperly disposed grease.

“They don’t work independent of each other” Denard said adding that providing enough information to the public about the issue remains a challenge. “I think it’s something that us Mobile and a whole lot of people have tried to deal with. Collectively we’ve tried to come up with someone nationally.”

Mark Berte executive director of the Alabama Coastal Foundation – which oversees the Utilities United Initiative that includes 20 water and sewer utilities in South Alabama – said that education about flushable wipes will continue to be his organization’s primary focus. He said the aim is to convince enough people to forgo purchasing flushable wipes so that there is less demand for the products.

“We’re trying to educate those in this state not to spend money on flushable wipes because they cost a lot more in the long run” Berte said. “If no one buys them they won’t sell them anymore. Toilet paper is the only thing that should go into the toilets.”

He said the Coastal Foundation will provide educational resources to Gulf Coast visitors to alert them also to the potential costs and that it could be cheaper to vacation in the region if they make smart environmental decisions that includes not flushing flushable wipes down the toilets.

“Since it’s such a new product people are realizing through firsthand experience that when the toilet is clogged up they have to pay people to come and clean them out” said Berte.

‘Flushablility’

Legal strategies are not part of the equation in Alabama but a class-action lawsuit filed in January by the Charleston Water System in South Carolina is already bringing some changes. The lawsuit seeks to prohibit wipes from being marketed as “flushable” or safe for a sewer system until the companies that manufacture and sell the products can prove they disintegrate like normal toilet paper.

The lawsuit names the following companies as defendants because they either sell or manufacture flushable wipes: Costco Walmart Walgreens CVS Target Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Proctor & Gamble. Of those Kimberly-Clark reached a settlement with Charleston in April after the company vowed to improve its Cottonelle Flushable Wipes to make them disintegrate in water. The company also vowed to improve its package labeling.

Kimberly-Clark is not admitted to any wrongdoing and Saia said the company’s Cottonelle brand was the only brand that they’ve tested showing they dissolved in water.

“We feel Kimberly-Clark is less than 10% away from the flushability testing to be flushable” said Saia. He said none of the other brands come close.

Kimberly-Clark in a response to AL.com said Cottonelle Flushable Wipes contain “no plastic use 100% biodegradable fibers and have been extensively tested and proven to break down as they move through wastewater conveyance systems.” The company also noted Charleston’s tests on their products citing that their product performed best during the testing.

Costco Walmart Walgreens and Proctor & Gamble did not respond to a request for comment.

Mike DeAngelis spokesman with CVS said the Charleston complaint “mirrors claims made by other similar entities with wastewater systems that have been partially or entirely thrown out by courts due to legal deficiencies including standing.” DeAngelis said the company is “vigorously defending against this copycat lawsuit.”

Saia vowed that the Charleston lawsuit will be effective because it’s not seeking punitive damages or any financial relief.

“What we want is for them to do two things” said Saia. “Change the physical makeup of the wipes so it’s in fact flushable and improve their packaging and make the marketing say that they do not flush for the non-flushable wipes.”

He added “We want the flushable wipes to be flushable and to meet international standards for the wastewater industry.”

‘Changing mindsets’

But even if the lawsuit brings about industrywide change it won’t eliminate the frustrations utility companies will have to communicate what not to dump down sewer drains or what to leave behind in the toilet.

“Wipes are still our No. 1 we try to point out but we find other things in the lift stations” said Monica Allen spokeswoman with MAWSS in Mobile. “We find light bulbs. You would not believe everything we find.”

Getting the word out she said remains a difficulty in an era of fractured media and customers on various social media platforms.

“We could do a press conference and that is maybe something we’d want to do” Allen said. “But then you get into this ‘I don’t watch the news.’ It’s harder to reach people than it used to be.”

She added “It’s about changing mindsets and attitudes and fighting with people who say ‘they are flushable.’ But I would hope (customers) would have enough trust in your utilities that we are saying (flushable wipes are not flushable) just to be saying that. It’s very real.”

White the professor at the University of South Alabama said that wipes are a microcosm of an overall problem with general education about the sensitive nature of sewer systems and what to flush or not flush down the toilet.

“The whole wastewater system needs more education if you will” he said. “People will flush a kid’s diaper down the toilet. We didn’t design the sewers to be more than through pipes. There is a lot of education that needs to be done to the general public relating to how we should treat the sewer system.”",,,,,,,,,

Some would attribute this overwhelming show of support by the community for education funding to efforts by district leadership to create a culture of collaborative ingenuity and inclusion.

More specifically it may come down to the guidance of the Milpitas Unified School District (MUSD) under Superintendent Cheryl Jordan whose 5-year tenure began with a set of strategic goals for the future including building a “Culture of We” and identifying creative student-focused strategies to accommodate enrollment growth and ensure healthy learning environments. In other words: invest heavily in all of our children’s futures by preparing them to be the Silicon Valley leaders of tomorrow. Says Jordan “Just like the Sunnyhills neighborhood we want this new campus to reflect the Milpitas mindset of strength and richness in diversity with opportunity for all.”

Jordan’s philosophy is becoming reality in a big way with the development of the MUSD Innovation Campus slated for completion in 2024. $66.8 million from Measure AA will be used to fund this high-tech project a collection of schools and research centers that will most likely become a new hub of innovative thinking in Milpitas. The school district is seeking an additional $28 million through corporate and private donations to complete the full campus.

The design of the Innovation Campus includes 6 state-of-the-art L-shaped buildings spanning a total of 96000 square feet complete with a theatre and an admin building. Programs will include new high school and alternative high school classes that will be dedicated to students from grades 9th-12th needing special guidance to help them become successful. The campus will be located at 1331 E Calaveras Blvd. where the old Ayer High School site and district offices currently reside.

Programs will also include an adult education center; STEAM labs for coding AI computer science virtual design and construction; Career Simulation labs to familiarize students with the legal financial manufacturing and health industries; a Workforce Pathway Center; and Early Childhood Development Research Centers.

Says Jordan “The premise of this campus will be that no time goes wasted. The buildings will be alive with learners from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. When we think about learning it’s not just about going to college anymore. It’s that and so much more. Through corporate municipality and small business partnerships we hope to offer all students at the Innovation Campus opportunities through apprenticeships internships and mentorships while learning real life skills.”

MUSD has already developed partnerships with the City of Milpitas San Jose State and San Jose City College. And recently local giant KLA which has its headquarters in Milpitas donated $750000 to the project securing naming rights to the STEAM Lab building for the next three years. Says KLA Executive Director Cindy Campbell “MUSD is right in our backyard so investing in state-of-the-art capabilities for local students makes perfect sense.”

Indeed KLA has a history of collaborating with MUSD on high-tech projects including a $100000 gift to purchase Chromebooks during the pandemic a $10000 donation to Alexander-Rose Elementary in 2017 to sponsor the start of Science is Elementary in three kindergarten classrooms and supporting other technology investments and programs over the past 15 years.

Says Campbell “We created the KLA Foundation in 2007 to be the philanthropic arm of our company to focus on education wellness and community enrichment. Of course MUSD falls into both those categories. We’ve sponsored the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI) program in the past as well as the Milpitas Elementary Olympics.”

KLA has over 11000 employees worldwide with 2500 of them at the Milpitas headquarters. They manufacture semiconductor inspection and metrology equipment which gives companies like Intel the ability to inspect their silicon chips. Says Campbell “We’re the quality control that’s brought into the semiconductor manufacturing process. Semiconductors are basically a chip with several layers like a cake. Our tools inspect and make sure there are no defects—that all the strawberries are lined up correctly if you will.”

In fact the microscopes that KLA makes are extremely powerful. Powerful enough to view the DNA of a human hair. Or as Campbell explains “Imagine you’re in a satellite in space. If someone threw nickels all over San Francisco our tools could find every one.” And since semiconductor chips are in practically everything these days from cell phones to cars to appliances it’s crucial that they work.

It’s a natural partnership KLA and MUSD with both entities focused on the future. But both Campbell and Jordan know that they will need other local businesses and organizations to join them on their mission to create compassionate curious creative thinkers. With practically $28 million still needed to complete the MUSD Innovation Campus let’s hope that the business community potentially steps up. Otherwise success will await at the end of a long and winding road.

KHC,Kraft Heinz,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtxZWQub3JnL25ld3MvMTE4ODMzMTgvYmFjb24taW4tY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1tYXktc29vbi1iZS1tb3JlLWhhcmQtdG8tZmluZC1hcy1waWctcnVsZXMtdGFrZS1lZmZlY3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bacon in California May Soon Be More Hard to Find as Pig Rules Take Effect,"“We are very concerned about the potential supply impacts and therefore cost increases” said Matt Sutton the public policy director for the California Restaurant Association.

California’s restaurants and groceries use about 255 million pounds of pork a month but its farms produce only 45 million pounds according to Rabobank a global food and agriculture financial services company.

The National Pork Producers Council has asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture for federal aid to help pay for retrofitting hog facilities around the nation to fill the gap. Hog farmers said they haven’t complied because of the cost and because California hasn’t yet issued formal regulations on how the new standards will be administered and enforced.

Barry Goodwin an economist at North Carolina State University estimated the extra costs at 15% more per animal for a farm with 1000 breeding pigs.

If half the pork supply was suddenly lost in California bacon prices would jump 60% meaning a $6 package would rise to about $9.60 according to a study by the Hatamiya Group a consulting firm hired by opponents of the state proposition.

At one typical hog farm in Iowa sows are kept in open-air crates measuring 14-square-feet when they join a herd and then for a week as part of the insemination process before moving to larger roughly 20-square foot group pens with other hogs. Both are less than the 24 square feet required by the California law to give breeding pigs enough room to turn around and to extend their limbs. Other operations keep sows in the crates nearly all of the time thus also wouldn’t be in compliance.

The California Department of Food and Agriculture said that although the detailed regulations aren’t finished the key rules about space have been known for years.

“It is important to note that the law itself cannot be changed by regulations and the law has been in place since the Farm Animal Confinement Proposition (Prop 12) passed by a wide margin in 2018” the agency said in response to questions from the AP.

The pork industry has filed lawsuits but so far courts have supported the California law. The National Pork Producers Council and a coalition of California restaurants and business groups have asked Gov. Gavin Newsom to delay the new requirements. The council also is holding out hope that meat already in the supply chain could be sold potentially delaying shortages.

Josh Balk who leads farm animal protection efforts at the Humane Society of the United States said the pork industry should accept the overwhelming view of Californians who want animals treated more humanely.

“Why are pork producers constantly trying to overturn laws relating to cruelty to animals?” Balk asked. “It says something about the pork industry when it seems its business operandi is to lose at the ballot when they try to defend the practices and then when animal cruelty laws are passed to try to overturn them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvYXVnLzAxL3RvbWF0by1ncm93ZXJzLWluLXBpbmNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tomato growers in pinch,"Tomato sauce is feeling the squeeze and ketchup can't catch up.

California grows more than 90% of Americans' canned tomatoes and a third of the world's. Ongoing drought in the state has hurt the planting and harvesting of many summer crops but water-hungry ""processing tomatoes"" are caught up in a particularly treacherous swirl of problems that experts say will spur prices to surge far more than they already have.

The drought threatens to imperil some of Americans' favorite ingredients. Pizza sauce marinara tomato paste stewed tomatoes and ketchup all hang in the balance. And this comes not long after completely unrelated shortage of pizza sauce and individual ketchup packets during the height of the food-delivery-crazed pandemic.

This also comes on top of already steep increases in the price of fruits and vegetables which have been rising since the coronavirus pandemic was declared last year.

For tomatoes higher prices could start taking hold soon if not already said Wells Fargo's chief agricultural economist Michael Swanson.

""If you're a producer or a canner and see these problems coming why would you not raise prices now in anticipation?"" he said adding that consumers don't see the price tag for a lot of the processed tomatoes consumed away from home. ""It's embedded in the menu board -- but it is one more reason prices at Chipotle and Pizza Hut will go up.""

In a normal year Aaron Barcellos a farmer in Firebaugh Calif. grows 2200 acres of processing tomatoes. This year he's decided to drop to 900 acres on his farm which is on the border of Merced and Fresno counties. He's left the remaining acres unplanted choosing to focus all of his precious water on almonds pistachios and olives grown on trellises -- crops that command higher prices and represent already-significant sunken costs.

""We get 8 inches of rain in a normal year. Last year we got 4½ inches"" he said. ""We got zero percent of our water allocation which forced us to buy a lot of expensive water and it doesn't make sense to put it on tomatoes.""

He said many growers have made the decision to use their limited water on permanent crops -- trees and things like grape vines -- choosing to forgo planting annuals like tomatoes onions and garlic or even letting crops already planted wither in the desertlike conditions.

This year's shortage of processing tomatoes has been a long time in the making. Farmers already had been planting fewer tomatoes. From 2015-19 fewer countries were importing American tomatoes partly because the dollar was strong which made U.S. canned tomato products more expensive. This created an oversupply of California tomatoes said Rob Neenan chief executive of the California League of Food Producers.

Processors cut back their orders and farmers planted fewer acres. At the same time partly because of a trade war a global shortage of steel sheets used to make cans for food production caused can prices to soar. Major processing plants in Williams Lemoore and Stockton Calif. closed citing higher production expenses leaving fewer places for growers to sell. Inventory at the beginning of 2020 was low and supplies had tightened up worldwide.

And then the pandemic hit. Cue the tomato hoarding.

Frank Muller a multigenerational tomato grower and president of M Three Ranches in Woodland Calif. in Yolo County euphemistically describes the market last year as ""disrupted.""

Early in the pandemic gallon cans of tomatoes sat unwanted on restaurant distributor shelves hurting those who sold to the restaurant industry and other food-service sectors -- this included caterers event arenas and corporate cafeterias that all closed in the spring of 2020. Meanwhile retail sales at grocery stores -- from 5-ounce cans of paste to 28-ounce cans of diced -- soared.

""If you were just selling to food service they didn't want all those tomatoes last year when restaurants closed. But if you were in retail you were in hog heaven"" he said going on to describe the uptick in pandemic pizza delivery which used up all of those gallon cans followed by a ketchup shortage when curbside pickups and food delivery services grabbed all of the little packets.

On top of the chaos of the supply problem there's still the threat of the coronavirus. Thousands of farmworkers throughout California have gotten sick on the job. Outbreaks still occur despite robust vaccination pushes.

Muller said there were few infections among his farmworkers because his tomatoes are mechanically picked but he's worried about worker shortages.

""We made it through last year but here we are and the workforce is still not returning because of enhanced unemployment benefits and that has affected seasonal processing plants"" Muller said.

All these problems are leading to fewer tomatoes. Processors reined in their estimate of how many tons of tomatoes they would contract for this year dropping it by more than a million tons and now even that looks overly hopeful. Muller said this is the first year processors didn't get all the tomato tonnage they wanted from farmers. ""This year will be some of the lowest inventory levels that we've ever seen"" he said.

Prices were already on the rise. In April processing tomatoes worldwide was 7% more expensive than during three previous seasons according to the World Processing Tomato Council. And before this summer's heat wave struck the California Tomato Growers Association had negotiated a price on behalf of farmers with the tomato processors that is 5.6% higher than last growing season because as Muller says farmers' expenses are rising. ""Supplies fuel drip tape anything with steel you name it it's going up.""

""Tomato processors have very expensive facilities that can only do one thing. If they don't want to be out of business they will have to bid up tomatoes rather than leave facilities idle"" said Swanson the agricultural economist.

Those price increases are expected to be passed along to the big companies that contract with processors agricultural experts say. Companies that have deep ties to tomatoes have yet to signal price increases. Kraft Heinz declined to comment about pricing for this article as did Campbell Soup which is a grower as well as a processor and uses about 2 billion pounds of tomatoes annually for its iconic soup V8 beverages and Prego and Pace sauces.

But a lot of these business decisions were made before the recent blistering record heat wave. Fresno County the top producer of tomatoes saw a long stretch of triple-digit temperatures. Yolo Kings Merced and San Joaquin are the next largest in terms of tomato production and all five are in the ""exceptional drought"" category the highest level on the U.S. drought map. Severe drought conditions have enveloped nearly all of California's landmass with the state's rain and snowfall well below average and its network of reservoirs holding much less water than usual.

Muller said in a typical year he has allocated 3 or 4 feet of water for every acre of farmland that needs irrigation. This year he got a smidgen of 1 foot just 3.6 inches of water per acre. Much less rain than usual as well as much less irrigation water than usual means growers must turn to groundwater which is more expensive to save their crops.

""In Yolo County we have relatively stable groundwater and replenishment of the aquifer. It's like having money in the bank so we're pumping water out of the ground like a withdrawal"" he said. ""We're just keeping our fingers crossed that the water table will maintain itself. That's caused a whole new level of concern.""

Greg Pruett chief executive of Ingomar Packing Co. in Los Banos a partnership of four growers says the situation is going to be significantly worse next year because while there were reasonable reservoir levels going into this growing season that will be entirely depleted by growers turning to groundwater.

Last month California's State Water Resources Control Board released an order that would cut farmers off from turning to rivers and streams in the Sacramento and San Joaquin river watersheds removing yet another source of water in an extreme drought year.

""Growers will have the worst water situation ever by the end of this growing season"" Pruett said. ""The cost increases this year -- in water cans all the other ingredients labor transportation -- all those things add up to major cost inflation. And that pales in comparison to what's going to happen next year.""

Bottom line he says: If the drought continues and the water table dips significantly many growers may not plant tomatoes next year.

The complex began operations in early March and already has delivered more than 30000 orders.

One of several advantages the facility brings to Kroger is its ability to provide groceries to areas from north of Dayton to Northern Kentucky and southeast Indiana where the company doesn’t have stores as well as where it does have them.

Kroger on Thursday had a similar ceremony at its second such facility in Groveland Fla. a suburb of Orlando.

“We really believe that customers will always eat” said Kroger Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen. “Now how they will eat will always change. And we aim to be there for the customer the way they eat and Ohio and Cincinnati has always been a dear part of that. And obviously Monroe is part of that as well.”

McMullen said Kroger aims to double its digital business by 2023. That business now is $10 billion with a goal of $20 billion he said.

Company officials praised the state its private JobsOhio development organization and southwest Ohio’s REDI Cincinnati development group for the location choice.

“We’re still hiring” announced Gabriel Arreaga senior vice president of supply chain for Kroger.

The company said drivers who are also expected to provide customer service are paid $19 per hour plus benefits.

Matt Davis the operation’s general manager said it was gratifying “to be the first to set history not just in Cincinnati but kind-of American history within the industry opening up the facility first of its kind.”

The group is so proud of its pioneering facility that when Davis ends meetings the groups together say “Safety first and then in unison — loudly — ‘launch.’”

He had the news conference audience including DeWine together say “launch.”

There are advantages of using the service company officials said. For one thing said Brian Johnson inventory control supervisor when a customer orders an apple “We’ve got the best apple going out to you.” That’s because the service has to meet expectations of its pickiest customers.

Refrigerated and frozen foods always remain that way from when they enter the facility until they arrive at a customer’s door in trucks that have refrigerated and non-refrigerated areas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9tZW1waGlzL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wOC8wMS9rcm9nZXItdXBkYXRlcy1tYXNrLWd1aWRhbmNlLWFzLWNvdmlkLXN1cmdlcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kroger updates mask guidance as the COVID-19 Delta variant surges - Memphis Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2021/08/01/kroger-updates-mask-guidance-as-covid-surges.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9tZW1waGlzL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wOC8wMS9rcm9nZXItdXBkYXRlcy1tYXNrLWd1aWRhbmNlLWFzLWNvdmlkLXN1cmdlcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA3LzMxL2Rpc25leS13YWxtYXJ0LXZhY2NpbmUtbWFuZGF0ZS1kZWx0YS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney and Walmart mandate employees get vaccinated to work in response to delta variant,"Disney and Walmart announced Friday that they are implementing coronavirus vaccine mandates for some of their employees as two of the largest U.S. companies became the latest corporate giants to embrace vaccination in the face of renewed pandemic restrictions.

Groceries were offered at a steep discount and sample items were displayed in glass cabinets.

""To purchase the customer will insert a key in a hole in the showcase beside the sample article press a button"" TIME Magazine reported at the time. ""In the stockroom the proper article will drop on a conveyor belt leading to the cashier's desk. Simultaneously the purchase price is recorded on an adding machine. After all purchases are made the customer sticks his key into the adding machine gets his bill. Using another key the cashier releases the purchases all wrapped for the customer.""

The idea was an ambitious one but the three Keedoozle locations failed to last even a year. The mechanical technology was not capable of handling the high traffic loads and customers began to flock back to groceries staffed by a team of humans. Since then supermarkets have flirted on and off with new technology to further automate the grocery shopping experience; for instance by 2025 it is predicted that 1.2 million units will be installed worldwide.

But over the last year — as more and more Americans looked for alternatives to traditional grocery shopping amid the novel coronavirus pandemic — there's been an uptick in the development and popularity of supermarket services that utilize artificial intelligence.

Lindon Gao is the chief executive officer of Caper a technology company that created the Caper Cart the ""world's first AI-powered shopping cart."" Originally launched in 2019 at the New York-based supermarket Foodcellar & Co. the Caper Cart looks like a typical shopping cart. However as customers place items in the basket they are weighed measured and priced; additionally a screen affixed to the cart offers shoppers basket-based recommendations and nearby deals.

For instance if I've placed tortillas queso fresco and salsa in my cart the screen may recommend that I venture over to the produce aisle to snag some avocados which are on sale.

""I've always shopped for groceries once a week with my family"" Gao said. ""And if you look at how grocery stores were 100 years ago versus today it's virtually the same act. Given the emergence of automation across every single industry I think grocery retail is long overdue for a positive injection of automation.""

Gao explained that the design of the Caper Cart is actually pretty simple. There are four high-powered cameras on each corner of the cart and pad in the base of the basket to weigh items. The items are then logged on the on-camera computer which customers can also use to pay.

""Caper brings at least two major benefits for the shopper as well"" Gao said. ""Number one you get to bypass the lines and it's just more convenient. The second part is that Caper has the ability to interface with customers at the shop so based on what you have put inside the basket and where you are in the store it will give you tailored recommendations to make your shopping journey a lot smarter.""

Caper provides an obvious benefit for supermarket owners and managers as well. Retailers have an opportunity to observe shopper behavior in more detail especially as Caper is able to extract data from the carts and provide them to stores so that they can optimize their inventory holdings.

When asked if Gao — or Caper as a whole — had received any pushback from consumers or retailers who were concerned about the concept of artificial intelligence becoming a part of their supermarket experience (despite the fact that AI is an ever-growing part of both the online shopping experience and our lives) he said that it's not been an issue.

""The consumers are receptive if we build a good product and I think that's the most important thing"" he said. ""Maybe five years ago when people were less familiar [with AI] they would have been a lot less receptive but now it's more common.""

He continued: ""One of our mottos is 'Make shopping magic' and with technology and AI that's what we have been able to build.""

The intersection between grocery shopping and artificial intelligence technology is also picking up outside the supermarket aisles especially as the pandemic inspired home cooks to look for alternatives to in-person shopping. For instance in late 2020 Kroger launched Chef Bot an AI-powered Twitter recipe tool ""that helps users' pair the groceries in their fridge and reduce food waste by providing mealtime inspiration and personalized recommendations.""

Users simply snap a photo of three ingredients from their refrigerator or pantry. Users then tweet their photo to @KrogerChefbot. Through artificial intelligence Chefbot identifies ingredients and then provides users with a list of personalized recipe recommendations based on the selected ingredients.

""Chefbot illustrates how marketers can tap into augmented intelligence to deliver true service and value"" said Menno Kluin the chief creative officer of 360i in a press release. ""Innovation often happens during times of seismic change. By leveraging visual AI in a bold new way Kroger is bringing their promise of 'Fresh for Everyone' to life while addressing pain points and helping shoppers maximize their purchases.""

Another company that saw an increase in interest during the pandemic was Hungryroot a personalized virtual grocery service that uses machine learning and predictive modeling to build grocery lists based on user preferences. The service gets to know users by having them complete a quiz about their typical buying patterns and their eating preferences like whether they are vegetarian vegan or gluten-free.

Hungryroot then compiles a personalized shopping list and from there users can add or subtract items. The order is then shipped directly to their doorsteps.

According to Dave Kong Hungryroot's chief technology officer most of their customers don't change the list recommended by the service.

""In fact 72% they don't change it"" Kong said. ""Now for the few who do have some kind of special preference for other items as they change it our technology notes that. It learns from your habits and how you're editing and that's then taken into account for your next box and the next box.""

According to Michael Ruhlman the author of ""Grocery: The Buying and Selling of Food in America"" while it may seem like the grocery shopping experience has remained stagnant for decades — and in many ways it has — we as a country moved relatively rapidly from the days of the neighborhood grocer to those of the big-box supermarket.

""One of the big things was the creation of Piggly Wiggly in 1916 which did something that no other store had done before"" Ruhlman said. ""Which was to have customers pick out their own food. That was one thing. The second was the introduction of the first real supermarket King Kullen which brought all the different categories — greengrocer dairy meat — all into one store and that was in 1930.""

According to Ruhlman many of the changes in the business of grocery selling are sparked by innovations in the world of technology — like the invention of the cardboard boxes tin cans wire-woven grocery baskets and more recently the temperature-controlled Amazon lockers at Whole Foods.

""Interestingly Piggly Wiggly because they were letting shoppers do their own picking they had to create a shopping cart that people could roll around and about 20 years after they started a nesting shopping cart changed the way we shop for food"" he said. ""So I like the way that non-food products alter the way that we buy our food. AI is just the latest iteration.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9sYXd5ZXItZmlsZXMtbmV3LWFwcGVhbC1mb3ItZnJhbmtsaW4tcmVnaW9uYWwtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtYXR0YWNrZXItYWxleC1ocmliYWwv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9sYXd5ZXItZmlsZXMtbmV3LWFwcGVhbC1mb3ItZnJhbmtsaW4tcmVnaW9uYWwtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtYXR0YWNrZXItYWxleC1ocmliYWwv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lawyer Files New Appeal For Franklin Regional High School Attacker Alex Hribal,"By: KDKA-TV News Staff

The unified network is expected to provide a seamless integrated network management capability to simplify user experience increase situational awareness and strengthen cyber network defense according to Army officials. Under a unified network communication offices from the tactical edge through corps level will have fewer network management and monitoring applications and tools to enhance their ability to plan configure manage monitor and secure the network. Lt. Gen. John Morrison Jr. USA the service’s deputy chief of staff G-6 has described the separation of enterprise and tactical networks as a false divide.

Modernization efforts include fielding enhanced equipment to signal battalions cutting-edge command posts and commercial satellite communications capabilities. However as the Army provides one advanced capability after another it also injects more sophisticated and complex systems creating challenges for signal officers and soldiers.

Paul Mehney a spokesman for the Program Executive Office-Command Control and Communications-Tactical (PEO-C3T) says the office is providing “leaps ahead in connectivity leaps ahead in the ability to maneuver leaps ahead in the ability to know where their soldiers are located and push that data location data and operational mission command data across echelons up and down.

“We’re obviously providing additional commercial network capability in the units at a fairly rapid pace. That comes with challenges for how you manage all of this additional capability” Mehney explains. “What that creates is a larger burden and a greater degree of difficulty to manage those networks and then to be able to operate all of the various network management tools that come with that.”

He adds that it is critical for the service to begin removing some of that complexity. The PEO-C3T plans an array of technologies to achieve that goal. Three of those either are being fielded now or will be soon.

They are the Network Operations Management System (NOMS) which is used to manage the network and support non-classified classified and coalition network enclaves with a common look and functionality; Atom described as a single planning and loading tool that supports multiple tactical radios; and the Ruggedized Application Platform-Tactical Radio (RAP-TR) which consolidates lower tactical network tools onto a single Dell laptop or tablet to streamline tactical network management.

The systems are included in a suite of tools that reduces the time it takes to initialize plan and load a brigade’s worth of radios from four weeks to less than two hours. The Army is rapidly developing and fielding the technologies under the Unified Network Operations mid-tier acquisition effort.

Maj. Nick Perkinson USA the PEO-C3T assistant product manager for Network Operations describes the technology trio as “foundational prototype efforts” that will eventually come together under a Unified Network Operations program of record. “We’re putting it together in pieces right now. Once all of this comes together we will have the ability to plan monitor and manage both the upper and lower tactical Internet with a consolidated user interface as well as an open architecture API [application programming interface] to allow all of it to communicate together as well as create an industry standard tool for any applications that are going to reside on it or communicate with it.”

Atom in a nutshell is a capability for planning the radio network or the lower tactical Internet planning capability. NOMS is the monitoring and management capability for the upper tactical Internet which primarily includes satellite communications. RAP-TR houses Atom and a myriad of other planning monitoring and management tools.

As a part of the NOMS effort the Army is consolidating 24 different software programs into one common tool that soldiers will use to monitor and manage approximately 15 systems already in the field. It will be the centralized monitoring and management tool within a network operation and support center allowing a view of the network and the ability to push out software updates or patches.

The PacStar technology will benefit both on-the-move and at-the-halt communications. “It enables you to see an entire picture of your network your data latency your bandwidth and basically just a communications common operating picture with the ability to troubleshoot and fix it as needed. The at-the-halt version is going to be fielded later this year and the on-the-move version is currently in production” Maj. Perkinson reports.

Atom which is built by L3 Harris consolidates eight network operations tools. It also reduces by 75 percent the number of steps for the signal soldier to plan a radio network. Together Atom and RAP-TR reduce training time from 220 hours for previous network planning tools to 80 hours. The training time is expected to drop to about 60 hours next year due to improvements based on soldier feedback.

Atom supports multiple tactical radios including the AN/PRC 148 158 162 and 163 as well as legacy waveforms such as the Mobile User Objective System Single Channel Ground to Air Radio System and Integrated Waveform/Demand Assigned Multiple Access. The pilot effort will continue through the 2021 fiscal year and is expected to obtain fielding approval by the next fiscal year.

Army officials were expected to release an updated version in July capable of loading more radios. They also intend to add map editing capabilities. Atom provides a network plan but it can be cumbersome for soldiers to add or subtract radios according to Maj. Perkinson. “Through a lot of the soldier touchpoints and group discussions we’ve identified that they want to be able to edit to make even these small changes easier. We’re going to try to cut down on the time it would take to make all these changes to meet each and every unit’s specific need.”

The RAP-TR system is currently housed on both laptops and tablets but the Army is moving toward a tablets-only solution in part because younger soldiers prefer tablets and because airborne units need systems that weigh less than two pounds. “Currently we have nine applications that are on the RAP-TR laptop and tablet as it stands today. We’re going to move from the laptop to the tablet in the future which will be lighter have a stronger battery and be able to house more applications” says Kevin Blohm RAP-TR assistant product lead.

Additionally the Army is talking with officials from the other services to provide multi-service tools on RAP-TR. The system is being fielded as part of the Army’s Capability Set 21. Currently it is being delivered to the 173rd Airborne Brigade which is based in Italy and Germany and to the 3rd Brigade 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii. The 3rd Brigade 82nd Airborne Division is next in line.

The official Unified Network Operations program of record is scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2024 and the initial technology package will be fielded as part of Capability Set 25. While the service already has significantly reduced the number of network tools soldiers must contend with the program of record will continue to “collapse” the number of tools even further says Brent Smith deputy product manager Tactical and Cyber Network Operations within the PEO-C3T office.

Many of the technologies developed for the tactical network will ultimately be adapted for the enterprise applications as well. “The current construct moving into the Unified Network Operations program of record is to develop or focus tools at the tactical level and then scale those to encompass the requirements of the enterprise network” Smith explains.

Maj. Perkinson indicates that simplifying the network is no simple task. “Managing the ever-growing network complexity is always a challenge. There are lots of different tools out there and just trying to give the soldier the best capability to manage or execute all of those different tools trying to keep up with technology to provide the best function to the warfighter that’s always a challenge” he says. “It’s not getting any easier. We’re just trying to make it easier.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

TMZ reported Yesterday (July 30) that West was planning another event at the city’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium for August 5 the night before the album’s official release date. Sources reportedly told the publication that stadium employees have been hired for the event.

TMZ also reported that CAA and Live Nation were putting pressure on West and his production team to make the second ‘DONDA’ event different to the first.

This second listening party has now been confirmed by entertainment group Live Nation who made the announcement on social media today (July 31). The August 5 event dubbed Kanye West Presents The DONDA Album Release will feature creative direction by Balenciaga’s Demna Gvasalia and suggests that the album will be released immediately after.

The album was slated to be released last Friday (July 23) via G.O.O.D. Music/Def Jam Recordings but in true Kanye fashion the album did not materialise on said date. A rep has since confirmed that ‘DONDA’ will be now released on August 6.

It emerged last weekend that the rapper had moved into the Mercedes-Benz Stadium to finish work on the record and this past week he shared pictures of his humble living quarters.

Meanwhile a Kanye West fan is selling a bag of what they claim is air from the rapper’s first listening event for ‘DONDA’.

In 1973 Freddie Mercury Brian May Roger Taylor and John Deacon released their debut self-titled album which caught the attention of fellow future rock star Dee Snider. Speaking exclusively with Express.co.uk the Twisted Sister singer said he remembered hearing the track Liar come on the radio and was hooked instantly.

Dee shared: “Liar came on and I was like ‘Who the f*** is this?’ From that point on I was a Queen fan…from day one.

“I discovered their first album and I remember going to see them open for Mott the Hoople in New York.”

But this was so early in Queen’s career for Freddie Mercury and the band that Dee found himself to be the only one cheering them on.

The 66-year-old remembered: “I was the only person in the entire theatre not just cheering I was in the balcony standing in my platform shoes with my big afro screaming my lungs out.”

The Low-boom Flight Demonstration mission has two goals: 1) design and build a piloted large-scale supersonic X-plane with technology that reduces the loudness of a sonic boom to that of a gentle thump; and 2) fly the X-plane over select U.S. communities to gather data on human responses to the low-boom flights and deliver that data set to U.S. and international regulators.

Using this data new sound-based rules regarding supersonic flight over land can be written and adopted which would open the doors to new commercial cargo and passenger markets to provide faster-than-sound air travel.

Elements of NASA’s Low-boom mission are organized within two of the agency’s aeronautics programs — the Advanced Air Vehicles Program and the Integrated Aviation Systems Program — and managed by a systems project office whose members span both programs and all four of NASA’s aeronautical research field centers: Langley Research Center in Virginia; Glenn Research Center in Cleveland; and Ames Research Center and Armstrong Flight Research Center both located in California.

Assembly of NASA’s X-59 Quiet SuperSonic Technology aircraft is underway at Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works in Palmdale Calif. and is making good progress.

NASA plans as early as 2024 to fly the X-59 over select communities on missions to gather information about how the public will react to the level of quiet supersonic flight noise the aircraft is designed to produce — if they hear anything at all.

Data collected will be shared with federal and international regulators to help them set new rules that may allow supersonic flight over land and enable a whole new market for commercial faster-than-sound air travel.

“This mission is the culmination of decades of research and with the X-59 we are continuing to pioneer a future of aviation in which we will see drastically reduced flight times for global-travelling passengers” said Peter Coen NASA’s Low-Boom Flight Demonstration Mission Integration Manager.

At the Skunk Works each construction milestone brings the aircraft closer to first flight.

One of those milestones is with the X-59’s eXternal Vision System or XVS which is a forward-facing camera and display system that allows the pilot to see outside the aircraft via augmented reality.

The XVS is NASA’s solution to the aircraft’s lack of a forward-facing window — a result of the need to place the cockpit lower and farther back on the airplane because of its unique elongated nose and fuselage profile.

The innovative XVS system underwent successful flight tests in August 2019 and passed several rounds of qualification testing in January 2020.

Major progress has been made on the aircraft’s wing thanks to the Skunk Works’ Combined Operation: Bolting and Robotic Auto-drill (COBRA) system. This advanced robotic technology enhances production by drilling and inspecting hundreds of holes on the wing that are part of the assembly process.

Meanwhile pallet brackets have been installed into the airframe for the XVS and Flight Test Instrumentation Systems marking the first installation of components supplied directly by NASA for the X-59.

Moreover the X-59 has achieved several other milestones including delivery of several major aircraft segments that will be installed. These include the F414-GE-100 turbofan engine from General Electric Aviation the aircraft’s vertical tail and the one-of-a-kind extended-length nose.

Although production and assembly have continued at a steady pace in many areas the development of an all new full scale experimental aircraft is not without its challenges.

As a result some schedule updates have been implemented.

NASA now expects the X-59’s assembly to be complete and major ground testing to begin in summer 2021 leading to a target date for first flight in summer 2022.

“The integrated NASA and Lockheed X-59 team is doing an amazing job given the challenging circumstances of COVID-19” said NASA’s LBFD Project Manager Craig Nickol. “The team has shown remarkable resilience and we’re excited to see the visible progress on X-59 assembly and integration every day. Although we have had some challenges in 2020 the team has responded well by updating plans and continuing to make progress.

We’re looking forward to several important milestones this year.”

These milestones include completion of manufacturing the X-59’s wing and its mating to the aircraft’s fuselage.

“We are more than half-way complete with the build of this one-of-a-kind X-plane” said David Richardson X-59 Program Director Lockheed Martin Skunk Works. “We will soon complete close-out of the wing which is the central structural anchor of the aircraft and we will then prepare for mate of the empennage fuselage and the distinctive super long nose. The team has done a phenomenal job of advancing aerospace technology and working through challenges to drive progress all of which has been enabled by our close partnership with NASA.”

None of the schedule adjustments threaten timing of the ultimate goal of delivering results of the community overflights to the International Civil Aviation Organization and Federal Aviation Administration in 2027.

With that information in hand regulators will be able to decide if a change should be made in rules that prohibit supersonic flight over land — a decision that would be expected in 2028.

Before then however and even as the X-59 aircraft is under construction other teams of NASA’s aeronautical innovators are preparing for their roles in what NASA calls the Low-Boom Flight Demonstration mission.

Once the X-59 begins flying it will be important to validate that it is capable of producing supersonic shockwaves that will lead to quiet thumps in place of loud sonic booms. This will require tools for shock wave visualization in-flight pressure measurement and acoustic validation — technologies which are continuing preparation and testing at NASA both on the ground and in the air.

These acoustic validation flights are targeted for 2023.

At the same time critical planning and preparation for the community overflights continues — flights that are expected to begin in late 2024. The effort is taking advantage of lessons learned from a flight series that took place over Galveston Texas in 2018.

Taken together this mission work is spread across three projects within NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate. They include the Commercial Supersonic Technology project managed out of NASA’s Langley Research Center the Flight Demonstrations and Capabilities project managed out of NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center and the Low Boom Flight Demonstrator project responsible for the X-59 aircraft itself managed out of Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters in Washington D.C.

The X-59’s mission to provide regulators with data that may open the future to supersonic flight over land drastically reducing flight times is the culmination of decades of NASA supersonic research. While the challenge is there NASA as it always has is pioneering the future of flight through the first “A” in its name — Aeronautics.

The deal will also include up to 60 T408-GE-400 Engines and up to 36 embedded GPS/Inertial Navigation Systems (EGI) with Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) as well as an unspecified number of GAU-21 .50 caliber machine guns and more.

The main contractors will be Lockheed Martin Global and General Electric Company. It is worth an estimated $3.4 billion.

“The United States is committed to the security of Israel  and it is vital to US national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability” the State Department said.

“The proposed sale will improve the Israeli Air Force’s capability to transport armored vehicles personnel and equipment to support distributed operations. Israel will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense” the statement added.

Israel announced in February that it would purchase one squadron of CH-53K over Boeing’s CH-47 to replace its fleet of Yasur helicopters at Tel Nof Air Base.

First used by the IAF in 1969 the Yasur is the air force’s primary helicopter used to transport soldiers and equipment and has taken part in a wide variety of missions including secret operations as well as search and rescue missions.

Defense Minister Benny Gantz said the CH-53K has been “adapted” to the Air Force’s operational requirements and that the decision to purchase the CH-53k was a significant step in building up the IDF’s capabilities.

“It is also essential to the IDF’s ability to carry out a wide range of operational activities” Gantz said adding that “the decision was made following a professional assessment that included test flights in all the proposed aircraft as well as a thorough examination of the various alternatives in terms of engineering technology maintenance and other considerations.”

The CH-53K King Stallion the successor to the CH-53 is powered by three engines giving it a cruising speed of 261 kph. and a range of 852 km. (530 miles). Operated by a crew of 5 including 2 pilots and a combat crew of 3 gunners it is fitted with self-defense weapons and ballistic protection and also has crash-worthy seats and retracting landing gear significantly increasing aircraft and crew survivability.

The fuel tanks have also been designed to have inert gases pumped into them instead of allowing oxygen to build up inside giving them a better likelihood to survive if hit by incoming projectiles.

The CH-53K is fitted with digital fly-by-wire avionics with fully integrated flight and navigation displays and has a mechanical diagnostic system that notifies maintenance crews when a part needs to be replaced and can carry three times the amount of cargo able to be carried by older helicopters."

The Los Angeles Lakers were reportedly ""close to the finish line"" on a deal to acquire Buddy Hield before completing the trade for Russell Westbrook on Thursday according to Zach Lowe of ESPN.

Los Angeles was prepared to send Kyle Kuzma and Montrezl Harrell to the Sacramento Kings for Hield before shifting its focus to Westbrook. The team sent Kuzma and Harrell to the Washington Wizards along with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a first-round pick for the star point guard and two future second-rounders as first reported by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.

""The Westbrook deal came together fast"" Lowe noted.

The deal should make LeBron James happy considering he reportedly spoke with Westbrook and Anthony Davis earlier this month about joining forces in Los Angeles according to Broderick Turner of the Los Angeles Times.

Even with questions surrounding Westbrook fit in L.A. he is still a nine-time All-Star and former MVP who can take over games.

The Hield near-trade creates a ""what if"" scenario for the Lakers especially with Lowe noting the team could have also kept Caldwell-Pope and possibly re-signed point guard Dennis Schroder. The first-round pick might have also added a contributing rotation member.

While these players don't have the same star power as Westbrook it might have been a better fit alongside James and Davis while creating a lot more spacing offensively. Hield shot 39.1 percent from three-point range last year while Caldwell-Pope hit 41.0 percent of his attempts representing much bigger perimeter threats compared to Westbrook (31.5 percent).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVoYWx0b24uY29tL25ld3MvaW1tZWRpYXRlbHktc3RvcC11c2luZy1tYWpvci1yZWNhbGwtb2YtZ2VuZXJhdG9ycy1zb2xkLWJ5LWNvc3Rjby1ob21lLWRlcG90LWxvd2VzLWFtYXpvbi1hbmQvYXJ0aWNsZV9mMTYwZGViMi1lYTNhLTU4ZWQtOTUyNC01ZTViOTljNTE1ZjUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'IMMEDIATELY STOP USING': Major recall of generators sold by Costco Home Depot Lowe's Amazon and other ...,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

If you buy a product we have recommended we may receive affiliate commission which in turn supports our work.

We're superfans of lululemon's sports bras — and don't even get us started on the lululemon's leggings! — but now the athletic brand is delving into a new category in the midst of COVID-19: face masks lululemon's Double Strap Mask to be specific.

According to a Men's Health review of the Double Strap Mask from Lululemon the two adjustable straps — in lieu of the traditional ear loops — come in handy when you're working out because they prevent the mask from shifting. There's a top strap that goes around the back of your head and a bottom strap for the nape of your neck. Note: Lululemon told POPSUGAR that these masks were made however for everyday wear not directly for workouts.

The fabric also used for Lululemon's popular sports bras is lightweight and breathable and is also advertised as having moisture-wicking technology that's quick to dry. Sounds good to us! Here's yet another plus: the price. Three face masks goes for just $28.

If you need a face mask while out in public — especially when you know you'll be in crowded and enclosed settings near others — you may want to consider Lululemon. Please keep in mind though that face masks are encouraged to thwart the spread of COVID-19 and that the most effective everyday face masks for protecting yourself and others have multiple layers of cloth with higher thread counts (as opposed to single-layered cloth masks).

The Lululemon Double Strap Face Mask is launching on the afternoon of Nov. 17 via lululemon.com in 10 different patterns and colorways and it will be available in stores starting Nov. 24. If you buy one of these Lululemon instructs you to wash the mask before use and it should be machine-washed in cold water (preferably in a laundry bag).

Wes Ball’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes from 20th Century Studios the first Apes release under the Disney empire is looking at $21M-$22M today (which includes previews) for a what is looking like a $52M-$55M opening at 4075 theaters. Tracking saw it around $50M.

Also the opening is in the vicinty of the first and third chapter of the previous millennium trilogy: 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M Friday $54.8M 3-day) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M Friday $56.2M 3-day). RT Audience sentiment is still at 82%.

The rest of the top five is as follows:

2.) Fall Guy (Uni) 4008 theaters Fri $3.6M 3-day $14.5M -48% Total $50.5M/Wk 2

3.) Challengers (AMZ) 2609 theaters Fri $1.55M 3-day $5M -34% Total $38.3M/Wk 3

4.) Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Fri $1M 3-day $3.4M -48% Total $12M/Wk 2

5.) Godzilla x Kong (WB/Leg) 2531 theaters Fri $700K 3-day $3M -34% Total $192.3M/Wk 7

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9vcGluaW9ucy9yZWNsaW5pbmctc2VhdC1yYWdlLWFpcnBsYW5lLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtcG9vbGUvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBWWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvb3BpbmlvbnMvcmVjbGluaW5nLXNlYXQtcmFnZS1haXJwbGFuZS1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLXBvb2xl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: I’m a flight attendant. You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space.

Department of Veterans Affairs officials improperly approved nearly $11 million in bonuses to senior executives intended for other workers a department watchdog said in a new report.

The money was recently allocated by Congress and intended to be used to recruit ""critical skill"" employees but ended up in the hands of senior executives in the VA's central Washington office according to an inspector general's report posted Thursday.

The funds authorized by the Pact Act were meant to be incentives in hiring and retaining specialists needed to process billion in new benefits for veterans dealing with health issues from being exposed to burn pits. Agent Orange and other toxic hazards.

The IG report said the money was paid instead as bonuses to more than 180 senior executives last year with several taking home more than $100000.

The average bonus paid out was over $55000 the report said.

The Washington Post first reported the results of the inspector general's investigation.

The IG said the improperly approved bonuses were due in part to breakdowns in leadership and controls at multiple levels of the VA.

The IG recommended the ""Secretary of Veterans Affairs or his designee takes appropriate action to determine whether individuals involved in the decision-making process ... had any actual or apparent conflicts of interest and develop a process to ensure all decision-makers are free from conflicts when awarding future incentives.""

When Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough in September ordered the executives to return the money most did or agreed to do so but 19 have challenged having to repay the bonuses the IG report said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida HBCU backs away from dubious $237M donation,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/florida-a-m-backs-away-from-dubious-237m-donation-00157234 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Ukrainian M-2 Sneaked Up On A Russian Tank—And Hit From A Mile Away,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/05/08/a-ukrainian-m-2-fighting-vehicle-sneaked-up-on-a-russian-t-80-tank-at-night-and-hit-it-with-a-missile-from-a-mile-away/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

This payment means that the dividend yield will be 4.2% which is around the industry average.

View our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum

Marathon Petroleum's Distributions May Be Difficult To Sustain

Unless the payments are sustainable the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Marathon Petroleum isn't generating any profits and it is paying out a very high proportion of the cash it is earning. This is quite a strong warning sign that the dividend may not be sustainable.

Over the next year EPS might fall by 50.1% based on recent performance. This means the company will be unprofitable and managers could face the tough choice between continuing to pay the dividend or taking pressure off the balance sheet.

Marathon Petroleum Has A Solid Track Record

Even over a long history of paying dividends the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from US$0.40 in 2011 to the most recent annual payment of US$2.32. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 19% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.

Dividend Growth Potential Is Shaky

Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Over the past five years it looks as though Marathon Petroleum's EPS has declined at around 50% a year. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough.

Marathon Petroleum's Dividend Doesn't Look Sustainable

Overall it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment but we think that longer term the current level of payment might be unsustainable. Although they have been consistent in the past we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.

Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile despite the importance of dividend payments they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example we've identified 2 warning signs for Marathon Petroleum (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing. We have also put together a list of global stocks with a solid dividend.

To Exit Marriott System,"Marriott is about to lose two W Hotels in Washington D.C. And Atlanta Midtown. Both are legacy Starwood properties.

The W in Washington exits on August 31 and supposedly becomes an independent hotel and W Atlanta Midtown has already disappeared on Marriott’s website and becomes Curio Collection by Hilton.

You can access Marriott here and Hilton here.

ADVERTISEMENT

W Washington D.C.

There is an ownership change of this hotel and the new owner has decided to deflag the property. The hotel likely goes independent that could work well for it due to recent renovations and a highly desirable location.

The last date to book and stay at W Washington D.C. is August 30th 2021. The hotel exits the Marriott system on September 1st.

W Atlanta Midtown

The hotel has already gone from Marriott’s website and only returns an error.

There appears to be a change in the progress to transform this hotel into a Curio Collection hotel by Hilton.

Conclusion

It is normal for hotels to exit systems go independent or reflag but the Covid-19 has accelerated the progress.

Perhaps hotels that both under and overperform consider the best path and brand for them going forward and how much being part of a system is beneficial for them.

W Washington is strong enough to become an independent hotel that will likely do well. W Atlanta Midtown is not as strong and certainly benefits from being part of Hilton under Curio Collection.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vcGFzb3JvYmxlc2RhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vaG90ZWxzLWRvd250b3duLXBhc28tcm9ibGVzLzgxMDY1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best hotels in downtown Paso Robles,"Best hotels in downtown Paso Robles

79% agree taking good care of themselves helps them connect with others

“Mastercard has long been a brand that connects people to each other and their passions” said Raja Rajamannar chief marketing and communications officer Mastercard. “The pandemic forced people to reconsider what they need from experiences and brands to reimagine how to deliver them. Findings from the research help us understand what is most meaningful to people today and what experiences we can bring them to help create moments and memories that are truly Priceless.”

Fitch first raised Israel's rating from A to A+ in November 16 and has not lowered it since.

""Israel's 'A+' rating balances a diversified high value-added economy which proved resilient to the COVID-19 pandemic strong external finances and solid institutional strength"" Fitch's report read.

""The Israeli economy contracted by 2.6% in 2020 due to the COVID-19-related restrictions imposed from 2Q20 [2020's second quarter] and is forecast to grow by 5.1% and 5.7% in 2021 and 2022 respectively"" the report stated. ""The economy has been more resilient to the pandemic shock than many rating peers reflecting the strong performance of high-tech industries and the early and fast progress in vaccination.""

""Fitch forecasts a budget deficit of around 7% of GDP in 2021 down from 11.6% in 2020 mainly due to the economic rebound the gradual withdrawal of pandemic-related support measures and buoyant revenues from high-tech sectors"" the report read. ""The new government is preparing the first regular budget in three years covering the end of 2021 and 2022 and the final vote on it is scheduled for November. Fitch expects that the government will be able to adopt a full budget by November 2021 consistent with its commitment to stabilize the public debt/GDP ratio in 2022.""

Despite the positive forecasts  the report also mentioned the unstable political situation.

The report noted the government's slim parliamentary majority and its diverse nature as a factor that could hinder policymaking. It also noted that ""Israel has only had technical budgets based on an adjusted 1/12th rule since 2019 due to a run of inconclusive elections. There are also expenditure pressures from social inequality and low employment in particular among ultra-Orthodox and Arab groups.""

The report also addressed Israel's current security situation.

""Israel's credit profile has shown resilience to periodic conflicts. Key risks include instability in Syria and relations with Iran in the context of the latter's nuclear program and apparent Israeli countermeasures. Israel remains concerned by Iran's influence in neighboring Syria and Lebanon and reportedly continues to intervene in Syria with air strikes to counter the presence and activities of Iran or Iranian proxies. Risk remains of another conflict with Hezbollah although there has not been a large-scale clash since 2006 and both sides would suffer losses and Lebanon is in the middle of a domestic crisis"" the report read.

The report took note of the Abraham Accords but said that ""It remains to be seen whether they lessen the geopolitical risks facing Israel. Economic benefits are likely to be limited given the modest size of their economies compared with existing trade partners.""

The report even took note of the internal tensions during the May fighting in Gaza. The report's analysis stated that even though the clashes between Israelis and Palestinians revealed ""serious fault lines"" these only had a limited adverse effect on the economy.

""THE EXACT methodology used by the ratings agencies is not publicly released. But ratings are based on a mix of public information and private information provided by the debt issuers"" according to Eliza Wu Associate Professor in Finance at the University of Sydney. Wu's explanation appears in ""The Conversation"" a not-for-profit media outlet written by academics and researchers.

""When it comes to giving the federal government a rating agencies will use publicly available economic data such as economic growth income per capita and unemployment and inflation rates. This gives the agency an idea of the current state of the economy as well as where it might be in the short and long term"" Wu explained.

She continued ""Agencies will also look at the federal government’s budget. They will consider the gap between revenues and expenditures when the government’s debts are due and the quality of assets that the government could sell off.""

Wu added that ""the agency will look at the wider economic and political context. This includes the quality of financial regulators and levels of corruption and political stability.

With the victory the USA clinched its seventh Gold Cup title and second-straight victory vs. Mexico in a tournament final after also defeating its regional rival in the inaugural Concacaf Nations League Final on June 6 with an almost entirely different squad.

In winning its ninth-straight game the USA registered its fourth-straight shutout and fifth in six Gold Cup matches only conceding a penalty kick goal in the second group stage game vs. Martinique. For his efforts anchoring the defense goalkeeper Matt Turner won the Golden Glove as the tournament’s best goalkeeper. The USA has now won the Concacaf Gold Cup in 1991 2002 2005 2007 2013 2017 and 2021.

The archrivals entered the match having conceded just one goal each with both posting four shutouts through their first five games and neither side budged through 115 minutes in the championship match. Mexico dictated play for much of the first half but could not break through a disciplined and disruptive collective defensive effort from the U.S.

Anchored by goalkeeper Matt Turner and Robinson at center back the USA defense continued to play lights out keeping a clean sheet vs. Mexico. Robinson and Turner are the only two U.S. players to play every minute of all six matches at the Gold Cup. Turner denied Mexico’s Rogelio Funes Mori on three occasions in the first half alone including a fantastic diving save early on.

The USA weathered the early pressure and had its own chance to take the lead 26 minutes in. Sebastian Lletget picked off a defensive clearance and found Paul Arriola inside the box but Mexico goalkeeper Alfredo Talavera came out to cut off Arriola’s angle forcing his shot to hit off the right post.

The second half was more even with both sides creating half-chances during swinging momentum shifts. However again and again the final ball was just off in a hard-fought battle that saw 51 fouls called - including 31 on the USA – and the USMNT also blocking seven shots.

The USA had the last word in extra time scoring the game-winner in the 117th as Robinson headed in Kellyn Acosta’s free kick to clinch the USA’s second trophy of the summer. It was the USA’s third-straight game-winner to come with less than seven minutes to play and marked the latest USMNT goal in USA-Mexico history.

The USA now shifts its focus to the start of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying next month. The USMNT begins its quest for Qatar on Sept. 2 at El Salvador plays Canada on Sept. 5 in Nashville and closes the FIFA window on Sept. 8 at Honduras.



GOAL SCORING RUNDOWN:

USA – MILES ROBINSON (KELLYN ACOSTA) 117th minute: Mexico’s Edson Alvarez was shown a yellow card following a challenge on Nicolas Giaocchini near the left touchline. Acosta took the ensuing free kick sending a dangerous ball into the box for Miles Robinson. The defender beat Alvarez in the air to head in the game-winner from seven yards out for his third career international goal. USA 1 MEX 0

KEY DEFENSIVE PLAYS AND SAVES:

USA - MATT TURNER 11th minute: Mexico had the game’s first clear chance but Matt Turner was up to for the test. Jesus Corona sent in a corner from the right finding Rogelio Funes Mori unmarked just beyond the penalty mark. Funes Mori put a solid header on frame towards the right post but Turner dove quickly to his left and pushed the ball wide with a strong left-handed save.

MEX - ALFREDO TALAVERA 74th minute: Kellyn Acosta whipped a dipping free kick from the left side into the six where Gyasi Zardes could not connect but kept the ball alive. It fell to Paul Arriola who got a shot off at the doorstep but Talavera threw himself forward blocking the shot from close range with his back as he fell to the ground.



ADDITIONAL NOTES:

Gregg Berhalter made four changes to the squad from Thursday’s semifinal against Qatar inserting defenders George Bello and Reggie Cannon midfielder Eryk Williamson and forward Gyasi Zardes.

Tonight’s Starting XI had an average age of 24 years 236 days. It’s the second-youngest USMNT lineup in a tournament final coming in behind the squad that began the Concacaf Nations League win against Mexico on June 6 (24 years 206 days).

Appearing in his third straight Gold Cup Final Paul Arriola captained the USMNT for the second time tonight. He first wore the armband in the 1-0 quarterfinal win against Jamaica on July 25.

Reggie Cannon started his second-straight Gold Cup final while Gyasi Zardes appeared in his third-straight.

Midfielder Kellyn Acosta was the only starter who also started last month’s Concacaf Nations League Final triumph against Mexico on June 6 in Denver. Both Reggie Cannon and Sebastian Lletget came off the bench in that match.

Acosta appeared in his 14th consecutive match for the USA tonight. He’s the only player to appear in each of the USA’s 13 games in 2021.

The USMNT is 26-6-3 in 35 matches under Gregg Berhalter and 11-1-0 in the Gold Cup. Berhalter is now tied with Steve Sampson (26-22-14; 52 games) for fifth in wins among USMNT head coaches.

The NHL Golden Knights were born in Las Vegas in 2017. The NFL Raiders migrated to begin play here in 2020.

With this taste of the big leagues giddy Las Vegas sports fans enjoy schmoozing about the MLB Oakland Athletics checking out Las Vegas while also negotiating with the city of Oakland about a ballpark. And they love chatting about the prospects of an NBA team playing at a world-class arena located between New York-New York and Park MGM on the Strip.

But those sports fans might be missing another professional sports league that likes the Las Vegas market.

Major League Soccer.

Las Vegas will be getting a strong taste of the power of soccer Sunday when Mexico and USA play an international game at the Raiders’ Allegiant Stadium that sold out in 90 minutes. It’s the first sports event at the NFL stadium that is a sellout. UNLV’s football team played there Oct. 31 but only 2000 fans were permitted in the building because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Concacaf Gold Cup championship game will attract super-intense soccer fans who will pack the domed stadium. Most of the fans will be rooting for Mexico. Stadium workers will slide the tray with the grass field into the venue and 60000 fans — COVID surge or not — will pass through the turnstiles. Under a new state indoor mask mandate everyone inside the 65000-seat venue will be required to mask up

MLS will also be there.

The Las Vegas market and MLS have a history of flirting. In July 2019 Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman and MLS Commissioner Don Garber took a selfie together at the Bellagio to announce the “Leagues Cup” soccer event that brought together four MLS teams and four Liga MX clubs in an eight-team tournament that had the bracket winners facing each other at Sam Boyd Stadium in September 2019.

The city of Las Vegas unsuccessfully proposed using public money earmarked for its parks to help subsidize building a MLS stadium with a private developer in downtown Symphony Park in 2015.

More recently the city has talked privately with another development group about rebuilding the Cashman Center area with a new soccer stadium along a section of Las Vegas Boulevard. But those negotiations have not yielded a deal. If the negotiations had been successful the investor in that group would have purchased the minor league Las Vegas Lights soccer team and attempted to move that United Soccer League club to Major League Soccer.

The Lights founder Brett Lashbook used to work for MLS and deserves credit for launching the USL team in 2017. But now the team is not even based in Las Vegas. It’s an affiliate of LAFC and practices in Los Angeles. The Las Vegas connection is that it still plays its games at downtown Cashman Field.

Even Vegas Golden Knights owner Bill Foley confirmed more than a year ago that he was studying the business numbers of an MLS team in this market.

Keep in mind that MLS is allowing private equity financing to help fund teams — a business move that could have ramifications to create a potential MLS franchise in the Las Vegas market.

Plus Allegiant Stadium needs programming.

Southern Nevada contributed a record $750 million in public dollars to help the Raiders build their palatial indoor sports palace with the Raiders saying the stadium would host 46 events a year.

With an MLS team playing 17 home games reaching the 46 events number at Allegiant Stadium is viable.

Raiders owner Mark Davis who also owns the Las Vegas Aces is emotionally invested in living in the Las Vegas market and needs events for the stadium that he controls.

Las Vegas has a sizable Latino population plus an MLS team in this market could tap into the Latino demographic from Texas and the West all the way to Southern California. It’s no secret that the majority of fans at Lights home games are local Latinos in Las Vegas. But an MLS team in Las Vegas playing at luxurious Allegiant Stadium would be a regional draw too. The stadium can tarp off sections of the upper bowl and create MLS venue seating for 35000 or 40000.

Mexico vs USA on Sunday is an international soccer match drawing fans from across North America and could be a model for what Las Vegas could do with an MLS team by combining soccer’s global appeal with the international visitors among the 40 million strong who visit this market every year.

So don’t be surprised if Allegiant Stadium is home to more soccer matches down the road.

Las Vegas has two world-class sports venues — the Raiders stadium and T-Mobile Arena. In major league sports it’s the presence of amenity-rich venues that decides whether teams call a market home or not.

A publicly-funded baseball park in metro Las Vegas for the Athletics? Good luck with that. I don’t see elected political hotel industry or tourism leaders going out on a limb to designate public dollars for an MLB stadium.

But Sunday’s Mexico vs USA soccer game will offer clues to a potential MLS franchise at Allegiant Stadium. Don’t forget MLS teams playing in NFL stadiums in Atlanta and Seattle are working out well. And memo to MLS: I don’t see anyone in city of Las Vegas Clark County and even the state legislature looking to fork over public money for an MLS stadium.

Follow the money? Nice cliche so sure.

I follow the stadiums. And the Las Vegas market has a beauty that’s open for business and that will host a monster soccer event Sunday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIxL2p1bC8zMS9mbHVpZC1maWppLWRlZmVhdC10ZWFtLWdiLWluLW9seW1waWMtcnVnYnktc2V2ZW5zLWJyb256ZS1tZWRhbC1tYXRjaNIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIxL2p1bC8zMS9mbHVpZC1maWppLWRlZmVhdC10ZWFtLWdiLWluLW9seW1waWMtcnVnYnktc2V2ZW5zLWJyb256ZS1tZWRhbC1tYXRjaA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fluid Fiji defeat Team GB in Olympic rugby sevens bronze medal match,"When sportspeople talk about tough journeys they are often waxing metaphorical but Saiasi Fuli was speaking literally as he described Fiji’s arduous route to an Olympic bronze medal in women’s sevens.

“This is the 16th week we haven’t seen our families” said the Fiji head coach said after their 21-12 win over Great Britain three days after the Fiji men’s side had retained the Olympic title by defeating New Zealand. “It was a tough tough journey.”

A four-month slog of training camps and quarantine bubbles in Fiji Australia and Japan had a happy ending – not that the separation is quite over. With the country of about 900000 people reporting more than 1000 Covid-19 cases per day the squads will have to endure another fortnight of hotel quarantine before they can show their medals to friends and loved ones in person.

“It’s hard for us” said Reapi Ulunisau who scored one of three tries against a Britain side that fell 14-0 behind in the first half and never recovered. “This is for them.”

Fuli’s job has encompassed logistics as well as tactics. “Three or four of them it’s their first time to fly out of Fiji. It’s a big challenge for us to manage that and come out here and play well in a very tough pool” he said.

“Some of them they tried to break camp and run home and we had to get them back and keep them at the camp and remind them that the journey will be quite a long one until we reach Tokyo.”

Fiji lost to France then beat Canada and Brazil in the group stage before stunning the 2016 Olympic champions Australia 14-12 in the quarter-finals. They gave New Zealand an almighty scare in the last four going down 22-17 after extra time.

The Black Ferns claimed the gold medal with a 26-12 victory over France who beat Britain in the semi-finals 26-19.

“We identify them from athletics some playing touch rugby in their village and winning the bronze medal in the Tokyo Olympics is massive” Fuli said. “They just learned rugby a year ago. They had no idea about [what rugby is]. So we had to do a massive job and 60-70% of our effort is just concentrating on core skills how to catch how to pass tackle technique. That’s before we implement tactical stuff.”

Scott Forrest the GB head coach could only admire his opponents. “They’ve got a good group of athletes their offloading skills were unbelievable” he said. “That’s probably the standout moment of the whole tournament in terms of how impressive Fiji have been.

“How far they’ve come as a team is just so good to see when you think of how strong their men’s programme has been for years. To see their women’s programme at that level now it’s brilliant.”

Britain’s men also narrowly missed out on a medal in Tokyo losing 17-12 to Argentina. Forrest’s squad huddled after their loss here reflecting on their disappointment but also their achievement. Money problems before the competition had cast doubt over whether Britain would field teams but funds were secured last December through a partnership with the National Lottery.

“We as a programme have only been together for five months and six months ago we had absolutely nothing so to come fourth not a lot of people expected that” said the Welsh winger Jasmine Joyce. She is convinced that if a deal had been struck sooner allowing for more preparation time the fast-improving side would have won a medal.

With the future beyond this year uncertain Forrest hopes that this near-miss of a medal will persuade the Scottish Welsh and English governing bodies to keep GB sevens alive.

“Three unions trying to come together it’s never easy for legitimate reasons. There’s no grudge from us. Ultimately these players just want to play sevens full time” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vb2x5bXBpY3MuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvdG9reW8tMjAyMC1vbHltcGljcy1pbmRpYS13b21lbi1ob2NrZXktdGVhbS12cy1hdXN0cmFsaWEtcXVhcnRlci1maW5hbC1yZXN1bHTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India women beat Australia to enter Tokyo Olympics hockey semi-finals,"It was the Indian women’s third straight win at Tokyo 2020 having opened their campaign with three straight losses. India had to win their final two group stage matches to make it to the quarters.

Only participating in its third Olympics the Indian women’s hockey team made it to the semi-finals of the Summer Games for the first time. India had finished 12th and last in Rio 2016 and only a round-robin stage was played at Moscow 1980.

India the fourth-placed team in Pool A overcame the Pool B toppers Australia through Gurjit Kaur ’s drag-flick in the 22nd minute and held on to their lead for the remainder of the match.

On Monday India did not get outpaced by the famed speed of the Australians and generated several quick counters to keep the opposing defence busy. Even as late as the fourth quarter the Indians’ fitness levels did not let them down and their concentration in defence did not dip.

The Indian defence led by Deep Grace Ekka and goalkeeper Savita Punia held firm throughout the match soaking up all the pressure the Australians exerted and keeping a clean slate across an incredible nine penalty corners.

India had conceded 14 goals to Australia’s one and scored seven compared to the Australians’ 13 in the group stages. And Australia almost scored right in the second minute of the match but Ambrosia Malone’s shot slammed into the post.

That was the closest Australia would get to a goal in the first quarter as the Indian women’s hockey team ensured plenty of action happened in the opposite half. Holding on to a slender majority of the possession India didn’t concede a penalty corner until the fifth minute of the second quarter. And even then they were able to repeatedly deny Australia.

India had nearly taken the lead in the ninth minute when captain Rani Rampal’s deflection off a cross hit the inner part of the Australian left post.

Australia kept threatening now and then a Brooke Peris strike going just wide of the right Indian post.

But it was India who would go on the scoreboard first as Gurjit Kaur’s drag-flick found its mark in the 22nd minute off the Indians’ very first penalty corner. It was Gurjit’s first goal of the tournament following a struggle to fire the drag-flicks in the group stage.

Australia had earned more penalty corners had more circle penetrations and had taken more shots on goal but India held on to their advantage in the first half.

In the third quarter the Indian defence withstood the charge of the Australians as they pressed harder making regular inroads into the Indian circle.

Having absorbed that pressure India regained some momentum late into the third quarter. Navneet Kaur dribbled her way into the circle for a wide attempt and Rani Rampal’s tap off a cross looped to the right of the Australian goal. India’s lead was still intact going into the final quarter.

With just over eight minutes to go in the match Australia pushed for two more penalty corners and two more still with a couple of minutes left. But the Indians were just not going to relent and had more than earned their historic semi-final spot at Tokyo 2020 after a 6-1 loss to the Australians in Rio 2016."
MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9iaWctc2hvZXMtdG8tZmlsbC1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stdGFsa3Mtd2VhcmluZy1kYXZpZC1kZWNhc3Ryb3Mtbm8tNjYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Big Shoes To Fill:' Mason McCormick Talks Wearing David DeCastro's No. 66,"Though he’s been a Steeler for barely two weeks Mason McCormick knows the reputation that comes along with his new jersey number. Wearing No. 66 David DeCastro’s old number McCormick told reporters he’s fully aware of the legacy he’s replacing. At least in number.

“I have heard a little bit about it” he told reporters via Steelers.com when asked about his jersey digits. “I heard I got some big shoes to fill. And that’s super exciting.”

McCormick clearly isn’t backing away from the expectations. More similar to Troy Fautanu DeCastro was the team’s first-round pick in 2012 going lower in the draft than projections and the last West Coast college prospect the team had taken in the first round prior to Fautanu. After battling injury as a rookie DeCastro turned into one of the NFL’s best guards a six-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro before ankle problems shortened his career.

A punishing run blocker with tons of experience McCormick didn’t get his phone call until early on Day 3 the team’s fourth round pick. While McCormick will keep his goals high expectations out of the gate are lower than they were for DeCastro. Pittsburgh’s starting guards of James Daniels and Isaac Seumalo are set in stone entering the spring meaning McCormick is set to begin the year as a backup.

But o-line depth is valuable and can be quickly tested. Pittsburgh has been incredibly fortunate to avoid serious or multiple offensive line injuries the past two seasons but sheer law of averages suggests that luck will run out. That could push McCormick into a role sooner than expected.

“I’m ready to do whatever it takes to get on the field” he said. “I’ll play either guard spot center whatever it takes. I just want to help this organization in any way I can.”

That could include reps at center. McCormick noted he was the backup center in college and had South Dakota State’s starter gotten hurt he would’ve shifted over. Pittsburgh worked him out as such shortly before the draft and though Zach Frazier’s selection makes him a clear favorite to start the Steelers like to make their backups as versatile as possible. Friday McCormick played right guard and the Steelers will likely have him work at guard this spring before considering center come training camp.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9sb25kb24vc29tZWJvZHktd2lsbC1kaWUtaWYtZm9ybWVyLW1jY29ybWljay1zLWZhY3RvcnktaXNuLXQtdG9ybi1kb3duLW5laWdoYm91cnMtc2F5LTEuNzE5OTI4OdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS43MTk5Mjg5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Somebody will die' if former McCormick's factory isn't torn down neighbours say,"The owners of the former McCormick's candy factory on Dundas Street have been ordered by city bylaw officials to restore security fencing around the crumbling building but business owners near the property say much more needs to be done to deal with what they call a dangerous eyesore.

""The fence usually lasts 48 hours"" said Gord Inglis who operates Inglis Cycle located on McCormick Boulevard behind the property. ""It's very run down neglected not looked after and ignored and it's turned into a playground for children and an area where homeless people [go] in and out.""

A work order was posted on three parts of the fence surrounding some of the property stating that a property inspection done May 8 found contraventions of a city bylaw that requires owners to ensure that vacant buildings are secured against unauthorized entry and to protect the building from the risk of ""fire accident or other danger.""

When a CBC News reporter visited the site on Thursday there were at least eight places where the fence had been torn down partially or completely allowing anyone to walk onto the property.

Windows doors and duct openings were recently covered with plywood Inglis said but that's also usually torn down within days.

Two young teens had to be rescued from the roof of the building on Sunday night London Fire said. There was a fire in the building and the teens who were exploring inside made their way to the roof while they waited for help said Platoon Chief Kirk Loveland. An aerial ladder was used to communicate with the youth and tell them to stay put until firefighters came to the roof to escort them out of the building he said. The teens weren't hurt and were taken away by police.

A similar incident happened on Thursday afternoon. A teen was stuck in the building and police requested the aerial truck again so they could communicate with the young person and escort them out of the building.

Seeing young people in the building is a frequent occurrence Inglis said. ""I feel the city is playing with the devil. Every time an emergency service is called to the building it seems to be more severe. If you don't do something with this building somebody is going to get hurt.""

There are concerns over this former east London factory as redevelopment plans have stalled Duration 0:56 Once a bustling confectionary factory the former McCormick building is now an eyesore that is dangerous for people going in to strip out any metal that can be sold for cash and youth looking for an urban exploring thrill.

'We're picking up garbage everyday'

The recent rescue was just one of the latest incidents where emergency crews were called to the building said Lou Fatibene who owns neighbouring Dundas Automotive.

""I'm surprised nobody's been killed over there yet"" Fatibene said. ""We've had cars broken into the whole area has been vandalized. We're picking up garbage every day.""

Somebody's going to die"" he said. ""How much did it cost us taxpayers to have that aerial truck out there to save the kids?""

Tena Smith who works at Tim's Tires across the street from the old factory says young people are using it as an urban exploration site. Some throw bricks and other items from the roof damaging property and cars below.

""Every Monday when we come in after the weekend it's like the teenagers have had a heyday in there and they've knocked out more windows"" she said. ""We used to park our cars over there to make room for our customers but they throw stuff off the roof. A brick landed on my car and dented my roof so we don't park over there anymore.""

The fence that's supposed to keep people out of the crumbling factory is not very effective. (Kate Dubinski/CBC)

The owners of the property Sierra Construction based in Woodstock did not reply to emails and phone calls asking for comment. They have until May 12 to comply with the city's work order.

The company bought the property for $1. In 2021 McCormick Villages Inc. owned and run by Sierra Construction submitted a plan for a subdivision for the factory site comprising of five hectares. In October 2022 city council approved the development which included repurposing the former factory into a mixed-use mid-rise building as well as townhouses a long-term care facility and a seniors apartment building on the property.

But Sierra Construction wasn't happy with council's decision to limit the apartment building height to five-storeys and to make a multi-use path on the property publicly-accessible among other issues. The Ontario Land Tribunal will consider that appeal in June.

It's been frustrating watching the building and property fall further and further into disrepair said Ward 4 Coun. Susan Stevenson. ""It's becoming a huge safety concern and a lot of people are worried that there will be a tragedy there let alone the disturbance to the neighbourhood that's happening as well"" she said.

But what’s potentially revolutionary about Everytable isn’t the prepackaged salads and wraps. It’s how the company is working to help its employees accumulate wealth. Everytable aims to do that by reimagining one of the most common paths to business ownership: franchising.

There are about 750000 franchise establishments in the U.S. today. Virtually all of the entrepreneurs who opened those franchises had to prove good credit and put down a lot of cash. For example opening a McDonald’s franchise requires an initial investment of at least $500000 in non-borrowed capital. And that’s just to get started.

Becoming a franchisee is often out of reach for Americans born into low-income communities without the head-start of generational wealth. Everytable wants to remove those hurdles.

The company recently started a program that trains and provides capital to employees from marginalized communities who want to work toward owning their own Everytable franchise. It’s a system that fuses both capitalistic and social principles said CEO Sam Polk.

“Everytable is a business where there is no tradeoff between what’s good for our business and what’s good for our mission” Polk told Freethink. “It’s all intertwined and synchronistic.”

This socially focused franchise model could serve as a blueprint for how other companies can grow and profit while giving workers the opportunity to gain wealth — not just a wage.

How entrepreneurs benefit from franchising

Here’s the basic idea: A business builds a successful brand and wants to expand. Instead of opening more stores on its own the business partners with entrepreneurs called franchisees. Franchisees pay licensing fees — and sometimes buy stores and property — to sell products or services using the brand’s name. The franchisee owns the store. But franchisees must operate according to standards set by the franchisor to whom they also pay royalties.

Franchising has helped businesses grow and prosper at minimal risk for more than a century.

It’s a relatively safe way for entrepreneurs to own and operate a business: Unlike starting a company from the ground up franchisees get a headstart by piggybacking on the success of established brands. But the perks of owning a franchise have long been limited to people with access to capital.

From homelessness to business ownership

After her second divorce Dorcia White-Brake became a single mother with three kids and no home. She worked multiple jobs and went to school on nights and weekends.

“I always knew that I had to work really hard to get a better life for my kids” she said.

Blake eventually landed a job at an Everytable store in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. She worked her way up to store manager and later as a brand ambassador. Now she’s set to become the company’s first franchisee.

It marks the launch of the company’s Social Equity Franchise program which aims to help Everytable employees work toward owning their own store by providing them free training and loans with a 2-percent interest rate to cover the cost of buying the store. To enter the program Everytable employees must work as a store manager for at least six months. But the program is free and becoming a franchisee requires no upfront capital.

“The average cost of an Everytable location is $250000” Bryce Fluellen executive director of Everytable’s franchise program told Black Enterprise. “However the loan repayment doesn’t begin until the store starts to make a profit. Additionally because most entrepreneurs of color often don’t have a cushion to fall back on Everytable franchisees are guaranteed an annual salary of $40000 in their first three years in business.”

The loans for Everytable’s franchise program come from foundations like the W.K. Kellogg Foundation the Annenberg Foundation the California Wellness Foundation (Cal Wellness). Foundations like these are required to give away 5 percent of their endowment to charitable causes every year. As for the other 95 percent?

“For the most part you know it’s invested in Wall Street and the market” Cal Wellness CEO Judy Belk told Freethink. “Cal Wellness and many other foundations are saying ‘I think we can do a little better with that [money]. Why not use that capital to invest in the communities that we’re supposed to serve?’”

Despite the low interest rates these foundations are still expecting a return on their investment.

The key difference is that this type of investment aims to yield not only capital returns but also social returns.

Bringing fresh meals to food deserts

Everytable’s franchising model is just one aspect of its socially focused approach to capitalism. The company also varies its meal prices based on neighborhood: A wrap that sells for $5 in a lower-income neighborhood might go for $9 in a more affluent community. One reason Everytable is able to sell healthy food at competitive prices is because it prepares and packages all of its meals at a central kitchen eliminating the costs of building kitchens in its stores.

The goal is to make nutritious meals price-competitive with traditional fast food especially in low-income communities where healthy food is often hard to find. The 40 million Americans who live in so-called food deserts are more likely to live below the poverty line and suffer from conditions like diabetes obesity and cardiovascular disease.

Everytable currently operates a handful of stores in the Los Angeles area but over the long term it hopes to franchise thousands of stores across the nation. If successful the company’s socially focused spin on franchising could create new avenues for disadvantaged Americans to accumulate generational wealth — not only within fast food but any franchisable industry: retail automobile repair shipping etc.

For now Everytable is focused on guiding more workers through the journey from employee to manager to owner.

“I’ve worked very hard to get to this point in my life” Blake told Freethink. “I believe poor people just need some extra help. I never ask for handouts. I don’t want free this or free that. I just want to be able to have the same opportunities given to me and my children.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL3RyYXZlbC8zMzkwNTA1L21jZG9uYWxkcy1iYW5uZWQtZXVyb3BlLWNvdW50cmllcy_SAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvMzM5MDUwNS9tY2RvbmFsZHMtYmFubmVkLWV1cm9wZS1jb3VudHJpZXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The countries which have BANNED McDonald’s restaurants – including four in Europe...,"MAKING A HASH OF IT The countries which have BANNED McDonald’s restaurants – including four in Europe

NEXT time you are on holiday you are likely to run across a McDonald's being one of the largest fast food chains in the world.

There are more than 34000 restaurants in 118 countries - although fans of the burger joint maybe surprised to find that nearly 100 countries are yet to have a McDonald's in the country.

2 There are still many countries which have no McDonald's stores Credit: Reuters

Many destinations have never had a McDonald's or were forced to close them due to economic difficulties meaning the fast food was not attainable or affordable for the majority of the population.

Jamaica had eight McDonald's from 1995 to 2005 but all closed down while just one opened in Barbados in 1996 but closed within a year after struggling to make a profit.

A McDonald's in Bermuda managed to avoid the local law banning foreign food chains and opened for a decade from 1985 to 1995 at the US Naval Air Base although closed when the base did.

Other reasons include a ban on foreign food chains which is why there is yet to be a McDonald's in North Korea while just four countries in Africa have McDonald's - Morocco Egypt South Africa and Mauritius.

However here are the destinations in Europe where you will have to skip a Big Mac next time you visit.

Iceland

Iceland once had three McDonald's restaurants dating back to 1993.

However high import costs following the 2008 financial crash led to its demise with it becoming the most expensive Big Mac in the world after rising 20 per cent in price (where a kilo of onions was said to cost the same for a ""good bottle of whiskey"").

The McDonald's stores have since been converted to Icelandic burger chain Metro with the last store closing in 2009 - although this led to more than 10000 McBurgers being sold in a day following the announcement.

Montenegro

In 2003 a McDonald's opened in Montenegro although was a mobile store as opposed to a building.

While it was popular it was never able to become a permanent fixture and only lasted a few months as the government and local businesses prevented it from staying.

A permanent fixture is yet to open in the country.

Macedonia

Macedonia was once home to several McDonald's chains primarily in the capital city of Skopje.

However a problem with the licensing meant all of the chains had to close down in 2013.

The fast-food chain could soon return however with rumours that a McDonald's will be opening this year.

Vatican City

Perhaps not surprisingly The Vatican has never had a McDonald's.

It is the only country in Europe to have never had one - although there is one just 100m outside with views of the building.

I talked to Burks before she finished just outside of qualifying for the Olympic final on Sunday in Tokyo and instantly began to rethink my idea of ""hard work"" as the Hartselle Alabama native recalled her high school routine: Driving her grandmother to work at the local nursing home at 4:30 a.m. making the 30-minute trek back to get her younger sisters ready for school going to school herself attending track practice then working at McDonald's from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.

Burks details a normal day in her 17-year-old life without a single hint of resentment or acknowledgement that most kids her age had far less responsibility. ""I didn't look at it as 'Oh my gosh this is challenging.' I looked at it as my baby sisters are looking up to me I want to pave the way for them.""

""I knew that we needed that money from McDonald's"" Burks explains of receiving her $113 check every two weeks which she put toward car insurance. ""I knew that my family needed me. I had a purpose.""

Quanesha Burks

Ironically enough it was Burks' unparalleled work ethic that almost kept her from accomplishing her ultimate dream of becoming an Olympic athlete.

When college coaches came calling to recruit Burks -- who would go on to become one of the most-decorated student-athletes in Alabama track and field history -- she gave them the run around.

""I can't talk to you right now. I'm doing drive-thru"" she remembers saying to multiple coaches on several occasions. ""Coaches would come in to the McDonald's lobby and wait for me on my break to recruit me.""

Eventually Alabama coach Miguel Pate enlisted the help of Burks' high school coach Kenny Lopez to explain what a full scholarship would mean for her and that her days of working at McDonald's could be put behind her.

Even so the 11-time AHSAA state champion who set seven school records continued working at the fast food chain after committing to Alabama and through high school graduation. In the fall after football games her classmates would pull up to the drive-thru and see one of the most highly-touted athletes in the state there working instead of socializing on a Friday night.

But Burks didn't mind. She was too focused on fulfilling her purpose to be concerned with the high school microcosm. ""Even before Alabama I told everyone I'm going to get a full scholarship. I'm going to be the first one in my family to go to college. I'm going to have my pick of any school. ... So many people laughed 'OK Quanesha you work at McDonald's' but I just never stopped because I knew my purpose was bigger.""

I've been waiting for the ""moment"" that it will hit me that I'm an Olympian. It just hit me at 5:30am.. on my balcony in Japan that in less than 24hrs I will be competing in the Olympics! My dreams are really my reality! GOD IS GOOD🥺 — Quanesha Burks OLY (@strongbelieverQ) July 30 2021"

Data governance is rapidly becoming the glue that holds businesses together. Get this right and your business can unlock a host of opportunities.

We are living through an era of big data. In the space of a few years digital technology has triggered an explosion in the amount of data businesses are processing. That data has enormous value and is being used to power insights improve services and to underpin a wide range of business innovations but only if companies can capture it sort it and use it.

Here are several case studies of companies working with providers on data governance solutions:

Medical: McKesson

In the modern world of medicine things are moving quickly. Consumers are more demanding and expect prescriptions and services to be delivered quickly and with the highest possible quality of service.

“The consumer expectations are changing” says Andy Zitney CTO McKesson. “The expectation of the customer is real-time always available in your hands. We need to change the architecture to meet those consumer expectations. The current environment does not allow that.”

That led them toward hybrid cloud architecture and Google Cloud. The first thing they had to focus on was protecting customer data. The cloud eliminates much of their overhead and allows them to deploy more of their resources to above-the-line processes that deliver value to their clients.

The cloud gives them all their data and a complete cycle from pharmaceutical companies and medial equipment manufacturers to the patient. That data can now be accessed and put to use to inform decisions develop services and help add more value to customers. It results in a better quality of health care which in turn leads to healthier patients.

Risk management: Swiss Re

As a company that provides risk management solutions to corporations data management is crucial at Swiss Re. However their legacy data management solution was inefficient and made it more difficult to understand the relationships between the customers and brokers. Data was opaque making it challenging to identify new opportunities.

They wanted to analyze their data in one intuitive system that could be integrated into their native applications.

They created a new XEM system using Azure Azure Databricks and Azure machine learning (ML) to create an end-to-end system that could aggregate information provide relationship insights and deliver contact-level details to relevant users.

The result has been “transformational in addressing the inverse relationship we had with ‘data in’ versus ‘value out’ for our users” says Paul Fitzgerald global head of customer and distribution steering Swiss Re.

Banking: NCBA

East African financial services organization NCBA has embraced digital technology to serve its 32 million global customers. However its sales process was comparatively antiquated. Data was segmented and patchy making it difficult to deliver a first-class customer service.

“We wanted to engage with customers in a personalized way that would be relevant to them to ensure that they remained with the bank for the long-term” says Joseph Githinji customer value management strategist for the consumer digital business NCBA.

“Oracle emerged as a leader in providing personalized marketing and customer experience that could help us achieve the customer longevity we were looking for and get a greater return on our marketing investment” Githinji says.

To meet this challenge they adopted multiple customer experience platforms including Oracle Responsys Campaign Management Oracle Infinity Behavioral Intelligence and Oracle Data Management Platform.

These applications have enabled the bank to track the customer journey from start to finish gain insights into customer behavior and drive improvements for individual clients. Having gained control of its data it now delivers a high level of personalized service for all its customers.

Agriculture: Kite

As a leading provider of support solutions to the agriculture industry Kite wanted to develop new solutions to improve the value they could offer farmers and businesses using their services. To do so they turned to SAP to create digital data management solutions that could help farmers track key data and maximize their profits.

The result is an IT platform that collects analyzes and shares data. It brings everything together in a clear graphical presentation. With just a few clicks farmers can see all the key data relating to every square feet of their land.

Farmers can see how their land is being used and maximize profits from every part of their operations. Having all this data filtered and presented in a manageable way provides insights that can inform decision making and optimize the performance of their operations.

“With the help of SAP we have data and analysis to help make customers’ farming systems more profitable and sustainable’ says Leventa Szabo CEO Kite.

Finance: Financial Industry Regulatory Authority

The financial industry is harnessing digital technology to deliver transformative services and financial regulators are doing the same to keep pace. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) turned to AWS to help it manage billions of transactions and offer next-generation oversight for the next era in the financial industry.

They receive billions of records every day. By migrating to the cloud they were able to automate this process enabling analysts to query vast quantities of data sets and improve their ability to monitor what’s happening in the markets.

In addition they were also looking for a more cost-effective solution that could react to changing data volumes. Data volumes can expand and contract dramatically during the day. They wanted a system that could move to match real-time demand ensuring they always had as much capacity as they needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award recognizes employers who go above and beyond in their support of employees who are National Guard or Reserve service members.

Of the 15 awards handed out to both businesses and municipalities Minnesota had two companies selected for going far beyond the requirements of the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act: Marcus Construction of Willmar and Medtronic of Minneapolis.

“It is a distinct honor for two Minnesota employers to receive this award” said Gov. Tim Walz. “I’m grateful to Marcus Construction and Medtronic for ensuring that when their employees who serve in the National Guard are called to duty they are supported and appreciated at home.”

Award recipients include small and large employers in both the private and public sectors. They are nominated by a National Guard or Reserve component employee who works within their organization.

“Knowing my dad and my grandpa (Marcus has) always been an employee-first family-style culture” said Taylor Marcus business development manager for Marcus Construction. “So I think we recognize the sacrifices that (service members) ... make. I think for us it's just 'how do we help? How do we pitch in?'”

Dan O’Meara works for Marcus Construction as a safety compliance officer and company pilot. For at least one weekend a month and two weeks a year he is better known as Lt. Col. O’Meara with the Minnesota National Guard’s 34th Infantry Division currently assigned to Division Headquarters.

O’Meara said that after being in the National Guard for 29 years “it's all the little things” that Marcus Construction does to make the company stand out as an employer.

Many of the employers who were honored offer enhanced pay and benefits packages; flexible scheduling and generous leave policies; and pre-and post-deployment support.

“Being an officer and an aviator the whole ‘one weekend a month two weeks in the summertime’ thing that went out the window a long time ago” O’Meara said. “I get phone calls all throughout the week or I'll have meetings during the week. You know there's always something going on and (Ross Marcus CEO of Marcus Construction) is very accommodating to what I need to do in order to keep both careers going.”

With the award ceremony at the national level being canceled this year due to COVID-19 concerns awards will be presented at the state level. Marcus Construction is scheduled to receive its award Aug. 18 in Willmar.

The 2021 Freedom Award recipients will be recognized by Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve state chairs.

“I am proud to salute the outstanding employers who have earned the distinction of being named Freedom Award recipients as we mark the 25th year of this highly coveted recognition” said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in the news release announcing the awards. “The men and women of the National Guard and Reserve make significant contributions to our communities and our national security through their civilian and military careers. We owe a debt of gratitude to these exemplary employers who by valuing and supporting their employees’ military service enhance the strength readiness and diversity of our National Guard and Reserve forces.”

Selected companies have implemented robust training to equip human resources professionals and managers to support their organization’s military serving employees; stayed connected to deployed employees by sending care packages; and have taken care of their employees’ families during deployments by assisting with household repairs including them in company functions or providing financial assistance.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

Yuval Boger: Hello Thomas and thank you for joining me today.

Thomas Ehmer: Hi Yuval pleasure.

Yuval: So who are you and what do you do?

Thomas: That’s a good question Yuval and because I know the podcast I prepared a bit. I’m a bit of a superposition and it depends really on whom you ask. So for my band I’m the keyboard player for my kids I am the dad. But I think for this podcast I’ll tell you what I’m doing in my business. I’m one of the co-founders in the Merck group Merck KGaA. We are not Merck & Co. so there are two different independent companies. We have to tell this every time. So if you listen from the US we operate under EMD Serono. Rest of world we are Merck KGaA. And some eight years ago I was looking for novel technologies. I’m still looking for novel technologies and we did found a quantum task force with the objective to check if it makes sense that our company takes care of quantum technologies. It does. Yeah and then I’m a physicist by training. I look mainly at all applications that are novel to our company and should make sense. I’m a bit of a troublemaker because I bring technologies in-house that we don’t know yet how to use or we want to use but don’t have budget and so on. So that’s what I do for a living. Eight years

Yuval: wow.

Thomas: Yes.

Yuval: Really one of the pioneers. So let’s go back eight months. What have you learned in the last eight months about quantum and quantum readiness that maybe you didn’t know before that?

Thomas: Eight months is February. What did I learn in the last eight months? So I think what is confirming is that we have a very good emerging quantum computing community. I very much like all these conferences and it’s always good to see that we independent on whom you ask it seems that we are a community who wants to work together. Yeah and I think this is as some might say we approach quantum winter. We don’t know. But I think it’s good to see that there are still some brave people who carry the flag and work together. I see also that a lot of novel quantum computing architectures make it close to the market or are close to the market. So it’s really good to see. And I mean personally I was keen to see the recent announcement from Quantinuum for example where they have for example logical qubits apparently entangled. Eight years ago we didn’t even know how to build a single qubit. Now we have logical qubits at least in some claim that they have and I trust them. So this is interesting to see. And also the quantum communication part people are really getting keen on all these quantum key distribution communication protocols and so on. So that’s yeah. There’s not a single thing. I think it’s just really exploding. That’s good to see how far we move.

Yuval: In your company what do you see as the key application for quantum? Is it drug discovery or is it more things like optimization supply chain and so on?

Thomas: It depends on whom you ask. So we are super interested in quantum applications because once they come if ever they come they might be transformative. There’s so much hope and hype on drug discovery. Personally I’m not really a big fan or believer that computational drug discovery is outperforming wet drug discovery. So that’s my personal take. I think it’s a partnership and everybody’s betting on artificial intelligence. So drug discovery is a very complex thing and computational methods. Quantum computing is an additional computational method. So I think it’s a long way. There’s a very good paper out from the colleagues from Boehringer who did investigate if quantum computing ever will work. So it looks like we need new algorithms. So that’s my take. And the other problems logistics problems this is how it started for me actually to dive into quantum computing. So some years back the D-Wave were the first ones on the market with their traveling salesperson optimization. I still think it’s a miracle that we have these annealing things. And apparently so these ultra wicked complex problems might benefit also from quantum computing. I’m a bit undecided. I mean we see the three classes simulation optimization and machine learning. And yeah for our company none of them currently is relevant from an application perspective. But if they will come to maturity likely the material sciences is also of important.

Yuval: It’s very popular these days to talk about chat GPT moment a moment where AI moved from science fiction to we got to do it now. What do you think the quantum chat GPT or the quantum GPT moment is going to look like?

Thomas: The quantum that I have no clue. So I think the GPT moment was when everybody and their sister and brother were exposed to a functionality they could never imagine which is mimicking human intelligence. Actually it does not but it’s mimicking and it’s very convincing. So I think we will see how this develops compared to quantum. I have actually no clue. I could imagine that eventually something like this communication protocols might have an impact if everybody could just plug in whatever app to have a quantum secured point to point communication without any agency being able to listen in without me knowing they listen in. So this might be eventually one of these which has mass impact because I think quantum computing per se is rather an expert-ish niche co-processor thing. So I’m not sure how to. It’s a good question. I have to ask my guys what they think.

Yuval: You mentioned community earlier. And I know you’re part of a community of several I think German companies that work together to develop quantum. Could you tell me a little bit about that? And also related to that are you worried about other pharma companies about collaborating with other pharma companies to do quantum or right now a rising tide lifts all boats?

Thomas: Yes. So the yes is to the last question. So the company you mentioned at the beginning so it’s an association called QUTAC stands for German Quantum Technology Application Consortium. We have a very cool homepage. And it’s an association of the 13 big German companies. I don’t want to mention them all because otherwise the podcast would be over. What we are doing we organize ourselves in several streams and with the focus to identify quantum technology use cases that we could work on either as developers or co-developers or application user guidance for the developers. Independent from our own let’s say business. For example we work together with automotive or pharma and reinsurers logistics companies on let’s say logistics problems. Everybody has their problems and we test out different approaches on knapsack etc. So that’s one thing. And the other thing is we share the burden to evaluate vendors potential service providers. And by being attractive enough if as a partner you manage to convince QUTAC you not only have one customer but you would have 13 customers. So that’s the main point. And also I think it’s very helpful. All of us have relatively small quantum teams. So these are big worldwide corporations. I mean BMW SAP Bühringer etc. And all have relatively small quantum teams. And it’s very comfortable for us as a team to not be alone so that we have a bit of a peers and we can share interests. Regarding the pharma guys I mean it started I think at the Q2B several years back. There was an initiative that we all say everybody claims we can speed up drug discovery or drug development or we can bring better drugs to the world by quantum computing. Who knows how this works? Nobody did. So it’s also very open very collaborative. And I think it’s rather a friend-ish approach bosonic approach that we work together instead of competition because currently it’s really pre-competitive. There’s also the Pistoia Alliance who is setting up one pharma consortium thing. There are several pharma consortiums emerging. So that’s quite open. And the third part I forgot. Now I think you answered everything here.

Yuval: When you think about QUTAC what is the issue that you’re facing right now? What is the key thing that you’re looking for a solution?

Thomas: So we have different streams. So one stream we started focusing on the logistics and the material sciences streams. It looks like currently we have reshuffled a bit. So one part of us is looking at generative components. So we’re working on quantum generative network so QGANs to check in how far they perform better than classical GANs. We have a paper out. You can make sense yourself if it’s worthwhile or not. I mean it’s early days but this is where we jointly work on because everybody is interested of course in these generative networks. The other thing is in the logistics part we work on knapsack problems to understand can quantum do better knapsack things. And there’s another stream which is composed of different people. They work mainly on material science topics so quantum chemistry using quantum computers. I don’t have too much insight in that but it’s always shared problems that we say how can you better do ground energy finding whatever. What is quantum Monte Carlo? Where does it make sense? Where does it not make sense? And the third stream I mentioned is really looking at infrastructure from different perspectives. So we are also writing there some papers with the target audience of being other quantum computing users to guide them if it makes sense to go on neutral atoms. I mean you know neutral atoms or we’re just working on an ion trap paper. And the other part is also political communication. And in principle also we wanted to do a bit of education so help grow talent for our companies. But that’s not so far progressed as we would have wanted just due to the lack of resource we have.

Yuval: You mentioned the comparison between computational chemistry or using quantum computing for computational chemistry versus wet labs. In a company like Merck how much communication is there between the people who are actually working on developing drugs and people like yourself who are dealing with future technologies?

Thomas: That’s a good question. So I think there is enough communication. There is even a common ground. There are just not enough solutions. I mean we have recently discussed the potential to do I don’t know what was this the idea to use quantum computer annealing approaches to find binding pockets in complex targets. And when I talk to our researchers who do the wet stuff or other computational stuff they said it sounds interesting. On the other hand we already have 15 methods or 20 methods and I have 15 people so I just don’t have capacity to digest this. So I think there is an appetite that it’s really tough to understand this added value given that you have new ways of thinking. So quantum algorithm is using quantum features nobody really understands what these are even the quantum guys don’t. And then I mean how to translate your existing problems in a way that you can make additional value for using quantum components or quantum core processor. That’s not easy. And unfortunately most have objectives that are not so much forward looking and have time to think what will be happening in 10 5 years because in the end you need to deliver the next target. And it’s just a bit of operational pressure. I mean it’s a bit of a dance and mainly of interest so people listening with interest but it’s just currently it’s more playful with the intent to detect good things but it’s not a threat currently if we would not look at it I think.

Yuval: Do you see a need for a company like Merck to purchase a quantum computer anytime soon in the next few years or everything is on the cloud as far as you’re concerned?

Thomas: I mean there are different answers to that. I think it depends on what you want to achieve so if we want to contribute as a material supplier for example because we have the very best isotopes and the very best gas to do nitrogen vacancy whatever stuff well so do we need a quantum computer for that? Maybe not. If we want to learn to program it there are so many solutions out in the cloud. I doubt that we need one in-house. And then there’s on the other hand the approach that the American clinics currently are doing. So every clinic who thinks they have interest in novel technologies they put a quantum computer on site which is then I think rather a symbol because if every day you pass a quantum computer eventually it triggers your way of thinking what could I do with it? So I think for this sake more as a symbol it could make sense. And I mean it looks good. The machines depending on which machines you use but I think definitely from a productive use point it doesn’t make sense this moment in time. I would not even know whom to hire to maintain and operate these things because they are very fragile and you need to calibrate all these. And then the question is also which technology do you want to have? So you would need to buy one of each flavors modalities how they’re called. I would not know what to choose. So therefore I think it’s also not from a financial investment. Maybe it’s not a good value investment because the next generation makes the other one obsolete. So it’s not that it’s getting more and more from a collector’s viewpoint that you can collect. I have the very first I don’t know a QuEra machine and then I put it somewhere. I have the very first IBM machine with 127 qubits. I think it doesn’t make sense.

Yuval: Germany is one of the countries that’s investing heavily in quantum on the national level. And do you feel some of the results of this investment or do you think it’s going to be years out?

Thomas: So personally I feel some of it because I’m also profiting from a federal funded project which I’m very grateful for because otherwise we would not do this project because it’s just too risky. And because we have this funding I can spend part of my time to think on things I would not think for. And the interesting part is that I think we heard this on several talks also on conferences that because you think on quantum algorithms you detect sometimes solutions that are completely independent from quantum that help your business nevertheless. So that’s one aspect. Do I see other… I mean Germany spends a lot of money. The UK does France does. Others do too. I can’t really say that I have seen quick returns but I see that there is a lot of attention and even a bit of understanding in the decision makers. It’s moving into a direction which is at least they want to understand what it is and it’s quite complex but I think it’s more technology friendly these days than it was in the past. Unfortunately we have the situation in the world. So I think everywhere funds are cut for fundamental research. But I mean that’s I think independent from the aim that we want to spend much money on that. I mean one thing on the other hand is what I find a bit disappointing is that we have a bit of this fragmentation in Germany. We have all the land and everybody wants to do their own valley. So we have a quantum valley in Munich we have a Saxony valley. So in Germany everybody is a bit of building their own center and everybody is in the center of their world. I’m not sure how this is in other countries. I think France is by definition different that everything goes to Paris and then you have to see what’s coming out there. But the original question is yes I think it makes sense. You slowly see. I think we’re a bit far behind. Others started earlier and have more mature startup scenes but we’re catching up.

Yuval: You spoke earlier about the quantum winter and also mentioned that you’ve been doing this for eight years. Do you think there is a risk that a company like Merck says you know what we’ve been at this for a while. Let’s shelve it and come back in three years and maybe things will be different.

Thomas: I think there is in principle the risk because we are not doing this as a profession. Everybody’s doing this as their hobby. We have a very small team under our digital just forget but we have a central function and we have a digital unit. And somewhere in this area we have a unit who is doing quantum and AI lab. And these are not many people. And they spend a very small part of the time doing what they do. And what I’m doing thanks to my boss and my boss’s boss and everything so I am doing this on top of my job. I have zero budget except the federal funding so there is not much to cut. Because otherwise it’s late in the evening we have this call after business hours. So I think many people are committed despite not having money because it’s not like in other companies where you have a really a small team and hire a few students. For us it’s relatively small. And I rather see that we are doing more than is visible to the top management. And when we did this task force people were surprised how active we are. If you’re not in the field of course you don’t see it. But then when you say we should do something about quantum computing you see that we’re relatively well networked. I think that’s… Does this answer the question?

Yuval: Absolutely. So hypothetically if you could have dinner with one of the quantum greats dead or alive who would that person be?

Thomas: I’m prepared so I’m not so… I don’t fake surprise. And it took me a long time to think. And I’m in a very lucky position that I already had lunch with some of my idols they’re alive. Therefore I go for the dead ones. And this is a tough thing. I think I would go for David Bohm or John Wheeler because I really like the way they put more into quantum which has to do with consciousness research self-perception the miracles of the observer what is the observer so the bigger picture. Currently I’m tending in my philosophical interpretation of the word a bit to the monistic view which is maybe a bit over-exaggerated. But the miracle that we have something which is self-perception and we have something which is an external world. And how come? We don’t know. And there are so many different interpretations and I think Bohm did a very good… with his implicate order he had a very good idea to think about that we need new ways of expressing ourselves if I understood this correct. And I’ve seen some rare interviews back on YouTube with him and he seems to be a very super interesting person. But he’s dead unfortunately so no chance.

Yuval: Very well. Thomas thank you so much for joining me today.

Thomas: Yeah thanks for having me. It was a pleasure.

Date : 01 Aug2021

UV/VIS Spectroscopy is a very powerful and popular method in life science. It has become a standard method that is used on a daily basis in many laboratories. This is mainly due to its simplicity; it does not require complex sample preparation it is easy to perform and results are obtained quickly usually within seconds. A typical mea­surement requires only a small amount of sample and as it is a non-destructive method samples can be used for subsequent analyses. The field of life sciences typically applies UV/VIS spectroscopy in the analysis of nucleic acids proteins and bacterial cell cultures. The most common applications are the concentration determination of nucleic acids – DNA and RNA – the purity of nucleic acids the concentration determination of proteins by direct measurement or colorimetric assays the study of enzymatic reactions and monitoring growth curves of bacterial cell suspensions.

For an in-depth introduction to UV/VIS spectroscopy we recommend the “UV/VIS Spectrophotometry – Fundamentals and Applications” guide which is available here: www.mt.com/uv-vis

Beer-Lambert Law:

Many compounds absorb ultraviolet or visible light a behavior that is described by the Beer-Lambert law. It states that the absorbance of a sample is proportional to its concentration. This is the principle used in simple concen­tration determinations of samples such as DNA and proteins. To be more precise the Beer-Lambert law states that the absorbance is proportional to the extinction coefficient Σ(epsilon) the path length d and the concentration c.

A= Σ ∙c∙d

A: photometric absorbance

Σ: extinction coefficient

c: concentration of sample

d: path length

Spectrophotometer Instrument Types

There are essentially two different instrument categories in life sciences; the cuvette based spectrophotometer and the micro-volume spectrophotometer. Hybrid instruments come with an additional cuvette shaft and can be used for both micro-volume and cuvette measurements. However their accessory range is limited which also restricts the scope of applications.

Cuvette-Based Spectrophotometers

Conventional UV/VIS spectrophotometers with a large sample area for cuvettes can be used for various applications. They can accommodate many different cuvette types with a wide volume range and allow the usage of many optional accessories such as changers and thermostat holders.

Micro-Volume Spectrophotometers

Micro-volume instruments are dedicated to those applications where only a small amount of sample is available or when the sample is highly concentrated. The sample volume required for a measurement is typically between 1 and 3 μL. The direct measurement of highly concentrated samples eliminates the tedious dilution step and avoids pipetting errors. It is also convenient that the sample is loaded directly onto the measurement surface without the need for cuvettes.

Most micro-volume instruments cover a wide concentration range by changing the optical path length of the measurement platform. For example decreasing the path length by the factor 10 has the same effect as diluting the sample by a factor of 10. This is because reducing the path length also reduces the photometric absorbance.This way very high concentrations can be measured at moderate photometric absorbance levels. In other words the shorter the path length the higher the concentrations that can be measured. To achieve accurate results with this approach it is key that the exact path length is known.

METTLER TOLEDO Solutions for Life Science

METTLER TOLEDO offers two dedicated UV/VIS spectrophotometers for life science applications:

UV5Bio Spectrophotometer for Cuvette Measurements

The UV5Bio spectrophotometer is based on the FastTrack™ technology which allows fast and accurate measurements. The open sample area on the top makes loading and unloading cuvettes and other accessories uncomplicated. Running an analysis is self-explanatory with the aid of the OneClick™ color touchscreen user interface. Its clear structure and intuitive smartphone-type functions means there is no need for extensive training. Users are expertly guided through each step of their work. The software includes a comprehensive package of life science methods ready to use.

UV5Nano Spectrophotometer for Micro-Volume Measurements

The UV5Nano spectrophotometer combines innovative technology with intuitive usability. It can be used for small volumes of down to 1 μL saving time for dilutions and sparing precious samples. The additional cuvette slot allows measurements of large volumes of up to 3 mL. The micro-volume measurements are based on the innovative LockPath™ technology ensuring high accuracy and repeatability. Two independent measurements at two precisely defined path lengths are taken so that a wide concentration range can be covered. The LockPath technology secures the path length at a fixed position thus excluding path length drift over time. However some laboratories need documented verification of their procedures. In this case where utmost certainty is required a calibration procedure for the path length can be performed.

Railroad Pass casinosits on the outskirts of Henderson not far from Boulder City the only incorporated Nevada town where gambling is illegal.

It’s a small unassuming property — nothing like the swanky upscale resorts that line the Las Vegas Strip. But it’s proved resilient carving its place in history and holding on tight.

The state’s oldest operating casino turned 90 on Sunday. It’s a milestone worth celebrating historians say given its origins and role in the earliest days of Nevada gaming.

And while mindful of the hotel-casino’s venerable benchmark in Silver State history owner Joe DeSimone is also making improvements with an eye toward the future.

He is pumping money into renovations and new projects including an additional hotel tower he hopes to complete within a year. His message is clear: “We’re not going anywhere.”

Some of Railroad Pass’ biggest changes in its 90 years have come in the last six.

DeSimone bought Railroad Pass from MGM Resorts International in 2015. In his time as owner he has removed the museum and hung its black-and-white photos throughout the casino added 150 new slot machines developed a Chevron gas station travel center to entice truckers updated the hotel rooms extended the casino bar and modernized the property.

“We’ve done millions and millions of dollars of improvements and each one of them makes the place better and better” DeSimone said Monday.

More upgrades on horizon

The changes continue as the property enters its 10th decade.

Construction crews broke ground last month on a new hotel tower project that is expected to cost about $15 million when complete. The tower will sit just northeast of the original tower and add 127 new hotel rooms to the property’s total of 120 DeSimone said.

The new tower will be branded as a Holiday Inn Express to help attract Holiday Inn rewards members. DeSimone said Railroad Pass will supplement the new hotel’s occupancy with its own customers marketing plans and business relationships.

The Holiday Inn Express tower will resemble a modernized version of the existing hotel and its burnt orange facade. When finished the four-floor tower will feature a new pool to replace the current one pet-friendly rooms with vinyl flooring a laundromat and gym DeSimone said.

A players club connecting Railroad Pass and DeSimone’s other property The Pass in Henderson’s Water Street District went live this week. The hotel-casino is holding a birthday party on Aug. 10 with free drinks and food live entertainment and drawings.

Also DeSimone who is a real estate developer said he has applied to annex 12 acres of unincorporated land on Railroad Pass Casino Road across Interstate 11 into Henderson. He hopes to acquire the land and develop it into another travel center similar to the one on the property.

DeSimone said the property finished developing a helipad last year on a mountain overlook just to the north of the hotel. He’s looking to bring in a commercial helicopter tour operator to work out of the helipad.

“We’re not too anxious but we want to create an atmosphere where both the casino-hotel and the new tower are working with the operator of the heliport to coordinate and help each other business-wise and experience-wise for the customer” he said.

When DeSimone took over the property he said the roof “leaked like a sieve” when it rained — so often that employees knew where to place garbage cans to catch dripping water. DeSimone said a manager would tell him employees under previous ownership used to fear the place would close.

DeSimone’s team fixed the roof replaced the air conditioning system adjusted the slot operating system and repainted the property.

“It made a big deal to the employees to send a message that we’re going to be around here for a while and someone owns it that really is going to apply themselves to the property” DeSimone said.

A place in history

Railroad Pass wasn’t the state’s first licensed casino but it’s the oldest.

The property holds Nevada gaming license No. 4 and has since opening in 1931. That was the year Nevada became the first state to legalize gambling and as the oldest licensed casino in the first legalized state Railroad Pass claims it’s also the country’s oldest. The state never issued the first two gaming licenses and No. 3 closed down the Review-Journal has previously reported.

The hotel-casino earned its name for the eponymous area it occupied. The area known as Railroad Pass was named in the 1880s for a railroad track that was supposed to run through the town of Pioche and continue south into the Las Vegas Valley but never made it past Pioche when the town declined in the decade according to historian Mark Hall-Patton who recently retired as administrator for the Clark County Museum.

A mining community called Alunite occupied the pass before the railroad. A schoolhouse sat on a hill that today overlooks the travel center he said. Its Railroad Pass school district would later expand and become Henderson School District.

Railroad Pass finally got its railroad a half-century later in 1931. It was a spur designed to carry supplies to build the Boulder Dam its location chosen because it was the shortest distance to the Colorado River Hall-Patton said. In that way the spur essentially defined where the government would build the dam now known as Hoover Dam.

The railroad’s first load however carried supplies to build the casino just outside of the Boulder federal reservation land — which later became Boulder City — where gambling and drinking were illegal.

Hall-Patton isn’t sure how someone could’ve missed that the load included items for a bar.

“They didn’t know it was going to be a speakeasy” Hall-Patton said.

Single-digit slot machines and a table game provided cover for a speakeasy in the back where workers building the dam would sneak off for after-work drinks until Prohibition was repealed in 1933.

The property was built on a failed patented mine which gave the casino protections from government closures that would claim other nearby casinos Hall-Patton said.

Whisper the password “gaiety” at a door in the back of the casino and a worker could imbibe from a 55-gallon drum of brandy which would be split down to roughly 25 percent alcohol and mixed with their choice of flavor Hall-Patton said.

“It wasn’t supposed to taste very good but it was alcohol” he said.

Workers kept coming to the Railroad Pass casino after prohibition was lifted. Alcohol in Boulder City couldn’t be stronger than 3.2 percent beer and the casino offered it as well as another vice — prostitution.

“For years my claim has been that if you trip on the Boulder City city limits and fall you’ll hit your head on a slot machine in Railroad Pass” UNLV associate professor of history Michael Green said.

The Railroad Pass location was and is part of the appeal he said. The casino is a stop for travelers on their way to and from Arizona and for Boulder City residents looking for a place to legally gamble. Green said it was a neighborhood casino before the term existed.

“Railroad Pass appears to do the little things well and that has helped them” Green said. “They’re not going to have Garth Brooks do a residency or Celine (Dion) or any of the others.”

Customers looking for that type of entertainment can find it elsewhere he said. “Railroad Pass that’s not their market. And they really seem to know who they are.”

Time marches on

The original arched roof structure remains. One can see where the walls once encompassed the entire casino floor — today an area where glowing LED slot machines meet the bar. There’s the chandelier still hanging from the rafters roughly 15 feet above a false ceiling that enclosed the original high ceiling.

Kingman Arizona resident Mary James misses the old days of pulling a slot handle at the property. She said she has been stopping by Railroad Pass on her way to or from Las Vegas for 40 years.

The property still has penny slots but table games cost more than the quarter or two they used to cost said James 72.

“We used to love to come early in the morning and have their special breakfast and stuff for 99 cents which is a thing of the past” she said with a chuckle. It came with pancakes bacon and hash browns.

On Monday James her adult son and his children sat at a booth for brunch at the Iron Rail Cafe. They were visiting her from Texas and all took a trip to Las Vegas. She’s glad Railroad Pass has stuck around so long.

“I would miss it” James said.

And there is the casino’s original safe for employee payroll which may or may not still contain anything. DeSimone doesn’t know the passcodes to open them and he doesn’t believe any owner has opened it since 1975 at latest when Bob Verchota bought the place.

Before Verchota the property changed hands several times from 1936 to 1975 and “came very close to being closed under a couple of owners” the Boulder City Review has previously reported.

Verchota sold Railroad Pass in 1985 to gaming executive Michael Ensign and his Gold Strike Resorts which added the casino’s hotel. Gold Strike would merge with Circus Circus Enterprises in the mid-1990s which would become Mandalay Resort Group in 1999 which itself would be bought out by MGM Resorts in 2004.

“It’s part of that corporatization that we really saw get big here in the ’90s” Green said.

DeSimone said he wishes he knew more about the previous owners and who made which changes such as the dropped ceiling. Having changed plenty on his own DeSimone hopes to keep Railroad Pass chugging along as it has for nine decades.

“It’s a long-term business that I want to be in for a long time. I enjoy it and I appreciate it. But I realize it’s bigger than me” he said. “And when I’m gone there’ll be someone else here to carry the weight and take care of it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV2YWRhaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbWFzay1tYW5kYXRlcy13ZXJlLXRoZS1tb3N0LW5vdGljZWFibGUtYW5kLWxlYXN0LWltcG9ydGFudC1tZWFzdXJlLXRha2VuLWxhc3Qtd2Vla9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mask mandates were the most noticeable and least important measure taken last week,"In case you’re still socially distancing in a cave yes yet again most Nevadans and most of our visitors must wear masks indoors once again (mandate not valid in Lovelock Virginia City Winnemucca Battle Mountain Eureka or where otherwise not required by law).

This along with the mandates requiring masks in our state’s two most populous school districts attracted a ton of attention last week and understandably so. They are the most obvious most noticeable and most immediate demonstration that government officials believe we’re not quite done with COVID-Two Years Ago especially now that the Delta variant is making its way into our state. Looking at our steadily increasing case count and much more importantly our steadily increasing hospitalization and death rate it’s hard to argue with them.

Unfortunately though masks are indeed better than nothing (they really are!) that doesn’t mean they’re anywhere near good enough to get us back to normal on their own. According to a report on face mask effectiveness published by the EPA in April most household mask types have a filtration efficiency under 50 percent; in other words they allow in or out at least as many particles including potentially COVID-laden water droplets as they filter out. Even so they keep out (or in) some droplets and when you’re about to drive into a wall the difference between hitting it at full speed and slowing down 30 percent might be the difference between an unpleasant hospital stay and a trip to the morgue. That’s why regardless of how you feel about mask mandates you really should wear one anyway especially if you’re unvaccinated.

Even so it is a little strange that Nevada is bothering with yet another mask mandate especially since mask mandates can’t even be enforced in Los Angeles. This is doubly true since none of the other pre-vaccination restrictions appear to be on the table — social distancing and capacity requirements remain limited solely by pre-pandemic fire codes and the eviction moratorium will expire on schedule.

What gives?

The answer is credibility. When people talk about governments having credibility they generally prefer to talk about whether those in power actually know what they’re doing. Yes this is partially because no op-ed columnist ever went bankrupt writing about the real or perceived ineptness of people in power but it’s also partially because most people prefer to think happy thoughts and nothing brings happy thoughts faster than being able to do what they want to do. If those in power are smart enough to let them do that whatever that might happen to be then the world would be a more pleasant place to live in at least for them.

This particular form of credibility however is nowhere near as important as people think. There are always going to be people who when told to go one direction will reflexively go the other way out of spite. Where governments actually derive credibility from is their ability to compel. Will the government make you do what the government wants you to do even if you’d prefer not to?

Put more concretely do you interpret speed limits more liberally in the middle of a small town or in an urban neighborhood? It’s not like you know whether the people responsible for setting speed limits on either road are doing so on a rational basis (much of the time it turns out your driving is helping to set it). Your difference in behavior if there is one is probably based on which jurisdiction you’re more likely to think you’ll receive a speeding ticket. In this context the Esmeralda County Sheriff’s Department is frightfully credible when it comes to militantly punishing drivers for speeding infractions whereas most urban police departments won’t even show up with a radar gun until someone gets run over. Whether Goldfield’s urban planning department has set an appropriate speed limit for their county seat’s main thoroughfare or not is entirely immaterial (as is for that matter whether Goldfield has an urban planning department or not) both to you and to local law enforcement.

In order for a government to effectively compel you to action however your behavior must be legible to it and it must be able to respond promptly. Paraphrasing from a paraphrasing of James Scott’s Seeing Like A State a credible government needs to efficiently know whether you’re following the law or not and if you’re not it needs to be able to quickly and reliably correct your behavior. Whether someone is wearing a mask or not is extremely legible — either the mask is on or the mask is off — which makes enforcement trivially easy provided the mandate is universal.

By contrast conditioning mask wearing on vaccination status was never going to work because nobody believed the government or anyone else had information nor the willingness to actually check vaccination statuses of unmasked people. Even corporate human resources departments conditioned under the principle that any labor measure which is not allowed by the complex web of local state and federal labor laws all businesses operate under is forbidden to them were reluctant to enforce mask mandates on unvaccinated workers even though they could gain access to each worker’s vaccination records for liability and insurance purposes. Those in power had lost credibility — not technical competence but the ability to enforce their will.

Until now.

The most important change in public policy over the past week wasn’t the reintroduction of universal indoor mask mandates — it was the introduction of ostensibly legal vaccine enforcement regulations in workplaces.

On their own the announcement that unvaccinated government workers in Nevada California New York City and the Department of Veteran Affairs will soon have to undergo weekly testing for COVID-19 affects a relatively modest number of workers though if the rest of the federal government joins in that alone will potentially cover over two million employees. However private sector employers know or at least rationally assume that before a government commits to a sweeping policy such as this they’ve probably run it by the very same regulators the policy would apply to. Consequently it’s probably safe to assume that if a private company (like for example MGM Resorts) copies the very same policy and applies it to their workplace those same regulators working under the very same policies won’t object. Even if private sector employers don’t reliably follow suit applying the same mandates to the remainder of the nation’s government employees would cover over 20 million workers.

Not a single layer of the American government could credibly enforce a vaccine mandate against the population at large but employers including each of our governments as employers always could and now will. They have the medical information they have the leverage and workers are already conditioned to follow workplace rules and regulations. Now they’ve been given a green light and a roadmap.

Before you get the wrong idea it’s about time people are held accountable for their choices. For many Americans being unvaccinated has been a choice not a medical necessity and like all choices there are costs and benefits not only for the person making the choice but also for those around them. Pandemics and infectious diseases more generally are bad for business and bad for living things. The costs are almost immeasurable both in lost labor productivity and in lives. It’s only natural that businesses once given a chance will do everything within their power to prevent their employees and customers from propagating COVID-19 — even if some of their employees and patrons would rather choose to live dangerously.

However at the risk of sounding a little wistful and naive I preferred living in a world in which employers were a little less immediately aware of exactly how much leverage and control they had over their employees. I also preferred living in a world where the personal was a little less political where vaccine status wasn’t some sort of in-group loyalty signal for politically active young adults where most Americans could be relied upon to take basic preventative measures against infectious diseases and where employers didn’t have to threaten their employees’ jobs or repetitively annoy their staff into submission before people would actually receive a vaccine or two.

I don’t know what it will take to get back to that world if it even really existed but I’ll tell you this — there are far more contagious and far more lethal diseases than COVID-19 out there and we’re struggling to do the right thing against them too.

The oldest licensed casino in Nevada turns 90 on Sunday. The Railroad Pass Hotel Casino and Travel Center south of Las Vegas will celebrate that anniversary on Aug. 10 with a birthday party at the resort on the southern outskirts of Henderson.

On March 19 1931 Gov. Fred Balzar signed Assembly Bill 98 legalizing gambling in Nevada. A few months later on Aug. 1 the Railroad Pass opened. It received the fourth gambling license in Nevada. The state never issued the first two licenses. The third license recipient later closed the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Joe DeSimone a Henderson real estate developer bought the historic property from MGM Resorts in 2015.

In addition DeSimone recently bought the former Eldorado Casino in Henderson’s historic Water Street District and spent $7 million renovating and rebranding it. The Water Street property is called The Pass.

Railroad Pass Improvements

At the Railroad Pass DeSimone has spent millions on improvements over the years including adding a Chevron gas station and travel center to attract truckers the newspaper reported.

The resort is 2367 feet above sea level on the Union Pacific route to nearby Boulder City and Hoover Dam according to a Nevada Handbook entry by Deke Castleman. The hotel-casino is on the main route for visitors driving up from Arizona. Gambling isn’t legal in Boulder City but the Railroad Pass is only four miles from the town.

DeSimone is upgrading the Railroad Pass with the construction of a $15 million hotel tower. The tower will add 127 guest rooms to the current 120 rooms at the resort the newspaper reported. The tower will be a Holiday Inn Express allowing guests to use Holiday Inn rewards points. Construction began this month.

The historic property also contains an original safe used for employee payroll. The safe has apparently not been opened since 1975 according to the newspaper. DeSimone doesn’t have the passcode to open the safe and doesn’t know what’s in it.

Las Vegas Makeover

While the Railroad Pass builds upon its historic past other well-known Southern Nevada casinos have been demolished and replaced by resorts with thousands of rooms.

On the Las Vegas Strip longtime hotel-casinos such as the Desert Inn Dunes and Sands were imploded during a megaresort era that gained traction with the 1989 opening of the Mirage Hotel and Casino. Developer Steve Wynn built the Mirage on the west side of the Strip where the Castaways once stood.

Last month the $4.3 billion Resorts World Las Vegas opened on the west side of the Strip where the Mob-connected Stardust was located.

The Stardust was the center of New York journalist Nicholas Pileggi 1990s true crime book Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas. Pileggi and director Martin Scorsese wrote the screenplay for the 1995 movie Casino based on the book. In the movie the Stardust was called the Tangiers for legal reasons.

Pileggi told Casino.org “old Vegas” had an intimate quality sometimes lacking today. However the newer resorts have their own appeal he said.

“It’s Disneyland” Pileggi said. “The climate is good. These hotel-casinos are spectacular. It’s just unbelievable.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZGVhZHNwaW4uY29tL2l0LXRvb2stYS1nYW1lLXRhbmtpbmctYWNjdXNhdGlvbi1mb3ItdGhlLW5obC10by1maW5hbGwtMTg0NzQwMzUzOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NHL investigating accusation that Evander Kane bet on his own games,"At some point by now you would think that the National Hockey League would have had Evander Kane sit down for a bit either as discipline or to help him get his life on track.

English view video What can make the NHL more exciting?

In 2016 Kane was sued in Buffalo by a woman who said Kane attacked her in his hotel room. Later that year Kane was involved in separate incidents at a Buffalo-area bar that resulted in charges which were eventually dismissed after he stayed out of further trouble for six months. But in 2019 Kane found himself back in hot water sued by the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas a resort and casino after allegedly walking out on a half-million dollars’ worth of debt. That suit was dropped last year but this year Kane ran into more trouble filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in California with $26.8 million in debt and getting sued by Professional Bank over an unpaid loan.

During all that time Kane’s interaction with the league office has been a three-game suspension for abuse of officials during the 2019 preseason and a three-game suspension for elbowing in a 2020 regular-season game. He also was suspended by the Sabres for missing a practice after attending the 2016 NBA All-Star Game.

All of this stuff has just kind of happened with no intervention from the league. After all it didn’t involve the league did it? Having looked the other way for so long the NHL now finds itself in a mess that it has to address. Anna Kane Evander’s wife posted a harrowing story on Instagram about what’s been going on from more off-ice trouble to an on-ice accusation that represents a five-alarm fire for the NHL.

Among Anna Kane’s claims are that Evander left and did not call her for a week at the beginning of July; that when he finally did call it came with the news that their house was being seized by the bank; that she would need to sell her wedding ring to get money for baby formula while he was partying in Europe… and finally the one that sends a chill up Sixth Avenue: “Can someone ask Gary Bettman how they can let a player gamble on his own games? Bet and win with bookies on his own games?”

And no there’s not a flawed kind of Pete Rose defense here that Evander Kane was betting on himself. Anna Kane explicitly said “How does the NHL let a compulsive gambling addict still play when he’s obviously throwing games to win money?” Hmm maybe someone needs to address this.

Finally the NHL will do just that after five years of near-constant warning signs about Kane’s behavior.

Here’s a statement from the league:

The League was made aware this evening of a post on social media alleging that San Jose Sharks Player Evander Kane bet on NHL games. The integrity of our game is paramount and the League takes these allegations very seriously. We intend to conduct a full investigation and will have no further comment at this time.

Kane had 22 goals and 27 assists this past season for the Sharks leading the team in both categories. The 29-year-old’s worst stretch of the season coincided with San Jose’s eight-game losing streak in April when any outside shot at a playoff berth was long gone. During that period Kane’s only two goals were a shorthanded goal in the third period of a 3-2 loss at Minnesota and a tally at home against the Wild that cut a third-period deficit to 5-2. If that April swoon by the Sharks isn’t where the NHL’s investigation begins the league doesn’t know what it’s doing.

Advertisement

Then again if the NHL knew what it was doing the league would have been involved long ago in the story of a player with a history of off-ice trouble gambling issues and millions of dollars of debt. It shouldn’t have to get to a point where the wife of a man with a history of violence toward women is the one to publicly call him out possibly putting herself in danger.

Kane has denied the accusations calling them completely false.

Ignoring things and hoping they go away is standard operating procedure for the NHL which still has nothing to say about the situation in Chicago where video coach Brad Aldrich’s alleged abuse was swept under the rug for more than a decade and details continue to trickle out. But that like Kane’s previous woes never posed a threat to the NHL’s bottom line — and as sports gambling becomes more and more mainstream the biggest reason that the “integrity of our game is paramount” is that the casinos tell them so."

The NRL are set to trial two new technologies later this season to determine whether a pass is thrown forward or not.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported back in May that the NRL has received two approaches from different companies whose inventors believe they can definitively determine whether a pass has been thrown forward or not.

One of those is Sportable who based in London uses the method of inserting a microchip into the ball to track whether the ball leaves a players’ hands forwards or backwards.

The other technology uses limb-tracking technology to determine whether the trajectory of the pass goes forward or back.

NRL head of football Graham Annesley confirmed both methods will be trialled this season to see how they fare out on the pitch.

“It’s very early stages” Annesley said.

“All we have agreed to at this stage is a trial of the technology in training matches to determine whether the technology meets our needs. If we’re convinced it is accurate and suitable we would need to build a business case to take to the commission.”

The developments have been ongoing for the past three months with excitement growing all the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,

News oi -Vivek

JEDEC the solid-state technology association have now announced a new standard for the low-powered memories -- LPDDR5X which is an improved version of the LPDDR5. As one can expect the LPDDR5X (JESD209-5B) offers faster data transfer rates with over 33 percent performance improvement.

LPDDR5 standard came to mainstream flagship smartphones in 2020 and most of the premium smartphones launched post that period are being equipped with LPDDR5 RAM. Given JEDEC has officially unveiled the LPDDR5X standard we expect the upcoming flagship smartphones to use the same.

What's New With LPDDR5X?

LPDDR5X offers a peak max rate data of 8533Mbps which is 33 percent higher than the LPDDR5. LPDDR5X has a max density of 32 Gbit and it is a single-channel memory with x16 width. It also offers signal integrity improvements using TX/RX equalization along with reliability improvements using Adaptive Refresh Management technology.

We can expect to see LPDDR5X memory modules from Samsung Electronics Micron Technology and Synopsys. Micron Technology has also confirmed that the upcoming 5G smartphones will come equipped with the LPDDR5X RAM. Not just that the fast memory will also help smartphones to offer better gaming media streaming and photography features.

LPDDR5X Vs LPDDR5

LPDDR5 offers a max data rate of 6400Mbps while the LPDDR5X offers 8533Mbps. The LPDDR5X does this while consuming the same voltage (Max 1.1v) which is now variable hence one can lower the data rate by reducing the voltage.

Due to the increase in the data rate a smartphone with the LPDDR5X RAM will have a memory bandwidth of 68.26GB/s. Thich should help to increase the performance of both CPU and GPU this results in an overall smartphone performance improvement. Lowering the data rate will reduce the power consumption hence the LPDDR5X is actually more power efficient when compared to the LPDDR5.

It is now said that the Xiaomi Mi 12 is expected to be the first smartphone to feature LPDDR5X along with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 898 SoC and all the phones with the Snapdragon 898 SoC are likely to use the same LPDDR5X RAM. Hence we can expect to see smartphones with the LPDDR5X RAM probably in Q1 or 2022.

I’ve been the editor of Future Tense for more than a decade now—a long time to live in the future.

But part of me is stuck in the past: I am deeply committed to Microsoft Word. I see the ascendence of Google Docs—which has been around in various forms since 2006 but has become an unstoppable force over the past several years—as a personal affront. Word is clunky and expensive and all those things but it’s also wonderful in a lot of ways: The track changes function is superb (even if it takes a little getting used to) it’s customizable and frankly it’s familiar. I know its quirks and its features I can troubleshoot it and the mere act of staring at a Word document tells my brain: OK time to get to work.

I’m not saying Google Docs is completely useless just mostly so. There are some good use cases—in particular planning documents. I use it for grocery lists packing lists to track expenses. But when it comes to the thing I most need a word processor for—editing articles for Slate—Google Docs utterly fails. It’s the little things: If I delete a bunch of text then start writing over top of it Google Docs marks the new words as deleted text. Why? Why would I type in text only for Google Docs to delete it? It often adds a hyperlink to the space before a word which is hideous. The way it puts all of the changes in bubbles on the side instead of in-line takes up far too much space and means that you rarely see the change and the changed text on the same latitude of the page. It’s hard to rapidly accept a bunch of changes—I get stuck doing them one. At. A. Time. Like. A. Sucker.

And worst of all: the collaboration that allows multiple people to work in a document at once the very feature most championed by Google Docs partisans. Once a writer sends a Google Doc to me and I start editing by default Google lets them know. Then I see their initial pop up in the upper right-hand corner of the document and I know they are watching me. I can’t edit in front of an audience! I need to move things around to try different phrases out. But sometimes writers actually start responding to my edits in real time. What the hell! Leave me alone! One person in a document at a time! I want clear iterations not various versions that bleed into one another.

Yes there are ways around these things. Sometimes I’ll create a new document so the writer doesn’t get an alert. Sometimes I’ll specifically tell them: Stay out until I tell you I’m ready. But a lot of the time I just download it as a Word document and edit in my old familiar home where everything makes sense. That inevitably creates formatting weirdness in the document but that’s mostly a problem I have to deal with not the writer.

I know that I’m fighting a losing battle here as demonstrated by a piece I published nearly three years ago: “Journalists Just Can’t Quit Microsoft Word. But Some Are Trying.” Since then it seems to have changed from “some” to “most” including a relatively new colleague of mine at Slate an editor who was absolutely horrified when she arrived here to realize that most of us still prefer Word. And even some of my fellow Word defenders are starting to fall to Google Docs.

I see the reasoning behind Google Docs. It is most importantly free. That’s huge especially if you’re a freelance journalist. Others who aren’t as performance-shy as I am don’t mind editing a document while the writer watches or even dips in. My colleague swears that she prefers Google Docs’ “suggestions” mode to Word’s “track changes” (though I cannot comprehend how this could possibly be so). It doesn’t matter that I love Word if everyone else hates it. Word is the past; Google Docs is the future. With this sea change I see myself—a person who thinks about the future for a living—slipping into the past. It reminds me of a piece my former colleague Will Oremus then 32 wrote for Slate in 2015: “Is Snapchat Really Confusing or Am I Just Old?”

I’m just old. And someday the Google Docs partisans will see something else replace it and feel curmudgeonly about whatever new word processor people start embracing. But at least Google Docs fans and I can agree on one thing: There’s never a good reason to use Apple’s Pages.

In this work we develop an audio-based toxic language classifier using self-attentive Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). As definitions of hostility or toxicity can vary depending on the platform or application in this work we take a more general approach for identifying toxic utterances one that does not depend on individual lexicon terms but rather considers the entire acoustical context of the short verse or utterance. In the proposed architecture the self-attention mechanism captures the temporal dependency of the verbal content by summarizing all the relevant information from different regions of the utterance. The proposed audio-based self-attentive CNN model is evaluated on a public and an internal dataset and achieves 75% accuracy 79% precision and 80% recall in identifying toxic speech recordings.

While not overtly malicious in the same category as banking trojans infostealers or ransomware PUAs are still considered malware.

Sometimes also referred to as adware PUAs are typically distributed bundled with legitimate software or installed without the user's consent via pay-per-install schemes.

The category of PUAs usually includes apps that show intrusive ads apps that track users and sell their data to advertisers apps that change browser settings apps that install root certificates to intercept web traffic or apps that hijack browser search results all for the profit of a third-party company.

Living in the narrow gap between malware and legitimate software PUAs have become more rampant and intrusive as the years have gone by taking advantage that many security firms have not prioritized adware detection focusing on the more serious threats.

Microsoft took its first major step to make a dent in PUA distribution in May last year with the release of the Windows 10 May 2020 (v2004) update when it added a PUA blocking feature to the Defender the Windows 10 built-in anti-malware engine.

At the time the feature was turned off by default as Microsoft continued to work out on PUA detection kinks.

One year later the OS maker is now ready to enable this feature by default for all the one billion Windows 10 users. The rollout phase which will take place over the next two weeks will help improve the security posture of Windows users something that Microsoft has been criticized in the past especially for not enabling security features by default.

Windows 10 users can check if the new Defender PUA blocking is active or not by going to Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > App & browser control > Reputation-based protection settings.

This piece originally ran on Kotaku Australia on July 27 2021. It has been retimed as a weekend read.

Out on PC and Xbox Series X/S consoles Microsoft Flight Simulator‘s greatest asset is its accessibility and scalability. You could spend hundreds of dollars on a flight yoke separate throttle and all-aluminium rudder pedals. Alternatively you could just grab a gamepad and go on a nice bush flight.

But however you choose to play there’s a few things you should know about that will make the experience a little bit better. Having had access to the game for about a month with some experience across both control methods here’s some tips to help you get the most out of the game.

This story has been updated since its original publication following the Xbox release of Flight Simulator and subsequent updates.

Turn the default sensitivity down for Xbox controllers.

The game doesn’t tell you this during the tutorials but the default stick sensitivity for gamepads is really high. High enough that it’s useful when you’re starting out but not great for landing challenges or flying through windy or stormy scenarios.

To tune it down we’ve got a quick guide in the story below.

Flight Simulator has released a ton of great “World” updates since launch each of which improves the local maps data for their respective areas. Those updates also add more bush flights and challenges so they’re something you absolutely want to have.

Only thing is: Flight Simulator won’t download these updates automatically. To get them you need to navigate to the Marketplace tab (either by clicking or using the right bumper on a controller). From there select the World Update tab at the top.

This will bring up a selection of five updates that you can download for free. All you have to do is add each of them to your account. To make sure they’re actually downloading however press X to load up the Content Manager — here you’ll be able to see the download status of each update as well as every add-on package you have installed for Flight Simulator.

Don’t like your pilot avatar? Change it in the settings.

Microsoft Flight Simulator doesn’t tell you this but you can actually customise the pilot and co-pilot that you see when flying around in third-person. If you want a different combo for your pilot co-pilot and the instructor who flies around with you in the tutorial head to the Options -> General -> Misc tab.

There you’ll see a set of Pilot Avatar Settings where you can pick from 24 different models. I don’t know why this is buried so deep but it’s handy to know about.

Disable your firewall if you’re getting an ‘Insert Disc’ error.

This is a tip from Kotaku Australia reader camm who ran into the frustrating annoyance above when trying to install Flight Simulator on PC. In general you should disable any AV or firewall software if you run into installation or crashing issues.

Don’t be afraid to start easy with Microsoft Flight Simulator’s assists.

When you finally boot up the game — after the mammoth 100GB download — you’ll be asked to customise your Flight Simulator experience. Whatever you choose it won’t affect the in-game tutorial’s level of assists and you can always hit ESC (or Start on a gamepad) to change the assists at any time.

Flying a mammoth Airbus A320 with a gamepad is definitely going to require a bit of AI help but you can jump into the smaller propeller aircraft with your Xbox controller and a bit of keyboard/mouse help. Whatever level you start at I recommend turning Assisted Yoke OFF. It’s the Microsoft Flight Simulator‘s equivalent of Mario Kart‘s auto-steering and while it’s nice if you’re ultra paranoid about flying you’ll have a much better time nudging the plane up and down yourself.

Assisted landing and takeoff both help control your pitch (that’s aiming up or down) landing gear and flaps. Flaps are basically designed to help a plane take off and land in a shorter distance and if you want you can have that auto-adjusted. You’ll have more fun if these are turned off but if you help understanding what they do then make sure Flying Tips is enabled in the notification section. This is turned off by default on the Medium or True to Life assist presets but it’s super handy if you want to learn more about the principles of flight — and navigation — as you play.

To make life easy you can select presets for each individual setting. For everyone starting out I recommend setting Piloting to Medium and then disabling everything except Take-off Auto Rudder and Delegate ATC to AI. Going through the flight checklist is simple and a great bit of immersion and once you’ve done it once in the tutorial you won’t have any problems doing it in future flights.

CTRL + ALT + 1 / LB + B saves a custom camera — and ALT + 1 / LB + A will recall to that position.

This one’s covered in the first tutorial but it’s very easy to quickly forget. If you have a particular view that you want to save — whether that’s within the cockpit or externally — you can do so by hitting CTRL + ALT + 1 on the keyboard or LB + B for Xbox users. Pressing ALT+1 on keyboard or LB + A on Xbox will then instantly switch to that camera view and you can push in the right stick to go back to the standard view.

Give the landing challenges a go if you want to learn how to fly/land with fewer assists.

The game’s tutorial has been expanded since launch and it’s pretty comprehensive for smaller aeroplanes. If you really want to get going quickly the first 8 tutorials will get you going — and there’s also the in-game Discovery Flights with easy assists that make it almost impossible to crash.

Once you’ve had enough experience with the tutorials you can get a better feel for the controls by trying out some of the landing challenges. These will force you to navigate a little more accurately weather will be more forceful and you’ll have less guidance keeping the plane on track. This is a good option if you still want to play the game with a controller but you don’t want the game to do all of the flying for you. It’s also just a great way to quickly experience a whole range of different aircraft too so you’ll get a quick feel for what you actually want to fly.

If you can play with a full-size keyboard — even on Xbox.

While you can rebind controls to whatever you want on PC and Xbox there’s still a lot of controls. The tutorial will do a great job of explaining just the ones you need to know — or at least the ones you need to know for the aircraft you’re flying. Jumping into a Dreamliner is a totally different kettle of fish to a basic Cessna for instance.

But what Flight Simulator isn’t great about is letting you know what controls you can’t immediately access. The basic throttle controls on PC are all set to the numpad — like classic flight sims and MicroProse games — but if you have a tenkeyless or 60% keyboard you’re not going to have any shortcuts for your throttle control.

For Xbox users Asobo has implemented a “virtual mouse” which is activated by pressing in the left thumb stick. This is handy if you want to bring up say your flight log or VFR map on-screen so you can see where you’re going. (Some planes don’t have a VFR tracker in the cockpit so you will need this from time to time.) The problem is that the game will activate auto-pilot when this happens and you might not want to veer back on course — you might want to just cruise off somewhere.

If possible I’ve found the best experience outside of a full flight yoke/rudder/pedals is with a combination of a gamepad mouse and/or keyboard. Xbox users can plug in a mouse and keyboard via the console’s front and back USB ports although you may need to use a wired mouse instead of a wireless one. On Xbox I’d recommend at least having the mouse: it makes getting nice camera angles a little bit better and the mouse makes it much easier for doing things like setting flight plans tuning individual dials in a cockpit and moving around navigation menus.

Make sure you bind “Toggle Active Pause”.

The game mentions Active Pause in the tooltips but it never actually mentions what active pause is. Hitting the PAUSE button on the keyboard will basically lock your plane in place allowing you to take beautiful screenshots like the one above. On Xbox the “Toggle Active Pause” function isn’t bound by default because the Start button brings up the menu instead. But you can bind active pause to whatever you want: just head to the Controls Options expand the Menu tab and scroll down until you see “Toggle Active Pause” in the menu.

Toggle Active Pause is great especially on bush flights: it freezes your plane in place so you can quickly assess where you are without having the auto-pilot kick in. It’s also as you can see above perfect for taking killer screenshots.

When landing target for the middle of the runway. Point the nose of the aircraft down and just as you get near the runway pull the nose of the aircraft up slightly and eventually the plane will calmly drop onto the runway.

Landing is probably the most challenging thing you can do in Microsoft Flight Simulator and there’s a lot of different ways it could go wrong. You could be coming in at the wrong angle. Maybe you came in too fast. Or maybe you don’t have enough speed coming in.

The tutorial does a good job of taking you through a basic landing where you have a direct line of approach to the runway. Generally the easiest approach is to maintain about 65 knots and target the number at the front of the runway (the bit closest to you) in your dashboard.

You want to descend on a path where that number stays fairly level in your sights. If it’s rising up in your dashboard then you’re falling too quickly so you’ll need to get a bit more throttle. If it’s falling below your dashboard you’re flying too quickly so you’ll want to reduce your speed maybe add some flaps (LB / RB to extend/retract on the gamepad).

I’d recommend running through the fourth tutorial level a couple of times just to get comfortable with landing. If you want more advice on touching down there’s a great video below from YouTuber Squirrel outlining all the basics you need to know.

Microsoft Flight Simulator will let you put all the pop-up windows — navigation air traffic control weather status — on a second monitor.

So here’s something cool if you’re playing on PC. When you start planning your own flights there’s a ton of extra stuff you might want to do. You might want to chat to air traffic control yourself — maybe you’ve set off on a joy flight and didn’t really decide where you wanted to land so you’ll need to radio in before touching down.

Maybe you want to keep a list of objectives up. Or you’ve got a navlog up for a bush flight so you know where you need to head after each checkpoint. Problem is this stuff takes up a ton of real estate on the screen and it all gets in way of the game.

Now while you can minimise or close these windows as needed you can also leave them up permanently — on a second monitor. In the image above you’ll see three blue buttons in the top-right of the Navlog window. If you press the second button it’ll pop-out the Navlog to a separate window process which you can then drag around your desktop.

You can do this for everything else so for instance. Here’s my second monitor just before taking off for a joyflight from Queenstown.

It’s not necessary if you’re just doing a short flight — from say Hobart to Melbourne’s Tullamarine. But if you want to plan a longer trip tackle the game’s initial bush flight challenges or do a longer route from Australia to the United States Japan or somewhere equally far away then this can help a ton.

No you can’t crash into other pilots.

In case you were wondering — or you were worried about pissing off people trying to fly “properly”. Don’t worry! There’s no in-game chat and Flight Simulator will let you customise whether you want to fly solo fly with other live players or NPC-powered AI pilots which are based on real-world traffic patterns.

Don’t try to run the game at highest settings on the highest resolution.

Microsoft Flight Simulator is basically the modern day version of Crysis. In the video above you can see what it’s like running the game on a fairly high-end rig: An Intel i7-7700k with an RTX 2080 Ti. At 4K with max settings the game barely hovers above 30fps with plenty of drops underneath that. Even for users with 3000-series or RX 6000-series GPUs Flight Simulator is a notorious beast.

The latest performance upgrade will improve the game’s optimisations for a lot of users but even then you’ll still get the most mileage if you can live with a tweaked medium preset (or high-end with a reduced render scale).

If you’re on a low-end card — like a RX 500 series or a GTX 1060 series — then you’ll need to play the game at 1080p on medium settings with some further options turned down or off entirely.

Enjoy yourself.

The fun of Microsoft Flight Simulator is similar to Euro Truck Simulator or other “sims”. It’s not a competitive experience per se even though there are solo flying challenges you can take part in.

Instead it’s all about just soaring into the sky and enjoying the journey. If you want to do that with friends you can. If you want to take it “seriously” and invest in better setup to better experience the difficulty of flying an Airbus A320 through a thunderstorm you can do that as well.

But you don’t have to.

The fun of the game is really just letting go and enjoying the journey. It doesn’t matter how closely that journey replicates the real-life experience; it’s about customising the experience to the point where you find it the most enjoyable. There will be a career mode of sorts patched into the game post-launch and there are a set of achievements and challenges that you can experience in the meantime.

But all the while the best part of the game remains the same. It’s the freedom of flight. Nothing does it better than Microsoft Flight Simulator. And in a world where we’re in isolation forced or out of anxiety or concern for others that is a truly a gift.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vNzQ0NDAwL3doeS15b3Utc2hvdWxkLXBsYXktbWljcm9zb2Z0LWZsaWdodC1zaW11bGF0b3ItMjAyMC1mb3IteGJveC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why You Should Play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 for Xbox,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vNzQ0NDAwL3doeS15b3Utc2hvdWxkLXBsYXktbWljcm9zb2Z0LWZsaWdodC1zaW11bGF0b3ItMjAyMC1mb3IteGJveC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The nucleic acid vaccines including messenger RNA (mRNA) and DNA vaccines have been under development for decades but there was no opportunity to test their safety and efficacy; vaccines may take years and decades to provide sufficient proof of safety and efficacy. Then came COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Fast data collection became possible because the virus was so widespread. Even with small infection numbers (n = 150) among study populations that averaged about 30000 to 40000 it was clear that mRNA vaccine efficacy was surprisingly high: 95% or better. The FDA would have approved the use of the mRNA vaccine at even at 50% efficacy.

The safety of the mRNA vaccines was confirmed clearly in multiple studies across the globe. However not all COVID-19 vaccines fared well. The third mRNA vaccine by CureVac failed because its developers chose not to follow the teachings of the common wisdom. mRNA vaccines work by introducing a harmless piece of the virus into the body and triggering an immune response that conditions the body to recognize and attack the true virus. Moderna and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccines use modified RNA (pseudouridine); CureVac chose not to modify the RNA and its vaccine uses normal uridine. It produced lower levels of antibodies than the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines and was just 47% effective at preventing COVID-19 infection. Incidentally the name Moderna comes from “modified RNA.”

The Chinese Sinopharm vaccine a traditional inactivated virus vaccine also failed. This failure brought great misery because the Chinese government had used this vaccine as a diplomacy tool supplying billions of doses to developing countries. As of today none of the non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have come close to the efficacy of the mRNA vaccines.

We have 2 mRNA vaccines approved under Emergency Use Authorization (BNT162b2 mRNA-1273/NAID) and I anticipate their full approval soon. Pfizer has filed for the modification of storage temperature and Moderna has filed for the reduction of dose; the Pfizer dose is 30 mcg and the Moderna dose 100 mcg. There are now newer lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations that can provide better temperature stability allowing only refrigeration storage.

Sarfaraz K. Niazi PhD mRNA vaccines have been under development for decades so much of the base technology is already in the public domain. Both Pfizer and Moderna have shared their clinical protocol and that is a rare event as these protocols cost millions to produce and billions to execute.

Incidentally Moderna has permitted the use of its patented LNP technologies to any company. Although the challenges to overcome IP issues remain the humanitarian considerations make these challenges manageable. The US government has proposed to remove patent exclusivity relating to the COVID-19 vaccines. This action will require EU cooperation that is yet to come. However as a patent law practitioner I am confident that we can make COVID-19 vaccines without any patent infringement that remains in our way. mRNA vaccines have been under development for decades so much of the base technology is already in the public domain. Both Pfizer and Moderna have shared their clinical protocol and that is a rare event as these protocols cost millions to produce and billions to execute. No other vaccine developer has shared these protocols in public. The mRNA vaccine developers now have a clear understanding of the regulatory process required to approve new mRNA vaccines.

Regulatory Pathway

At the time of the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA 2010) there was no indication that the introduction of mRNA vaccines would create a dilemma for the FDA in deciding an appropriate regulatory pathway.

The FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) jurisdiction includes biological products such as prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines whole blood and blood products cellular products and exosomal preparations gene therapies tissue products and live biotherapeutic agents. CBER also regulates selected drugs and devices used to test and manufacture our biological products. In keeping with that mission product approval applications filed with CBER include 351(a) filings which are for “standalone” or original products rather than biosimilars (21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 601.2). The biologics license application (BLA) is regulated under 21 CFR 600 – 680.

Many biological products are controlled by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) including biosimilar and interchangeable biologics. For example in March 2020 insulin glucagon and human growth hormone regulated as drugs under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act came into the CDER BLA program.

mRNA vaccines have a unique feature: They are manufactured chemically not biologically as are many other vaccines. As a result the vaccine structure is completely known unlike the therapeutic proteins. The variations in the secondary and tertiary structures and post-expression modifications require intensive evaluation of similarity to allow them a biosimilar status. A proposed biosimilar mRNA vaccine can provide a 100% match for a reference product sequence. Thus mRNA vaccines are closer to generic chemical products than biological therapeutic proteins.

In my opinion the traditional vaccines can stay within the jurisdiction of CBER and the chemically synthesized vaccines be approved under BLA by CDER under the 351(k) filing where suitable.

Already the FDA has issued a final guideline (February 2021) on the development of products for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 which states:

“COVID-19 vaccine development may be accelerated based on knowledge gained from similar products manufactured with the same well-characterized platform technology to the extent legally and scientifically permissible. Similarly with appropriate justification some aspects of manufacture and control may be based on the vaccine platform and in some instances reduce the need for product-specific data. Therefore FDA recommends that vaccine manufacturers engage in early communications with [Office of Vaccines Research and Review] to discuss the type and extent of chemistry manufacturing and control information needed for development and licensure of their COVID-19 vaccine.”

This statement can be construed as pointing to the possibility of a biosimilar application filing for a licensed (BLA) product to meet all requirements of the BPCIA. If the sequence of a biosimilar mRNA vaccine matches a reference product sequence then the need for extensive toxicology and efficacy testing can be reduced on a case-by-case basis depending on other factors of variation. In my earlier conversation with the FDA I appreciated the broad encouragement I received to discuss the development plan in a Type B meeting first where the possibilities of a modified 351(a) filing or a 351(k) filing for a biosimilar mRNA vaccine can be discussed; the 351(a) modified approach will be analogous to a 505(b)(2) new drug application under the FDC Act. I will keep my readers informed of any new indications from the FDA.

mRNA vaccines are now at the forefront of hundreds of possibilities including preventing infections to preventing autoimmune disorders. Since the antigens focused on the design of mRNA vaccines cannot be patented a biosimilar vaccine product may likely produce the product without any infringement issue. The testing proposal presented above will help expedite the approval of biosimilars without risking the safety and efficacy of biosimilar products.

For the first time we have a scientific challenge to meet: how to classify mRNA vaccines as chemical drugs or as biosimilars rather than standalone biologics?

Sarfaraz K. Niazi PhD To promote the idea of creating a new category of products biosimilar vaccines I have filed a citizen petition to the FDA advising the agency on creating new guidance for this new class of biosimilar products.

In contrast to chemically synthesized small molecular weight drugs which have a well-defined structure and can be thoroughly characterized biological products generally derived from living material (humans animals or microorganisms) are complex in structure and thus are usually not fully characterized. However this last consideration does not apply to mRNA vaccines.

To promote the idea of creating a new category of products biosimilar vaccines I have filed a citizen petition to the FDA advising the agency on creating new guidance for this new class of biosimilar products. In my opinion the agency will agree to many of my suggestions because the issue of structural similarity with a reference product is no longer an issue. Preclinical toxicology studies can be waived based on in vitro and situ studies requiring only comparable antibody production in animal species. The immunogenicity—stimulation of immune response—is not a significant issue because vaccines are supposed to be antigenic. A limited trial in animal species capable of showing antibody response that is comparable to findings with the reference mRNA vaccine will suffice to establish equivalent safety with the reference product.

I have also developed several mRNA vaccines including COVID-19 flu HPV HIV and tuberculosis that are under advanced stages of development across the globe including one with a biosimilar status. Today the world needs about 8 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines that work. I have concluded that we can make 1 billion doses using 30 L bioreactors in 6 months with our cost of goods not exceeding $0.50 per dose in bulk and $0.90 in final packaging if the vaccine is manufactured in the United States; the costs can be lower if manufactured in developing countries. For example the cost of Moderna single dose is $32 to $37 and Pfizer’s $22 in final packaging. I can confirm these costs of manufacturing that make the commercial manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines a highly profitable project.

While there is an excess of COVID-19 vaccine in the United States the rest of the world is still starving for it. The WHO has also told me that the world needs 8 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines and that they will be very proactive if anyone can supply the mRNA vaccines; the trust in all other vaccines has declined. This is a remarkable business opportunity for many companies since the capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX) are very small. In my next article on the topic I will provide details of strategies to take the mRNA vaccines to market fast and reduce CAPEX and OPEX significantly. I want to enable newcomers to appreciate that mRNA technology will revolutionize health care and there are many opportunities to join this revolution.

Summary

mRNA vaccines are chemically derived and have fixed chemical structures; it is possible to fully replicate a reference product sequence reducing the burden of proving biosimilarity required for therapeutic proteins. The FDA has already suggested a new pathway for mRNA vaccines but this path will only come into being when enough companies join in taking steps toward this strategy.

Watch for the second article in this series: Biosimilar mRNA Vaccines—Fast-to-Market Strategies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vYXJ0aWhvbGljcy5jb20vbHluZXR0ZS15aWFkb20tYm9ha3llLW1vZGVybmEtbXVzZWV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lynette Yiadom-Boakye at Stockholm's Moderna Museet,"There are two entrances to the Lynette Yiadom-Boakye exhibition at Moderna Museet in Stockholm. Or rather: they might be an entrance and an exit but they’re not clearly marked so you could choose either to start your journey. I chose the left and the very first painting I encountered left me breathless.

Against a dark monochromatic background a figure appears. Wearing a distinctly red robe and not much else their gaze is penetrative their hand on their chest evokes an equally surprising look back at the viewer in return. The red halo around the person as if a reflection from the clothes adds mystery to the work yet it gives nothing away. But while all these representational elements certainly inform the painting and add to the public’s possible interpretation of it what struck me is the exquisite brushwork. The character’s face the single stroke that comes to define their lip and thus the whole facial expression the poignant white around the pupils. The way all these movements come together in perfect harmony to create poetry that is this painting.

Fly In League With The Night

It’s hard to believe none of the people in some 80 paintings in this exhibition are real. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye (born 1977 in London) combines drawings found images and imagination to give life to ambiguous characters based on these visual notes. Stemming from the artist’s scrapbook they appear in everyday scenes in intimate and timeless moments becoming somebody and nobody at the same time. It is precisely because these people could be any people that we can relate to them so deeply. This is also why this artist is finally in the spotlight she deserves amid the rise of figurative painting on the international art scene.

Indeed that very first portrait I saw in this show is a great example of Yiadom-Boakye’s practice as a whole which we can describe it as a threefold one.

There is the figure depicted based on a color a movement or a gesture. These characters are usually depicted resting observing or dancing in an intimate conversation. Sometimes there is nothing or very little accompanying them on canvas (or linen). The backdrop is usually dark almost the same hue as the characters’ skin. Sometimes there is an animal or an endless landscape – all designed to ignite our imagination and have us write out their stories ourselves.

I mention “writing” here on purpose because aside from being visual narratives Yiadom-Boakye’s artworks are also poetry prose. According to the artist fiction and narration are both profoundly present. “I write about the things I can’t paint and paint the things I can’t write about” she says. The exhibition title itself “Fly In League With The Night” is taken from a poem by the artist written especially for this presentation. The titles of the paintings can be seen as extensions of the prose she says as additional brushstrokes on the picture plane. And so we have painting titles such as “Repurposed for Songs” or “No Such Luxury” or “A Passion Like No Other” again providing very little actual context to the work and asking us to do it instead.

Finally there is the act of painting itself. Yiadom-Boakye explores the potential of color composition light and tone improvising in a conversation between paint brush and canvas. The paintings are generally dark in color palette with palpable thick strokes that examine the way the human eye perceives color. Because of that and the way the artworks were lit inside Moderna Museet I explored different points of view of each work each angle giving me something I hadn’t seen before. Additionally Lynette Yiadom-Boakye never uses a ready-made black but instead mixes blues and browns to capture all the nuances and hues – something which can be seen in many of the paintings on display if you pay enough attention.

Almost always as well there is a single or couple of elements that stand out in the paintings. Sometimes it’s a brightly painted piece of clothing other times it’s the whiteness of a cigarette or the subject’s teeth or the redness of a parrot.

Lynette Yiadom-Boakye at Moderna Museet Stockholm

A contemporary artist Lynette Yiadom-Boakye obtained her MA degree at the Royal Academy Schools in 2003. In 2010 the late curator Okwui Enwezor gave her an exhibition at Studio Museum in Harlem. In 2013 she was shortlisted for the Turner Prize. The exhibition “Fly In League With The Night” which was previously shown at Tate Modern in London (December 2020-May 2021) is the most extensive survey of the artist’s career to date.

Lynette Yiadom-Boakye’s Wikipedia page states that “her work has contributed to the renaissance in painting the Black figure.” While “painting the Black figure” certainly isn’t a new phenomenon I would argue that it is one pushed by the mechanisms behind today’s contemporary art market. The white Western contemporary art canon has been showing an interest in Black figurative painters that center Black people in their work. It is a phenomenon that perhaps did start before the Black Lives Matter movement’s 2020 protests but was definitely pushed by it into the mainstream.

As usual the two sides of the mainstream coin will show again here: the Black painters will finally benefit from it by getting the spot within it that they deserve but are also in risk of being forever referred to as “painters of Black figuration” instead of just “painters of figuration.”

Lynette Yiadom-Boakye is not new to this business. In my opinion her work is in no need of contributing to anything. Perhaps the artist’s own quote is best explains this view:

“Blackness has never been other to me. Therefore I’ve never felt the need to explain its presence in the work anymore than I’ve felt the need to explain my presence in the world however often I’m asked. I’ve never liked being told who I am how I should speak what to think and how to think it. I’ve never needed telling.”

“Lynette Yiadom-Boakye Fly In League With The Night” is on view at Moderna Museet in Stockholm Sweden until September 19 2021."

Initiated in 2019 the campaign confronts the issue of cyber-bullying and encourages its audiences to express generosity an act close to the brand’s narrative.

Commenting on the launch of the second edition of the campaign Anil Viswanathan Senior Director – Marketing Mondelez India said “Cadbury Dairy Milk as a brand believes that a little bit of generosity can go a long way and often it’s the smallest things that have the biggest impact. Cyber-bullying is something which affects everyone especially today’s youngsters. Apart from the direct impact of bullying the apathy of the silent bystander impacts the victims in a big way. While we were pleased to see the impact created online through #HeartTheHate which leveraged this insight in 2019 we knew there was a lot of work still left to do. Through the next phase of the campaign we hope to further reiterate Purple Heart as an emoticon that helps express solidarity with the bullied. This campaign leverages technology in a smart way to make consumers understand how breaking their silence and standing up for the victims can make a huge difference in their lives.”

The second edition of the campaign roots from the insights drawn from a recent poll conducted by Cadbury Dairy Milk in partnership with Inshorts. Out of the total 1.7L participants 42% of them said they were cyberbullied and 55% said they weren’t supported by friends when cyberbullied.

The campaign through its digital films builds a strong case for the need to speak up when witnessing cyberbullying. The videos show the victims in a vulnerable state after being subjected to bullying and the viewer is nudged to take a stand and support the victim by clicking on a link on the video. Basis the action or inaction of the viewer multiple sequences of instances are generated from the victims’ life. If the viewer clicks the link to post a Purple Heart for the victim they are shown how relieved the victim feels in real time. However if the viewer ignores the message or skips the pre-roll ad they are targeted by another ad which shows the victim becoming even more affected from the bullying. This algorithm has been adapted to other social platforms including Facebook Instagram and audio platforms like Saavn Spotify helping break the fourth wall and interact with viewers by making them a real time bystander to bullying.

Commenting on the campaign Neville Shah Executive Creative Director Ogilvy India said “The idea makes you see the effect of cyberbullying. Something we as silent bystanders ignore. Because while the bullying or trolling maybe just words online they have an impact in the real world. We shouldn’t ignore it. And we shouldn’t ask the victims to ignore it. So a little push a gentle nudge a soft reminder to ask us bystanders to stand up and simply share a Purple Heart. Make the person smile. Let them know it’s NOT just trolls out there”

The campaign is supported through multiple integrated marketing elements including influencer outreach. Additionally Cadbury Dairy Milk has also partnered with a leading cyber psychologist to lead workshops with 20 campuses in the country. The key focus of the campus engagements would be creating awareness and highlighting the various tools available for youngsters to handle bullying in the cyber space",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2NvdHRpc2hncm9jZXIuY28udWsvMjAyMS8wOC8wMS9sZXR0aW5nLXRoZS1wdWJsaWMtZGVjaWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Letting the public decide,"CADBURY has unveiled the three finalists in its Dairy Milk inventor competition.

The writer Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s chief global strategist is author of ‘The Ten Rules of Successful Nations’

The world faces a growing paradox in the campaign to contain climate change. The harder it pushes the transition to a greener economy the more expensive the campaign becomes and the less likely it is to achieve the aim of limiting the worst effects of global warming.

New government-directed spending is driving up demand for materials needed to build a cleaner economy. At the same time tightening regulation is limiting supply by discouraging investment in mines smelters or any source that belches carbon. The unintended result is “greenflation”: rising prices for metals and minerals such as copper aluminium and lithium that are essential to solar and wind power electric cars and other renewable technologies.

In the past the transition to a new energy source provided a big boost to the old one. The advent of steam power inspired the makers of sailing ships to innovate more in 50 years than they had in the previous 300. Electricity had a similar impact on gas lighting. Now building green economies will consume more oil in the transition period but producers are not responding the same way because political and regulatory resistance has darkened the future of fossil fuels.

Even as oil prices rise investment by the big hydrocarbon companies and countries continues to fall. Instead oil powers are reinventing themselves as clean energy powers. One broker recently wrote that of his firm’s 400 institutional clients only one was still willing to invest in oil and gas. Even in shale oil a corner of the market dominated by private players rising prices are triggering an unusually weak increase in supply.

Two of the most important metals for green electrification are copper and aluminium. But investment in these metals has also been depressed by environmental social and governance issues. The world needs more copper to stop global warming but environmentalists recently helped block a new Alaska mine over rival concerns: the impact on local communities and salmon.

ESG used to be a luxury of rich nations. No longer. These pressures are restraining supplies even from Latin America once the wild west of global mining. Almost 40 per cent of copper supply comes from Chile and Peru and in both countries mining projects that used to take five years can now take 10 or more. One big copper project in Peru scheduled to open in 2011 remains unfinished owing to resistance from the local community. This year alone Chile has adopted two sweeping environmental rules and is considering a new royalty that could make some of its biggest mines unprofitable.

China’s role as a big commodity supplier has also been turned on its head. A decade ago the country was still overproducing raw materials such as iron ore and steel and dumping the excess in foreign markets. Now Beijing has cut production as part of its campaign to reach carbon neutrality. Nearly 60 per cent of aluminium comes from China which recently capped new smelting because of its fat carbon footprint.

This certainly looked like the green thing to do. Aluminium is one of the dirtiest metals to produce. Yet it is also one of the metals most vital to solar and other green energy projects and it is set to face a particularly sharp increase in demand in coming decades according to the World Bank.

In the 2000s analysts were bullish on commodity prices owing to demand from China. Now if they are bullish it is because of increasing demand from green projects. The green economy is the new China.

Renewable technologies require more wiring than the fossil fuel variety. Solar or wind power plants use up to six times more copper than conventional power generation. Over the past 18 months as governments announced new green spending plans and pledges analysts steadily increased their estimates for growth in demand for copper. Green regulation is thus spurring demand as it tightens supply fuelling greenflation. Since the low point early last year the price of copper is up more than 100 per cent while aluminium is up 75 per cent. Unusually their upward climb has barely weakened with recent signs of waning momentum in global growth.

Solving this conundrum — how to supply enough dirty old material to build a new green economy — will require balance. Blocking new mines and oil rigs will not always be the environmentally and socially responsible move. Governments and greens in particular need to recognise that trying to shut down the old economy too fast threatens to push the price of building a cleaner one out of reach.

Letter in response to this article:

Market forces can help manage climate transition / From Professor Nick Bosanquet York North Yorkshire UK",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEvMDgvMDIvc2FuYy1hMDIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visits the US as a lackey of the banks,"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez’s recent three-day trip to the United States has yet again made very clear the class interests defended by the Spanish government formed by Sánchez's Socialist Party (PSOE) and his pseudo-left ally Podemos.

Significantly Sánchez did not visit the capital Washington D.C. nor did he publicly meet with Joe Biden or any other official representative of the US government. Instead he met with investment bankers hedge fund managers and other major corporate heads. Sánchez was traveling not as a representative of the Spanish people as is usually presented in the capitalist media but as a lackey in the service of Spain’s banks and corporations.

The explicit aim of the trip was to attract investments from large vulture funds and other possible US investors. Using the 140 billion euros Spain expects to receive in European Union (EU) bailout funds in exchange for massive attacks on the working class—pension and labour reforms and austerity—the PSOE-Podemos governments hopes to obtain an additional €500 billion in private investment.

During his visit Sánchez met with a long list of banks and fund managers: Ares Management Corporation Bank of America Blackstone Group Bank of New York Mellon Brookfield Asset Management Roko Capital Management J.P. Morgan Catterton Partners Lone Star Funds Morgan Stanley Providence Equity Partners Soros Fund Management Wellington Management Group and also the US Chamber of Commerce in Spain.

Sánchez offered all of them guarantees that he will continue his attacks on the working class. In Spain Podemos promotes the lie that a new labour reform is part of “social measures” to improve working conditions but in the United States Sánchez made clear that he intends to escalate attacks on workers.

As El País explained “The Prime Minister explained to them that the labor reform agreed with Podemos and also negotiated with Brussels will mean that Spain is moving towards the German model of labor relations where there is social peace but also flexibility for employers to adapt to circumstances through the use of furlough schemes without redundancies.”

By German model of labor relations Sánchez really was talking about the notorious Hartz laws which created conditions for the emergence of a huge low-wage sector. This in turn served as a lever to smash wages and working conditions wiping out many thousands of well-paid industrial jobs. The result of the “model” hailed by Sánchez has been an explosion of social inequality. In Germany there are 136 billionaires and 542000 millionaires. On the other hand 13 million people live in poverty the highest number since German reunification in 1991.

Sánchez boasted to investors that pro-Podemos unions will suppress the class struggle El País added: “Sánchez explained to them that Spain is a country with few strikes with social peace and constant negotiation between employers and unions.” In other words the trade unions play a fundamental role in suppressing the class struggle and working with big business to impose wage cuts plant closures and pension reforms.”

He also told them not to worry about his government’s new housing law. This was of special interest to these hedge funds: Blackstone is Spain’s largest landlord with more than 40000 homes out of the nearly 240000 managed by hedge funds in Spain while Lone Star owns around 15000. Pedro Sánchez made clear that he had no intention of limiting their profits by regulating rents.

This issue affects millions of workers and youth. According the Platform for those Affected by Mortgages (PAH) since 2008 there have been more than one million evictions in Spain.

In addition to the real estate sector other groups such as J.P. Morgan Morgan Stanley Providence or Wellington have strong investments in various sectors such as mobile telephony energy banking food and other sectors in Spain. But it is global investment fund BlackRock that has the largest slice of Spain’s economy with €17 billion worth of shares in 18 of the 35 companies of the IBEX-35 Spain’s principal stock market index.

BlackRock is the world’s largest asset management corporation with $9 trillion in assets under management as of June 2021. It holds stakes in almost all major multinational companies including Coca-Cola Microsoft Monsanto and Apple among others. To understand its size and influence it is enough to say that if it were a country it would be the world’s third largest economy by size. Its president and CEO Larry Fink is known as “the fixer” for being the person who “fixes things in the financial market.” Sánchez reportedly held a private one-on-one meeting with Fink.

Podemos has covered for Sánchez’s visit. Podemos leader and Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda Díaz declared “I suppose they have talked about taxes” adding that this is “the only interesting thing about a visit to a large investment fund.” She concluded “The president has done his job” then cynically explained “Investment funds are in the world to make money and governments especially progressive ones are there to improve people’s lives.”

Díaz’s cynicism has no end. She and her government have done nothing but work tirelessly with the collaboration of the trade unions to benefit these investment funds. The examples are many.

Spanish banks laid off 15000 workers in the first six months of this year all rubber-stamped by the trade unions and endorsed by Díaz herself. This has allowed the banks to announce last week €4 billion in profits which will keep BlackRock and the IBEX-35 happy.

The monthly rise in electricity bills that is ruining millions of workers green lighted by the PSOE-Podemos government is benefiting large Spanish corporations like Iberdrola. The latest pension reform signed by the government and trade unions with the employers opens the way towards the privatization of pensions through company pension plans—in line with the aggressive promotion of these schemes by the hedge funds in Spain and throughout Europe.

These hedge funds have also profited from the herd immunity policy pursued by Madrid and the European Union prioritising corporate profits over workers’ lives. While these firms made billions in profits the cost in human lives of this policy has been over 100000 deaths in Spain and over 1.1 million across Europe. Europe is now confronting a new wave under the virulent Delta variant as capitalist governments across the continent continue to aggressively reopen the economy.

Sánchez’s visit to America confirms the warnings that the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) has made about pseudo-left parties like Podemos and their political satellites. Workers cannot expect anything from Sánchez Podemos the trade unions or their political satellites. They defend the interests of the billionaires and the big multinationals. The critical question is the struggle to give a political perspective to workers for a struggle against the pseudo-left by forming sections of the ICFI in Spain and throughout Europe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvc2h1YWNvaGVuLzIwMjEvMDgvMDEvYXBwcm92YWwtb2YtZmlyc3QtaW50ZXJjaGFuZ2VhYmxlLWJpb3NpbWlsYXItc2VtZ2xlZS1pcy1zaWduLW9mLWFuLWltcHJvdmluZy11cy1iaW9zaW1pbGFycy1tYXJrZXQtZGVzcGl0ZS1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Approval Of First Interchangeable Biosimilar Semglee Is Sign Of An Improving U.S. Biosimilars Market Despite ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2021/08/01/approval-of-first-interchangeable-biosimilar-semglee-is-sign-of-an-improving-us-biosimilars-market-despite-challenges/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvc2h1YWNvaGVuLzIwMjEvMDgvMDEvYXBwcm92YWwtb2YtZmlyc3QtaW50ZXJjaGFuZ2VhYmxlLWJpb3NpbWlsYXItc2VtZ2xlZS1pcy1zaWduLW9mLWFuLWltcHJvdmluZy11cy1iaW9zaW1pbGFycy1tYXJrZXQtZGVzcGl0ZS1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy9kci1qb3NlcGgtc2lsdmVybWFuLXJhcGVkLWFub3JleGlhLXBhdGllbnRzLWxhd3N1aXRzLXNheS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dr. Joseph Silverman Raped Anorexia Patients Lawsuits Say,"An operating room at Babies Hospital in New York City now NewYork–Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital.

One thing that stands out to Susan Kryhoski about her first meeting with Dr. Joseph Silverman is how boastful he seemed how confident he was in his recommendations and how insistent. It was 1992 and she was 11 years old sitting in his office at the recommendation of her pediatrician. Starting at age 9 or 10 Kryhoski developed anorexia; by the time she landed in front of Silverman her weight had dropped to 86 pounds. Silverman meanwhile had built a name for himself studying disordered eating in children and adolescents; he had degrees from Princeton and Columbia and completed an internship at Harvard Medical School. He had treated at least 100 young people through his inpatient program at the Babies Hospital — now the NewYork–Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital — and written extensively on anorexia nervosa.

“He had these credentials he had this impressive résumé he was part of a large hospital system he had admitting privileges and he had — according to him — a groundbreaking treatment program with a proven success rate for pediatric anorexics” Kryhoski tells the Cut. When at that first appointment Silverman asked Kryhoski’s mother to leave the room so he could conduct an exam she complied. But then he “forced” Kryhoski “to lay down on her back and spread her legs” a new lawsuit states. According to Kryhoski’s lawsuit he digitally penetrated her under the guise of “inspecting” her uterus ostensibly “to ensure that she would be capable of bearing children.”

At that first appointment Kryhoski remembers Silverman insisting that her parents pull her out of school and check her into his inpatient program immediately. To her mother Silverman’s action plan was “the best news she ever heard” Kryhoski says. “Somebody was going to heal her daughter.” But although she would stay at the hospital for the next two months Kryhoski says she never wound up receiving treatment for anorexia. She recalls the doctor ushering staff from her room during his weekly visits closing the door behind him and pulling a curtain over the window so he could “check her insides” as the lawsuit puts it. Within her first few days at the hospital Kryhoski says digital penetration escalated to rape; during his weekly “exams” Silverman would pull out his penis and penetrate her allegedly telling the 11-year-old: “This is a medical procedure; it’s to make sure that you can have children later in life. If you tell anybody you will never see your parents again and you will never leave this hospital again.”

His words made an impression: Kryhoski says she kept what happened secret for more than a decade only telling a therapist about his alleged abuse in her mid-20s. Though Silverman died in 2012 on Thursday Kryhoski filed a lawsuit against NewYork–Presbyterian and 20 of its unnamed employees citing negligence and the intentional infliction of emotional distress. The only reason she’s able to sue at all is New York’s Child Victims Act which temporarily rolled back the statute of limitations on sex crimes against children allowing survivors to take legal action against their abusers regardless of when the abuse took place. When the legislation passed in 2019 it triggered an outpouring of complaints against institutions like the Catholic Church and Boy Scouts of America but also against medical centers: Rockefeller University Hospital for example where Dr. Reginald Archibald has been accused of molesting more than 1000 minors as far back as the 1940s. As for Silverman Kryhoski isn’t the only ex-patient bringing a lawsuit: Last year Stefani Declercq — who says she first saw Silverman in 1978 or 1979 when her last name was Weisberg — filed her own complaint against NewYork–Presbyterian for negligence and malpractice and against the doctor’s estate for assault battery and infliction of emotional distress. Attorneys for the executor did not return a request for comment though they have argued in legal filings that the estate holds no liability for Silverman’s alleged abuse. The hospital declined to speak on either lawsuit.

If you tell anybody you will never see your parents again and you will never leave this hospital again.

During her time at Babies Hospital Kryhoski says Silverman kept her separate from any other anorexia patients. On her floor “nobody knew why I was there. That was a common question from nurses” she recalls. The only practitioners she saw were a psychiatrist and Silverman who would visit her in her small out-of-the-way room with a single window. She says staff allowed her only short periods of supervised contact with the outside world: Daily phone calls to her parents lasted five minutes she says with a nurse listening in and ready to end the call if Kryhoski did anything “inappropriate” like cry. Kryhoski’s parents were permitted to visit for one hour each week but they could not talk to their daughter alone; instead they sat with her in a hospital lounge with a nurse standing by as a chaperone. Ultimately her mother says the lack of access raised suspicions and prompted their decision to bring her home.

Absent opportunities to ask for help Kryhoski says she started drawing pictures: Silverman with devil horns “evil eyes” little labels reading “monster” “disgusting” “gross.” She taped these to her walls but according to the lawsuit the nurses would simply take them down and toss them in the trash. They punished her for this kind of behavior too she says confiscating her few personal belongings. Yet no one seemed to see the drawings as a red flag just as “no one questioned the reocurring bloodstains in a prepubescent minor’s underwear” the lawsuit states.

For Kryhoski the widespread failure to question Silverman’s methods feels like complicity. Her lawsuit alleges that the signs of abuse should have been visible to the people entrusted with her care and that they had a duty to protect “vulnerable” child patients. If staff were not aware of Silverman’s behavior then they should’ve been Kryhoski’s suit contends — particularly because he allegedly did the same thing to Declercq (then Stefani Weisberg) more than a decade earlier. In an interview Declercq echoed many of the allegations made in her lawsuit — namely that Silverman repeatedly raped her when she was 14 and 15 years old using exams as an excuse to penetrate her anally and vaginally on a near-daily basis for the eight weeks she spent in his program.

Like Kryhoski Declercq says the abuse started during her first meeting with the doctor when she was a freshman in high school. Suspecting she might be dealing with anorexia a teacher suggested Declercq’s mother go see Silverman. Declercq remembers the car ride from New Jersey to Silverman’s private Manhattan practice how her parents kept insisting “We’re going to listen to everything the doctor has to say we’re going to do what he wants … people are lucky to get appointments with him.” When it came time for the exam she says Silverman barked at her to undress and when she stopped at her underwear he scolded her until she cried. Then he grabbed the sides of her neck she says and laid her on the table while staring into her eyes. “He would pinch my nipples to the point even at this first exam that they hurt” she tells the Cut. “Then he would have me spread my legs so that he could examine me vaginally — I’d never been examined like that in my life. I was 14 years old. And then when I thought that was over with he had me turn on all fours and he did an anal exam.”

You can’t believe a word that she says … These girls will say anything these girls are liars.

Though Declercq says she left Silverman’s office bleeding she felt too afraid to tell her parents. She would not try until after he booked her into the hospital when Silverman’s exams had become a regular occurrence. She says the nurses acted on the doctor’s orders preparing his patients in advance of his visits: “‘Ready for him’ meant lying on the bed on your back bare-naked with your knees open” she notes. In the beginning Declercq remembers Silverman pulling the curtain around her bed — like Kryhoski Declercq alleges that the doctor kept her apart from other anorexia patients much of the time — and she remembers him stepping into her bathroom to masturbate after penetrating her first vaginally and eventually anally. Toward the end of her stay she says he became more reckless and “did whatever he needed to do to satisfy himself to me.”

One Sunday during her parents’ weekly visit she tried to tell them what was going on not knowing Silverman had prepared them for this possibility. “This is coming trust me. She’s going to say I’m doing these things. I assure you I’m not” she says he told her parents who believed him. In hindsight she understands why: They were distraught and here was a doctor warning them that “girls are dying all the time” heavily implying that she might too if they removed her from his care. But he allegedly hammered on her unreliability as a narrator: “All my girls they’re gonna lie. They always do. I see this all the time: She’s gonna tell you things that we know are impossible. She’s going to say horrible things about me to you she’s going to say horrible things about you to me you can’t believe a word that she says … These girls will say anything these girls are liars.” The nurses seemed to agree allegedly calling Declercq “a lying bitch.”

“I remember that” she says. “The first time I’d ever been called a bitch in my life was in that hospital.”

Ultimately Declercq’s complaint states she left Silverman’s care because of a nurses’ strike; speaking to the Cut she said her parents only agreed not to send her back when they realized that she was serious when she said she would kill herself first. After the hospital she experienced persistent cramping abdominal pain which doctors waved off as a menstrual complication. But a few years later she woke up in the middle of the night “hemorrhaging blood” she says. She had peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal lining) apparently from unchecked gonorrhea her lawsuit alleges. As a result she had her left ovary Fallopian tube and a portion of her uterus removed in emergency surgery. She maintains the infection only could have come from Silverman.

For years Declercq says she lived with the assumption that she would not be believed. The first person who encouraged her to report his behavior to NewYork–Presbyterian was a therapist she saw when she was a college student in the mid-’80s. Declercq says that when she told hospital administration what happened they batted down her claims as implausible from such a “well-respected” doctor. According to Declercq’s lawsuit after leaving Silverman’s program she developed post-traumatic stress disorder anxiety depression difficulty with intimacy lingering “feelings of worthlessness shame and disgust” plus anorexia. Kryhoski too struggled with suicidal ideation and self-harm and continued to seek treatment for an eating disorder she says Silverman did not even attempt to treat. Declercq agrees: When she went into the hospital she says she weighed 112 pounds. By the time she left she’d dropped down to 88.

Until very recently Declercq says she felt like she “was all alone out there” like she was the only one who’d suffered at Silverman’s hands. When she heard about Kryhoski’s case the comfort she felt came tempered with regret: Silverman seemingly abused someone else after she tried to report him. “What hurts me the most about this is this other girl” she says. “If one person investigated it and believed me maybe it wouldn’t have happened to her.”"

The business in Ashwell is hosting the event as part of its Small Business Summer initiative supporting local independent businesses.

Based outdoors but under the canopy at the Garden Centre over 50 local artists artisans and producers will be showcasing their wares and products from 10am to 4pm on this Saturday and Sunday July 31 and August 1.

Brand Ambassador for Rutland Garden Village Miranda Jones said: ""The Fair is the culmination of months of work reaching out to local businesses.

""Many of these artists and artisans have had very few opportunities to exhibit their work and meet face to face with the buying public over the course of the last 18 months so this is an important event for them.

""There are also people coming who have started new businesses during lockdown or who have been made redundant and turned their hobbies into a new business. We really hope that people come down and see first hand the creativity resilience and resourcefulness of local people.""

Entry is free on both days. The Lord Lieutenant of Rutland Dr Sarah Furness will open the Fair at 10.30 am on Saturday 31st July. There will be a cold drink & ice-cream station and the Garden Village Café will be open throughout.

Or at least it is in the stock market. U.S. equities surged 16.7% in the first seven months of the year trouncing the 5.90% gain in the rest of the world through late Friday as measured by the benchmark MSCI indexes. Not only that but the U.S. outperformed by 4.06 percentage points this month the most since April 2020.

Despite the heady performance one critical ingredient had been missing: the backing of those with the most at stake. But that changed this month when a State Street Global Markets index released Wednesday showed that institutional investors turned net bullish on the U.S. for the first time this year. The change in sentiment underscores how the outlook for the U.S. is only becoming stronger relative to the rest of the world which is a testament to the policies put in place by the government and Federal Reserve to support the economy as the pandemic lingers. It also suggests that maybe the “dumb money” has been smart all along.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZG1hcmtldGZvcmNlcy5jb20vemVuaXRoLWJhbmstZ21kLWNhbnZhc3Nlcy1pbmNyZWFzZS1pbXBhY3QtaW52ZXN0aW5nLWluLWFmcmljYS_SAVhodHRwczovL2RtYXJrZXRmb3JjZXMuY29tL3plbml0aC1iYW5rLWdtZC1jYW52YXNzZXMtaW5jcmVhc2UtaW1wYWN0LWludmVzdGluZy1pbi1hZnJpY2Ev?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zenith Bank GMD Canvasses Increase Impact Investing in Africa,"Zenith Bank GMD Canvasses Increase Impact Investing in Africa

Ebenezer Onyeagwu Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Zenith Bank Plc has called for increased impact investing in Africa to enable the continent to achieve its full potentials.

A statement by the bank issued to newsmen on Sunday in Lagos said Onyeagwu made the call in a keynote address at the Africa Investment Risk and Compliance Summit 2021 organised by the Emerging Business Intelligence and Innovation (EBII) Group on July 30 at the University of Oxford U.K.

Onyeagwu whose address was entitled: ‘Leveraging Impact Investment Opportunities for Growth in Africa’ described impact investing as an investment that yielded optimal returns for investors.

He further described impact investing as value for all stakeholders and guaranteed continued sustenance and existence of humanity.

Onyeagwu decried the shallowness of Africa’s financial market as depicted by the fact that no African exchange was among the Morgan Stanley developed markets index except for two in Egypt and South Africa in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and only six African exchanges in the MSCI Frontier Market Index.

The Zenith bank’s CEO noted that although the International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimated that the global investors’ appetite for impact investing could total as much as $26 trillion only approximately eight per cent of the assets of impact intent funds were focused on Africa.

This is not significant enough he said adding that Africa appeared to be in the room but not on the table considering the fact that Africa was in dire need of investments especially in the light of the continent’s 1.3 billion people representing about 17 per cent of the global population of about 7.8 billion.

Onyeagwu cited the immense opportunities in Africa that represented enormous investment propositions for discerning investors including the huge population large market active labour force and the rich natural endowments.

He described Africa as “the new frontier” for global growth; making a case for increased impact investment in the continent because of its investment opportunities in agriculture healthcare housing infrastructure electricity and the creative sectors.

Onyeagwu exuded optimism on the coming into effect of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) initiative noting that this would create a single continent-wide market for goods and services business and investment granting investors access to the entire continent.

The Zenith bank CEO also called the attention of investors to Africa’s rich natural endowments which included 60 of the world’s uncultivated arable land that had enormous potentials for organic food production and nine per cent of the world’s freshwater bodies.

“Therefore I implore investors in the agribusiness value chain to focus attention on Africa for organic food production instead of genetically modified food in other climes.

“As a socially responsible organisation Zenith Bank continues to promote impact investment in Africa.

“For example the bank has maintained strong advocacy for investment in Africa through its flagship sponsorship of “Inside Africa” on CNN for 16 consecutive years.

”This is helping to highlight the immense creativity and talent that abound on the continent and the enormous investment opportunities.

“The bank leverages its in-depth knowledge of the African market to guide investors and hedge their exposures” he said.

In addition he said the bank had been on a steady Environment Social and Governance (ESG) investment journey.

Onyeagwu then called for a paradigm shift as Africa remained a work in progress and leaders in the public and private sectors must not despair rather they should champion the changes they want to see by paying close attention to responsibility and accountability in leadership.

He called for the de-risking of Africa through reforms improved ease of doing business respect for the rule of law and sanctity of contract and human capital development.

Onyeagwu expressed satisfaction with the several reforms of the Federal Government including the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme (RITC) and the establishment of the Rural Electrification Agency’s (REA).

In particular he lauded the Rural Electrification Fund (REF) and the Infraco Plc among other development finance initiatives of the Central Bank of Nigeria.

But new calculations from climate-friendly Australian Ethical suggest switching funds could have a much larger effect on the nation’s carbon footprint than other more incremental changes.

If every single person in Australia moved their superannuation into an eco-conscious fund it would reduce their collective carbon footprint by an amount equal to half the household emissions across all of Australia.

Australian Ethical said this was equal to 78 million tonnes every year – the same amount produced by 16.9 million cars on the road or 4.6 million average Australian households.

Australian Ethical CEO John McMurdo said the motivation behind the research was to remind people that their superannuation could be invested in companies they deemed unethical and to show them that switching funds could “make a real difference”.

“Australians increasingly only want to associate with brands and companies that reflect their own values” Mr McMurdo told TND.

“And there’s a lot more consciousness about where their money is being invested [which is] really opening our eyes to the power of our money.”

Mr McMurdo said an inconvenient truth was now being exposed – that banks insurance companies and superannuation providers “have been investing in companies doing damage for a long time now”.

“Presumably in the pursuit of performance and profits” he said.

‘Enormous collective difference’

In its research – which used the MCSI World Index as a proxy for an average superannuation fund and calculated the difference between its carbon footprint and that of the MSCI World Climate Paris Aligned Benchmark Select Index – Australian Ethical points out that Australians would have no immediate influence on the emissions of the companies from which they took away their superannuation savings.

But if enough people took action it could lead to positive behavioural changes or render the companies unviable if they continued to pollute at the same levels.

“It can sometimes feel like the fate of our planet rests on individual people taking lots of small actions” Mr McMurdo said.

“But instead of just saying no to using harmful products and services we can also use our money to remove support for their production in the first place creating an enormous collective difference.”

Ethical investing is taking off – and it’s not just for bleeding hearts.

Australian Ethical’s campaign has won the support of independent Member for Warringah Zali Steggall who took the seat of former prime minister Tony Abbott in the 2019 federal election after campaigning on the need for stronger climate action.

“Transferring funds to an ethical funds manager is a clear way for individuals to reduce their own emissions and broader environmental impacts whilst at the same time benefitting from these funds’ high average performance” she said.

“It’s a win-win.”

Performance myth busted

The strong performance to which Ms Steggall referred was on show last financial year when Australian Ethical’s Balanced fund returned 17.5 per cent and its Growth option returned 20.4 per cent.

The former has now returned an average of 6.7 per cent a year since its inception and the latter 7.9 per cent.

“The myth about [inferior] performance has been busted” Mr McMurdo said.

“There are now so many proof points of superior investment performance from ethical investing – I see a new study nearly every day now globally that ethically constructed portfolios outperform other portfolios.”

Australian Ethical does not invest in tobacco companies and heavily limits its exposure to fossil fuel and gambling companies. (You can check out its full ethical criteria list here.)

And it was not the only provider to enjoy outsized success with its ethical options last financial year.

Among many others HESTA’s Sustainable Growth investment option returned 23.03 per cent and AustralianSuper’s Socially Aware option returned 19.37 per cent.

Both annual performances were stronger than the average non-ethical balanced option which according to Rainmaker returned 17.1 per cent.

In addition to its influence on climate action the strong financial performance of ethical investing helps to explain why Australian Ethical expanded its customer base by 22 per cent over the 12 months to December.

Meanwhile net flows of money into the fund over that timeframe increased by 56 per cent as high net worth individuals rushed into the fund and helped diversify its customer base beyond eco-conscious millennials.

“They were the sort of early adopters of this style of investing but we now see that it is very broad” Mr McMurdo said.

“More than 50 per cent of the population and every demographic is either now investing this way or plans to within the next 12 months.”

In more than a century we've simply never seen the stock market bounce back from a bear market as robustly as it has over the past 16 months. Since bottoming out on March 23 2020 the benchmark S&P 500 has gained a whopping 97%.

With gains like this some investors might be hesitant about putting money to work in the market. But if history has proved anything it's not when you put your money to work that matters. Rather it's the quality of the company you buy and how long you hold onto your investment.

It's my belief that if you put $50000 to work right now in any of the following five stocks they'd help you become a millionaire by 2040 or perhaps sooner.

Sea Limited

Don't be turned off by companies with market caps north of $100 billion. Often businesses that have large market caps offer sustainably strong growth and/or profitability. In the case of Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) it offers three exceptionally fast-growing operating segments.

For the moment and likely the next few years Sea's digital entertainment division will provide all of its positive earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Sea's mobile games are clearly resonating with users worldwide who've been cooped up in their homes because of the pandemic.

Sea was closing in on 649 million quarterly active users (QAU) at the end of March but more importantly had 12.3% of its QAUs paying to play. This pay-to-play figure is many multiples higher than the industry average.

The more exciting long-term opportunity for Sea is its e-commerce platform Shopee which has consistently been the most downloaded shopping app in Southeastern Asia. Shopee happens to be gaining steam in Brazil as well. By targeting emerging markets with rapidly growing middle classes Sea's online platform should deliver sustainably strong growth. For example $12.6 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) was purchased on its platform in first-quarter 2021 which is more GMV than the entirety of 2018.

Third Sea has a nascent but quickly growing digital financial services operation. It ended March with more than 26 million people paying for mobile wallet services. Since many of the regions Sea targets are underbanked it could become a key player in opening financial doors for tens of millions of consumers.

Airbnb

Another large-cap stock that has the tools needed to turn a $50000 investment into $1 million or more by 2040 is travel-and-hosting platform Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB).

What makes Airbnb so special is that it has the opportunity to disrupt two industries at once: Hotel and travel. Prior to the pandemic bookings on Airbnb more than quintupled in a three-year period (2016-2019) from 52 million to 272 million. What's more the vast majority of people booking on Airbnb are finding the platform organically. This is to say that Airbnb's brand is sticky enough that it's not having to spend a boatload on advertising and marketing to bring in repeat business or new users.

Additionally there are approximately 4 million hosts globally per Airbnb. However there are over 130 million households in the U.S. and very likely north of 1 billion worldwide. The company is still just scratching the surface of its hosting potential and we're liable to see more hosts join as consumer demand picks up.

But perhaps the biggest opportunity for Airbnb is its Experiences segment. Utilizing local experts to lead activities opens countless new doors for Airbnb to take the reins and handle most aspects of users' vacations from the transportation they take to the adventures they experience. Airbnb has ""travel disruptor"" written all over it.

Teladoc Health

Innovative healthcare stocks are also a good bet to make investors richer over time. Telehealth kingpin Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) is one such company that has the capacity to turn a $50000 investment into a cool $1 million in under two decades.

The beauty of the Teladoc operating model is that it's helping all facets of the healthcare treatment chain become more efficient. Virtual visits are almost always more convenient for people and they make it easier for physicians to stay in contact with chronically ill patients. Being able to keep up on vital data for patients with chronic illnesses should lead to improved patient outcomes and therefore less money out of the pockets of health insurers. Telemedicine is a win-win-win.

Teladoc's success is also a function of the rapid growth from applied health signals company Livongo Health which it acquired in the fourth quarter. Livongo leans on artificial intelligence to send its subscribers tips that'll help them change their behaviors in order to live healthier. As of the midpoint of 2021 Livongo had 715000 enrolled members with chronic illnesses.

This figure just scratches the surface considering that Livongo aims to offer its services to patients with hypertension and weight management issues in addition to its existing service for people with diabetes.

Though Teladoc is losing quite a bit of money now as it integrates the Livongo acquisition virtual visits represent a key tool for the healthcare community moving forward. That makes it a good bet to significantly outperform over the long run.

Redfin

Technology-driven real estate company Redfin (NASDAQ: RDFN) is a mid-cap stock with large-cap aspirations that has all the potential to turn $50000 into $1 million or more by 2040.

There's no question that saving money is important to virtually all homebuyers and sellers. One area where Redfin sets itself apart is on the cost front. Whereas most real estate firms charge up to a 3% listing/commission fee Redfin's charge ranges from 1% to 1.5% depending on how much previous business a buyer or seller has done with the company. Considering that the median existing home listed for sale in the U.S. in June cost $385000 according to Realtor.com we could be talking about $7700 in median savings for a buyer and/or seller.

Just as intriguing are the myriad personalized services Redfin has offered. On top of creating virtual and 3D home tours during the pandemic the company's Concierge and RedfinNow services are helping to take the burden off sellers. RedfinNow which is available in select cities purchases homes for cash thereby removing the haggling and hassle that come with selling a home. Meanwhile Concierge works with people on upgrades and staging that can maximize the value of their homes during the listing process.

It's no mistake that Redfin's share of U.S. existing home sales nearly tripled from 0.44% to 1.14% between the end of 2015 and March 2021. Look for this figure to head even higher as homebuyers and sellers find value in the Redfin platform.

Square

A final company with the ability to transform a healthy pile of cash into a life-altering amount of money by 2040 is fintech stock Square (NYSE: SQ).

Square's foundational puzzle piece has long been its seller ecosystem. This is the operating segment that provides point-of-sale devices analytics loans and other tools to merchants to help them grow their business. In the seven years leading up to the pandemic Square's seller ecosystem saw annual gross payment volume (GPV) skyrocket from $6.5 billion to $106.2 billion. In 2021 GPV is on track for north of $130 billion which is primarily a result of bigger merchants (as measured by annualized GPV) utilizing the platform.

While the seller ecosystem should remain a steady growth driver for Square the true gem for the company is digital peer-to-peer payments platform Cash App. Cash App has consistently been the most downloaded payment solution in the U.S. for the past two years. Furthermore monthly active users have more than quintupled since the end of 2017 from 7 million to 36 million.

The great thing about Cash App is that it gives Square a number of ways to generate revenue. On top of merchant fees it can collect transfer fees to and from bank accounts as well as investment fees/commissions. This includes the trading and exchange of the world's largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. By 2040 Cash App may well be the leading financial services app.

(NASDAQ:PPBI) Looks Like A Good Stock And It's Going Ex-Dividend Soon,"Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St which is why it's exciting to see Pacific Premier Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:PPBI) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore if you purchase Pacific Premier Bancorp's shares on or after the 5th of August you won't be eligible to receive the dividend when it is paid on the 13th of August.

The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.33 per share. Last year in total the company distributed US$1.32 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments Pacific Premier Bancorp has a trailing yield of 3.5% on the current stock price of $37.98. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable and if the company is growing.

See our latest analysis for Pacific Premier Bancorp

If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Pacific Premier Bancorp paid out a comfortable 39% of its profit last year.

Generally speaking the lower a company's payout ratios the more resilient its dividend usually is.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Pacific Premier Bancorp has grown its earnings rapidly up 21% a year for the past five years.

Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Pacific Premier Bancorp has delivered an average of 14% per year annual increase in its dividend based on the past three years of dividend payments. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.

The Bottom Line

Is Pacific Premier Bancorp worth buying for its dividend? Companies like Pacific Premier Bancorp that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares. Overall Pacific Premier Bancorp looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis and we think it would be worth investigating further.

While it's tempting to invest in Pacific Premier Bancorp for the dividends alone you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example Pacific Premier Bancorp has 2 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about.

We wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see though. Here's a list of interesting dividend stocks with a greater than 2% yield and an upcoming dividend.

The popular investment firm sold 63643 shares estimated to be worth about $43.7 million in the Elon Musk-led company on a day Wood said Tesla will follow Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in capturing the lion's share of the sector's profits.

Wood compared Tesla with Apple in an interview with RealVision and suggested a huge inefficiency in analyst research behind Tesla as reported by Markets Insider.

“We believe that the reason there's such a big inefficiency in Tesla's valuation is the short-term time horizon of analysts and the wrong analysts following it” Woods said as per the report.

Later this month the streamer is set to launch the much anticipated dark fantasy The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf. Produced by The Witcher executive producer and showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich the animated spin-off film serves as an origins story for Geralt’s mentor and fellow witcher Vesemir.

Around the middle of August John David Washington’s new thriller Beckett which also stars Tomb Raider and The Green Knight actress Alicia Vikander will bow. The film follows an American vacationing in Greece (Washington) who must fight his way to the U.S. embassy to clear his name after becoming the target of a manhunt and ensnared in a dangerous political conspiracy following a devastating accident.

Two anticipated young adult films will also hit Netflix in August including the contemporary and gender-swapped She’s All That remake He’s All That which features real-life influencer Addison Rae as an on-screen teen influencer who attempts to turn a high school misfit played by Tanner Buchanan into prom king. The second is The Kissing Booth 3 the long-awaited conclusion to the Netflix hit trilogy which stars Joey King Jacob Elordi and Joel Courtney.

Among the other film titles dropping on the streamer this month are two Leonardo DiCaprio-led films — Christopher Nolan’s Inception and Steven Spielberg’s Catch Me If You Can — alongside ’80s classic Ferris Bueller’s Day Off; Oscar-winning Seabiscuit; the Clint Eastwood Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland starrer Space Cowboys; coming of age drama My Girl and its sequel My Girl 2; and puppet comedy Team America: World Police.

On the TV front Sandra Oh stars in the upcoming comedy-drama series The Chair which follows Dr. Ji-Yoon Kim (Oh) as she navigates her new role as the chair of the English department — and one of the few women and people of color — at Pembroke University. The show is written by Amanda Peet who co-wrote the pilot with Annie Julia Wyman and is executive produced by Peet alongside Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.

Other notable TV releases include the fifth season of the DreamWorks animated series Fast & Furious Spy Racers; the premieres of Paris Hilton‘s Cooking With Paris and Bake Squad a dessert competition series from Milk Bar founder Christina Tosi; as well as oldies but goodies like all five seasons of fan-favorite Friday Night Lights and all seven seasons of the Tina Fey- and Alec Baldwin-led NBC comedy 30 Rock.

To assist on this cinematic journey IndieWire runs a monthly series that highlights movies and television shows worth streaming on every major platform in the U.S. including Netflix. But as an extension of that popular ongoing series we’ve also curated lists of films that specifically tell Black stories and are streaming on those same major streaming platforms.

Among August’s offerings on Netflix: several feature directorial debuts including Stefon Bristol’s time-travel adventure “See You Yesterday” (produced by Spike Lee) and Gerard McMurray’s fraternity hazing drama “Burning Sands” as well as actors David Oyelowo (“The Water Man”) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (“The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind”). Also featured are two pre-“Black Panther” Chadwick Boseman performances John David Washngton’s “Tenet” and “Malcom & Marie” follow-up a pre-“I May Destroy You” Michaela Coel musical-romance and more.

The inter-circuit reading festival followed the inter-schools reading contest during which winning schools were selected from the four GES circuits to compete at that level.

Mr Benjamin Cudjoe Birim Central Municipal Director of GES advised students to make good use of the many instructional hours at their disposal as well as spend time exploring library resources.

He said doing frequent research at the library would enhance their academic performance and encouraged school children in the area to patronise the Akim Oda library.

The library was given an award and now boast of facilities such as a computer laboratory.

The maiden reading festival 2021 brought together a number of schools from the four circuits comprising Lower and Upper Primary and Junior High Schools (JHS).

They were Akim Oda Anglican Primary Aboabo Salvation Army Basic School Akim Oda Wesley Methodist School St. Anthony Basic School ODASCO Experimental Primary School El – Shadai Primary and Akim Oda Freeman Methodist School.

The participants were tested on reading spelling pronunciation and current affairs.

During the finale El-Shadai Primary School emerged as the winner for the Lower primary with 25 points while ODASCO Experimental Primary School won with 47 points for the Upper Primary and Akim Oda Wesley Methodist School topping with 45 points for the JHS category.

They were given reading books certificates and plaques while the rest of the schools took away certificates of participation.

Mr Evans Korletey- Tene Eastern Regional Director of GhLA said the Authority and Newmont Ghana have a partnership to boost reading among children in Akim Oda.

They also have a project termed Newmont Gold-4-Gold Literacy Programme which involves reading.

He urged all and sundry to patronise the Ghana Library app a digital library app that enhances accessibility to library services.

He said after the app had been downloaded on the phone it does not attract any data charges and could be used for free.

Telecommunication networks MTN and Vodafone were applauded for making the app free from charges for users.

Master Graham Darko a form three student of Oda Wesley Methodist School showed appreciation to GES and GhLA for the competition and advised his fellow students to read everyday to expand their knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Alan Jones previously one of the media giant’s most bankable stars was according to the Murdoch enterprise’s own actions both a man with a diminishing connection to his audience and a star whose light still burns bright.

The company took the axe to Jones’s column in Sydney’s Daily Telegraph – apparently because it did not “resonate” with readers – then lauded the broadcaster as a “compelling voice” with a big audience on Sky and a well-read column in the Australian. So a zero and a hero it seems.

“The decision to no longer publish Alan Jones’s column in The Daily Telegraph was made by its editor Ben English based on the impact the column was having on the Telegraph’s objective to build its audience” a spokesman for News Corp told Guardian Australia.

“Decisions about what to publish in News Corp mastheads is the responsibility of the editor. These decisions should not be confused with the company’s corporate position or in this case a signal that News Corp Australia no longer supports Alan.

“Alan is one of Australia’s most accomplished broadcasters; his show on Sky News is achieving strong success and he has a widely read column in The Australian.

“He is a compelling voice that has long represented the values of many Australians and his relationship with News Corp remains strong.”

When news broke that Jones had been dumped there was immediate speculation about the future of his 8pm weeknight show on Sky News which has just clocked up 12 months on air.

1:43 NSW health minister Brad Hazzard criticises Alan Jones’s commentary on Covid-19 – video

When Jones appeared to tone down his anti-lockdown rhetoric on air the next day denying that he had encouraged protesters it fuelled a perception he was on the nose with Murdoch executives.

His final Telegraph column last week criticised Australia’s response to Covid-19 which he argues is no worse than the flu for healthy people. Had he gone too far even for News Corp?

Jones had attacked the New South Wales chief health officer Kerry Chant calling her “dumb” and “out of touch”. “How many villages are missing their idiot?” he said.

He had also defended the Sydney protesters and in reference to a 38-year-old woman who died in Sydney on Sunday said it was “highly unlikely” she had died of Covid-19.

Jones has since taken to the air to deny being an anti-vaxxer or encouraging illegal anti-lockdown protesters in an emotional broadcast.

And he is not going anywhere. He kept his sport column in the Australian and New Corp’s Holt Street headquarters praised him as someone “who has long represented the values many Australians”.

The defining hire of Sky New Australia chief executive Paul Whittaker’s tenure Jones has not set the TV world on fire and has flagged publicly his desire to go back to radio. He has been unable to replicate the success he enjoyed as Sydney’s No 1 breakfast radio presenter over several decades.

At Sky his ratings are below those of Andrew Bolt and Peta Credlin even though he was hired to be the station’s flagship presenter. This week he bounced between a high of 61000 on Monday and a low of 39000 on Wednesday.

But Sky’s business model does not rely solely on the ratings for its Foxtel channel.

Wounded after he was dumped by the Telegraph Jones said he resonated with people online and had the figures to prove it.

“Well thankfully we live in the world of social media” Jones told his audience after English said his columns didn’t “resonate” with readers. “I am staggered by the reach.”

The reach of the rightwing pundits on Sky is staggering and expanding.

Already boasting a reach of 9.1 million viewers each month across Sky News on Foxtel YouTube Facebook and other online platforms on Sunday a new channel Sky News Regional will launch across free-to-air stations in regional Australia.

The Murdoch-owned broadcaster might be celebrating 25 years as Australia’s first 24-hour news channel but it’s outside the linear channel that the video content Sky pumps out daily is enjoying extraordinary growth.

View image in fullscreen A Sky News breakdown of its audience

Sky’s YouTube channel has grown in two years from 70000 subscribers to 1.85 million which is higher than ABC News or any other local media company.

One of the most popular videos with 4.6m views is Jones’s “Australians must know the truth – this virus is not a pandemic” which was posted at the height of the pandemic last year.

“I’ve done a piece on Biden President Biden that’s gone around the world” Jones boasted this week. “I’ve had emails from Israel. The views so far total 2.8m and 34000 comments.”

In the 2020-21 financial year according to Sky’s figures for potential advertisers its videos were seen 1.3bn times. The more extreme the video the more popular it is on YouTube or Facebook in particular those critical of Joe Biden’s cognition or China’s role in the pandemic.

The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi says anti-lockdown videos have been a dangerous influence during the pandemic.

“Various Sky News presenters have taken a conscious decision to politicise and undermine widely-accepted public health measures in order to exacerbate community frustrations” Faruqi told Guardian Australia.

“It’s no surprise that after weeks of this sort of rubbish we saw thousands of people out on the streets last Saturday.

Jones is an incredibly skilled broadcaster whether you agree with his point of view or not Tim Burrowes media commentator

“These frankly dangerous messages are being shared not only to a TV audience but to a much bigger audience on YouTube as well.

“Sky News’ indulgence of far-right conspiracy theories and Covid-scepticism has gone on for far too long. It has to be called out.”

A tally of views on Sky News clips posted to YouTube between 18 and 23 July leading up to the 24 July anti-lockdown rallies found more than 1m views of 22 clips including explicitly anti-lockdown or lockdown-sceptical sentiments.

According to Sky’s own advertising sales pitch only a quarter of its audience is now on Foxtel. The majority is across YouTube Facebook News Corp websites skynews.com.au free-to-air TV and Twitter.

“Sky News Australia is now reaching more than a third of the Australian population with an average monthly audience of 9.1 million Australians across its extensive portfolio of media assets” Sky’s commercial director Cathryn Adams told advertisers.

Sky News Regional will be available on two regional broadcasters after Sky signed a new deal: Southern Cross Australia across Victoria southern New South Wales and Queensland and on Win in northern NSW Griffith and South Australia.

“We’ve listened to our regional audiences and adjusted the programming schedule to reflect their feedback which includes our new live breakfast program Sky News Breakfast the return and live broadcast of The Bolt Report plus more of Paul Murray Live and the continuation of its regional Our Town series which puts a spotlight on a different regional town each month” Whittaker said before the launch.

The media commentator Tim Burrowes whose book Media Unmade examines the upheaval in Australian media during the last decade says Sky has evolved from a “straight news service and an advertising-safe environment” to a “subscription model which has identified an audience to the right side of the political spectrum”.

Burrowes wonders if the Telegraph terminated Jones because it was worried it might be targeted by the successful social media campaigns run by the activists Sleeping Giants and MFW which led to advertisers deserting 2GB and Sky.

Jones has been in the headlines this month for what his radio rival Ray Hadley calls his “ridiculous stance” against the Sydney lockdown.

Sky was also forced to remove a video in which Jones and the federal MP Craig Kelly presented inaccurate information about vaccination safety.

“I think the question for me is Jones is an incredibly skilled broadcaster whether you agree with his point of view or not” Burrowes told Guardian Australia. “He makes an argument well and he makes it entertainingly. So surely he must be an asset.”

“One of the things that gives presenters influence is the fact that even if you have a relatively small audience politicians take them seriously and politicians also perceive them to be influential.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vdXRsb29rLzIwMjEvMDgvMDEvaXMtZm94LW5ld3MtYmxhbWUtYW1lcmljYW4tcmFnZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Perspective | Is Fox News to blame for American rage?,A good rule of thumb for discerning readers: Take Kevin Drum seriously.

When news broke that Jones had been dumped there was immediate speculation about the future of his 8pm weeknight show on Sky News which has just clocked up 12 months on air.

When Jones appeared to tone down his anti-lockdown rhetoric on air the next day denying that he had encouraged protesters it fuelled a perception he was on the nose with Murdoch executives.

His final Telegraph column last week criticised Australia’s response to Covid-19 which he argues is no worse than the flu for healthy people. Had he gone too far even for News Corp?

Jones had attacked the New South Wales chief health officer Kerry Chant calling her “dumb” and “out of touch”. “How many villages are missing their idiot?” he said.

He had also defended the Sydney protesters and in reference to a 38-year-old woman who died in Sydney on Sunday said it was “highly unlikely” she had died of Covid-19.

Jones has since taken to the air to deny being an anti-vaxxer or encouraging illegal anti-lockdown protesters in an emotional broadcast.

And he is not going anywhere. He kept his sport column in the Australian and New Corp’s Holt Street headquarters praised him as someone “who has long represented the values many Australians”.

The defining hire of Sky New Australia chief executive Paul Whittaker’s tenure Jones has not set the TV world on fire and has flagged publicly his desire to go back to radio. He has been unable to replicate the success he enjoyed as Sydney’s No 1 breakfast radio presenter over several decades.

At Sky his ratings are below those of Andrew Bolt and Peta Credlin even though he was hired to be the station’s flagship presenter. This week he bounced between a high of 61000 on Monday and a low of 39000 on Wednesday.

But Sky’s business model does not rely solely on the ratings for its Foxtel channel.

Wounded after he was dumped by the Telegraph Jones said he resonated with people online and had the figures to prove it.

“Well thankfully we live in the world of social media” Jones told his audience after English said his columns didn’t “resonate” with readers. “I am staggered by the reach.”

The reach of the rightwing pundits on Sky is staggering and expanding.

Already boasting a reach of 9.1 million viewers each month across Sky News on Foxtel YouTube Facebook and other online platforms on Sunday a new channel Sky News Regional will launch across free-to-air stations in regional Australia.

The Murdoch-owned broadcaster might be celebrating 25 years as Australia’s first 24-hour news channel but it’s outside the linear channel that the video content Sky pumps out daily is enjoying extraordinary growth.

Sky’s YouTube channel has grown in two years from 70000 subscribers to 1.85 million which is higher than ABC News or any other local media company.

One of the most popular videos with 4.6m views is Jones’s “Australians must know the truth – this virus is not a pandemic” which was posted at the height of the pandemic last year.

“I’ve done a piece on Biden President Biden that’s gone around the world” Jones boasted this week. “I’ve had emails from Israel. The views so far total 2.8m and 34000 comments.”

In the 2020-21 financial year according to Sky’s figures for potential advertisers its videos were seen 1.3bn times. The more extreme the video the more popular it is on YouTube or Facebook in particular those critical of Joe Biden’s cognition or China’s role in the pandemic.

The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi says anti-lockdown videos have been a dangerous influence during the pandemic.

“Various Sky News presenters have taken a conscious decision to politicise and undermine widely-accepted public health measures in order to exacerbate community frustrations” Faruqi told Guardian Australia.

“It’s no surprise that after weeks of this sort of rubbish we saw thousands of people out on the streets last Saturday.

Jones is an incredibly skilled broadcaster whether you agree with his point of view or not Tim Burrowes media commentator

“These frankly dangerous messages are being shared not only to a TV audience but to a much bigger audience on YouTube as well.

“Sky News’ indulgence of far-right conspiracy theories and Covid-scepticism has gone on for far too long. It has to be called out.”

A tally of views on Sky News clips posted to YouTube between 18 and 23 July leading up to the 24 July anti-lockdown rallies found more than 1m views of 22 clips including explicitly anti-lockdown or lockdown-sceptical sentiments.

According to Sky’s own advertising sales pitch only a quarter of its audience is now on Foxtel. The majority is across YouTube Facebook News Corp websites skynews.com.au free-to-air TV and Twitter.

“Sky News Australia is now reaching more than a third of the Australian population with an average monthly audience of 9.1 million Australians across its extensive portfolio of media assets” Sky’s commercial director Cathryn Adams told advertisers.

Sky News Regional will be available on two regional broadcasters after Sky signed a new deal: Southern Cross Australia across Victoria southern New South Wales and Queensland and on Win in northern NSW Griffith and South Australia.

“We’ve listened to our regional audiences and adjusted the programming schedule to reflect their feedback which includes our new live breakfast program Sky News Breakfast the return and live broadcast of The Bolt Report plus more of Paul Murray Live and the continuation of its regional Our Town series which puts a spotlight on a different regional town each month” Whittaker said before the launch.

The media commentator Tim Burrowes whose book Media Unmade examines the upheaval in Australian media during the last decade says Sky has evolved from a “straight news service and an advertising-safe environment” to a “subscription model which has identified an audience to the right side of the political spectrum”.

Burrowes wonders if the Telegraph terminated Jones because it was worried it might be targeted by the successful social media campaigns run by the activists Sleeping Giants and MFW which led to advertisers deserting 2GB and Sky.

Jones has been in the headlines this month for what his radio rival Ray Hadley calls his “ridiculous stance” against the Sydney lockdown.

Sky was also forced to remove a video in which Jones and the federal MP Craig Kelly presented inaccurate information about vaccination safety.

“I think the question for me is Jones is an incredibly skilled broadcaster whether you agree with his point of view or not” Burrowes told Guardian Australia. “He makes an argument well and he makes it entertainingly. So surely he must be an asset.”

Las Vegas Review-Journal via AP

A few miles off a Nevada state highway west of Las Vegas about 10 miles south of Pahrump lies a 3000-acre solar farm under development.

As you approach bundles of metal fencing are prepped to soon become 10 miles of temporary desert tortoise exclusion fencing.

A team of biologists relocated 139 tortoises from their habitat to make way for the solar panels in the Yellow Pine Solar Project one of four large solar energy developments initiated in Southern Nevada.

The tortoises were moved across state Route 160 to Stump Springs in May.

In a span of a few weeks 30 tortoises were killed possibly by badgers. Conservationists believe relocation stress made the reptiles vulnerable and drought caused badgers to look for new sources of prey.

Wildlife experts are still looking into the exact cause.

The loss of the tortoises a threatened species in Nevada since 1990 illustrates the challenges of bringing alternative energy sources to the Mojave Desert while still protecting its biodiversity.

Conservationists say the state should modify desert relocation protocols under the current drought. Laura Cunningham biologist and co-founder of Basin and Range Watch said the tortoises get lost and confused when moved from their home range.

""We're not even surprised that badgers discovered these tortoises"" Cunningham told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ""When you move them to a different area they tend to start wandering around and try to get back to their home range and that's when they're taken by predators.""

Cunningham founded the nonprofit Basin and Range Watch with partner Kevin Emmerich 12 years ago. They were field biologists for state and federal wildlife agencies before shifting their work to help conserve the deserts of Nevada and California while advocating for sustainable renewable energy alternatives.

Both are concerned about the large solar project and its impact on the desert landscape.

""During the drought there are less rodents less lizards and so they (predators) are going after everything. And so we think this was predictable enough that it shouldn't have been done especially during a drought"" said Cunningham.

Steven Stengel a representative of NextEra Energy Resources declined immediate comment.

The solar project

Through the Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act the federal government is incentivizing wind solar and geothermal energy developments on public lands.

In November 2020 the Bureau of Land Management accepted the Yellow Pine Solar Project application developed by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources. The project is expected to generate 500 megawatts of electricity using photovoltaic solar panels enough for up to 100000 households by the end of 2022.

The solar arrays absorb energy from the sun and generate electricity which is stored in a lithium-ion-based battery gathered by an internal electrical collection system and transformed to transmission voltage before reaching homes.

The developers say the solar farm will provide 300 construction jobs and approximately $23 million in additional tax revenue for Clark County within a decade.

Before development the company first surveyed wildlife vegetation cultural and tribal resources and endangered species. BLM then issued a right-of-way in January 2021 granting the developers approval to begin clearing the area of tortoises and putting up fencing to keep the tortoises from reentering the project site.

Tortoise migration

There are strict guidelines and standardized protocols in place set by the Fish and Wildlife Service for each phase of handling the tortoises to mitigate risks and prevent further endangering the species.

The desert tortoise has been listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act because of population decline due to predation collection by humans off-highway vehicles and upper respiratory tract disease.

In addition urban developments agriculture road construction and military activities have fragmented tortoise habitats reducing the tortoise population below the level necessary to maintain a minimum viable population.

After 30 years of study Todd Esque a U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist said data shows the populations are ""not quite stable.""

""We knew when they got listed that it would take decades to get them turned around"" he said. ""But we have to be able to do all the things that that requires to turn them around; you can't just wish they would start repopulating.""

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service monitors tortoise populations in designated conservation areas throughout a range including Southern Nevada Southern California southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona.

However tortoises outside designated conservation areas are not monitored and mostly inhabit land renewable energy developers are interested in.

During the survey the number of adults juveniles and hatchlings is counted in three areas by qualified consultants: the project area the relocation area and a reference site in a conservation area.

Consultants check the health status of the tortoises in the project and relocation site to prevent disease spread and finally the relocated tortoises are paired with a tracking device. The developers report back to both BLM and state wildlife officials throughout the process.

Despite mitigation measures within weeks of relocating the tortoises from the project site to their new home in Stump Springs dozens died.

""I think most of those were thought to be from or had signs of badger predation"" said Roy Averill-Murray Fish and Wildlife Service desert tortoise recovery coordinator. ""Others could have also included a small handful of other natural causes but it seemed to be mostly this kind of localized focus badger attention on the translocated tortoises.""

The tortoise deaths from badgers accounted for roughly one-third of the relocated adults. No more deaths have been reported since mid-July.

Badgers aren't typically known to prey on desert tortoises. Instead their main prey is desert rodents but they are also known to eat ground-nesting birds lizards and insects.

They also aren't the only desert animals with a history of switching prey.

Other tortoise relocation

Esque and Averill-Murray were part of a 2008 study that looked into the relocation of 2000 tortoises from Fort Irwin in Southern California where hundreds of square kilometers of habitat were cleared for Army tank training.

In their research 600 tortoises were radioed from three subpopulations: one group nowhere near any of the animals that got moved one group living in the area where the tortoises got moved and the group that got moved.

Coyotes attacked all three tortoise populations near the area. According to Esque it's difficult for a coyote to eat tortoises because they require more energy to eat than the rabbits that coyotes typically prey on. But during drought if rabbits die out coyotes will resort to eating tortoises which is what happened in Fort Irwin.

""So the story was not that there's one thing happened and they moved tortoises and they all got whacked"" said Esque. ""It's that the whole desert ... there are patches where it's a higher risk to be a tortoise when you're near a town. And that's the bad news. For tortoises it was much bigger (risk) than just an incident of moving the tortoises in one time.""

For their Fort Irwin study it was not the act of translocating tortoises that led to their death but how much more residential areas are blending into wildlife where many predators reside. It was difficult to compare badgers and coyotes changing their prey toward tortoises.

""If it was related to the drought why aren't coyotes eating tortoises in Stump Springs?"" said Averill-Murray. ""It's just very strange and it's not quite as simple as 'Oh it's drought and the predators automatically eat translocated tortoises. Or translocated tortoises are more susceptible to being eaten by predators in a drought.' It's just that has not been the case over the last 10-15 years.""

Tortoise versus solar

Cunningham and Emmerich propose that developers instead build solar arrays on the tops of parking garages or push back the development of solar projects when there isn't an extreme drought.

""We're asking the tortoise to make a sacrifice here for climate change. Maybe we the people in the city and towns should really try to conserve more and make our structures more energy-efficient and less wasteful"" said Cunningham.

Developers of the Yellow Pine Solar Project need to finish setting up the tortoise exclusion fence before moving on to the next stage of development later this year.

For now they are responsible for keeping track of all three populations of the desert tortoise for a year. After that according to Averill-Murray the developers will hand off the project to the Fish and Wildlife Service which will most likely contract out the U.S. Geological Survey to continue monitoring the tortoises.

""BLM is having them (developers) pay a fee to support monitoring into the future. I think it's a $1 amount per acre that they're ... putting into a bank account that will support the future monitoring down the line"" he said.

The Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service partnering with the U.S. Geological Survey allows for the long-term monitoring of translocated desert tortoises to inform future mitigation protocols.

""Judging by the number of applications we have for solar plants basically the next area will be between Las Vegas and Beatty Nevada -- a giant flat valley up there that's all perfect for solar"" said Esque.

""But that's also one of the few north-south corridors for desert tortoises to respond to climate change if they need to if we can think in those terms which is really long terms"" he said. ""So what should the strategy be for that? Not just for our backyard here but the whole range of desert tortoises.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Get after it with local recommendations just for you. Discover nearby events routes out your door and hidden gems when you sign up for the Local Running Drop.

There’s a lot of hype around running shoe features: foam that can improve running economy by a certain percent carbon-plated midsoles that stabilize your foot and provide spring upward-curving toe structures that facilitate forward motion. No matter what a shoe claims it can do the only feature you should really be concerned about is whether or not you actually notice it on your foot while you’re running. The best shoes are the ones you never feel or think about.

I happen to spend a lot of time thinking about what’s on my feet while I run mostly because it’s part of my job to review running shoes (I know tough gig). My sneaker collection is almost embarrassing and I tend to rotate my shoes nearly every run. In April I added one more: the new Nike Pegasus 38 a shoe the brand calls a “workhorse with wings.” To put it to the test I decided to wear it (almost exclusively) while training to run a 5K time trial.

RELATED:

Full disclosure: I haven’t been a superfan of previous Pegasus iterations. I experienced shin splints while training in what may have been the 33 and my calves were almost always sore after running in the Pegasus 37. I generally lean more towards cushioned shoes like the Nike React Infinity Run and the Tempo NEXT%.

In theory the Pegasus combines my favorite aspects of both of those: the same React midsole that allows me to run long and steady in the Infinity Runs and a Zoom Air unit in the forefoot that gives me that extra bounce I’m used to in the Tempo NEXT%. But can you really run a PR in a workhorse shoe?

I trained for about a month in the Pegs wearing them for everything from short recovery runs to speed workouts (think: 5- 4- 3- 2- 1-minute progression ladders or alternating 2 minutes on/2 minutes off) and long runs up to 10 miles.

RELATED: Three Next-Level Interval Workouts to Add to Your Weekly Routine

What I liked most about the updated Pegasus was the wider forefoot which allowed for more space for my toes and helped me feel like I had a better grip on the ground during speedier intervals. I also liked how stable I felt compared to Nike’s faster shoes like the Alphafly or the older Zoom Fly 3 but I never felt like I was carrying around any extra heft you might feel in a stability shoe.

The Pegasus 38 uses an improved midfoot system with more React foam than the 37th iteration had which helps give you that stable ride. And the webbed lacing system provides a more personalized fit with extra foam on the tongue to avoid placing unnecessary pressure on the top of your foot. Together these features make for a secure fit that’s still breathable and flexible.

I personally prefer a more cushioned shoe with a higher stack height (think the NEXT% 2) but the React foam in the Peg is lightweight and springy enough that I was still able to tap into some serious speed (for me!) during interval training. And I could really feel that pop from the Zoom Air unit in the forefoot especially as I tend to hit more on my forefoot the faster I go. But they still felt plush during up to 10 miles of easy running; I didn’t develop a single blister or hot spot over the course of a month.

RELATED:

On race day I clocked a 22-second PR—and didn’t once think about my feet. I actually wore compression sleeves on my calves just in case but there was no soreness or pain in my lower legs. Of course a PR is never just about the shoes. I trained hard for a month I lucked out with weather conditions and I had a friend help pace me. But running shoes can make or break a race and this time I’m happy to say they made it.

How Nike’s controversial Vaporfly line redefined running,"“Fast” is the word that Rachel Bull senior footwear product director at Nike Running uses to describe the company’s Vaporfly series of running shoes.

As word choices go “fast” doesn’t seem particularly inspired. It’s safe to say that it’s not exactly going to have scholars scratching their heads over due to its ambiguity. Saying that running shoes are fast is a bit like saying that the key to Serena Williams’ success on the court is playing tennis really well.

But the more you delve into Vaporfly the next-generation high-tech running shoe technology that made its debut half a decade ago there really can be no other description.

Vaporfly was the technology that first allowed an athlete to run a marathon in under two hours. A Google auto-complete search for Vaporfly also brings up the words “banned” and “controversial.” Ross Tucker a sports scientist wrote a blog in which he argued that the shoe technology disrupted not the sport of running but the meaning of running. “It broke the principle” Tucker wrote. “The premise is that running ‘natural’ as it is should not be decided by who wears the best shoe but by who has the optimal combination of physiology psychology and tactics.”

Not too many running shoes are accused of fundamentally tearing open a rift in the space-time fabric of the sport they’re designed to be used for.

The footwear economy

“Originally Vaporfly was created in an effort to give athletes improved running economy through footwear” Nike’s Rachel Bull told Digital Trends. “Our initial muse was our elite marathon runners and specifically Eliud Kipchoge’s quest to become the first to break the two-hour marathon barrier. But then [we] unveiled a completely new approach to footwear design a synergy between sport science engineering and athlete which defined an industry-leading approach to improving running economy. That technology our NEXT% platform has now informed several models across our portfolio and is available to runners of all levels: Whether you’re trying to break two hours three hours or four hours in the marathon — or simply want to reach a little further.”

Before Vaporfly shoes came along Bull said racing flats were the shoe of choice for elite marathoners. “We challenged ourselves with revisiting the system altogether to offer athletes the right weight of a shoe [which is] not necessarily the lightest weight” she noted.

In the place of these flat-soled designs Vaporfly employs a chunky heeled design that looks a bit like wearers are sprinting in wedges. However while that might not sound like the most aerodynamic choice this “radical and iconic aesthetic” shift turns out to be stunningly effective: The first Vaporfly model shoes improved running economy (how much energy it takes to travel a particular distance) by 4%. In a field where a single percentage point increase in running economy is like reinventing the wheel that’s an enormous leap forward.

What causes the massive improvement isn’t totally clear-cut (or at least it’s a secret sauce that Nike doesn’t spread around) although it has something to do with a combination of foam in the midsole and a carbon fiber plate that’s sandwiched inside the shoes. This design allows for the return of approximately 80% of the energy from every strike of the runner’s foot on the ground.

Technology doping?

At this Olympics Games Vaporfly will make an appearance continuing Nike’s notable appearance at the world-famous sporting event. It very nearly didn’t however. Accused of being an example of technology doping giving an unfair advantage to athletes who wore them Vaporfly was almost banned entirely from Tokyo 2020. In the end World Athletics placed an indefinite ban on shoes with a sole thicker than 40mm which includes the original Eliud Kipchoge Nike ZoomX Vaporfly 4% shoes. However the shoe-tech is nonetheless represented at the Tokyo Games — albeit in a modified version. In a statement Nike said that it respects “the spirit of the rules and we do not create any running shoes that return more energy than the runner expends.”

“Serving all athletes will always be our focus and leading with innovation is what Nike has always done” said Bull. “We will continue to create new and better solutions for training and competing. All of the road [and] track and field shoes that Nike athletes will be competing in in Tokyo abide by the guidelines set forth by World Athletics including [the new] ZoomX Vaporfly NEXT% 2.”

Ah yes: The Vaporfly NEXT% 2 also known as the next generation of Vaporfly footwear — complete with added innovations like the breathable mesh material that helps feet keep cool during races pockets of padding for reducing lace pressure and more.

“With this model we fine-tuned several key features to provide a more comfortable and durable running experience while continuing to deliver the energy return we know runners trust and want from this shoe” Bull said.

See you at the finish line — provided such things will continue to exist in a world in which the meaning of running has been perhaps permanently disrupted.

After its Olympic debut the mask got a lot of recognition from fans who took to social media to compare the mask to everything from Batman villain Bane to Hannibal Lecter and characters from Mortal Kombat. Although the mask looks heavy-duty it is designed for optimal airflow and offers slightly less protection than a regular N95.

There's yet no official release date tied to the Nike Venturer mask but it is set to be available to the public soon. The mask will retail at $60 and is machine washable and reusable."

Occasionally lessons can come barreling in at more than 100 miles per hour and weighing over half a million pounds.

This is the case with the Norfolk & Western Class J 611 locomotive. The 71-year-old engine is in the middle of a monthslong residency at the Strasburg Rail Road where train enthusiasts and fans can pore over all facets of this classic vehicle from rides to tours. You can even blow the whistle.

A wide range of tours and events are planned at Strasburg Rail Road through Oct. 3.

“This represents when America did stuff not just the junk it makes today” says Scott Lindsey chief mechanical officer of the 611. “Everyone's impressed with an iPhone — this is impressive stuff. Using brain power and experience. Steam built the country and then diesel came and put steam out of business all in the name of progress.”

This is actually the 611’s second residency at Strasburg Rail Road having first made an appearance in 2019. What was true then is true now: With the 611 in Strasburg the railroad can lay claim to featuring the last two operational Norfolk & Western engines in the world. The 611 joins the 475 a steam locomotive built in 1906 and owned by Strasburg Rail Road.

611 history

The 611 was built in 1950 right at the end of the great steam experiment in the United States. Throughout the ’50s the 611 transported passenger trains between Norfolk and Cincinnati and could scale the Blue Ridge Mountains with ease.

In its first nine years on rail the 611 notched 1 million miles of travel.

“It’s not like today where when you have so many miles cycles or hours you throw it out and buy a new one"" Lindsey says. “There are components on here that never wear out short of freeze damage or accident and you rebuild it and keep it running. They can run forever with the proper care.”

After its initial decade-long lifespan the 611 went where many old locomotives and trains go when they’re not in motion — to a public park where kids and families can admire it. From 1963 to 1981 it sat in a park in Roanoke Virginia. In 1982 Robert Clayton the first chairman of the newly formed Norfolk Southern Corporation sent the 611 to Birmingham Alabama for restoration.

For the next 12 years the 611 served as a public relations tool traveling everywhere from Jacksonville Florida to Buffalo New York usually with hundreds of people along for the ride.

Strasburg Rail Road trainmaster Ryan Merrill says visitors from as far as Australia Japan Germany and Switzerland have already come to marvel at the steam behemoth.

“These engines are from a time when you could legitimately set your watch to them showing up on time” Merrill says.

The 611 locomotive is just as powerful and awe-inspiring today as it was in 1950 but the allure has only grown over the years as steam-powered engines become a fainter memory in the public consciousness.

Lindsey who has stood faithfully with the 611 each stop of the way since 1982 agrees.

“It’s very important to keep this kind of technology in front of people to observe and enjoy and hopefully create a new generation of fans to ride behind it or operate the locomotive” Lindsey says. “Otherwise it’s just a cold piece of steel.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvY29yb25hdmlydXMtcHVibGl4LWVtcGxveWVlcy1tdXN0LXdlYXItbWFza3MtYWdhaW4tc3RhcnRpbmctbW9uZGF5L2FydGljbGVfNzExY2M4MjMtNjk1ZS01MzVmLWEwYWQtNTFlOGJhZDMwMmYxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coronavirus: Publix employees must wear masks again starting Monday,"Memphis TN (38111)

See the Junior Geek of the Month archive for more.

As a child growing up in Portland Ore. Luna Abadía was always curious about the nature around her. She carried a journal with her that she called her “book of questions” and filled it with observations of her world.

What happens when we sneeze? She wrote. Why is my dog’s nose wet?

She’s not sure if she ever answered all of her questions but it instilled in her an interest in science and etymology.

But as she went through school and learned about the realities of climate change she was overwhelmed by a “sense of hopelessness” and fear of what the world would look like as she got older.

She said she had many breakdowns over the uncertainty but now after finding a way to make change she channels her fear into action.

“Climate action isn’t necessarily like a sacrifice or debilitating” Abadía said. “I think it’s more of an investment for my future. It definitely impacts me but also I don’t have mental breakdowns anymore. I learned to channel that fear into a sense of action and motivation. That’s what’s gotten me through and helped me deal with the immensity of this issue.”

Abadía 17 is the founder of the Effective Climate Action Project a youth-led environmental organization focused on promoting systemic solutions to climate change.

Abadía is GeekWire’s Junior Geek of the Month for July. The monthly honor presented by Northern Trust recognizes talented young scholars innovators creators and entrepreneurs in the Pacific Northwest.

A large part of Abadía’s work at the Effective Climate Action Project is facilitating climate simulation workshops. It also helps promote youth engagement and shares information on actionable steps to address climate change.

The Project uses two computer models designed by MIT and Climate Interactive that allow participants to input different policy solutions to climate change like promoting forestation or eliminating fossil fuels. The simulations allow not only young people but also business leaders participating to see the outcomes of each of these solutions.

Abadía founded the Project last summer when the world was reeling from COVID-19. After a year Abadía is still seeing the effects of climate change happening in the Pacific Northwest. She mentioned the recent heat wave wildfires and poor air quality bringing climate change to the front of people’s minds.

Over the past year the Effective Climate Action Project has hosted 16 workshops for about 150 people. Now Abadía said her foundation is opening a global internship program to train young people on educating others about climate change and leading simulations.

Abadía was one of the winners of T-Mobile’s Changemaker Challenge. Her team won $5000 in seed money and a trip to Bellevue Wash. for t​​he Changemaker Lab to develop action plans.

In the long term Abadía sees her organization expanding its social media outreach. She said she hopes to help people learn to balance individual and collective climate action. She also hopes to provide school teachers with curriculum guidance on teaching about climate change.

But Abadía is still a high school senior concerned with applying for colleges. She hopes to establish a mentorship program through the Effective Climate Action Project to pass it down to more youth.

Abadía isn’t sure what she will study in college but she’s interested in a lot of things. Along with English she speaks Spanish and Japanese. She spent time abroad as a student in Japan so she loves learning about Japanese food and culture. Abadía still hopes to work in environmental policy and climate advocacy. She hopes to find the intersection of these in international relations.

Outside of work Abadía loves hiking running reading and writing. In the future she hopes to travel to Japan again as well as Colombia where she has family.

Abadía said she wants to tell other young people that they don’t need to start their own organization to make a difference.

“Everyone has their own way in which they can make an impact on climate change and other issues they’re passionate about” Abadía said.

Rickie Fowler has been having all sorts of troubles lately. The 32-year-old has not been consistent with his game and his derailing confidence is pulling him back from achieving strong finishes. As the 2020-21 PGA Tour season is nearing its end Fowler has made a startling decision to skip an event that in turn puts his FedExCup Playoff spot at risk.

A few years ago Rickie Fowler was a top-tier player who stayed put in the top half of the Official World Golf Ranking. But due to a form slump Fowler’s reputation as a big-time player has taken a hit.

Fowler has made 23 starts this season and has achieved only one Top-10 finish. That is very unlikely for a player like him. While he’s only missed eight cuts in 23 starts posting a low score in the weekend has been an uphill task for the 32-year-old.

Rickie Fowler raises concern with the latest schedule change

The PGA Tour season is heading towards its conclusion. This means that the FedExCup Playoffs are fast approaching. There are three playoff events that will take place as part of the 2021 FedExCup challenge.

The first among them will be ‘THE NORTHERN TRUST’ which is scheduled for August 19-22 at the Liberty National Golf Club in New Jersey. The top 125 players in the current FedExCup standings will qualify for this event and Rickie Fowler currently holds the 125th spot.

However the subsequent BMW Championship will filter out the pack and only the Top 70 players in the standings will qualify. That’s where it gets tricky for Fowler. There are only three events lined up ahead of The Northern Trust event and Fowler has already pulled out of one of them. He rapidly needs to get into the Top 70 to play the BMW Championship.

Rickie Fowler is currently 125th on the 2021 FedExCup Standings. However with him not playing the Barracuda Championship or the World Golf Championships-FedEx St. Jude Invitational he will most likely miss out on playing the BMW Championship the second leg of the FedExCup Playoff event.

Dr Sir Tom Esmonde (60) was based in the Northern trust where he single-handedly manned a busy outpatient clinic while seeing hospital inpatient referrals - caring for a quarter of Northern Ireland's population.

A holder of a private pilot's licence the father-of-three retired in July last year and also enjoyed motorcycling.

He died ""suddenly but peacefully at home"" in Belfast on Saturday.

Originally from Dublin Dr Esmonde was a graduate of Trinity College and trained as a junior medic in Whiteabbey Hospital.

Dr Paul Darragh a former chair of the British Medical Association who was also based in the Northern trust shared a bungalow with him for a year on the hospital grounds and has fond memories of his housemate.

""Tom was a wonderful guy basically. As a doctor he was totally dependable and reliable.

""He was someone you could always go to and who was totally dedicated to medicine and to his patients.""

Dr Esmonde began working as a consultant in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast in the 1990s and moved to the Northern trust over a decade ago where he was based at Antrim Area Hospital.

""Tom always wanted to study neurology and even on our lunch breaks he'd be reading through 'Brain's Neurology' the standard text book at the time"" Dr Darragh said.

""When our paths crossed again in Antrim he was very busy and the sole neurologist. If we ever had anyone on the wards we were worried about you could always get in contact with Tom and he would make a point of coming up to see that patient.""

He was also a 'bit of a gourmet' and loved cooking.

""Tom was always very generous. When he was a consultant at the outpatient clinics at the Mid Ulster Hospital in Magherafelt he would bring in good coffee for the nurses.

""I remember one incident when we were juniors when a French drug rep brought food to a lunch-time meeting but the meeting was cancelled. I told him I had a bungalow on the grounds with a fridge.

""There was all sorts of fancy food and fine cheeses. It was strange for a wee fellow like me coming from Springfield Park in west Belfast to see escargot and garlic butter. I always remember Tom looking in the fridge - and the look of delight on his face.

""The interesting thing was that he was a baronet - I only found that out a few days ago. The Esmonde family have a long history in Irish politics. One of his relatives also took part in the 'swordfish' plane attack on the Bismarck and was awarded the posthumous Victoria Cross. Another was awarded it for his role in the Crimean War.""

The family's middle name is 'Grattan' and are related to Henry Grattan the politician and lawyer who successfully campaigned for an independent Irish parliament in the late 18th century.

In a personal tribute issued by Northern trust colleagues Dr Esmonde was described as a ""dearly valued colleague to all who knew him in Antrim Area Hospital"".

""He single-handedly maintained a busy neurology outpatient practice as well as attending without fail to many inpatient referrals. One could always be sure that Tom would present a clear answer cutting through our irrelevancies and confusion whenever he reviewed our patients"" they said.

“He was the perfect gentleman whose deep knowledge of neurology was matched by his humility and good humour. He gave compassionate care to all his patients modelling excellence in both his clinical and listening skills.

""Tom's diverse interests outside of medicine - aviation chess motorcycling hiking and many other pursuits - reflected his enthusiasm for life. He will be greatly missed by all of us his clinical colleagues and friends. We trust that all who knew him will find some measure of comfort in a life that though cut short was well and fully lived.""

Dr Esmonde is survived by his wife Pauline children Sean Aisling and Niamh and siblings Harold Karen Lisa and Richard.

Son Sean said they would remember him as a ""truly wonderful dad and husband - and a best friend"".

The turbofan-powered robotic aircraft in its new configuration is being developed by the US Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force for advanced long-endurance maritime intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance.

Since its first test flight in 2013 the subsonic Triton drone has grown in capabilities that have transformed it from an airframe for occasional surveillance duty to a semi-autonomous platform that a Northrop Grumman spokesperson has described as being on the verge of completely revolutionizing how the US Navy and the RAAF carry out maritime patrols and reconnaissance.

In its latest configuration the MQ-4C Triton combines its High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) capabilities with multi-intelligence systems that bring to bear state-of-the-art radar and other sensors as well as very high-bandwidth multiple data feeds. This provides for much greater situational awareness on both the tactical and strategic levels.

If the current program is successful the two baseline configuration Tritons that the US Navy is operating in the Pacific region will expand into both full Pacific and worldwide deployment as it reaches initial operating capability (IOC) in 2023.

Eventually there will be a fleet of 68 Tritons that will fly five-at-a-time on patrols conducted 24 hours a day seven days a week. This will allow the US Navy to stand down its crewed EP-3 Aries patrol craft which first joined Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron One in 1969. Later upgrades will include artificial intelligence and machine learning.

""This hugely important milestone for our Triton Multi-INT program is the culmination of over five years of intense engineering integration and test and represents the efforts of the hundreds of team members who have worked so tirelessly to achieve this Herculean task"" says Captain Dan Mackin Persistent Maritime Unmanned Aircraft Systems program manager. ""The Multi-INT capability that the U.S. Navy and Royal Australian Air Force have procured through Northrop Grumman our Naval Warfare Centers and our GFE partners is like no other – 360 degree AESA maritime radar full-motion EO/IR video streaming high-altitude long-endurance full-spectrum signals intelligence and the pipes to send multiple data types to ships aircraft and intelligence community ground stations allow our forces to hold adversaries at risk and protect the peace which is so vital to our national interest.""

This year marks the company’s 40th anniversary. Over those four decades CAST developed a unique record of excellence in GNSS/INS simulation.

CAST Navigation’s founding brought together a team of engineers with considerable experience in GPS and inertial navigation. Even though in 1981 the GPS constellation only consisted of six experimental Block I satellites CAST’s unique expertise quickly proved itself with customers that needed help integrating GPS technology and avionics sensors for navigation systems.

“John Clark Sr. George Gutheim and Dick Gibson were the original founders” CAST Vice President of Engineering John Clark Jr. said. “With their astute forward thinking they understood the need for a new class of engineering tools and test equipment to be able to support this new and emerging GPS technology. Hence CAST was born.”

One of CAST Navigation’s first products was NAVSIM a software simulator for developing and tuning GPS Kalyan filters. NAVSIM set the company on its decades-longcourse as a simulation systems developer. CAST introduced its first GPS simulation tool in 1987. A complete test system for GPS/INS technology development laboratories the Global Positioning System Tester (GPST) combined GPS simulations with models of that era’s avionics interfaces.

With GPS fully operational in the 1990s the nature of CAST’s business expanded beyond the lab to support new customer requirements. Companies integrating embedded GNSS/INS (EGI) systems needed simulation tools as did military customers testing EGI units on the flight line.

To support these needs. CAST steadily advanced its technology and capabilities. The GPST required two chassis and a separate controller computer to generate C/A and P(Y) signals on 10 channels. By the late 1990s CAST delivered more features at a lower price with a single-board 10-channel simulator that produced L1 L2 C/A and P(Y) signals. In 2005 CAST migrated their technology to Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices that could simulate L1 L2 L5 C/A P(Y) SAASM and M-codes as well as other GNSS signals.

CAST has worked closely with navigation platform developers throughout its history to ensure that CAST solutions produce high-fidelity simulations of customers’ navigation units. In addition these simulations demonstrate strong coherence and coincidence when simulating complex dynamic GNSS/INS scenarios.

Configured for Today’s Requirements Scalable for Tomorrow’s

Forty years after its founding CAST Navigation still focuses on delivering simulation solutions. Using the company’s latest FPGA technology CAST simulators generate signals with unmatched coherence precision and repeatability so CAST’s customers can get the job done right the first time.

According to Joseph Franiak Navigation Technologist at Northrop Grumman Corporation “The investment in the CAST stimulator pays for itself in the first integration allowing the user to uncover issues that only flight testing could perform in the past. I personally have used the CAST product for several product line integrations and the capability it brings allows for quick testing and re-testing verifying that the issue found was resolved.”

The discrete products of CAST’s earlier years have evolved into a modular configurable platform that lets CAST convert each customer’s requirements into solutions delivering a combination of four capabilities:

CAST GNSS Simulators: Based on the latest generation of CAST FPGA technology these simulators produce multi-frequency multi-constellation GNSS RF signals that are precise and repeatable.

CAST CRPA Simulators: The CRPA Simulator produces phase coherent composite GNSS and interference signals in the lab that accurately simulate the phase differences at each element Controlled Reception Pattern Antennas.

CAST Inertial Simulators: When testing navigation systems — whether loosely coupled tightly coupled or ultra-tightly coupled — CAST’s Inertial Simulators produce RF outputs that are coincident with inertial data. Users can modify the signals to simulate a specific navigation unit’s output performance and drift rates.

CAST Jammer Systems: Laboratories use CAST Jammer systems to generate high output low noise multi-location interference signals for testing single-element and multi-element antennas. The system can modify the signals to emulate hostile jamming and common interference sources.

An intuitive interface lets users create detailed simulation scenarios. Multiple vehicles on land in the air at sea or in space can be simulated statically or dynamically with 6-DOF trajectories through environments that recreate terrain obscuration vehicle silhouettes atmospheric delays and other parameters.

While the solutions CAST develops address customers’ immediate needs the platform’s modularity scales to meet future requirements. For large projects such as the simulation of entire squadrons CAST synchronization technology lets customers combine multiple CAST systems to meet your integration/testing goals.

The development of the combat drone is part of the US government-run Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) LongShot program which seeks to significantly increase the engagement range and effectiveness of air-to-air weapons.

In practice the program aims to launch an unmanned drone carrying missiles close to the enemy territory from an aircraft or bomber.

This way LongShot is envisioned to increase the survivability of manned platforms by allowing them to be at standoff ranges far away from enemy threats while an air-launched LongShot UAV efficiently closes the gap to take more effective missile shots DARPA’s statement noted.

The concept image released by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) becomes the third one after DARPA and Northrop Grumman another leading defense manufacturer had released their own versions in February this year.

The Concept Image

The California-based company released an article titled ‘GA-ASI: The Future of Small UAS’ highlighting the current projects the company is working on. Among other SUAVs like Sparrowhawk and MQ-1C Gray Eagle there was an artist rendering of DARPA’s LongShot.

The article described the futuristic drone which can be “launched from larger UAS or human-crewed aircraft and charge into hostile airspace armed with its own air-to-air missiles able to fire on enemy targets if it were so commanded”.

Talking about the versatility of the weapon the article listed the ways in which LongShot can be deployed such as “initiating a fighter sweep ahead of a strike wave without putting a human crew in danger or joining an attack alongside the vanguard with human-crewed warplanes or could give legacy aircraft such as bombers a potent new anti-air capability”.

General Atomics’ version shows a cockpit that looks much like a B-52 stealth bomber but without the need for the cockpit windows. It seems that the drone needs a comparatively larger-looking fuselage to house the combat weapons it is designed to deliver.

Speculating on the size of the drone The Drive reported that it seems big enough to host radar-guided air-to-air missiles including AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile or AMRAAM.

Earlier DARPA released its own concept art of LongShot showing a stealthy cruise missile-like vehicle with pop-out fins and rear-mounted air-breathing engine while firing two smaller air-to-air missiles.

Similarly two days after getting the contract Northrop Grumman revealed its concept image of the advanced technology weapon. The image had an airplane-like platform and a more traditional wing and tail configuration.

The Drive noted that Northrop Grumman’s LongShot concept has stealthy features including a chined fuselage it is shown carrying a pair of missiles externally which would increase its overall radar cross-section.

“The LongShot program enables us to combine our digital engineering skillset with our extensive knowledge in advanced technology weapons autonomous systems and strike platforms to increase weapon range and effectiveness” Jaime Engdahl program director kinetic weapons and emerging capabilities at Northrop Grumman said in the statement.

The LongShot Program

DARPA announced its Longshot program in February 2021 when it awarded contracts to General Atomics Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for preliminary Phase I design work.

The objective is to develop a novel UAV that can significantly extend engagement ranges increase mission effectiveness and reduce the risk to manned aircraft the statement said.

By providing a drone capable of engaging in air combat the program allows pilots to remain at safe distances in conflict zones and still engage in multiple combat operations.

In fiscal 2021 the Pentagon asked for $22 million in total to conduct initial work including the development and refinement of the design for a “demonstration system” The Drive reported.

“The LongShot program changes the paradigm of air combat operations by demonstrating an unmanned air-launched vehicle capable of employing current and advanced air-to-air weapons” said DARPA program manager Lt. Col. Paul Calhoun.

The unique military advantage of the combat drone is that the LongShot can launch a missile closer to the target which means the weapon retains a high level of energy making it harder for the target aircraft to escape.

Integration With A Bomber

Since the inception of the program military experts have speculated that bomber-sized aircraft carrying a large number of these missile-laden drones could be a particularly potent combination.

All three press releases mentioned the possibility of integrating the combat drone to the futuristic bombers currently under development in the US military.

For instance General Atomics highlights the bomber-launched scenario in which the LongShot is described as being launched after “allied battle networks” detect hostile fighters rather than its launch necessarily being commanded based on what the bomber’s own sensors ‘see.’

The press release mentioned LongShot also could give “legacy aircraft such as bombers a potent new anti-air capability”. But experts are also considering the possibility of integrating it with the upcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber

Built by the Northrop Grumman the B-21 is said to be the most advanced stealth bomber in history when it enters service later this decade. The EurAsian Times reported on the status of the bomber when concept images were released earlier this month.

Designed to perform long-range conventional and nuclear missions and to operate in the high-end threat environment in the future the B-21 will be a visible and flexible component of the nuclear triad” the US Air Force said in a statement.

It remains to be seen what Lockheed Martin brings to the table for the radical air-launched drone designed for the US’ adversaries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGF1bGlkZG9uLzIwMjEvMDcvMzEvdGhlLW1pZGRsZS1lYXN0LWhhcy1zb21lLXBvd2VyZnVsLWFpci1kZWZlbnNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Tehran To Tel Aviv: The Middle East Has Some Powerful Air Defenses,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2021/07/31/the-middle-east-has-some-powerful-air-defenses/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGF1bGlkZG9uLzIwMjEvMDcvMzEvdGhlLW1pZGRsZS1lYXN0LWhhcy1zb21lLXBvd2VyZnVsLWFpci1kZWZlbnNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd2Fycmlvcm1hdmVuLmNvbS9haXIvYS0xMC1saXZlcy10by1maWdodC1hbm90aGVyLWRheS1haXItZm9yY2Utd2FudHMtdG8ta2VlcC0yMzktd2FydGhvZ3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A-10 Lives to Fight Another Day - U.S. Air Force Wants to Keep 239 Warthogs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://warriormaven.com/air/a-10-lives-to-fight-another-day-air-force-wants-to-keep-239-warthogs on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd2Fycmlvcm1hdmVuLmNvbS9haXIvYS0xMC1saXZlcy10by1maWdodC1hbm90aGVyLWRheS1haXItZm9yY2Utd2FudHMtdG8ta2VlcC0yMzktd2FydGhvZ3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Suki Waterhouse is not amused with HBO Max's recent Gossip Girl revival.

The Bad Batch actress 29 had some words for one show writer who made a jab at her relationship with Robert Pattinson referring to the model/actress as a ""nobody.""

In the third episode Luna (Zión Moreno) one of the minions of Constance Billard's new queen bee attempts to help rehab new girl Zoya's (Whitney Peak) public image after she starts dating her long lost sister's ex-boyfriend Obie (Eli Brown)... keeping up? ""When are you going to get it? As far as the press is concerned he's R-Patz and you're Suki Nobody"" Luna tells Zoya in the scene.

Tuesday July 20 2021.Jeff McIntosh/The Globe and Mail

A semi-trailer is idling just outside Enmax Corp.’s Shepard gas-fired power plant on Calgary’s eastern outskirts and it is loaded with a grey granular substance that’s become Apoorv Sinha’s life’s work.

Mr. Sinha’s startup Carbon Upcycling Technologies has invited business partners and government officials to have a look at the reaction vessel that yielded the powder from the plant’s waste carbon dioxide and then watch the 40-tonne load trundle away to a concrete batch plant in Edmonton.

His team manufactured the additive from the greenhouse gas that otherwise would have been emitted into the sky. Lafarge Canada will add the powder to its concrete mix in place of some of the portland cement it normally uses and lower emissions from making its own products.

“There’s no doubt we’ve come a long way but to really make the impact that we’re striving for we’ve got to change behaviour. The aspiration here is that we start with this Western Canadian business unit then Lafarge all across the world starts to change how they do business” said Mr. Sinha a 31-year-old entrepreneur who has been Calgary-based Carbon Upcycling’s chief executive officer since the technology was first proven in a reactor the size of a cookie tin six years ago.

Shell Canada president says carbon capture facility an integral part of company’s emissions reduction plan

Carbon Upcycling is in a fast-growing segment of the Canadian cleantech sector focused on manufacturing useful products and providing innovative services by tapping into the massive volumes of CO2 captured from all kinds of energy and industrial processes to reduce the impact on climate.

A spate of technological developments in the fields of chemicals manufacturing and agriculture has caught the attention of environmentalists scientists and venture capitalists alike as companies tout new uses for the heat-trapping gas that would otherwise be spewed into the atmosphere injected underground or used to boost oil production.

Of course there is also a phalanx of environmentalists who are wary of carbon capture saying the practice will prolong the use of fossil fuels which they contend must end for the world to get to net-zero emissions.

Even so the business opportunity looks huge. The U.S.-based Global CO2 Initiative has estimated the market will be worth as much as US$800-billion a year by 2030 and Canadian entrepreneurs and scientists are already making their mark.

In April another company focused on lowering concrete’s carbon intensity Halifax’s CarbonCure Technologies Inc. won part of the US$20-million Carbon XPRIZE a nearly five-year competition sponsored by Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance and U.S. power company NRG Energy Inc. The next phase of the technological race has a US$100-million purse and is sponsored by Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk and his foundation.

Other major tech players including Canadian e-commerce giant Shopify Inc. have dedicated funds to find solutions to the carbon conundrum.

The trick for developers will be proving they can scale up and commercialize their innovations – sell them in industrial and consumer markets at a profit – so they will attract investors and make a real difference in the fight to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

Here are five emerging Canadian companies with carbon utilization technologies that could be on the verge of major market breakthroughs.

Carbonova Corp.

Calgary

Under an electron microscope the carbon nanofibres Carbonova produces at its lab at the University of Calgary look like tangles of ramen noodles. To the naked eye they are a black powder one that stands to revolutionize everything from construction materials to car parts to electronics because of an unusual combination of strength and light weight.

Carbonova’s secret lies in the science of how it produces the material from carbon dioxide and an even more potent greenhouse gas methane using two catalysts to trigger chemical reactions. It is the brainchild of CEO Mina Zarabian and chief technology officer Pedro Pereira Almao.

When the pair experts in catalyst research developed the process that spit out the material in 2016 they were elated. But celebration was tempered somewhat by skepticism among other chemical engineers used to coke being the cheap byproduct of such a reaction not a sought-after material used in the most advanced manufacturing Ms. Zarabian said.

“Although it looks the same – it’s black and under analytical equipment it says it’s carbon – when you put it under a microscope you see it’s a different type of carbon. Carbon can be formed in many different ways” she said.

The energy-saving process and its potential have caught the attention of investors including well-known names in Canada’s oil patch: Pat Carlson former CEO of Seven Generations Energy Ltd. and Perpetual Energy Inc. CEO Sue Riddell Rose. Carbonova fields frequent calls from large CO2 emitters.

Governments utilities and the nuclear industry hope small modular reactors will power Canada’s future. Can they actually build one?

The real test however will be producing enough of the product for global markets and at a low-enough cost to realize its benefits.

“You can use it for so many things. The reason we cannot use it at this point is that it’s too expensive” Dr. Pereira who is also a professor at the university said during a tour of the research facility. “So we’re going to make it less expensive but also available for everybody while we reduce considerably the environmental impact – the process for producing carbon nanofibres.”

Carbon nanofibre is prized for strength and versatility. They are 40 times stronger than steel and a quarter of its weight. The material can be used in paints electronic components metal and plastics. It is also more electrically conductive than copper.

Today global production of carbon nanofibre and nanotubes at less than 5000 tonnes a year is dwarfed by carbon black at 14 million tonnes and standard carbon fibre at 150000 tonnes.

Carbonova is now scaling up having recently completed a $2-million financing round. It is also part of a Canada-U.S.-European consortium that will study the development of products for the building and automotive sectors over the next three years on behalf of a multinational company in the construction sector looking to reduce its carbon intensity.

Its customer’s tests have yielded positive results but it wants more volume. Now Carbonova is building a reactor it describes as “semi-commercial’ in scale that will yield 150 times more than the bench prototype.

Once the pilot proves itself the goal is to build modular plants at a cost of $20-million to $30-million each that can produce thousands of tonnes a year. The plants will be designed for sites where there are emissions to tap and proximity to end users of the carbon nanofibres Ms. Zarabian said.

The founders hope to keep the company and its intellectual property in Canada especially the West but Ms. Zarabian is cognizant of how difficult that can be as a startup tries to scale up a frequent worry in Canadian tech. “Business sometimes is a race” she said.

CO2 Gro Inc.

Toronto

CO2 Gro Inc. has been on a long road with its technology for improving the use of greenhouse gas in greenhouses. The founders’ initial plan more than a decade ago was to capitalize on keen interest in algae for biofuels. It had success in the lab at the National Research Council Canada in Halifax and launched an initial public offering.

As oil prices surged to US$147 a barrel in 2008 algae was seen as the next big thing. Then crude fell back to earth during the financial crisis and the buzz died down. Algae no longer looked like a viable business but the plant-growth technology would prove versatile.

Canada’s legalization of marijuana in 2018 was the start of CO2 Gro’s second act.

Pumping CO2 into greenhouses has long been known to increase plant growth by as much as 30 per cent but the process is inefficient and during hot months the gas gets vented into the atmosphere. CO2 Gro’s technology involves infusing water with CO2 but in a way that does not yield club soda. The solution is misted onto plants in short bursts improving the efficiency of the process.

The pot industry quickly became a top market and now CO2 Gro has sold its misting systems to eight licensed cannabis operations. It is also concentrating on other crops grown in protected structures including peppers and berries – those with large enough leaves for the technology to be effective.

“The use of carbon in most cases has not been a very precise thing. People burn fuels to make carbon they do all sorts of things to get the CO2 for the carbon and in most cases it’s lost” said John Archibald CO2 Gro’s CEO.

To pump the gas into a 100000-square-foot greenhouse an operator may have to inject up to a million cubic feet of CO2 he explains. In many cases as much as 90 per cent of that then gets emitted.

“What we do is put the CO2 into the water at a specific solution rate and put it onto the leaves in a mist so the leaves basically uptake nearly all of the carbon that we give them. So we use about 5 per cent of the carbon that somebody would if they were gassing” he said.

The technology has also proven itself in another important way: It reduces the need for herbicides because the solution alters the pH level on the surface areas of the leaves allowing the plants to resist pathogens such as E. coli mould and powdery mildew a common problem for cannabis producers.

“So a lot of folks look to us for the natural pesticide that comes part and parcel with putting on mildly acidic water loaded with saturated CO2 molecules” said Sam Kanes the company’s vice-president of market research.

CO2 Gro has 10 staff and uses a global network of independent sales representatives to market its delivery systems. Its largest shareholder is U.S.-based private equity firm Ospraie Ag Science LLC.

In the past year CO2 Gro has signed several deals with companies around the world to determine the commercial viability of the technology in their operations. They grow crops such as lettuce strawberries and peppers as well as orchids and roses.

“We are seeing an average of 30-per-cent crop increases and to generate those crop increases we’re only adding about 5 per cent of the CO2 to the atmosphere” Mr. Archibald said. “In a world that is experiencing food stresses to feed populations particularly in the emerging economies that’s an important gain. We can’t work with wheat and we can’t work with rice but we can make a significant contributions at the margin.”

CleanO2 Carbon Capture Technologies Inc.

Calgary

Thursday July 22 2021.Jeff McIntosh/The Globe and Mail

Jaeson Cardiff is a plumber and gas fitter by trade who started his company CleanO2 developing technology to strip carbon dioxide from furnaces. Now he is marketing soap with natural ingredients to some of Canada’s best-known retailers.

The two go hand in hand. The reaction unit Mr. Cardiff invented removes carbon from the flue exhaust of commercial boilers and using heat the reactor produces potassium carbonate. The company mixes the white powdery substance into its lines of soaps and cleaners with benefits similar to a water softener.

The soap started as a novel marketing tool but that changed quickly as the company realized retailers and consumers liked the products.

“I had multiple conversations with Kathi Fischer our chief science officer saying something to the effect of ‘We’re never going to be a soap company. I don’t want to be a soap company. We’re a carbon capture company. We will not make soap’” Mr. Cardiff said. “Now we’re making soap.”

The liquid hand soap and body bars have names such as Wilderness Lager Spearmint & Clay and Mulled Merlot and the company produces car wash detergent.

“You’d have to be fools not to notice attraction of a product made from carbon that was sequestered from a heating appliance. And you have to be even bigger fools not to modify your business strategy to incorporate that” he said in CleanO2′s fragrant East Calgary office and manufacturing centre.

Besides removing CO2 the reaction unit called CARBiN-X also provides more efficiency to buildings by generating its own heat that can be used for water. A single unit which is about the size of a couple of refrigerators side by side removes six to eight tonnes of carbon per year.

Thursday July 22 2021.Jeff McIntosh/The Globe and Mail

Mr. Cardiff developed the first units 15 years ago for home use. The technology worked but the business didn’t. The breakthrough came with the decision by the founders to increase the size of the reactors for commercial operations such as businesses and hotels and make a viable product with the residue.

CleanO2 has carbon capture units set up at sites across Canada as well as locations in United States and Japan. Eventually it plans to set up soap manufacturing at those sites as well partly to reduce the CO2 emitted during shipping.

One hotel in Minneapolis uses CleanO2′s technology to scrub the carbon from its furnace and puts the soap products in its rooms effectively closing the CO2 loop.

Canadian Tire Sobeys and Safeway as well as Walmart’s Canadian e-commerce site are among retailers that already carry CleanO2′s soaps. Power companies such as Fortis BC and Atco Ltd. also purchase the products. CleanO2 is just at the start of an expansion that will see it go from shipping 5000 units to 100000 units over the next three months.

Now Mr. Cardiff says he expects the company to be financially self-sustaining in the next two to three months.

Hyperion Global Energy Corp.

Ottawa

Hyperion Global Energy is creating what it calls the world’s first carbon recycling business using an energy-efficient process to remove CO2 from smokestacks in a host of industries and turning it into minerals that can be used in everything from green building materials to pharmaceuticals.

The company’s strategy involves packing all of its gear needed to run the process into shipping containers and setting them up at mining energy and manufacturing facilities that emit greenhouse gases. The host producer needs to make no capital expenditures.

Hyperion then aims to supply a US$44-billion global market for the resulting materials such as calcium carbonate. In some cases manufacturers generating the CO2 will then be able to buy the minerals back to make their products.

“We have an energy-efficient process and life cycle right from the inputs to the offtake that we create” said Heather Ward Hyperion’s co-founder and president. “This is plug-and-play technology a drop-in unit that does not require new construction at the site.”

The minerals are non-toxic and Hyperion can adjust the purity based on what customers need for their own products which could be concrete paper plastics or fertilizers. The process creates two tonnes of minerals for every tonne of CO2 processed and the material can sell for US$500 to US$2200 a tonne according to Hyperion.

The company’s journey began five years ago when Ms. Ward teamed up with Jerry Flynn who developed the technology which they call the Tandem Carbon Recycling System. Earlier this year they joined forces with Luke Tucker a military special operations veteran who is Hyperion’s CEO.

It’s a pivotal year for the company which operates in Ottawa’s Bayview Yards innovation centre. Hyperion was a semifinalist in the NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE proving with its prototype that it was able to process a tonne of CO2 a week. Hyperion is now pushing that up to one tonne a day as it builds a pilot system. Later this year it will work with industrial customers in a path to 20 tonnes a day and beyond.

Meanwhile it received $100000 in seed funding from Crown-owned Sustainable Technology Development Canada secured close to $1-million through Ottawa-based Capital Angel Network and won a $770000 grant from the Natural Gas Innovation Fund. Hyperion also scored funding from Norway’s Equinor & Techstars Energy Accelerator.

Ms. Ward said the money to develop the technology has allowed Hyperion to hit its stride just as global investment in carbon utilization is reaching a tipping point.

“Once we have our commercial system running at a plant the world will be our oyster. We’ll have proven the technology at an industrial demonstration” she said.

Carbon Upcycling Technologies

Calgary

Apoorv Sinha is adamant that cleantech companies must show ability to scale up and commercialize their technology or the industry will face another burst bubble and frustrated investors.

“A lot of it boils down to not only execution but looking at some of the really tough parts around making innovation real which is talking to customers making sure that what you are doing actually solves the problem making sure you are making their lives easier not tougher and taking all of that into account when you design your product” he said.

He believes company he co-founded Carbon Upcycling is close to proving itself in that realm with a new memorandum of understanding with a global concrete manufacturer LafargeHolcim to use the startup’s unique carbon-based material in its products.

Carbon Upcycling a finalist in the Carbon XPRIZE has nine employees plus contract staff but Mr. Sinha says that number will increase quickly.

“You compare that to like 70000 for Holcim and the reason they’re showing interest is because of the significance this has strategically for them” Mr. Sinha said at his company’s demonstration facility at the Shepard power plant.

“It’s really a way for us to punch above our weight and this company is going to have to go to a few hundred employees in the next couple of years if we’re going to make the type of impact that we want.”

Concrete manufacturing is a major source of greenhouse gases accounting for about 7 per cent of global CO2 emissions. Hence the industry’s keen interest in seeking breakthrough technology.

Carbon Upcycling’s additive a supplementary cementitious material or SCM can be used to reduce the carbon intensity of concrete but it can also be an ingredient in plastics anti-corrosion coatings and a range of consumer products.

The environmental benefit is twofold: First the company takes the carbon-based fly ash from the generating station and injects CO2 from the plant stacks into the material in its reactor which is slightly smaller than a city bus. The additive also makes concrete stronger and reduces its carbon footprint by 25 per cent.

Carbon Upcycling got its start in 2014 when Emissions Reduction Alberta held a competition for technology to convert emissions into products. Mr. Sinha worked with professors at universities in Calgary Waterloo and Toronto who helped prove the company’s prototype reactor could be replicated and scaled up.

Four years later the company fielded calls from the likes of Burnco and TransAlta Corp. in Canada and LafargeHolcim asking if the materials could be used in the construction industry. Its relationship with Lafarge Canada grew as Carbon Upcycling entered the XPRIZE competition. It also joined the multinational building products company’s accelerator program in France.

“The scale-up exercise was because of XPRIZE and their deadlines. But really we could never justify it quite frankly for just a science competition. They don’t look at market traction they don’t look at economics they just look at scale up” Mr. Sinha said. “What we wanted to make sure was as a company we’re actually doing something commercial.”

Although the Nvidia Control Panel isn’t readily apparent on your desktop opening it is simple. We have a handful of ways to access it as well as some tips for how to get the most out of the software.

How to open the Nvidia Control Panel

Before getting started make sure to download the latest version of Nvidia Control Panel. Even if you have a previous version installed we recommend selecting the Clean Installation option to make sure you don’t have any conflicting drivers or software.

If you’ve recently updated your graphics card drivers you shouldn’t need to worry about that. When you update your drivers Nvidia Control Panel should automatically install. Regardless of how you got it you can open the Nvidia Control Panel by following these steps:

Step 1: Right-click anywhere on your desktop.

Step 2: (Windows 11 only) Select Show More Options.

Step 3: Select Nvidia Control Panel.

That’s the quickest and easiest way to pull up the Nvidia Control Panel but there are a few other ways to access it. It should be open any time you’re using your graphics card so you can also find it by following these steps:

Step 1: Expand the system tray in your taskbar.

Step 2: Find the Nvidia logo (called Nvidia Settings).

Step 3: Right-click it and select Nvidia Control Panel.

You can also find the Nvidia Control Panel through the Control Panel in Windows 10. However recent versions of Windows have adopted a different look making this route the most difficult. If you’re a hotkey fanatic you can also use Windows Key + S and quickly search for the Nvidia Control Panel to pull it up.

What you can do in Nvidia Control Panel

Nvidia Control Panel is focused entirely on your graphics card. That includes the card itself how it uses settings in games and applications and how your monitor behaves. It’s a dense piece of software so we can’t cover everything here but we’ll hit the most important parts.

The Manage 3D Settings area is where you’ll spend a lot of your time. Here you can tweak global settings like your antialiasing mode max frame rate and if you want to use G-Sync with your monitor. You can change these settings globally or on a program-by-program basis by switching the tab.

After that the Change Resolution section is very important. As the name implies you can change the resolution of your display here. More importantly you can also change the refresh rate and color settings of your monitor. It’s important to check this section out when you buy a new monitor especially if it has a high refresh rate.

Finally the Set Up Multiple Displays option is critical if you have a multi-monitor setup. It allows you to quickly identify displays and drag them around to match how they’re sitting on your desk. You can also manage Nvidia Surround settings here if you want to stretch applications across multiple screens.

Nvidia Control Panel vs. GeForce Experience

If you install Nvidia Control Panel with a GeForce graphics card you’ll get GeForce Experience as well. Unlike Nvidia Control Panel GeForce Experience is focused on gaming. You can’t tweak your graphics card or display settings. Still GeForce Experience unlocks all the features available on Nvidia graphics cards.

The most important area is the Drivers tab which allows you to see and install the latest drivers. We recommend checking here often as new drivers add support and additional features to games as they’re released. If you’re experiencing a problem with your graphics card this is the first place to look.

Over in the Settings area — found by clicking the cog icon next to your username — you’ll find a host of useful information about your PC. In addition to your specs you can see if features like Nvidia GameStream Ansel and Freestyle are working on your graphics card. If you have one of the best graphics cards from the last few years you should have all the features available.

Also in this area the Games & Apps section is important. Here you can point GeForce Experience to where you install your games and apps. GeForce Experience will automatically optimize your settings in supported games so it’s worth scanning your computer for new additions occasionally.

It’s first post was even more intriguing:

3dfx Interactive is coming back 20 years later. Prepare for an major announcement regarding our return this Thursday! pic.twitter.com/KXPeY20lQ7July 30 2021

In the extremely likely event that the account is deleted and the above embed no longer works here is the full text: “3dfx Interactive is coming back 20 years later. Prepare for an [sic.] major announcement regarding our return this Thursday!”

The tweet is accompanied by the lead image above which echoes the iconic branding of the original graphics cards from the late 90s though it appears this has been lifted directly from Deviant Art without credit.

Typo and Creative Commons artwork aside there’s also the tricky issue that Nvidia purchased 3dfx back in 2002 after the company had produced its last card chiefly for its intellectual property. And while there’s some excitable talk about trademark lapse on Twitter there’s nothing that gives the account any credibility whatsoever.

Wishful thinking

It’s not hard to figure out why gamers of a certain age would daydream about the return of 3dfx and its Voodoo cards. Nostalgia is a powerful drug after all and the ongoing battle between Nvidia and 3dfx was one of the things that made 90s PC gaming so exciting. I remember getting a discounted Voodoo 5 5500 after the company went under in 2000. And even though the following years were a mess of struggling to find stable fan-made drivers that allowed the latest games to stumble on I still have a certain soft spot for the brand.

Even PC gamers too young to remember 3dfx can’t help but have noticed that graphics cards are in extremely short supply at the moment thanks to a combination of the ongoing global chip shortage and top-end cards’ ability to effectively mine cryptocurrency. Finding Nvidia RTX 3080 stock is incredibly hard right now – so hard in fact that the company has been reviving five-year-old cards as a stop gap for people who need a modest GPU urgently.

And it’s certainly true that these unusual market conditions provide an opportunity for companies keen to disrupt the status quo. Indeed Intel is going to test whether there’s room for a third GPU designer in the mix soon with its upcoming DG2 Xe-HPG cards rumored for an early 2022 reveal.

All the same there’s nothing here to suggest that the alleged 3dfx revival is any more real than the recent fake Interplay Twitter account which promised the return of the classic PC games like Messiah MDK and Descent. It was shut down when the real Interplay stepped in. But with no real 3dfx to step in here and clarify we’ll have to wait until Thursday 5 August before we can truly put this unlikely rumor to bed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84MDkxMy9udmlkaWFzLW5leHQtZ2VuLWFkYS1sb3ZlbGFjZS1ncHUtbWF4d2VsbC10by1wYXNjYWwtbGlrZS1wZXJmLWdhaW5zL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA's next-gen Ada Lovelace GPU: Maxwell to Pascal like perf gains,"NVIDIA's next-gen GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs should offer the same generation perofrmance jump that we had from Maxwell to Pascal.

We've been hearing very positive news on NVIDIA's next-gen Ada Lovelace GPU architecture with the last news in the last 24 hours or so teasing that the new GPU will use 400-500W of power and be 100%+ faster than the GeForce RTX 3090.

A new rumor from Ulysses teases that NVIDIA's new Ada Lovelace GPU will offer the same generational performance jump that we experienced from Maxwell to Pascal which was fantastic. We all remember how good the GeForce GTX 980 Ti was but the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti was a true generational leap.

In between now and then we should expect NVIDIA to unleash a ""SUPER"" refresh of its current Ampere-based GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards. That should happen later this year or early 2022 before the big launch of Ada Lovelace and the new GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs in the second half of 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzkwNjE5LW5leHQtZ2VuLWdwdXMtbG9vay1iaWctaHVuZ3J5LWJhZC1uZXdzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Next-gen GPUs look big and hungry and that's bad news,"A hot potato: Gamers who thought that the current crop of RDNA2 and RTX 30-series GPUs were already demanding might be in for a surprise if the most recent drop of leaks is to be believed.

Both kopite7kimi and Greymon55 established leakers in their own rights seem to be in agreement that some of Nvidia's upcoming Lovelace GPUs will land somewhere north of the 400W range. These figures would presumably be for the top models of the RTX 4000 series built on AD102 silicon successors to the RTX 3080 / Ti and RTX 3090.

Besides pushing the GPU core as hard as possible a great deal of this power budget will come from the continued use of the hot and power-hungry GDDR6X memory on Nvidia's top models.

Separately Bondrewd of the Beyond3D forums left hints on Navi 31 the top SKU from AMD's RDNA3 line-up suggesting that the multi-chiplet GPU would sit below 500W in total board power draw and below 350 mm² per graphics core die.

With an estimated size of 600-650 mm² for the two GCDs alone and perhaps 800 mm² for the whole GPU (when including the Infinity Cache-bearing MCDs) 3Dcenter believes that Navi 31 will end up in the region of 450-480W for total board power.

Although the GPUs are nowhere near from release these numbers are already concerning. In addition to being a bigger strain on PSUs and cooling in smaller cases the growing power draw of GPUs is increasingly leaving gaming laptops behind.

Size and weight constraints of gaming laptops limit their cooling ability and TDPs have remained stubbornly fixed as a result with mobile GPUs rarely given more than 150W to work with and that's the bulkier models that have lots of cooling.

That was good enough when the 180W GTX 1080 was the bar to beat but the RTX 2080 called for 215W and the RTX 3080 asked for 320W taking gaming laptops from near-parity to only half the power of a desktop card in just a few generations.

That's excluding how growing die sizes have locked out the top end GPUs from laptops entirely with the laptop RTX 3080 and RX 6800M actually using a lower tier silicon than their desktop counterparts. Or how partner cards routinely draw even more power reference numbers like EVGA's FTW3 pushing the RTX 3080 to almost 400W.

Surely 400W+ GPUs are unlikely to trouble top end battlestations with immaculately designed cooling and kilowatt power supplies. But for regular gamers – those using smaller cases or on laptops or keeping hold of an ol' reliable 500W PSU – they're becoming a major problem."

Wagner steps down from the bench,"The judge one prosecutor called “the conscience of Kenosha County” has stepped down from the bench.

Circuit Court Judge Mary K. Wagner served her last day in court Friday. She is retiring after 30 years having served five consecutive terms. Remarkably in a position in which her decisions were almost always going to make someone unhappy Wagner is nearly universally beloved.

“I think that Judge Wagner during her time on the bench has been the conscience of Kenosha County” District Attorney Michael Graveley said. “She’s got the biggest heart of anyone I have ever seen on the bench. She is a person who cares about the attorneys in the room she cares about the audience. She certainly cares about the defendants and she really cares about the victims.”

During her time in the judiciary she served as deputy chief judge as chief judge and as the “chief of the chief judges” from 2013-14.

Wagner announced in November that she planned to step down at the end of her term. She said she loved being a judge but felt it was time to move on. “I wanted to retire at the end of a term so we could have a good election” she said saying she wanted to make sure she left the bench when her replacement would be elected rather than appointed mid-term.

Former Deputy District Attorney Angelina Gabriele was elected to take over the Branch 6 seat.

Teaching politics and private practice

While she served three decades on the bench being a judge was just one of several careers for Wagner.

She grew up in Brighton living with her family over her father’s tavern. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1971 and became a teacher working in Kenosha County schools. But her interest in politics led her to run for office and she was elected as Kenosha County Clerk in 1976 and to the Wisconsin Assembly in 1978.

“I went to law school while I was in the Assembly” she said saying the flexible schedule of a legislator gave her time to pursue her degree.

After leaving politics she went into private practice as a lawyer. Among her legal partners was Bruce Schroeder who became a judge in the years before Wagner was elected. “First and foremost she may be short in stature but she is a giant in the law. She is a giant in terms of generosity and in terms of kindness” Schroeder said. “This business can be difficult at times but she just has the spirit of charity … I’m going to miss her terribly.”

Judge Jodi Meier said she met Wagner when Meier was in grade school. “She has always had an encouraging word she has always had a genuine smile” Meier said. “I personally have appreciated her wisdom her mentoring and her friendship in learning my role as judge.”

Families and children

In the court system Wagner had a passion for issues involving families and children. She served for 12 years as a juvenile court judge which oversees cases in which children are taken into protective custody because of abuse or neglect delinquency cases in which children under 17 are charged with crimes and cases where parental rights are terminated.

Clerk of Courts Rebecca Matoska-Mentink said she first met Wagner years ago when she was working in the child support division saying that’s when she learned that Wagner held both herself and everyone working in the system to a high standard.

Matoska-Mentink said she appeared in Wagner’s court on a case in which the state was attempting to locate a child’s father. “The judge asked me a question ‘Do you think you did everything necessary to locate this father?’ My response was ‘the federal guidelines have been met on this case” Matoska-Mentink remembered. “She slammed her hand down on the desk and said ‘But you still haven’t found him.’ I thought dang straight just because guidelines are being met doesn’t mean I can’t do more. A month later I was back in court and I had found the father.”

Wagner said issues surrounding children and families have been her passion on the bench and said she sees the effect of family dysfunction running through society and the criminal justice system. “The stability of families is tantamount to everything we do it’s the underpinning of everything we do” she said.

During her years in the courthouse Wagner said the legal system has made strides in trying to address those issues by creating treatment courts and diversion programs that focus on substance abuse treatment and treatment for mental illness but said there is still work to do.

She said she is proud of the work the juvenile court system did in getting social services and treatment programs for families.

Ron Rogers director of the Kenosha Division of Children and Family Services said Wagner spearheaded a move to use data measure the success of the juvenile court system and led a committee to study racial equity in the system disproportionate contact with minority children in the courts.

“She always had a really strong commitment to improving the lives of children youth and families and we would see that in every court hearing we had in juvenile court” Rogers said. “She wanted to see families improve and she wanted to see them succeed.”

‘Every human being is worthy’

Attorneys said Wagner paid close attention to every person involved in each case. “It takes a real effort to make sure each person who comes before you (in court) is seen as a fully dimensional human being” Graveley said. “That’s not easy to do and it’s definitely not easy to do running a court calendar but she was completely committed to it.”

Wagner said that was a lesson she learned from her parents.

“My mother and father were completely committed to the idea that every human being is worthy” she said. “I believe that to my core.”

In retirement she wants to travel to spend time with family and to focus on a hobby she recently began pursuing — golf. But she also plans to help in the effort to raise funds for the renovation of the ceremonial courtroom at the Kenosha County Courthouse. And she hopes to start a program that would provide driver’s education training and help in securing driver’s licenses for low-income teens and adults who often end up in criminal court for driving without a license.

Reflecting on her career Wagner got emotional when speaking about her gratitude for people in the community who entrusted her with the position.

“I just want people to know how grateful I am” she said “that I am so thankful that they gave me the opportunity to do all the things I have done and that I have worked hard to live up to that trust.”

The band played some classic Sublime favorites as well as new music from their 2019 album.

California alt rock trio Sublime with Rome formed in 2009 to carry on the legacy of the original ska-punk legends Sublime whose lead singer Bradley Nowell died of a heroin overdose in 1996.

Don’t panic when stocks collapse.

That investing maxim proved absolutely correct during the rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic panic of early 2020.

Remarkably shares of 57 of the 75 largest North Carolina-based public companies increased by at least 30% during the year ending June 30. Five tripled in value while another 12 doubled. The star performer was Belmont-based Piedmont Lithium which shot up more than 11-fold aided by a big contract to supply electric automaker Tesla.

Only four of the 75 stocks lost ground during that period.

We expanded this annual list from 50 companies to 75 this year reflecting the market’s increased bullishness.

A dozen companies are new to the list led by No. 7 Trane Technologies which was spun off from Ingersoll Rand. Trane is based in Dublin Ireland but senior executives work in Davidson. Five newcomers emerged after initial public offerings: nCino Driven Brands Krispy Kreme Bioventus and Fathom Holdings.

Other newcomers include companies that relocated their headquarters. Hayward Holdings moved from New Jersey Phreesia from New York and Avaya from California.

Departures included Raleigh-based BMC Stock acquired by Builders First Source and Charlotte-based Extended Stay America which was sold to Blackstone and Starwood Capital.

Old Dominion Freight Line SPX PRA Health and Cree repeated as four of the best stock market performers over the past five years. PRA was acquired in July by Ireland-based Icon while PPD and Select Bancorp have also announced plans to be sold.

“The one thing I did when I walked in (to make some friends in Ogilvy because I didn’t have any) was give everyone all 15000 employees my WhatsApp number. And I just went on a listening tour” says Andy Main. From his home in Colorado US the global chief executive officer of Ogilvy shares his experience of stepping into traditional ad agency territory at exactly this time last year.

In the thick of a pandemic in 2020 the Scottish-born executive took the topmost job at WPP Group-owned Ogilvy after over two decades with management consultancy giant Deloitte. In short Main was what advertising insiders call 'an outsider'. In his last role he was chief executive of Deloitte Digital where through key acquisitions he brought in creative firepower that the firm needed to take on the big ad holding companies namely WPP Omnicom IPG Dentsu and Publicis Groupe.

Many saw Main's arrival in Ogilvy as evidence of the seriousness of WPP and its CEO Mark Read's intent to transform the legacy agency into a future-fit organisation. In an exclusive interaction with Storyboard Main tells us why and how he's shaking things up.

(Edited for length and clarity)

Q. You took over the reins of Ogilvy at an extraordinary time. Tell us how that went for you and how Ogilvy’s transformation agenda looks in action? My focus has been on ensuring we take the best of Ogilvy protect it and build on it. That means keeping creativity at the centre of everything we do and enabling our creativity to spread its wings particularly into technology and data.

Our aspiration is to be the world's leading creative partner and platform for growth and impact for our clients businesses. To do that we structured Ogilvy around five business groups - Growth & Innovation Advertising PR & Influence Experience and Health. And we practice what’s called borderless creativity. It doesn't really matter where you happen to be or how you happen to think let's make the world borderless to advance growth and impact for our clients.

A lot of people go around talking about integration. Agencies and consultancies have integration departments and disciplines. But we have a different perspective. We talk about the intersections. Integration means you're putting together something that is fixed and known. But when you think about intersections it talks about how you bring talent and capabilities to explore and discover value at intersections of many different topics. That is allowing our minds to be free and when you map that with creativity you get an amazing Ogilvy in the marketplace. That's really what we brought to market very quickly. To have accomplished that feels very exciting to me personally.

Q. The last few years have been difficult for advertising companies across the board a situation made worse by the pandemic. How did Ogilvy fare this past year in terms of business? How did you deal with losing the American Express account which was an over half-century old creative relationship with Ogilvy?

We are a growing business and we've actually won lots of new accounts. For example Absolut Hyatt Enterprise Holdings TCS Pernod Ricard and Deutsche Bank. Our teams in India played a huge role in making that happen. Our wins have actually outnumbered our losses. We did extremely well at Cannes Lions with one Titanium eight Grand Prix and a raft of gold silver and bronze. The creative spirit and DNA of our business is alive and well.

I have transformed and will continue to transform Ogilvy into a growth-oriented business with a growth mindset. This industry is making an amazing comeback and Ogilvy is very well positioned to capture more than its fair share of the market as it comes back in full force.

Q. You are shaking things up in global leadership. You brought in Liz Taylor from Leo Burnett as global chief creative officer a position Piyush Pandey held till recently. Now he is chairman global creative in addition to his role as executive chairman of Ogilvy India. Devika Bulchandani is running the North American operations. Stacey Ryan Cornelius is global CFO and Kim Johnson is the new global CEO of Health. Tell us what was going on in your head when you reconfigured Ogilvy’s leadership.

I had to change certain members of the Ogilvy global leadership team. That's quite honestly why I was brought in. We're doing what we're doing to transform the business in a positive way. But it was very important to me to have diversity at the top.

We have more women and people of colour at Ogilvy’s leadership than ever before. (Liz Taylor is the first woman to hold Ogilvy's top creative position.) Because we have that dynamic leadership the thinking and the decisions we make and the mindset we have basically ripples throughout our organisation to all levels.

I've also been careful to make sure that many leaders from the last several years are also part of our global leadership team because we couldn't have had that much change in our business. That would be very risky. We've got a solid balance of new leadership and leadership that has been around for several years. This blend is helping Ogilvy be super duper competitive.

Q. You spent 21 years at Deloitte before joining Ogilvy last year. Traditional agencies typically get their leaders within the family. WPP flipped the script this time. What do you think the move signalled to clients competition and the industry in general?

That creativity is the source of innovation. I came from a wonderful and successful business. But when you come to Ogilvy it’s clear the creativity is there for everyone to see. My move was basically an indication that it is much harder to scale creativity than it is to scale technology. I can acquire a lot of technology to accompany an already scaled creative business. That in a summary is the message that was delivered to the market with that move.

We actually operate in a unique space between consultancies and agencies. When you compare us to consultancies we have so much more creative prowess. When you compare us to other agencies we've got much more substance insights and industry knowledge. It’s such a powerful combination. We've got great creativity and amazing speed to value. That's really our secret sauce.

Q. But the consultants can just buy great creativity. You did that at Deloitte with the Heat acquisition. Accenture Interactive acquired Droga5. So what happens to the USP of the likes of Ogilvy?

Quite honestly there’s been a slowdown in the consultants’ focus on creativity in the last few years. In many cases there's tissue rejection of the creative assets using the already in place consulting assets because you have a creative mindset meets a consulting mindset. It's like riptides in the ocean where there's competing forces in play. It creates a lot of swirl and unnecessary energy.

If I had to put my point of view on it I just don't think the consulting businesses have scaled creativity nearly fast enough to compete against the likes of Ogilvy on the creative scale. It's just a really hard thing to do to scale creativity and it's an easier thing to do to scale technology. Ogilvy is going to do both. That's what we're out to accomplish.

Q. Let’s dial back to July 2020. Did you feel like an outsider at all when you joined the agency?

I honestly didn't. I think my feeling of not feeling like an outsider started from the very first day I learned about the Ogilvy opportunity. I've had great admiration and love for the Ogilvy brand over many years. I don’t want to say even for a minute that I am comparable to David Ogilvy but in many ways I feel a spirit-connection to him.

David Ogilvy was also born in the UK and moved to the United States. He has Scottish heritage. I was born and raised in Scotland. I think he used to sell gas stoves around the doors in Scotland as one of his first jobs. I used to sell potatoes around the doors in Scotland as one of my first jobs. (Laughs)

If I had a chance to have a Scotch with him—he was quite fond of Scotch so am I—I think we'd have a bond around just being curious people being inventive and wanting to take things to the next level and not being satisfied with what you've got.

When I was introduced to the Ogilvy team over a year ago I promised to future-proof the business over the next few years. That was one of my commitments to the team. Ogilvy is an amazing heritage brand and a business that has not been merged with any others. So it's like a thoroughbred brand and that's just a wonderful thing to be able to represent.

The auto major which sells models including Nexon Harrier and Safari in the domestic market is also looking at different kinds of chips which could be used in components where the supply situation is severe.

The automaker expects the situation to remain challenging in the ongoing quarter and some improvement in supplies only in the second half of the fiscal.

""Yes we are definitely impacted because of uncertainty of supplies but so far we have been able to manage somehow"" Tata Motors President Passenger Vehicles Business Unit (PVBU) Shailesh Chandra told PTI when asked if the company was facing issues in its production activities due to semiconductor shortage.

He said the company is mulling reworking some of the product variants in order to minimise the production loss.

""We are looking for alternate semiconductors and at times procuring directly from stockists. We are also trying to see if a more standard chip can be used in certain components where we are facing stress. Besides we are looking at trim mix so that we don't lose on the sales"" he added.

The company is working very closely with chip suppliers as well to manage the situation Chandra stated.

Semiconductors are silicon chips that cater to control and memory functions in products ranging from automobiles computers and cellphones to various other electronic items.

The usage of semiconductors in the auto industry has gone up globally in recent times with new models coming with more and more electronic features such as bluetooth connectivity and driver-assist navigation and hybrid-electric systems.

Industry experts feel that enhanced demand for automobiles in the last few months has put pressure on the global supply chains leading to a shortage.

Chandra noted that the situation in the current quarter is going to remain tough and things are expected to improve in the second half of the current fiscal.

""It is a very uncertain situation though very hard to predict"" Chandra said.

Jaguar Land Rover which is owned by Tata Motors is also facing stress on production due to the chip shortage issue.

The British brand expects semiconductor supply shortages in the July-September quarter to be greater than in the first quarter potentially resulting in wholesale volumes about 50 per cent lower than planned.

JLR currently has about 110000 global retail orders pending.

Earlier this week Hyundai Motor India MD and CEO S S Kim had also stated that the automaker is facing issues due to the semiconductor shortages.

""Our production people are managing the situation they are closely collaborating with our suppliers. Our production is very flexible so that we can adjust as per the situation...we have been affected but not that much"" he had noted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzEzODU4OTQ3MjAzNDE0MDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1 + 1 > 2: A critical review of MOF/bismuth-based semiconductor composites for boosted photocatalysis,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894720341401 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzEzODU4OTQ3MjAzNDE0MDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c2FiYWguY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Vjb25vbXkvY2hpcC1zaG9ydGFnZS1mZWFyZWQtdG8tZHJhZy1vbi1mb3ItbW9udGhzLXB1dC1icmFrZXMtb24tcmVjb3ZlcnnSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXNhYmFoLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9lY29ub215L2NoaXAtc2hvcnRhZ2UtZmVhcmVkLXRvLWRyYWctb24tZm9yLW1vbnRocy1wdXQtYnJha2VzLW9uLXJlY292ZXJ5L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chip shortage feared to drag on for months put brakes on recovery | Daily Sabah,"The automobile industry is being hit hard by a shortage of computer chips that has slowed production and is set to drag on for months.

Carmakers and suppliers have turned in strong results that beat expectations for the first half of the year but they warned that a lack of semiconductors had crimped production.

Microchips are essential for the electronics systems of modern cars and have been in short supply since the end of last year.

The start of the COVID-19 crisis in early 2020 prompted a global spending spree on electronic items – from extra monitors as people rushed to set up home offices to televisions and games consoles for beating lockdown boredom.

Temporary factory closures due to the pandemic also put pressure on supplies.

And as plants reopened electronic goods producers continued to place orders – creating an ever-increasing backlog for the chips which can be just a fraction of a millimeter long.

The situation is to some extent the fault of carmakers who scaled back orders when the pandemic hit so chipmakers shifted output to consumer electronics which was seeing a boom in demand as people splurged on equipment to work and relax at home.

That has left car brands from Volkswagen to Jaguar Land Rover scrambling to get hold of semiconductors now that sales are revving up again with many slowing or even temporarily halting production at factories.

Smartphone makers had been relatively protected so far as they had existing stockpiles of chips but they too are starting to suffer.

While automakers and analysts were initially confident the impact would be short-lived and limited they now see it as lasting through the rest of the year and the impact as more significant.

Jaguar Land Rover has warned the chip shortage could cut its third-quarter output by half.

The Volkswagen Group said the impact was likely to be ""more pronounced"" in the third quarter as it lowered its annual production forecast by roughly 450000 vehicles.

That is 5% of last year's production level or a third of the output increase that VW had expected earlier this year.

""The risk of bottlenecks and disruption in the supply of semiconductor components has intensified throughout the industry"" the German automaker said.

Apple CEO Tim Cook warned this week that the shortages are set to hit the production of iPhones and iPads. Smaller phone-makers are likely to be worse affected analysts say.

Games consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have also been in short supply.

So great is the clamor among gamers to get hold of chip-powered graphic cards needed for their playing that they have been resorting to increasingly unusual strategies.

The die-hards are tuning in to live streams on YouTube and Twitch which ring an alarm every time a card is listed for sale online.

'Chipaggedon'

VW said one way it was coping with the shortage was by favoring high-end vehicles which bring in more money.

U.S. automaker Ford noted that the keen demand for vehicles created by the shortage meant that it could offer fewer promotions as well as focus on its most profitable models.

Ford said its average sale price rose by 14% from last year as it surprised analysts with a $1.1 billion second-quarter profit.

Nissan has been forced to push back the launch of its new all-electric crossover the Ariya due to the shortage of chips which some news outlets have dubbed a ""chiptastrophe"" or ""chipaggedon.""

But the worst may already be behind automakers according to one analyst.

""We've reached the peak of the crisis"" said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer head of the Center for Automotive Research in Germany.

""The situation will improve as new production capacity becomes available but the problem won't be over by the end of 2021 and could continue until 2023"" Dudenhoeffer told AFP.

He forecast the shortage would result in an overall loss in production of 5.2 million vehicles this year.

Consumers are likely to notice longer delays and higher prices as dealers have worked through their stocks and manufacturers offer fewer promotions.

Prices for used cars have also risen as unfulfilled demand has shifted from the new car market.

Automotive supplier Valeo which uses chips in its driving assistance and automatic lighting systems says it has so far escaped a halt in production.

However the French firm notes it has been buying up any supplies it can get its hands on and expects shortages to last until next year.

Chained up

Automakers have for years moved to reduce the supplies they keep on hand to boost their financial performance.

The crisis appears to be provoking manufacturers to reevaluate this practice dubbed ""just in time.""

""Suppliers and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) are reassessing their supply chains and are trying to have more control over their sourcing from different channels and by diversifying where possible"" said Nils Poel from the European Association of Automotive Suppliers.

But as automakers overcome the chip shortage another problem awaits Dudenhoeffer warned.

With carmakers aiming to quickly ramp up the production of electric vehicles battery firms will likely have trouble keeping up and shortages could appear beginning in 2023 he said.

When will this end?

Meanwhile governments are hurrying to boost their chip-making capacities.

In May South Korea announced a whopping $451 billion investment in its bid to become a semiconductor giant while the U.S. Senate last month voted through $52 billion in subsidies for chip plants known as ""fabs.""

The European Union is seeking to double its share of global chip-manufacturing capacity to 20% of the market by 2030.

But factories cannot open overnight – particularly those that make semiconductors a delicate process that involves pressing layers of chemicals into silicon.

""Building new capacity takes time – for a new fab more than 2.5 years – so most expansions that are starting now will not increase the available capacity until 2023"" said Ondrej Burkacky senior partner and co-leader of the global semiconductors practice at consultancy McKinsey.

He added that long-term factors also meant global demand was in ""hyper-growth"" such as the trend towards companies storing their data in the cloud requiring more and more data centers to be built – sites that use huge quantities of chips.

Jean-Marc Chery CEO of Franco-Italian chip-maker STMicroelectronics said orders for next year have already outstripped his company's manufacturing capacities.

There is a broad acknowledgment within the industry that the shortage ""will last up to next year minimum"" he said.

Analysts say the continuing squeeze could lead to higher prices for consumers.

PARIS: A shortage of semiconductors has sent shockwaves through the global economy squeezing supplies of everything from cars to headphones.The dearth of chips has exposed the modern world's reliance on these miniscule components the basic building blocks of computers which allow electronic devices to process data. Why is the shortage happening and what can be done about it?The start of the Covid-19 crisis in early 2020 prompted a global spending spree on electronic items -- from extra monitors as people rushed to set up home offices to televisions and games consoles for beating lockdown boredom.Temporary factory closures due to the pandemic also put pressure on supplies.And as plants reopened electronic goods producers continued to place orders -- creating an ever-increasing backlog for the chips which can be just a fraction of a millimetre long.The pandemic isn't the only factor. A storm briefly halted production at several plants in Texas in February and a fire ripped through a Japanese factory in March.US-China tensions are also part of the story. Last August the US banned foreign companies whose chips use American technology from selling to Chinese tech giant Huawei over espionage allegations.Huawei began stockpiling semiconductors ahead of the sanctions coming into effect and other companies followed their lead further straining supplies.The car industry has been the most visible victim so far with many brands forced to slow their output in recent months.As automakers slashed production early in the pandemic their chip suppliers turned to clients from other sectors -- namely the makers of electronic goods in high demand due to the pandemic.That has left car brands from Volkswagen to Volvo  scrambling to get hold of semiconductors now that sales are revving up again.Smartphone makers had been relatively protected so far as they had existing stockpiles of chips but they too are starting to suffer.Apple CEO Tim Cook warned this week that the shortages are set to hit the production of iPhones and iPads.

-

Tulsans are enjoying baseball and beer tonight but the focus at the Drillers game isn't only on the diamond. ONEOK Stadium's beloved beer man is retiring.

If the gates open at 6 you bet the beer guy is there to greet you with coolers in hand and if you've been to a Driller's Game in the last 11 years you've likely heard Evan Elsberry cracking jokes and cracking open cold ones.

""It's the one place I can always come that everybody likes me. I can heckle and talk smack and they give me money and at the end of the day we're all friends"" said Evan Elsberry.

Elsberry said you can't ever mess with the beer man at a ballpark because no matter who you brought with you the beer man at the ballpark has more friends there than you do.

""This place has been very good to me. I've had amazing experiences. I've met some of my best friends in life here"" Elsberry said.

The man's a legend around ONEOK Stadium. He's seen players come and go but some traditions stay the same. The Army veteran himself gives out beer to a fellow serviceman every game he works and around the 8th inning Elsberry finds his favorite fans of the night and slams a beer.

Every season comes to a close.

""My last game's Saturday. Why"" said Elsberry.

Elsberry started his own business a year ago.

""I'm gonna have to close one door to open up another"" said Elsberry.

He always asks: ""How's your beer? Who's ready?""

Well is he ready? Yes he said he's ready.

""I will come but I'll probably have a beer at the second inning instead of the 8th"" said Elsberry.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Kurtzman has been with the studio for more than a decade. In 2018 Kurtzman and his Secret Hideout inked a $25 million overall deal extension with CBS Studios. The five-year deal was to have taken him through 2023. Sources say Kurtzman — who oversees five (and counting) Star Trek shows among others for the studio — asked to renegotiate his deal more than a year ago after seeing the overall deals market explode.

Before the pandemic similarly prolific writer-producers like Shonda Rhimes Ryan Murphy Dick Wolf Mike Schur and the Westworld and Stranger Things creators scored nine-figure overall deals with both streamers and traditional studios. Kurtzman now joins the echelon of television’s most valued producers as his work on Star Trek as well as other premium content like Showtime’s The Comey Rule and the upcoming The Man Who Fell to Earth makes him the most important deal for CBS Studios.

The new deal renegotiates the remaining two years on the first pact and adds another three years to keep Kurtzman and his Secret Hideout at the studio through 2026. Secret Hideout will also expand its staff to meet its growing slate of shows and development. Heather Kadin continues to lead the production company with Kurtzman senior vp Aaron Baiers and director of development Robyn Johnson.

Keeping Kurtzman was a top priority for CBS Studios and ViacomCBS considering he oversees its incredibly valuable Star Trek franchise. The company turned to Kurtzman to launch Star Trek: Discovery which was the first new live-action show in the franchise in years when it was used to help the company enter the streaming universe with the creation of CBS All Access. Following the re-merging of CBS with Viacom the platform is now called Paramount+ and is designed to reflect offerings from across the company’s vast entertainment portfolio with Star Trek remaining at its centerpiece.

“Extending our valuable partnership with the brilliant Alex Kurtzman and Secret Hideout has been a top priority for CBS and Paramount+” said CBS CEO George Cheeks. “Alex’s vision and leadership of the Star Trek franchise and his ability to create artistic and commercial series across all platforms put him in a special class of creative talent. His substantial accomplishments at CBS and the spirit of collaboration we enjoy with his team are greatly valued and we are excited to build on his already impressive slate far into the future.”

Kurtzman exec produces all five Star Trek shows including Discovery the Patrick Stewart-led Picard animated comedy Lower Decks kids-focused series Prodigy (for Nickelodeon) and the upcoming Strange New Worlds. Other spinoffs from the Star Trek franchise are also in development including Section 31 starring Michelle Yeoh. The reinvigoration of the Star Trek world for television has also spread to other digital content including podcasts global products gaming collectibles publishing and other various revenue streams that ultimately help bolster ViacomCBS’ bottom line.

“Alex and Secret Hideout have been extraordinary partners who through their prolific output of high-quality shows have allowed our studio to grow exponentially” said CBS Studios president David Stapf. “Alex’s vision and breadth of interest is unmatched as he and his team have re-ignited the Star Trek franchise with five (and counting) brilliantly unique series while at the same time creating long-running hit series for both the Network and premium spaces. As an artist Alex does it all. Not only is he a visionary who creates worlds he has that rare skill of being able to write direct produce and inspire those who work with him to be the best version of themselves. We are so grateful to be extending our relationship together.”

Beyond the Trek universe Kurtzman is currently in London directing the Paramount+-turned-Showtime drama The Man Who Fell to Earth starring Chiwetel Ejiofor. Kurtzman co-created the update of the Walter Tervis novel with friend and frequent collaborator Jenny Lumet with whom he’s also doing Showtime’s Blackbird: Lena Horne and America. (That series is based on the life of Lumet’s grandmother.) Additionally Secret Hideout is also readying Scarface and the Untouchable for Showtime. Kurtzman also oversaw development of Showtime’s The Comey Rule and is readying Kavalier and Clay alongside author Michael Chabon. (Kurtzman and Lumet’s Silence of the Lambs offshoot Clarice remains in limbo as dealmaking has stalled for its planned move from CBS to Paramount+.) On the development front Secret Hideout is also prepping New York Times at Special Bargain Rates which is based on a Stephen King short story and has also optioned multiple books including The Girl Who Could Move Sh*t with Her Mind.

“CBS Studios has been my home for over a decade because the incomparable David Stapf always finds a way to demonstrate his decency and creative passion not just for the work we do but for the many people who do it” Kurtzman said. “In David Nevins [who now oversees Paramount+ and Showtime] I’ve found a rare breed executive with auteur taste and the guts to take chances who’s encouraged us to create premium streaming and cable that pushes boundaries. And over the last year I’ve had the extraordinary privilege of being eyewitness to the steady leadership George Cheeks has brought to CBS. He’s guided Secret Hideout and me personally with thoughtful care and strategic brilliance as the rules of our business grow and change daily. As Secret Hideout expands its footprint across ViacomCBS I can imagine no greater partners and I’m so excited to tell more stories together for years to come.”

One Producer Hopes to Make It So. (Published 2021),"Like so many other writer-directors Alex Kurtzman grew up worshiping film.

But he is adaptable — and in the streaming era that is a very lucrative trait.

Mr. Kurtzman the onetime writer of the “Transformers” movies and the director of the 2017 film “The Mummy” recently renegotiated his deal at CBS Studios into one of the richest there. Under the $160 million five-and-a-half-year agreement he will continue to shepherd the growing “Star Trek” television universe for ViacomCBS’s Paramount+ streaming platform.

He will also create shows including a limited series based on “The Man Who Fell to Earth” which he will direct for Showtime and the long-awaited adaptation of Michael Chabon’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.” That limited series is likely to be sold to an outside streaming service.

Mr. Kurtzman’s deal is the latest in a string intended to give prolific producers like Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy for Netflix and Jordan Peele with Amazon Studios free rein to create content that can feed insatiable consumer appetites and hopefully boost subscriptions for streaming. This one puts the ambitions of CBS Studios — the production arm for the networks and channels under the ViacomCBS umbrella — squarely in the hands of the 47-year-old Mr. Kurtzman.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMS90di9uZXdzL2FsZXgta3VydHptYW4tc3Rhci10cmVrLW1pY2hlbGxlLXllb2gtc2VjdGlvbi0zMS0xMjM1MDMyMDg1L9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMS90di9uZXdzL2FsZXgta3VydHptYW4tc3Rhci10cmVrLW1pY2hlbGxlLXllb2gtc2VjdGlvbi0zMS0xMjM1MDMyMDg1L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Star Trek Captain Alex Kurtzman Extends TV Pact With CBS Studios to 2026,"Alex Kurtzman the prolific producer who pilots the Star Trek franchise for CBS Studios and Paramount Plus has extended his exclusive overall TV deal with the ViacomCBS units through 2026.

Kurtzman’s Secret Hideout banner will expand under the new agreement to add an executive to help manage its growing slate of series. Longtime Kurtzman partner Heather Kadin remains the head of content for Secret Hideout which is shepherding five Star Trek-branded series for CBS Studios and Paramount Plus along with drama and limited series such as Showtime’s “The Comey Rule” and the upcoming “The Man Who Fell to Earth.” The company has become a reliable supplier of high-end shows for CBS Showtime and Paramount Plus.

Kurtzman is known for his agility in balancing multiple roles as creator writer producer director and showrunner. Secret Hideout has planted its flag at CBS Studios since 2016 although Kurtzman has worked with the studio for more than a decade on such series as “Hawaii Five-0” “Scorpion” and “Salvation.”

Keeping Kurtzman in the ViacomCBS family was important to the conglomerate at a moment of skyrocketing competition for top creative talent. Kurtzman is the creative steward who plots out the storylines and distribution strategies for Star Trek content for years to come. At present the Trek tote board encompasses Paramount Plus’ “Star Trek: Discovery” “Star Trek: Picard” “Star Trek: Lower Decks” and the upcoming animated series “Star Trek: Prodigy” for Nickelodeon aimed at introducing the “Star Trek” world to a new generation. And on tap for next year is another origins story series “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” which will follow the early space-trotting adventures of Capt. Christopher Pike as well as Spock and Number One.

“Alex’s vision and leadership of the Star Trek franchise and his ability to create artistic and commercial series across all platforms put him in a special class of creative talent” said George Cheeks president and CEO of CBS. “His substantial accomplishments at CBS and the spirit of collaboration we enjoy with his team are greatly valued and we are excited to build on his already impressive slate far into the future.”

Heather Kadin Secret Hideout

Kurtzman also guides all of the Star Trek universe’s digital content social media podcasts and games as well as merchandising and collectibles. Secret Hideout will recruit a franchise manager to help oversee the Star Trek frontier. Secret Hideout noted that it remains in development on another Trek series “Section 31” with Michelle Yeoh (an alum of “Star Trek: Discovery”) attached to star. Also working with Kadin at Secret Hideout are Aaron Baiers senior vice president and Robyn Johnson director of development.

“Alex’s vision and breadth of interest is unmatched as he and his team have re-ignited the Star Trek franchise with five (and counting) brilliantly unique series while at the same time creating long-running hit series for both the (CBS) network and premium spaces” said CBS Studios president David Stapf. “As an artist Alex does it all. Not only is he a visionary who creates worlds he has that rare skill of being able to write direct produce and inspire those who work with him to be the best version of themselves.”

Kurtzman has stayed busy outside of Star Trek content with a range of other shows and as a hands-on creator showrunner and director. Upcoming projects include an adaptation of the cult-fave Walter Tevis novel “The Man Who Fell to Earth” which Kurtzman is steering with executive producer Jenny Lumet. Lumet and Kurtzman are also teaming on a Lena Horne biopic series for Showtime (Horne is Lumet’s grandmother). Secret Hideout is also developing a project about FBI stalwart Eliot Ness’ long pursuit of mob boss Al Capone.

Other projects in the works at Secret Hideout include “New York Times at Special Bargain Rates” based on a Stephen King short story adapted by Jessica Mecklenberg and it has a number of book options including “The Girl Who Could Move Sh*t with Her Mind” by Jackson Ford.

Kurtzman praised CBS Studios as having been a nurturing home for his TV efforts for mroe than 10 years.

“CBS Studios has been my home for over a decade because the incomparable David Stapf always finds a way to demonstrate his decency and creative passion not just for the work we do but for the many people who do it” he said.

Kurtzman credited David Nevins Showtime chief and Paramount Plus scripted chief as being “a rare breed executive with auteur taste and the guts to take chances who’s encouraged us to create premium streaming and cable that pushes boundaries.” And he credited Cheeks with helping to guide Secret Hideout and himself “with thoughtful care and strategic brilliance as the rules of our business grow and change daily.

Diego Perez for Combate Global

Carlos “Goku” Arana considered pursuing a career in law enforcement but his passion for martial arts led him to make his debut in la jaula.

Arana meets Jimmy Sandlin this Sunday August 1 in a superfight at 155 pounds.

The event will air on Paramount + in English alongside Univision and TUDN USA in Spanish at 11 p.m. ET.

Nicknamed “Goku” since his teenage years for his “never give up attitude” Arana hails from Guadalajara Mexico but has spent a significant amount of his life in the U.S. gaining an education and practicing wrestling since 13 years old. Wrestling served as a gateway to mixed martial arts (MMA) while rising through the collegiate ranks at Santa Ana College; Arana would grapple with professional fighters during their preparation for an upcoming bout.

Once he transferred and graduated from York College Arana planned to be a cop. After visiting his mother and family in Mexico an activity he rarely got to enjoy as financial issues caused his family to relocate to Mexico while he was studying in the U.S. After this visit he” decided he wanted to see what [he] could do with [his] wrestling pedigree at the professional level” and skipped out on going to the police academy after all his paperwork was filled out.

After “fully committing to MMA” and relocating to Mexico back to his family he did well in several Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu tournaments so he got offered a fight on two weeks’ notice. Although he lost his first bout he discovered that this is the path that will truly “provide for [his] family and set a great example [for his] siblings.”

When not fighting Arana is a mentor and role model to his siblings and others at the gym Lobo Gym MMA passing down his vast knowledge of folk style wrestling. Arana has a brother that is 16 years old and a sister that is 19 years old: both are amateur fighters following in his footsteps. MMA has boosted their confidence and they appear to have the same passion he has for the sport. “It’s more nerve-racking cornering than fighting. It’s very high pressure especially when cornering one of your siblings… yet it’s one of the most beautiful moments seeing them win and master their craft.”"

In the 48 hours after the NBA Draft the Thunder was ready to welcome the newest members of the Thunder with the type of respect and reverence reserved for family – which is exactly what they now are.

On Saturday the Thunder introduced rookies Josh Giddey Tre Mann Jeremiah Robinson-Earl and Aaron Wiggins to a crowd of team officials community heroes and media. Freshly-pressed jerseys were presented and the four NBA dreamers held their Thunder threads proudly as Thunder General Manager and Executive Vice President Sam Presti beamed. The message from Presti was clear – the quartet of newcomers were selected first and foremost because of the type of people they are. In Oklahoma City the type of citizen joining the organization is the highest priority.

“We draw a lot of our inspiration from the people in Oklahoma” Presti said. “Hardworking values-based high-character. We want to be representative of that. I think this group of people as you get to know them will resonate with you both on and off the floor.”

As Presti gushed the four players’ families blushed. Sitting in the first few rows of the press conference on the club level of Paycom Center the four players’ families got to look on as Presti praised the new group of players for their makeup and noted that each were prepared mentally for the arduous task ahead of consistent improvement. Media members peppered questions to each of the players and they all spoke about their own games and approaches to becoming professionals and also what it meant to know that the Thunder organization values them holistically not just on the floor.

“It’s showing that everything that I did from being a person basketball player student everything paid off” said Mann who was selected 18th overall out of the University of Florida and will wear number 23 for the Thunder. “It feels great to hear that.”

“It gives a lot of credit to my mom the people around me that kind of helped me become who I am today” said Robinson-Earl a Kansas City native and Villanova Wildcat whom the Thunder traded up to select at 32nd overall. He’ll wear number 50.

The headlining selection for the Thunder at Thursday’s draft at Barclays Center in Brooklyn was 18-year-old Josh Giddey a dynamic playmaker drafted sixth overall who Presti called simply “a basketball player” when pressed on what exact position he’ll play. Giddey who grew up in Melbourne and began playing in Australia’s NBL for the Adelaide 36ers already understands a thing or two about the generosity of spirit required to be a fruitful member of a professional club.

“Being a good person off the court is such a big part of having a good sound organization” said Giddey in his Australian accent. “That’s what Sam really empowers having good dudes. I think we have a bunch of them on this team. It’s a big part of culture purpose going forward. It’s a young team so hopefully this can be something special leading to success in coming years.”

Giddey who will wear number 3 for the Thunder comes from a family of basketballers including both his parents and his sister who plays at Tulsa’s Oral Roberts University. That’ll make trips across the Pacific Ocean very efficient for the Giddey family moving forward and will keep the youngster connected to the people that helped shape him as a child.

While Giddey was off and shaking NBA Commissioner Adam Silver’s hand very early on Thursday night Wiggins had to wait until the 55th pick to finally hear his name called. As a result his level of gratitude was brimming off of him as he held up his number 21 jersey. As a child Wiggins’ family taught him to be well-rounded encouraging him to take up music dance and theater in addition to athletics. His ability to connect with those of all stripes will pay dividends and it’s a quality he sees in the Thunder’s philosophy too.

“This organization is really personable and just being able to talk to people and get to know who they are and their character and everything it's been really fun” said Wiggins. “It's awesome knowing that you know they think highly of you as a person and it's not just basketball.”

Each of the four players the Thunder has brought into the organization bring unique attributes to the floor – Giddey’s an impressive passer Mann a knockdown shooter Robinson-Earl a physical defender and Wiggins an eye-catching athlete. There will be plenty of time starting with Summer League next weekend to get a baseline evaluation on where each player is and where they can grow. What matters right now on the first day of their Thunder journey is the approach they bring to the organization.

“Dynamic talents different skills different approaches come from all over the world but they have one thing in common” Presti said. “They know how to work and they know how to put time in and they understand how to play for one another.”",,,,,,,,,

Depop describes its site as a place «where the next generation comes together to discover new items … transforming what fashion looks like.» It’s set up a lot like Instagram with photos and profiles appearing in a feed so users can scroll through and see what they like.

Melanie Weir/Business Insider



Once you’ve liked enough items you’ll also be able to use the «My DNA» feature which recommends new items based on your personal style. You can also follow users to add them to your feed.

How to sell things on Depop

Selling on Depop is a little more involved but still pretty simple.

If you haven’t done so already the first thing you’ll be prompted to do is connect your PayPal account. This isn’t necessary for buyers because they can choose to use a credit card but if you want to sell the money always has to go through a PayPal account for security reasons.

The good news is this makes it easier to get your money – all you need to do is cash out with PayPal as you normally would.

Once you connect your PayPal you’re ready to start selling. You can do this on the website or on the app – but since you need to use the mobile app to connect to PayPal the first time you do it it’s easier to use the app.







How to set up your Depop shop

On the app click the camera button in the center of the bottom toolbar.

To sell an item on Depop mobile tap the camera icon.

Melanie Weir/Business Insider



The first time you sell an item on Depop you’ll be prompted to set up your shop – this is essentially like setting up your profile. Think of it as the front-facing image of your business like designing a shop window. You want your shop to reflect the kinds of things you’ll be selling.

You’ll be asked to add a photo or logo a site description and to connect to your social media if you want to. You can also skip these steps; if you’re just looking to sell a few odd items this isn’t as important but if you’re looking to create your own brand make sure it reflects the style of your brand.

Follow the prompts to add your shop info.

Melanie Weir/Business Insider



Next you’ll be asked to connect to your PayPal account. If you don’t have one you’ll be prompted to create one instead.

Once your PayPal is connected you also need to enter your name and address – this is for billing purposes and won’t be shared without your knowledge. You’ll also need to specify if you are selling as a business or an individual.

Once you’ve set up your shop you’re ready to list your first item.

How to list an item on Depop

To list an item on the Depop app tap the same camera button you used to set up your shop.

To do so on the desktop site click «Sell» in the upper right corner.

To sell on desktop click «Sell» in the top right corner of the site.

Melanie Weir/Business Insider



The most important part of listing an item on Depop is the photos since this is how people browse the site and find things they like. It’s good to show your product from all angles or on a model if possible. You can also add a video if you like to show how the item looks in real life.

Another important aspect is the description. You’ll want to include all relevant info including color cut shape and material as well as any damage or quirks it might have so that people know what to expect. The keywords you use in the description will help others find your item in searches. You can also include up to five hashtags for this purpose.

This is important because if the item is not as described customers can ask for a refund.

You’ll also need to add some basic information about the item: where it’s coming from so people know how long it’ll take to ship and how much shipping may cost; what category it falls under such as menswear shoes or art; its condition from brand new to used and fair; and of course the item’s price.

The price is up to you but do some research first to make sure it’s comparable to other similar items on the site – if it’s too high you might not get any interest. If it’s too low you could get less than it’s worth.

Add photos a description and other item info.

Melanie Weir/Business Insider



If you want to rank higher in a search you can also enhance your listing with extra tags for color and style.

How to add shipping info on Depop

If you choose to ship with Depop they will ask you to select the size of your package based on weight which affects shipping costs.

You’ll also be asked if you want to include free shipping for your customer – free shipping makes them more likely to purchase but it also deducts the cost of the shipping from your total profit rather than factoring it into the final total.

If you choose to ship with Depop choose your package size and decide whether you want to offer free shipping.

Melanie Weir/Business Insider



If you choose to ship the item yourself the only decision you need to make is whether you want to offer free shipping. If you don’t you’ll be asked to specify a shipping cost for the customer to pay.

If you choose your own shipping and you want the customer to pay you’ll need to specify the cost yourself.

Melanie Weir/Business Insider



Drop shipping or selling without inventory

In some cases Depop users want to sell items that they don’t have in their possession yet items that are made and fulfilled remotely as needed – when the item is sent directly from the manufacturer to the buyer this is called drop shipping. Depop allows this but it has specific rules users need to follow.

All of these items need to be original designs by the seller.

The photos posted of the item still need to be real – digital renderings photos from suppliers and stock photos are not allowed.

Your description of the item must disclose that you are using a third-party manufacturer.

NBA Twitter was divided on whether LeBron’s reaction was the best course of action.

“That’s literally assault” wrote one fan on Twitter. Another mentioned that you shouldn’t just “run up on someone like that” and said that LeBron’s reaction was justified. Overall Twitter was left divided on the subject. You can check out reactions below.

Regardless LeBron has been having a pretty amazing 2021. He’s fresh off the success of Space Jam: A New Legacy and recently became the first NBA player to become a billionaire while he’s still playing the game. Since being drafted in 2003 LeBron has earned $330 million over the course of his career. Most of his earnings come from merchandise licensing media. and endorsements. Not to mention his brand partnerships with AT&T Beats Blaze Pizza GMC Nike PepsiCo Rimowa and Walmart all rake in more than $100 million a year for the legendary athlete.

With that being said Kevin Durant isn’t far behind him. The NBA star brought in $580 million in career earnings and is expected to bring in $1 billion as a result of his investments and 10 year deal with Nike. Steph Curry as an NBA player will likely break through the billion-dollar threshold as well. A lot of people pointed out that Michael Jordan has a very bloated net worth now but he was unable to cross that billion-dollar mark while he was playing. He wouldn’t have earned a billion dollars during his time on the court either.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3RoZXByaW50LmluL2ZlYXR1cmUvYnJhbmRtYS9yaW16aW0tcG9wdWxhci1kZXNpLWplZXJhLWRyaW5rLWJvdWdodC1hbmQtcmVsYXVuY2hlZC1ieS1jb2NhLWNvbGEtYmVmb3JlLWl0LWxvc3QtYWxsLWZpenovNzA1Njk2L9IBigFodHRwczovL3RoZXByaW50LmluL2ZlYXR1cmUvYnJhbmRtYS9yaW16aW0tcG9wdWxhci1kZXNpLWplZXJhLWRyaW5rLWJvdWdodC1hbmQtcmVsYXVuY2hlZC1ieS1jb2NhLWNvbGEtYmVmb3JlLWl0LWxvc3QtYWxsLWZpenovNzA1Njk2Lz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RimZim popular desi jeera drink bought and relaunched by Coca-Cola before it lost all fizz,"“A soft drink was considered a luxury in those days. Not everyone could afford it” said Ramachandran Mahesh a retired Army colonel now working with a corporate house in Delhi and past RimZim loyalist.

Today not many millennials and Gen Z will probably recall the ‘chatpata’ desi drink but after the exit of Coke from the Indian market in 1977 — the company had refused to bow down to the Indian government’s provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) 1973 — Indian consumers were left with few soft drink options to choose from. Among the pop picks at the time were Gold Spot Campa Cola and RimZim.

New Delhi: A jeera-flavoured fizzy drink may not make everyone’s tastebuds ‘pop’ in excitement but back in the 1980s RimZim had its own set of loyalists who made it one of the top-selling drinks of that time. This was before Coca-Cola acquired the homegrown brand in 1994 and took it off the market before relaunching it in 2018.

Many though preferred its taste before the relaunch by Coke.

Pointing out how the original version of the drink was “way better” a businessman in New Delhi who first tried RimZim when he was around five years old in the early ’80s told ThePrint: “I wish you could taste the original RimZim. It used to come in small glass bottles around 200-250 ml in size and had a unique way of appealing to the distinct Indian taste palette. The relaunched version according to him was a ‘pale copy’ of the original.”

Origin & relaunch

Launched by the Ramesh Chauhan-owned Parle — Chauhan is often referred to as the cola king — RimZim was a popular drink of the 198Os.

After Coca-Cola returned to India following the economic liberalisation of the 1990s the foreign company acquired RimZim from Parle along with some other beverage brands owned by the company such as Thums Up Limca Maaza Gold Spot and Citra in 1994.

Since Coke was more into expanding mainstream drinks at the time the focus was on Thums Up and Limca rather than RimZim which had a niche market. The jeera drink was therefore taken off the market at the time.

By 2012 however the company was thinking about relaunching RimZim.

“Coke viewed India as a country which had demonstrated a love for the ethnic drink whether it be a cola or one with an Indian twist like Thums Up and Campa and Dixie” said brand strategist Harish Bijoor. “Coke wanted more than just Cola. RimZim offered a readymade variant which was a hit in the northern belt.”

In 2017 the masala soda category was estimated to see a growth of over three times in the next three-four years. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola were the two big organised players in the space.

The latter relaunched RimZim — in a new package and a spicier taste — in 2018.

“The drink was reintroduced in select states — such as Gujarat Karnataka Andhra Pradesh and Odisha — where the market showed an affinity for it” a beverage industry expert told ThePrint on condition of anonymity. It was also taken to Bangladesh by Coca-Cola.

The initial response to the new version was quite encouraging according to the expert.

Quirky taste quirkier commercials

With its tagline ‘Atpata Nahi Chatpata’ Coke marketed RimZim through various quirky advertisements.

One such commercial launched in May 2018 showed a shocked man staring at a boy buying dinosaur eggs from a grocery store. When he turns to his friend to check his reaction the friend takes a sip of RimZim (probably the manufacture’s nod to the drink’s unexpected taste) before saying “Atpata Nahi Yeh to Chatpata hai”.

However because of competition from other desi-flavoured drinks (such as PepsiCo’s Nimbooz masala soda Bindu Fizz Jeera Masala and Parle Agro’s Dhishoom Jeera Masala Soda among others) RimZim started losing its niche market.

“RimZim was a taste that was regional. It continued to do well where it traditionally did well. A national rollout just could not work. In the bargain the brand fell through the slats” said Bijoor.

For some time even after it disappeared from the shelves in most stores the drink could be bought online from the site coke2home.com in six cities including Ahmedabad Bengaluru Chennai Gandhinagar Mumbai and Hyderabad. But that option is no longer available.

The spiced soda can still be bought from the virtual grocery store farms2fresh.

The United States is buying 500 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine including 200 million set to be delivered around the world by the end of this year. The remainder will be sent out by June 2022 the White House said in a statement.

This “largest ever purchase and donation of vaccines by a single country” will “help supercharge the global fight against the pandemic” the White House said.

Biden who is attending a G7 summit in Britain this week “will also call on the world’s global democracies to do their parts in contributing to the global supply of safe and effective vaccines.”

The United States has come under criticism for sitting on huge stocks of unused vaccines something the government says was initially necessary as a precautionary measure in its own race to get shots into the arms of Americans.

However with domestic vaccination rates now having reached 64 percent of adults receiving at least one dose Washington is moving quickly to reclaim global leadership on the issue.

Dismissing suggestions that the United States is in a so-called vaccine diplomacy contest with Russia and China the White House describes its initiatives as a return to multilateral action after the nationalist isolationism of Donald Trump’s presidency.

This new huge surge in donations aims “to save lives and end the pandemic” the White House said.

With the pandemic largely tamed at home “the United States is using the power of our democracy the ingenuity of American scientists and the strength of American manufacturing to beat the pandemic globally by helping to vaccinate the world.”

The vaccines will be distributed through the international Covax program to “low and lower-middle income nations.”

The announcement came on top of an earlier pledge to donate some 80 million vaccines by the end of June as well as a $2 billion contribution to COVAX funding.

“President Biden has been clear that borders cannot keep this pandemic at bay and has vowed that our nation will be the arsenal of vaccines” the statement said.

Biden hinted at the announcement Wednesday before boarding Air Force One bound for Britain to meet with fellow G7 leaders from Britain Canada France Germany Italy and Japan.

Asked if he had a vaccine strategy for the world he said: “I have one and I’ll be announcing it.”

The New York Times said Biden would appear with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to make the announcement.

The deal would see the US paying “not for profit” price for the doses according to US media reports.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

The death of Chinese ed-tech?

Last week China flipped the switch and went nuclear on its burgeoning private ed-tech industry. The draft policy stated that all tutoring companies would be barred from going public (IPO) raising funds and acquiring other educational services. And while everybody believes the new set of rules may effectively decimate the entire industry altogether we have to ask— Why? Why is China doing this?

Why cigarette companies want you to quit smoking

Jacek Olczak the CEO of Philip Morris International — most notable for making Marlboro cigarettes — recently announced that they’d stop selling cigarettes in the UK within the next 10 years. In fact he said that his company wants to “See the world without cigarettes…”. And while at first glance it may sound preposterous it all starts making sense as soon as we begin digging deeper?

So what's prompted a sudden change in heart you ask? Well you can read the full story right here.

We all know RBI has been working towards developing a new national digital currency. And while the topic has certainly garnered a lot of interest there's still a lot of unanswered questions.



How will it work with the current financial system? Will it be disruptive? Will it complement the banking structure? Or will it be something else entirely? Well if stuff like this is bothering you then you should definitely check out the Wednesday Newsletter.

Chicken prices to the moon

Over the last few weeks chicken prices have skyrocketed across many parts of India. This includes the farm gate price — where farmers sell live birds to customers. And the retail price — where you get dressed chicken without the feathers and other organs.



And while some people believe this could be a temporary blip poultry farmers aren’t convinced that this is in fact the case. They allege that prices are on the rise because it’s now more expensive to raise poultry and they have some solid facts to back their argument.

What might these facts be you ask? That's what we looked at in Thursday’s Newsletter.

No matter what else she might experience in life Kate Steward will always have Omaha — where in June she cultivated one of those once-only undertakings. She plunged with all her might into a watery odyssey that forged a kinship between her and the other fastest swimmers in the U.S. for this generation.

All things considered the Bartlesville High School product clocked in with powerful performances at the U.S. Olympic Swim Trials held in early June in Omaha Neb.

Steward competed the first weekend in the Wave I phase — a swim-in qualification for the Wave 2 competition at which the U.S. Olympic team would be decided the following weekend.

Steward gave all she had to try to qualify during the Wave I battles.

She placed high in her heats in both the women's 100m and 200m breaststroke events and advanced to the finals.

In her 100 breaststroke final Steward tore through the water to finish fifth (1:10.71).

Steward rocketed to second in her 200 breaststroke heat (2:32.74)

She came in fifth in her 200 breaststroke final (2:32.12) only a second behind the winner.

Following that race Steward's hectic swim year took a brief hiatus.

She is now heading into her senior season on the women's swim team at the University of Kansas and still focused on trying to capture the elusive honor of qualifying for the NCAA championships next spring.

Other than that Steward has pretty much achieved everything a competitive pool warrior would want on his or her resume.

Competing in the Olympic trials heads the list.

""It was really great"" she said. ""It was definitely the coolest meet I'll ever go to in my life. It was so cool to be surrounded by so many other great athletes. ... It's definitely an opportunity I'll only get once in my life.""

What most touched Steward was the encouragement of family friends and teammates ""all these people going out of their way to support me. I felt very very blessed by the good people around me.""

She also praised the ambiance fostered by the organizers.

""We got to walk out of the tunnel and it was all on TV and they announce your name and everything"" Steward recalled. ""I definitely had never experienced anything like that before. It was a good opportunity.""

Steward remained in the running to meet the Wave 2 cuts but barely came up short.

Even so ""I was really happy with the way I swam"" she said. ""I think in this particular situation I was trying to soak up the experience more than anything.""

And to appreciate the nostalgia.

""I actually thought whenever I was warming up for one of my races this was going to be my last tapered meet ever"" she said. ""I thought what an exciting way to end my career.""

But she's not done swimming competitively altogether.

Her final college season at Kansas beckons.

She was a part of a big group of teammates that trained hard together during the summer.

Her success in the trials also ""showed me I still have room to get better"" Steward said. ""There's still things I can improve on. It's making me excited. It always good to have opportunities to grow.""

She's been close the past three seasons to earn a spot in the NCAA meet and has one more chance.

When Steward calls it a career her wave of glory will extend back to her youth for the Phillips 66 Splash Club and Bartlesville High swim team.

She helped elevated Bartlesville to four-straight state swimming titles and set multiple state records during the process.

As mentioned she's spent part of the summer training at the Kansas facility.

""We don't have to wear masks and safety glasses in the weight room anymore"" she said. ""I'm very optimistic for a normal season.""

Steward also stands perched on the edge of her final college season with her health pretty much in tact.

Last summer she endured surgery on both knees and had to battle through the rehabilitation and regaining her strength and rhythm for several months.

""I pretty much have made a full recovery"" she said. ""They only occasionally bother me but not as close as what they were before. ... I feel like I've made full recovery and I don't have to worry about it.""

Steward also is looking forward to student teaching this coming student year as she wraps up her studies in education.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc2Z5aW1ieS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy9wZXJtaXRzLWZpbGVkLWZvci0zNzUtcGFya2VyLWF2ZW51ZS1yb2Rlby1jb250cmEtY29zdGEtY291bnR5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Permits Filed for 375 Parker Avenue Rodeo Contra Costa County,"Permits have been filed for a three-story mixed-use development at 375 Parker Avenue in Rodeo Contra Costa County. Rodeo is a relatively small town of roughly 8700 residents along Interstate 80. The proposed development would create 22 new units and ground-level retail at the intersection of Parker Avenue and Fourth Street.

The three-story building will produce 19 market-rate apartments and three units for inclusionary housing. The retail will be positioned at ground level spanning approximately 1600 square feet. The application estimated the construction job will cost $3 million. The property is currently vacant once occupied by an automotive and engine repair shop.

The history of Rodeo as a town started in the late 19th century with agriculture and ranch development. As a small satellite to Vallejo and Richmond its place in pop culture is fixed by being the birthplace of Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day. Rodeo’s built environment is largely dominated by the large Phillips 66 oil refinery spanning about as much land area as a half of the town’s residential and commercial development.

Public records show the property last sold in October of 2017 for $345000 with the buyer and seller unlisted.

Council Oak Comprehensive Healthcare located at the former site of Tulsa Cancer Treatment Centers of America nods in its name to a grand oak tree near downtown Tulsa that served as the tribe’s epicenter after its members survived forced removal from their Alabama homelands in the 1800s.

Officials hope the new facility will mark a new beginning of its own.

During a naming ceremony for the hospital on Friday the tribe’s secretary of health reflected on an urgent need revealed during the COVID-19 pandemic and one that continues in the onslaught of the coronavirus’ delta variant.

“The pandemic taught us a lesson” Shawn Terry said. “For the first time in history we had patients dying in our Okmulgee and Okemah hospitals because we couldn’t get them to Tulsa.

“We can never be in a position again when our patients coming from these rural communities need a place to go to have access to care and the Tulsa hospitals are full which is the exact situation that we’re in today with this pandemic.”

The sudden up-and-out of Cancer Treatment Centers of America due to cited insurance limitations in late March was the answer the tribe was looking for.

“About 15 minutes after the announcement came out in the newspaper there were several of us that are here in this room who were already texting saying ‘We need to go look at this facility’” Terry shared drawing chuckles from the crowd.

“And as a health care delivery person for 30 years if I had to design a facility that would almost perfectly match what the needs of our Muscogee citizens are I would almost design this building.”

The Muscogee Nation National Council voted 12-0 in June to purchase the former Cancer Treatment Centers of America facility in south Tulsa.

The Muscogee Nation Department of Health hopes to open a hospital on the existing campus in early spring that could provide high levels of care to its citizens and the public. For now it plans to open the doors to some outpatient services next week including an urgent care clinic a neurology clinic and the clinic of a family physician who specializes in HIV and hepatitis.

Tribal district representatives Oklahoma legislators and Tulsa leaders gathered at the building off 81st Street at U.S. 169 to witness the name reveal and celebrate the move. Tribal dignitaries gave thanks for God’s provision as a Muscogee Nation Department of Health employee led the crowd in a Muscogee hymn.

Grover Wind a chaplain over the health services shared his joy as an elder at seeing the tribe’s health care grow calling it a “phenomenal” change.

“This opens up so many opportunities for healing for our citizens” Wind said. “It shows such a movement for what we want to do for our people.”

Wind attributed much of the growth to Terry and his administration calling Terry a man with vision who demonstrates that “his compassion and care for our citizens is genuine.”

Terry spent much of his time at the podium thanking everyone who attended the event and those who made the purchase possible expressing his excitement and hope for the future.

“Creek Nation we won’t be put in that position again” Terry said. “We’re going to be able to have access to care for our citizens and the Muscogee people should be very proud.

“This is really for you.”

She is the first woman to hold that title.

“I am truly honored to serve as the Wisconsin state director for the Selective Service System” said Rohan a member of American Legion Post 385 in Verona Wis. “Its mission is critical to national security and is an important keystone to the nation’s preparedness.”

Rohan’s role will be to serve as liaison between the Selective Service System and the governor’s office. She will represent the governor and the Selective Service regarding agency matters in Wisconsin.

Kenney said of Rohan’s appointment “We are honored to have her as our state director. She is an outstanding leader and patriot.”

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers nominated Rohan for the position. She was appointed by former Selective Service Director Donald M. Benton.

Rohan replaced John Cumicek who served in the role for more than 30 years and before that 20 years as a Reserve Force Officer.

An Army veteran Rohan was elected in 2017 as the first female national commander of the nearly 2 million member American Legion. Her theme as national commander was “Family First” and her fund-raising project generated donations for the Veterans & Children Foundation (V&CF). The foundation provides Temporary Financial Assistance grants to disadvantaged children of veterans and training for accredited American Legion service officers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA4LzAxL2NpdGl6ZW5zLWJhbmstc2h1dHRlcmluZy10aHJlZS1tb3JlLWxvY2FsLWJyYW5jaGVzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citizens Bank closing 3 more Philadelphia-area branches - Philadelphia Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2021/08/01/citizens-bank-shuttering-three-more-local-branches.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA4LzAxL2NpdGl6ZW5zLWJhbmstc2h1dHRlcmluZy10aHJlZS1tb3JlLWxvY2FsLWJyYW5jaGVzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

In the past builders either did a hand drawing or used a series of stencils to quickly come up with a pool design concept. It’s only been within the last decade that pool companies felt the need to begin incorporating free designs into their sales process. In years past this had become a common practice. Builders created advertisements with tag lines like “Get a FREE Design” to attract homeowners hoping to sell them a pool and gave the designs away for free.

The days of having to give away free designs are over. Ads like this hurt the industry.

One thing that the pandemic has done is reignite an interest in swimming pools the likes of which has never been seen. The days of having to go that route and give away a valuable service like design are behind us. Builders no longer have to do that to entice homeowners. These days everyone and their mother-in-law wants a pool. It’s time to start saying no to free design.

A decade ago using 3D design presentations was considered a differentiator. Over the past 10 years that perception has changed. These days the majority of large pool companies incorporate some aspect of 3D design as part of their sales process. Homeowners have come to expect a 3D rendering and their tolerance for quality is quite high given the status of the technology available today.

Why Giving Away Design Is Bad For The Industry

One major and significant aspect of doing designs is often overlooked and that is the amount of time needed to create a sophisticated 3d design. Even when using cutting edge technology like Structure Studios a design could take anywhere from hours to even days or weeks to complete depending on how elaborate the design plan is.

The average homeowner in 2021 expects to see a 3D rendering of what their pool design will look like.

Accommodating every single prospect that could conceivably want a pool this season with a 3D design is impossible says Cameron Rhodes co-owner of Southern Poolscapes. “We’ve gotten away from doing free designs a while ago. Honestly with the amount of folks that want an inground pool right now you really don’t need to be doing that anymore.”

Ryan Baird of Beyond Blue Pools in Houston said that he has done away with free designs altogther. “Honestly I feel like if a homeowner truly values the work that is going into the design they should pay for it. There is a cost associated with doing these designs as well as how much time they take.” said Baird whose design / build firm has had their busiest season ever.

Design is a Painstaking Process

There is a growing consensus in the pool & spa industry to do away with free designs. Many experts feel that offering a design service for free commoditizes and devalues the creativity and labor that is involved with creating a custom backyard design for the customer.

The entire process of creating a custom 3d rendering for a customer is a time consuming process. So why not charge for it?

The level of detail and intricacy programs like Vip 3D are capable of achieving has upped the bar for pool designers considerably. An incredible amount of personalization is involved with creating one of these designs. Just learning the software itself takes professional pool designers a long time to perfect.

Swimming pool designer Brandt Gibert of Windgate Custom Pools said his process is seldom a one off design. “Each version of one of my designs takes me a few hours to complete and customers sometimes want to see 2 or 3 different concepts before they come to a decision.”

“Even using a design template only gives you the basis for creating a foundation for a backyard design. It’s not like you can hand that to a customer and say here’s your design.” said Denis Nadeau of Your Backyard Haven in Ontario. When formulating the overall design concept of the pool experts say it’s difficult or impossible to make a one design fits all type of solution.

“There is no cookie cutter or templatized approach towards designing custom luxury inground pools” said Jason DeBosky of Crystal Blue Aquatics “People want something unique. A truly discerning homeowner is going to want to see their home their environment and the elements discussed during project planning in their design concept. I don’t know how you make that happen with a template.”

Lack of Accreditation

Being a designer in the pool industry has its own unique set of challenges. Most designers get their experience once they are actually in the industry. While there are a number of training programs such as Genesis and Watershape University there are currently no prepatory or formalized college programs specifically focusing on pool design. Quite often pool builders who are adept at construction struggle with learning the design aspect and mastering the software. In fact many builders prefer to subcontract out the design process entirely and pay a staff to produce designs for their customers. Which makes one wonder if companies are paying for the designs why are they giving them away for free?

Education is one thing that differentiates pool designers from landscape architects or engineers. Each has accredited college degrees associated with those disciplines. Many pool builders say that not having a pool design focused degree they can hang their hat on has been what has held them back from charging for their services.

The vast majority of professional designers have spent weeks and months first learning and then perfecting this new design craft by watching a series of tutorials and engaging in the trial and error process of teaching themselves to be 3D designers without any formal instruction. This certainly begs the question “how does the pool industry determine who is qualified to be a pool designer?” It’s not an easy question to answer.

One question that is easy to answer is “why stop giving away free designs?” Many pool companies are reluctant to do away with free design because they consider it a value added service. This train of thought is flawed and I’ll explain why. Companies that don’t charge for design train customers to associate zero value with the service.

Truth be told each design takes someone a substantial amount of time to create. When accounting for the hundreds of man-hours spent learning the software and adding on the recurring costs of purchasing high-end computer hardware and 3D rendering software it all adds up.

The toll on the design staff performing their 20th round of revisions to Mrs. Jones’ pool just to get her to sign the contract is mentally taxing especially when you’re not being paid for them. The price tag associated with allowing that process to continue during this climate when pools are practically selling themselves is unfathomable. If you are still offering free designs you should probably stop.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMTA4LzEyMzAyMjIuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's aerospace technologies helped train Chinese Olympic medalists,"Gold medalist Zhang Yufei holds a Chinese national flag during the victory ceremony after winning the women's 200-meter butterfly swimming competition on Thursday in Tokyo.

The swimming events of the Tokyo Olympic Games concluded on Sunday with the Chinese swimming team collecting three gold medals two silver medals and one bronze medal to finish fourth in the medal table in the pool. This record-setting performance sparked public interest on the ""secret weapons"" - aerospace technologies that backed the training of athletes.



During the preparation period of the Chinese swimming team for the Olympics China Academy of Aerospace Electronics Technology (CAAET) carried out tests on six world swimming champions using aerospace measurement equipment and gained analysis data through simulation training which helped make scientific training plans for athletes and provided scientific support for improving their performances according to the Sina Weibo account of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) the parent of CAAET.

The CAAET used the inertial navigation subsystem to capture technical parameters such as time stroke frequency stroke length and breathing frequency.



Apart from swimming aerospace technologies have also been applied to training programs for other sports.



For instance the laboratory under a CASC unit which is equipped with low-speed wind tunnels successfully developed a three-dimensional force measuring platform that can measure the aerodynamic drag of athletes during the rowing projects with different gestures and combination of players.

The Chinese rowing team was able to win a gold medal of women's quadruple sculls breaking the world record for nearly 2 seconds and was 6 seconds off the silver medal winner on Wednesday. On the same day China also won a bronze medal on men's double sculls which was China's first medal in men's rowing.



""Aerospace technologies actually have been applied in Chinese people's daily life for nearly 50 years including satellite applications energy conservation and environmental protection equipment advanced materials and electronic information products"" an aerospace industry insider who declined to be named told the Global Times on Sunday.



The insider said that well-known examples include the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) which has been widely used across everyday life.



Drones robots intelligent driving intelligent wearable devices and other cutting-edge products are changing people's way of production and life. Various intelligent application scenarios draw higher requirements for positioning accuracy which are supported by the BDS and the mass-produced BeiDou high-precision positioning chip independently developed by China.



At present the BDS has launched high-precision services in more than 20 countries with a total number of users of more than 2 billion worldwide media reported.



With the completion of BDS-3 which was officially launched on July 31 2020 the BDS products equipped with independent BeiDou positioning chips and location services have the ability to serve the world with a daily visit of 2.5 billion.

Jordan Gnat will freely admit his foreign-language skills aren’t his best calling card.

“As my kids say my Sesame Street Spanish isn’t going to be very helpful” said Mr. Gnat 49 in an interview. And how is his Portuguese? “Obrigado” he responds with a self-effacing laugh. “That’s about as good as I get.”

Over the past few months though Mr. Gnat has planted a series of flags in the Latin American digital sports media space bringing a growing collection of websites social media accounts and other online properties under the purview of Playmaker Capital  the Toronto-based startup he joined as CEO last December.

Strictly speaking as Mr. Gnat will tell you Playmaker isn’t a startup so much as a roll-up: It went public in early June on the TSX Venture Exchange through a reverse takeover of Apolo III Acquisition Corp. a capital pool company co-founded by Vincent Gasparro who recently served as principal secretary to Toronto Mayor John Tory.

In April Playmaker had already acquired Futbol Sites a Miami-based operator of more than 10 soccer-focused websites branded under the name BolaVIP targeting fans in Brazil Argentina Chile Colombia Mexico Peru Ecuador Central America and the United States. Citing Comscore rankings the company announced that BolaVIP Brazil was the highest-ranking sports website in that country in May with more than 15.4 million unique visitors.

A couple of weeks after its TSX-V debut Playmaker added Fanáticos Por Futebol: Facebook and Instagram fan pages with a total of almost 4.5 million followers.

And last Tuesday it made its first major English-language move buying Yardbarker a Silicon Valley-based site that aggregates thousands of pieces of sports and entertainment content for an estimated four million unique users per month and publishes a morning newsletter sent to more than 350000 subscribers. A news release announcing the transaction pegged the value of the deal at up to US$24-million.

If digital media strikes some investors as a gamble – the number of properties seemingly infinite yet growing every day the rates for display ads often correspondingly tiny – they would be getting the right idea: Betting is a big part of Playmaker’s strategy.

Online sports betting that is. Mr. Gnat believes the company is well positioned to take advantage of that industry’s growth which is expected to be explosive as governments across the Americas legalize and regulate it by becoming an affiliate-marketing partner of sites trying to reel in new bettors.

Affiliate marketing is one of the Internet’s more lucrative practices – certainly far more lucrative than display advertising. If a reader is on a music site or other kind of digital property (newsletter social media account etc.) and they click on a link to buy a concert ticket or artist merchandise the site gets a share of that revenue.

“I want to be in the fan monetization business” Mr. Gnat said. “Playmaker is really a business that is being set up to live at the intersection of sports gambling media and technology. And we’re rolling up digital sports media assets finding assets that we can put together that we can leverage synergies between them to be able to build an ecosystem of highly engaged and loyal sports fans that we can deliver to sports betting companies teams leagues and Fortune 500 advertisers.”

“The regulated sports betting market on this side of the Atlantic is in the top of the second inning” said Mr. Gnat. “The appetite for growth is humongous. So the need to continue to feed the beast [with new bettors] is going to be there for quite a while.”

Affiliate marketing for online sportsbooks is big business. The Bettor Collective which Mr. Gnat cited as an aspiration for Playmaker is a global affiliate giant worth more than US$11-billion. But he and others insist there is room for more players.

“I think that tactically Jordan understands where the competition currently exists currently focuses and currently dominates and he understands where there’s opportunity” said Nic Sulsky a daily fantasy sports veteran who was recently named chief commercial officer for the Canadian division of the online sportsbook Pointsbet. “So I think that the Latin American focus and the Spanish-language focus provides a really great launching-off point to build into the U.S. and Canada.”

So far investors have been underwhelmed: Playmaker shares were off about 30 per cent at the end of the week from their debut price of 53 cents a share.

Mr. Gnat says he is on the prowl for properties “from the top of Canada to the bottom of Argentina” the same territory he trod in his last job as the group senior vice-president for The Stars Group. Beginning in July 2018 he headed up corporate and business development for the Americas with that Toronto-based online gaming company probably best known as the operator of PokerStars.

He has spent more than 15 years in the gaming industry including stints as president and CEO of the bingo hall operator Boardwalk Gaming; more than seven years with Scientific Games which provides casinos with products such as slot machines and gambling terminals; and CEO of Casino and Gaming Television (a.k.a. CGTV) which was owned in part by his father-in-law Larry Tanenbaum the chairman and part-owner of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment.

Another notable scion in Playmaker’s executive ranks: Its chief operating officer is Jake Cassaday the 33-year-old son of John Cassaday who formerly served as president and CEO of Corus Entertainment and before that of CTV Television Network Ltd.

Playmaker also has a well-connected group of backers and board members. It was created under the auspices of Relay Ventures the Toronto-based venture capital firm whose co-founder and managing partner John Albright took a seat on the Playmaker board. Mr. Albright is also on the board of theScore the Toronto-based digital sports media company that launched a sports betting operation in the U.S. in 2019 and is currently waiting to do the same now that single-event sports betting has been legalized in Canada in whichever provinces create a regulatory regime for the activity.

The Playmaker board is chaired by Maryann Turcke the former Bell Media president who most recently spent two and a half years as chief operating officer of the National Football League. “I think there’s value in aggregating eyeballs” Ms. Turcke said in an interview. “It’s also just bringing eyeballs together and then serving those eyeballs up to adjacent spaces whether it’s gaming or sports betting. We aren’t a betting company but lots of betting companies are going to want our eyeballs because it’s people that are hip deep in sport they are superfans and those are the kind of people that you can migrate into gaming and betting and those spaces.”

“I’ve known Jordan for years through my time at Bell Media and then when I was at the league and he was at Stars our paths sort of just kept crossing” she added. When Mr. Gnat asked her to join the board “I thought ‘Jordan’s the real deal he’s an authentic leader. John [Albright] is the real deal. Sure let’s give this a go.’”

And so as Mr. Gnat seeks out more deals he insists the language barriers aren’t as significant as one might think: You work with local firms you can trust and you get a good translator. You become adept at reading body language.

And there’s one other key he says he learned from a mentor who taught him how to manage in international settings. “You need to bother” he said. “You need to bother to understand the basics: How do you say hello? What are the proper colloquials? Do you shake someone’s hand do you not shake someone’s hand? In some cultures do you bow do you not bow? Those are things that are really important. Because the audience on the other side is watching to see if you have bothered.”

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Instead of utilizing a locally downloaded and installed packaged app as you traditionally would for mobile or laptop experiences PWAs allow you to access full app-like programs directly through your web browser – no install necessary. It’s as easy as clicking or tapping an icon just like you would for an app only more lightweight and they’ve come to include many of the same features as local apps too.

We reported back in April that Google was testing pre-installed Meet and Chat web apps on Chrome OS so that users wouldn’t have to manually visit these sites via the browser’s address bar and would instead be able to connect via message and video to colleagues and family members out of the box. Well Meet is officially rolling out as a PWA and you can install it now!

To get started simply visit Google Meet on the web. From there you’ll notice a new PWA install prompt in the top-right of the Chrome Omnibox (address or URL bar). It looks like a computer monitor with a down arrow in the corner. Tap or click that and you’ll be presented with a dialog box that asks if you’d like to ‘Install’ Google Meet. Select the blue ‘Install’ button and the entire website will be immediately popped out into its own standalone window with a nice blue top bar. Best of all you can now access your video chat software via a nice Meet icon that’s been placed on your shelf and in your launcher!

To be clear the PWA version of Meet has no new features compared to its app counterpart but it is much more accessible this way. If you’ve been using it as a standalone app all this time then you already know the benefit of having a website tab feel like a native app with its own identifiable icon and process. Anyone who comes to Chrome OS and is accustomed to using Windows programs for example will feel right at home with PWAs and as they continue to be added into the Google Play Store they will become more discoverable for everyone.

Google Meet now includes a completely new and improved layout and several new features including animated backgrounds various security improvements for your organization and more. The company has literally been obsessed with making it the best digital workspace and classroom during the global pandemic and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzMxL2hvdy1iZW4tamVycnktcm9zZS1mcm9tLXZlcm1vbnQtaGlwcGllcy1zZWxsaW5nLWljZS1jcmVhbS10by1wYWxlc3Rpbmlhbi1hY3RpdmlzdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Ben & Jerry rose from Vermont hippies selling ice cream to Palestinian activists,"Before they were woke they were clueless.

In 1978 when they launched Ben & Jerry’s from an abandoned gas station in Burlington VT Bennett Cohen and Jerry Greenfield had no idea what they were doing.

The two hippies who were born four days apart had become fast friends when they were forced to take a gym class designed for overweight students at the Merrick Avenue Middle School in Nassau County in 1963.

By the time they moved to Vermont in 1977 and settled on ice cream as a livelihood they were both 27 and college dropouts.

“Basically we’d failed at everything we tried” said Greenfield addressing a group of university students on Long Island after their company turned 40 in 2018.

Years after they graduated high school in 1969 Greenfield found himself sharing an apartment in the East Village with Cohen who had dropped out of several colleges that he had enrolled in to avoid the Vietnam War draft. Greenfield had twice failed to get into medical schools. The two eventually drifted to Vermont where Cohen got a job teaching pottery to emotionally troubled children near Lake Champlain.

Their initial idea was to open a bagel shop but when that proved too complicated and the equipment too costly they looked to ice cream. They split the $5 correspondence course fee in ice-cream making from Penn State and each scraped together $4000 for the start-up.

Settling in Burlington a college town where they could afford the rent and count on a steady supply of customers the two friends started Ben & Jerry’s Homemade Ice Cream and created a revolution. Not only were they producing high-quality ice cream — their first flavor was chocolate chip cookie dough — and buying their supplies exclusively from local dairy farmers but their counter-culture quirkiness and commitment to grassroots social justice initiatives made them local heroes.

When Pillsbury the corporate parent of ice cream rival Haagen Dazs tried to scuttle their first distribution deal fearing it could hurt sales of their own brand the friends got national exposure with one of their public relations campaigns: “What’s the Doughboy Afraid Of?”

After three years in business they were on the cover of Time magazine which hailed their ice cream with iconic flavors such as “Cherry Garcia” as the best in the world.

Today the two are worth $150 million each but are still courting controversy in the name of social justice.

While they no longer have operational control of Ben & Jerry’s which they sold to the London-based conglomerate Unilever in 2000 they recently called the decision to boycott sales to Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza one of the most important the company has made in its 43-year history. The boycott decision was made by the ice cream company’s board which retains autonomy over its brand and business strategy. Unilever does not support the boycott said CEO Alan Jope in a letter to US Jewish groups this week.

The boycott which began July 19 unleashed a political backlash in the US and the Middle East with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett calling it “a glaring anti-Israel measure.” In the US Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma called for a ban on all Ben & Jerry’s sales in his state. New York Congressman Lee Zeldin tweeted that the boycott is about “bowing to the liberal woke mob and anti-Israel anti-Semitic hate.” Last week the pension fund for New York’s state workers warned Unilever it might restrict investments as a result of the ban.

But Cohen and Greenfield have stood firm with their six-member board’s decision. They no longer sit on the ice cream company’s board of directors.

“As our company began to expand internationally Israel was one of our first overseas markets. We were then and remain today supporters of the State of Israel” wrote Cohen and Greenfield in an opinion article for the New York Times earlier this week. “But it’s possible to support Israel and oppose some of its policies just as we’ve opposed policies of the US government. As such we unequivocally support the decision of the company to end business in the occupied territories.”

Not only have Cohen and Greenfield backed the boycott but they have donated hundreds of thousands in company profits over the years to groups working to promote Palestinian rights.

Philanthropy has always been the cornerstone of Cohen and Greenfield’s business model. “Business has the responsibility to give back to its community” said Cohen who coined the phrase “caring capitalism” in the 1980s and started the Ben & Jerry’s Foundation in 1985. The foundation commits 7.5 percent of the company’s pre-tax profits to philanthropy which translates to just over $3 million per year for a company that has grown to become one of the world’s biggest ice cream brands churning out more than one million pints a day. Cohen and Greenfield both 70 still occupy board seats on their foundation.

“We realized the best way to embody the company’s progressive values and the foundation’s commitment to the power of the grassroots was to empower employees to participate in grantmaking” the group’s website states.

Most of those grants range from $50 to $1000 to local schools unions and environmental groups from some of the company’s 1600 employees in Vermont.

But while their early efforts were local they have now gone far beyond a simple mission of working for social change in the Green Mountain State.

Long before the company they founded announced its controversial boycott earlier this month the Ben & Jerry’s Foundation had already spent millions on global campaigns for social justice increasingly directing their largest grants to groups that promote refugee and land rights around the world.

To that end the Ben & Jerry’s Foundation has doled out more than $100000 in the last two years to the Oakland Institute think tank founded by Palestinian land rights activist Anuradha Mittal who is also chair of the ice cream company’s board and vice president of the Ben & Jerry’s Foundation.

Mittal 54 is one of the architects behind the company’s boycott in the West Bank Gaza and East Jerusalem where there are more than 600000 Jews scattered in about 140 settlements. The West Bank and East Jerusalem have been under Israeli control since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Opponents of Israeli policy consider the settlements illegal and want to grant land rights to Palestinians.

Mittal has long been a fierce critic of Israel’s policies in the region. Her think tank which includes Jeff Furman a longtime Ben & Jerry’s executive on its board supported a controversial human rights group in the West Bank in 2017 with cash from the Ben & Jerry’s Foundation. The BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights received a $3000 grant from the foundation in 2017 tax filings show.

Last year the European Union pulled nearly $2 million worth of funding from BADIL after it refused to sign an “anti-terror” clause in its funding contract. The clause stated that none of the EU’s funds would be diverted to members of terrorist organizations such as the military wings of Hamas and Hezbollah.

7 Anuradha Mittal who sits on the board of Ben & Jerry’s founded the Oakland Institute. Twitter

The Ben & Jerry’s grant was used to finance “a bold multimedia project on land rights to mark 50 years since the Six-Day War and Israel’s occupation” according to the Oakland Institute’s 2017 annual report. “Palestine: For Land and Life” documented individual stories of “marginalization and struggle.”

“Across the West Bank farmers lost their land livelihoods and even their ability to visit their families when the separation wall was constructed” according to the report. “Under occupation they also face massive water shortages as Israel diverts water from the Jordan River…to Israel and its settlements.”

Although the boycott has spawned a firestorm of criticism with opponents branding Mittal as well as Greenfield and Cohen — both Jewish — as anti-Semitic they are unfazed.

Mittal tweeted Friday that in spite of “violent threats” she continues to stand behind the boycott as do Greenfield and Cohen.

“We believe business is among the most powerful entities in society” they wrote. “We believe that companies have a responsibility to use their power and influence to advance the wider common good.”

In fact from their inception as a company ice cream flavors were themselves designed to address that common good. “Peace Pops” — sticks of chocolate chip and cookie dough ice-cream covered in a chocolate coating — sent an anti-war message in 1988 to protest the First Gulf War. The company called for 1 percent of the US national defense budget to be set aside for peace initiatives. In 2015 they renamed their classic cookie dough flavor to “I Dough I Dough” to celebrate the Supreme Court’s ruling on gay marriage.

Despite their success in business both Cohen and Greenfield live in relatively modestly with homes in Williston a Burlington suburb surrounded by lush green fields

“People used to laugh at us when we spoke to business groups” Cohen told a group of business students at Adelphi University in Garden City NY three years ago.

“Now we’ve been mainstreamed” Greenfield added.

Great-West Lifeco will kick off the major insurers’ Q2 earnings on Tuesday followed by Manulife and Sun Life on Wednesday. A Great-West subsidiary recently signed a $4.45-billion deal to buy Prudential Financial Inc.'s retirement business as the company aims to deepen its presence in the U.S. market.

BCE results:

This is an exciting time for BIMA with Chokor being just the first of 10 centres that they are opening around the country.

Present were representatives from Societe Generale AirtelTigo; GIZ; Prudential; Professor Agyeman Badu Akosa; Korle Gonno Manye Naa Adua Okropong I and the assemblyman for the area Theophilus Isaac Quaye.

The launch of the Chorkor experience centre forms part of BIMA’s vision to support Ghanaians individuals and families to plan for the unexpected and to plan to ride the storm of uncertainty.

This is the first of 10 centres to be opened around the country: Chokor Madina Kasoa Tema Cape Coast Takoradi Tarkwa Ejisu Suame and Sunyani.

According to the Country Manager of BIMA Ghana Valerie Abena Konyo Labi the Chorkor experience centre will support families who would otherwise have avoided going to the hospital or getting a lab test from a reputable organization because they feared the aftermath of a large hospital bill.

Commenting on the launch under the theme 'Closer to you' Valerie Abena Konyo Labi said ""BIMA is piloting delivering medicines directly to the doors of those who need them and also ensuring that when the worst happens and a loved one is lost that we step in to pick up some of the financial burdens allowing kids to stay in school families to pay rent”.

She mentioned BIMA has served more than 2.5 million Ghanaians with insurance directly over the phone and that they are dedicated to being closer to families so that we are just a stone throw away either by foot or by phone working together to protect the future of you and your families.

“We strive to be reliable and are adapting every day to make sure that we are providing the needed value back to our customers. Also we strive to pay claims in a timely and efficient manner with minimal paperwork and disturbance” she added.

She however commended GIZ its sponsoring partner that has been part of the journey all the way from concept generation to final delivery.

“GIZ's support has been invaluable and we are looking forward to continuing to bring to the forefront an increased awareness and penetration of micro-insurance across Ghana through future endeavours” she added.

BIMA organized for the community a free health screening and health check and also took the opportunity to present claims to some beneficiaries at the event.

BIMA works with mobile operators banks and microfinance institutions as well as a growing range of corporates.

Policies whether relating to vaccines or privatisation of key economic entities have been marked by bizarre U-turns abrupt changes or abandonment of previously announced approaches. The idea of policies seems to be to instil shock and awe logic and rectitude be damned. A striking case in point is the government’s recent decision to privatise United India Insurance Company Ltd a public sector general insurance company abandoning its earlier decision to amalgamate the four public sector general insurance companies.

The provisions of the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act 1972 which governs the operation of public sector general insurance companies require the government to hold at least a majority of the stake in these companies. The move to privatise any one of these companies thus requires amendments to the Act which the government has planned to push through during the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament. It remains to be seen whether the Pegasus scandal which has rocked Parliament will derail the attempt although there is little doubt that the government will be back at it even if it suffers an immediate setback in its attempts.

In 2019 while presenting the Budget for 2019-20 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the government would initiate the merger of the four general insurance companies effectively creating something like the public sector behemoth in the life insurance business Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). The Modi government thus seemed to have at last fulfilled a long-standing demand of insurance employees who have ever since the 1990s been demanding an amalgamation of the four companies to give them better focus while competing with the several private companies in the fray. The government hired consultancies to advise it on how to go about with the merger. In fact reports at the time indicated that the government was seriously considering merging the other three companies into New India Assurance the biggest general insurance company in India public or private. Ironically the about-turn now envisages the sale of United India Insurance.

In the middle of the pandemic which has affected every conceivable aspect of the economic life of the country Nirmala Sitharaman abandoned this approach. In her last Budget speech while presenting the accounts for 2021-22 she announced that one general insurance company would be privatised. This was in keeping with the revised privatisation policy—announced at the height of the pandemic—which envisages a minimal governmental presence in virtually every sector of the economy. Accordingly the NITI Aayog was given the task of determining which public sector general insurer would go on the block first. The body which replaced the Planning Commission but commands far less respect for its academic rigour determined recently that United India Insurance would be privatised first. An amendment to the law is a must because in its current form the government is prohibited from selling a majority stake in a general insurance company.

General insurance which means the insurance of just about every conceivable risk is a business that is closely related to the nature and level of development of a society. Generally in advanced societies which also have a degree of state-directed health care provisioning the premium generated by general insurance accounts for about 55 per cent of the overall insurance business life insurance accounting for the remaining 45 per cent. However in India non-life insurance premiums account for just about one-fourth of all premiums collected by insurance companies.

Transfer of risks

An important facet of general insurance is that it is meant to mitigate risks that companies would have to bear while running their operations. This means that companies transfer the burden of risks outside their main areas of activity. Thus by paying a small premium a company involved in marine fishing transfers the risks of losses arising from say destruction of its fleet in a cyclone. A high level of insurance protection in an economy is thus a measure of its maturity. The fact that general insurance levels are still very low in India indicates that economic agents continue to bear a significant proportion of the risks which hinders their growth and affects the overall development of the economy.

This was the rationale for the wholesale nationalisation of the general insurance business in India in 1971 15 years after the formation of LIC. Initially an ordinance was issued leading to the passage of the General Insurance Business(Nationalisation) Act 1972 and resulting in the nationalisation of 107 companies involved in the general insurance business. This led to the formation of General Insurance Corporation (GIC) structured as a holding company under which the four general insurance subsidiaries were to function.

Later in the 1990s the role of GIC was transformed into that of a reinsurer an insurer of insurers if you will. These changes were prescribed by the Malhotra Committee which soon after liberalisation initiated the first steps towards reversing the steps taken since the nationalisation of the banking and insurance sectors in India. The rationale for these changes instead of strengthening the public presence in insurance was making public insurance companies suitable for sale at an opportune moment.

The unions too welcomed the merger proposal because they believed that the original logic of having the four companies focus in specific geographies had outlived its utility since all of them in any case had pan-Indian operations. While National Insurance was based in Kolkata New India Assurance was headquartered in Mumbai Oriental Insurance in New Delhi and United India Insurance in Chennai.

The opening up of the insurance sector in stages has however created an uneven field with successive rounds of liberalisation putting the public sector companies under greater pressure. The consortium of the four companies under the umbrella of the General Insurers Public Sector Association has a business that accounts for about 40 per cent of the total general insurance business in India. The companies have never had to turn to the government for funding; instead they have been generating dividends. However roughly after the Modi government assumed office in 2014 the companies have been in some trouble. Employees point out that three of the four companies—National Insurance Oriental and United India Insurance—have been rudderless since then either because they have no chairman and managing director or they had one that only enjoyed a tenure of less than a year. Union sources also point to the fact that senior positions have remained vacant which has hampered business decision-making in the companies.

Of immediate concern is United India the second biggest public sector general insurance company in India in terms of market share. The company which was founded in 1938 by the same group that founded Indian Overseas Bank insures 1.47 crore families under the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister health insurance scheme and the Mahatma Jyothiba Phule Bima Yojana policy in Maharashtra. It also insures 4 crore people under various schemes run by the Centre.

Two factors have skewed the field against public sector insurance companies. While the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has increasingly acted as an agent in prising open the market in favour of private companies the sharp business practices of private companies has placed public sector companies at a disadvantage. For instance the introduction of Motor Insurance Service Providers (MISP) has allowed private insurance companies to draw business away from public sector companies as now automobile dealers can act as an intermediary for insurance policies. The unions for instance allege that private insurance companies flout restrictions on payouts to automobile dealers while public sector companies abide by the rules governing such commissions. Similar violations are also rampant in the health insurance business particularly by stand-alone health insurance companies which pay commissions to agents far in excess of the limit set by the IRDAI. The unions also allege that the IRDAI’s failure to inspect the operations of private insurance companies or its imposition of paltry fines even when it does has allowed the companies to mock at the regulations. They have called for forensic audits of private insurance companies’ motor insurance business by professional external auditors.

In a recent letter to the Vice Chair of NITI Aayog the leadership of the National Confederation of General Insurance Officers’ Associations pointed out that a consolidation of the companies instead of their outright sale was what was needed to revitalise the companies in the pandemic. It is obvious that privatisation is the primary means by which a consolidation is being forced. Data issued by the IRDAI show that in June 2021 New India Assurance United India Insurance and Oriental Insurance together accounted for more than one-third of the entire Indian general insurance market. If one adds the share of National Insurance Company the market share of the public sector increases to about 42 per cent. In fact only one private insurer ICICI Lombard has a market share that is comparable to the shares of the public sector companies. What this reveals is that the general insurance market is extremely fragmented among more than 30 other entities each enjoying a small fraction of the market. Seen from this perspective it is obvious that privatisation is being used as a cudgel to break open the market for private companies.

Terrible consequences

But this is not just a matter of market shares. There are likely to be terrible consequences for the economy and society if consolidation proceeds as a result of the elimination of the public presence in the business. For one as the experience from private insurance companies is already revealing private insurers are likely to strenuously deny claims if and when they occur. Moreover there is every likelihood that premiums will increase as a result of this consolidation. Both these developments will have a chilling effect on both the willingness of business agents to purchase insurance or to seek adequate protective insurance coverage. Rising premiums and arbitrary exclusions are likely to act as formidable barriers to insurance penetration. Small businesses already hit by the pandemic are likely to be deterred even more from buying insurance by the methods private insurers adopt. This would hamper the growth of the general insurance sector in India which is already lagging behind those available to business entities in competing markets across the world.

The greatest effect of nationalisation in the general insurance business has been the widespread adoption of insurance as a protective cover. Even after the wave of liberalisation public sector companies have been able to hold their own because they have been a powerful countervailing force to private companies some of which are backed by international finance. Privatisation is nothing but the forced attempt at evicting them from the market in order to facilitate a consolidation of private power in the business. The retrogressive move casts a shadow over much more than just the security of jobs of those working in the industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Vjb25vbXkvcG9saWN5L2dvdnQtY2FuLWV4ZW1wdC1hbnktbGlzdGVkLXBzdS1mcm9tLW1pbi1wdWJsaWMtaG9sZGluZy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NDkyOTQwOS5jbXPSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvZWNvbm9teS9wb2xpY3kvZ292dC1jYW4tZXhlbXB0LWFueS1saXN0ZWQtcHN1LWZyb20tbWluLXB1YmxpYy1ob2xkaW5nL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NDkyOTQwOS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Government can exempt any listed PSU from minimum public holding,"

The government can now exempt any listed public sector enterprise from the minimum public shareholding norm which mandates at least 25% public float for all listed entities. The move comes as the government prepares for the initial public offer (IPO) of Life Insurance Corp LIC ) of India likely to be the biggest listing ever.The government has inserted a new rule in the public listing norms specified in the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules 1957 toward this end.“Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rules (1) to (5) the central government may in the public interest exempt any listed public sector company from any or all of the provisions of this rule” said a notification issued by the Department of Economic Affairs part of the finance ministry. The framework for the minimum public shareholding has been revised to make it easier for large companies to launch IPOs.“It’s an enabling provision” a government official told ET.The mandatory minimum public shareholding was raised to 25% from 10% in FY10 with a carveout provided for public sector units (PSUs) from the norm which was amended in 2014 to bring them on par with private listed entities. Listed PSUs were given until 2017 to comply a deadline extended to 2018 to 2020 and then to this month.Stock exchanges can impose a fine of up to Rs 10000 on companies for each day of non-compliance with the requirement. They can also ask depositories to freeze the entire shareholding of the promoter and promoter group.Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) chief Ajay Tyagi said on Wednesday that the regulator was looking at the matter.“We are examining what is minimum public shareholding and what is the actual float… that we are examining separately with exchanges — all of this as a concept level 25% minimum shareholding whether it means 25% free float or not” Tyagi had said at a Ficci conference.",,,,,,,,,

Gun assault over a car trade in Alderwood

On July 18 at 8:26 p.m. two men arguing over a car trade ended with a firearm pointed in a threatening manner. The incident happened at the Alderwood Mall parking lot near Cheesecake Factory and no one was harmed.

According to the police report the victim met the alleged assailant in Tacoma where they drove north to test drive the white Mustang. The vehicle ran out of gas near Alderwood Mall where they pushed the car into the Cheesecake Factory parking lot. The victim told police that the man who drove up with him from Tacoma attempted to take the car at gunpoint.

Police apprehended the suspect where he was identified by the victim.

The alleged assailant told police that he was trying to buy the vehicle but after the test drive the other man began to “twitch” and later fight him. Knowing the car owner’s mental condition the alleged assailant walked away. The police officer states in the report that the car owner confirmed that he has mental health issues.

After completing the investigation the police officer concluded he had multiple accounts of the incident with conflicting information. The alleged victim was not confident in the location of the incident who was in the vehicle or how both men drove from Tacoma to Lynnwood with the vehicle.

The alleged assailant claimed to have known the car owner and his sister for approximately 6 years.

The Lynnwood police officer contacted the Tacoma PD about the incident but they didn’t have any local information about the two parties involved.

Man trapped in a public storage complex

Responding to a suspicious circumstance on July 23 LPD found a man trapped inside a public storage complex near 196th street.

Approaching the gate officers saw a white male attempting to break the door lock from the inside of the storage complex in order to leave the premises. The man’s vehicle was parked outside the gate with the engine running.

The man initially told officers that he was trying to get out of the complex after being trapped inside. However upon further questioning the man’s story consistently changed.

He told police he had the code to get into the premises and was there fixing the gate. Then he told officers he was at the location with two friends but now couldn’t get ahold of them. Lastly he said his girlfriend had a unit at the location and she had a key to one of the units but didn’t know where she was.

Police officers looked around the premises but didn’t find any signs of forced entry and were unable to determine if the man gained access into any of the storage units.

According to the report Lynnwood PD got ahold of the storage complex’s owner or manager of the location who declined to press charges against the alleged trespasser.

The door lock was damaged which the storage facility will repair.

CPU and GPU: covering the basics Let’s begin our run-through with a deeper dive into the architectural changes inside the Snapdragon 888. We’ll start with the CPU and GPU the cornerstones of day-to-day performance.

As anticipated Qualcomm is a member of the Arm CXC program granting it access to this year’s co-developed Cortex-X1 CPU core. The Cortex-X1 is a bigger more powerful and power-hungry spin-off from Arm’s roadmap offering around a 23% further boost over Arm’s latest Cortex-A78. Qualcomm has slotted these CPUs into a three-tier cluster just like last year. Though this is the first time Qualcomm has used three different CPU cores in a single chipset design.

Qualcomm’s Kryo 680 CPU cluster is made up of a single powerhouse Cortex-X1 clocked at 2.84GHz with a large 1MB L2 cache. Below that sits three big Cortex-A78 cores with 2.4GHz peak clocks and 512KB of L2 cache each doubling the cache from last year. Finally four low power Cortex-A55 cores with 128KB L2 cache hit 1.8GHz. The clock speeds are identical to last year suggesting conservative performance gains in exchange for better battery life. This points to limited gains for multi-core processing while the single Cortex-X1 will make a more meaningful difference in scenarios that demand greater single-thread compute power.

Qualcomm

The core cluster is outfitted with a large 4MB L3 cache and 3MB system cache which is also unchanged from the Snapdragon 865. Although the big Cortex-X1 and A78 cores have doubled their L2 caches compared to last year. Qualcomm must have spotted some performance benefit by giving these big core more nearby memory to work with at the expense of some extra silicon area. The Cortex-A78 is 5% smaller per core than the A77 leaving more room for the extra cache. In culmination the Snapdragon 888 boasts 25% higher CPU performance and power efficiency. Much of the latter is likely to come from the move to 5nm and the more energy and area efficient Cortex-A78s. The fine details: Arm Cortex-X1 and Cortex-X78 CPUs explained

Moving over to the Adreno 680 GPU Qualcomm keeps the inner workings of its graphics silicon close to its chest. But the company is touting a 35% boost to performance the biggest for generations while still offering 25% better power efficiency.

Qualcomm’s latest GPU supports sub-pixel rendering as part of the display engine which can boost the apparent display resolution. Variable-rate shading found in next-gen consoles and PC GPUs has also made its way into the architecture. This can reduce shader rendering requirements by 40% in supported games for up to a 30% boost to performance. Although it’s likely Qualcomm is folding this into the overall 35% performance claim so gains may be much more limited for titles that don’t support this feature.

The Adreno 680 also includes new machine learning instructions too for up to 43% faster AI performance. These instructions include 4-input mixed-precision dot product and wave matrix multiple for 16- and 32-bit floating-point numbers. This brings us nicely onto some other big changes in the Snapdragon 888: AI.

5G and AI: some much-needed changes Machine Learning (AI) processing is a key part of Qualcomm’s heterogeneous approach to modern computing. 2018’s Snapdragon 855 introduced a Tensor accelerator into the AI processing mix. In 2020 the Snapdragon 888 “fuses” the scalar tensor and vector processing units inside the Hexagon 780 DSP together with 16x the amount of shared memory.

The net result is seamless workload sharing inside the unit and up to a 1000x improvement to hand-off-time moving workloads between the three processor types. In addition the scalar processor sees a 50% performance improvement while the Tensor has double the compute capacity of the last generation. Combing CPU GPU and DSP capabilities Qualcomm claims a 3x improvement to AI performance per watt and 26TOPs of overall AI compute. That’s a 73% increase from the Snapdragon 865’s 15TOPs and a huge generational increase… at least on paper.

However we should be cautious about TOPs claims. TOPs don’t tell us anything about the type of workload used to calculate the figure making comparisons very difficult. In addition few workloads will max out the Snapdragon 888’s various AI cores all at once although Qualcomm says it is possible to do so in some scenarios.

Perhaps more importantly Qualcomm has some new machine learning tools for developers too. The new Qualcomm AI Engine Direct acts as an entry point for Android NN TensorFlow Lite and Qualcomm SDKs. This will help developers make the most of the Snapdragon’s capabilities regardless of which popular framework they prefer. Qualcomm’s AI platform also now supports the open-source TVM compiler enabling developers to program in Python rather than C or assembly. It’s easier than ever to leverage the entire Qualcomm AI engine.

Qualcomm

Another important change with the Snapdragon 888 is the inclusion of an integrated Snapdragon X60 5G modem. Many of the baseline specifications appear similar to the previous generation including peak mmWave speeds of 7.5Gbps down and 3Gbps up. However the X60 also introduces sub-6GHz FDD and TDD carrier aggregation as well as aggregation across sub-6GHz and mmWave bands to help realize those theoretical peak speeds. Carrier aggregation is very important for boosting speeds and capacity as it allows for data to be sent over low-band sub-6GHz and mmWave spectrum at once. There’s also Voice-over-NR support to make calls on future 5G standalone networks but we’ll have to wait for carrier support on that end.

But perhaps most important of all is the fact that the X60 is integrated into the Snapdragon 888 unlike last year’s Snapdragon 865 that paired with an external X55 modem. Thanks to the increased transistor density of 5nm Qualcomm can now fit its latest 5G goodies on the same chip as other processing components without fewer concerns about heat dissipation. Integration means a smaller area footprint and improved power efficiency for longer battery life when using 5G. Costs could also fall as manufacturers won’t have to buy two chips but Qualcomm would not comment on chipset pricing.

All the other odds and extras There’s plenty more tucked into the Snapdragon 888 too.

Sticking with networking the FastConnect 6900 function block enables Wi-Fi 6 Wi-Fi 6E and dual radio Bluetooth 5.2 functionality. This includes support for the latest Bluetooth LE Audio standard. So networking features remain on the very cutting edge of modern standards. There’s also a new AI processing block in Qualcomm’s second-gen sensor hub designed to offload processing for always-on scenarios. This block runs on less than 1mA of current but is 5x more powerful than the last-gen sensor block. Qualcomm says it sees about an 80% offloading of tasks from the Hexagon AI processor which should be a boon for battery life.

For gamers Snapdragon Elite Gaming now includes Qualcomm Game Quick Touch. A feature designed to lower touch response latency anywhere from 20% with 60fps to 10% faster in 120fps titles. There’s no dev work required here so gamers will benefit as soon as they get their hands on next-gen handsets.

Camera functionality is set for a range of improvement too. The Spectra 580 ISP transitions from a dual to triple processor setup. This allows for three concurrent processing chains at once which could be used to capture simultaneous video streams from three cameras or perform real-time processing on three separate image sensors at once. Overall throughput is up from 2 to 2.7 Gigapixels per second for a 35% improvement to processing capabilities.

Qualcomm

In addition the Snapdragon 888 now boasts 10-bit HDR image capture using the HEIF file container. This extra color data will ensure your images look their best when viewed on HDR displays. There’s also now 4K computational HDR capture using staggered HDR sensors. We’ve previously seen staggered sensors use simultaneous long medium and short exposures to produce great-looking HDR images. Now video can benefit too. The ISP is also capable of capturing 120 12MP images per second and low light images down to 0.1 lux. There are also new AI algorithms for auto-focus auto-exposure and auto-white balance. Overall expect lots more photo and video flexibility in 2021 smartphones.

Another interesting note is that the Snapdragon 888 is the first Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) compliant smartphone camera chipset. Essentially manufacturers can include cryptographically secure metadata to verify the origin of photos and video — handy in a world of increasingly impressive deep fake content floating around the web. Other security initiatives include the introduction of OS Hypervisors borrowed from the desktop computing space. This allows for individual users and apps to run in their own secure virtualized OS space — also handy if you want to keep your sensitive work and personal info separate on the same device. We’ll need to wait and see if handset manufacturers actually implement these extras.

What to expect from Snapdragon 888 smartphones

Qualcomm

Our early assumptions about the Snapdragon 888 turned out to be right. More efficient CPU GPU and AI processors with an integrated 5G modem built together on a 5nm manufacturing process is good news for battery life. At the same time new imaging machine learning and security features flesh out the likely capabilities of next-gen phones. Although it’s still more of a gradual evolution than an overnight game-changer.

Benchmarks have been a little more hit and miss with some devices struggling to sustain their performance gains over last year’s devices. Other reports have suggested that the SoC runs a little on the hot and power hungry side. The prospective gaming gains haven’t quite manifested in every benchmark either. But generally speaking performance improvements are there to be had. Particularly when it comes to the single-core improvements offered by the powerhouse Arm Cortex-X1 core.

Interestingly not every high-end smartphone with a Qualcomm chip may end up being powered by the Snapdragon 888. The company has also unveiled its Snapdragon 870 a suped-up version of 2020’s Snapdragon 865 Plus. This chipset is powering more affordable flagship smartphones that don’t require all of Qualcomm’s very latest bells and whistles such as the Motorola Edge 20 series.

Qualcomm announced its Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders a couple of weeks back the first device it has made especially for its newly created Snapdragon Insiders enthusiasts club. The US chip maker has partnered with Asus for this high-end niche product and for anyone that is keen the device is now up for pre-order on the Asus website. Unfortunately it is only available in select markets at this stage although Qualcomm says it will expand availability in the coming weeks.

The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 the SoC found in most top-of-the-line handsets currently on the market. For some peculiar reason however it misses out on the slightly faster Snapdragon 888+. It is fitted with a whopping 16 GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 512 GB of ultra-fast UFS 3.1 storage. The 144 Hz 6.78-inch Samsung OLED display is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus and is the same panel Asus has fitted to its ROG Phone 5.

The Asus influence continues on the rear with the triple camera set up which has been taken from its Zenfone 8 Flip. The wide-angle camera uses a Sony IMX686 64 MP sensor this is joined by an ultra-wide angle Sony IMX363 12 MP sensor with the third sensor rate at 8 MP but paired with a 3x optical zoom lens. The only obvious shortcoming with the device is its 4000 mAh battery but it does come with a 65 Watt charger in the box.

The Smartphone for Snapdragon insiders is retailing for US$1499 but this also includes a set of high-end Master & Dynamic MW08 TWS earbuds and a bumper case. Pre-orders are expected to ship by the end of August.

A few days ago we had a post on the top 10 Snapdragon 888 that tends to overheat. Subsequently we had another post on the top 5 Snapdragon 870 smartphones that overheats. Now we have the top 5 Snapdragon 865 smartphones that overheat. Since Qualcomm tries to ram up the performance of its chips these processors are susceptible to heating. However with a good heat dissipation system and a proper heat sink smartphone manufacturers can effectively reduce the heating effect. It is a menace to have smartphones that overheat up in your hand after a few hours of usage. Thus it is important for potential buyers to be adequately informed. Master Lu recently tested the temperature emission of Snapdragon 865 smartphones. Here are the top 5 Snapdragon 865 / Snapdragon 865+ smartphones that overheat.

1. Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G – Average temperature is 32.91°C

The Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro comes with a three-dimensional cooling system. According to the company the cooling system of this smartphone ensures a 10.5 °C CPU temperature reduction. It uses a VC Liquid Cooling with a super large vapor chamber surface area + 6-stack graphite layer + heat-transmitting gel According to reports at the time of its launch it has the largest VC heat-dissipating board which is three times larger than the VC board of the Mate30 Pro 5G version. The VC heat dissipation area is 3000 mm² and this smartphone also supports intelligent thermal control (smart CPU frequency and current control).

This smartphone uses a graphene heat dissipation material which dissipates heat for core flagships such as processors. Furthermore the large copper foil and thermally conductive gel wrap around every part of the cooling system. are used to cover every small detail inside the machine. This design will ensure that the smartphone runs on seamlessly during long-hour gaming. Despite this “robust” cooling system the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G has the highest average temperature on the list. According to Master Lu the temperature of this phone is as high as 32.91°C

2. Lenovo Legion Pro – Average temperature is 31.99°C

This is the only Snapdragon 865+ smartphone on the list and it is a powerful gaming smartphone. We can all understand why it is number two on this list. However the fact that there is only one Snapdragon 865+ smartphone on the top 5 list implies that in terms of heat dissipation the Snapdragon 865+ is better optimized than the Snapdragon 865 SoC.

This device comes with a 144 Hz refresh rate display and other gaming features that increase the temperature. However it uses a dual liquid cooling system so as to get the best gaming experience without any overheating and lagging issues. The company uses a frosted liquid within the dual liquid system. This cooling system comes with a 14-point temperature control matrix to monitor the body temperature in real-time. According to Master Lu’s ranking the Lenovo Legion Pro which was released in 2020 has an average temperature of 31.99°C and it has the second-highest overheating temperature for Snapdragon 865 / 865+ devices.

3. OnePlus 8 Pro – Average temperature is 31.42°C

OnePlus have not had a good time with heating issues as the OnePlus 8 series and mostly the OnePlus 9 series had had series of heating issues. The OnePlus 8 Pro supports up to 30W wireless fast charging new camera sensors a bigger battery a more powerful processor and a higher refresh rate display. Compared to the OnePlus 7T Pro that’s a pretty big upgrade and some of these upgrades have an impact on the heating.

The OnePlus 8 series comes with integrated cooling pipes for heat dissipation. However these smartphones (OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro) do not come with liquid cooling. Nevertheless the average temperature of this smartphone is just 31.42°C. At this rate users may not even notice the temperature increase.

4. Oppo Find X2 Pro – Average temperature is 31.39°C

The Oppo Find X2 Pro was officially released in March 2020. This smartphone comes with a 4260 mAh battery that supports 65W SuperVOOC 2.0 super flash charge fast charging. According to the company this charging power can give this smartphone a full charge in just 35 minutes. While users will enjoy the super fast charge of this device it has its shortcoming which is basically heating. Heating issues in a smartphone are usually not due to the processor alone. Here Oppo had to use an internal heat dissipation system that reduces the temperature of this smartphone. The Oppo Find X2 Pro comes with a triple thermal dissipation system. The device comes with a thermal conductive gel a vapor chamber liquid cooling as well as multilayer graphite. The aim of these materials is to reduce the temperature of this device. This system pays off as the average temperature of this device is 31.39°C which is minimal

5. Oppo Ace2 – Average temperature is 31.30°C

According to Master Lu’s rating the Oppo Ace2 has an average temperature of 31.30°C. However some reviews show that the temperature can get as high as 36.9°C during wired charging. There are reports that the wireless charging of this smartphone could raise the temperature to 41.2°C. However these temperatures are only possible during charging. On normal average usage the temperature does not get anywhere this high.

The heat dissipation consists of two long bar-shaped heat sinks. The AirVOOC charging comes with a board fan and there is a heat dissipation grille at the bottom of the phone to take care of the heat generation issues.

Conclusion

The conclusions here are basically the same for any ranking of processors that overheats. We are aware that overheating problems can be annoying especially when you have a flagship smartphone. However it is important to note that overheating issues can be the result of either hardware or software issues. Thus the Snapdragon 865 /865+ SoC may not be the sole reason for the heating issues on even mid-range smartphones. We must also emphasize that on a daily usage most of these smartphone does not come anywhere near the average temperature. Furthermore to curb the heating issues the smartphone manufacturer needs to do a lot of optimizations. The higher the heat of a smartphone the lower the performance of the device this is why most smartphones need a good heat dissipation system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvbW9iaWxlL3BpeGVsLTUtdnMtcGl4ZWwtNC12cy1waXhlbC00LXhsLXRoZS1iaWdnZXN0LWRpZmZlcmVuY2VzLWJldHdlZW4tZ29vZ2xlLXBob25lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pixel 5 vs. Pixel 4 vs. Pixel 4 XL: The biggest differences between Google phones,"Google released five different Pixel phones in the US in 2020 but only three of those remain available for purchase in the Google Store.

As you can tell by its name the Pixel 5 is Google's newest phone available right now but it's a midrange one that marks a departure from the pricey Pixel phones of years past. While the Pixel 5 has 5G connectivity along with the fantastic cameras that have become the line's main selling point Google made sure to drop its price to $699 (£599 AU$999) and scale back on some features (like the processor for instance) perhaps in light of the realization that pricey smartphones can be a tough sell in this pandemic-ravaged economy especially if those devices don't carry a Samsung or Apple label.

Meanwhile the last-gen Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL start at $799 (£699 AU$1049) and $899 (£829 AU$1279) respectively and offer a more advanced processor than the Pixel 5 and also boast a coveted telephoto lens as part of their dual-rear-camera setups. On the other end of the spectrum lie the entry-level Pixel 4A and 4A 5G both of which retain a popular feature that none of the other Pixels mentioned in this article have: the humble headphone jack.

Here are the details per Giants PR:

Second-year coach Joe Judge wanted a camp event geared toward the local community and found an outlet in the NFL initiative called “Back Together Saturday.” The Giants will practice in the newly-renovated 4500-seat Eddie Moraes Stadium – formerly Ironbound Stadium – which is reopening after being closed by the federal government in 1987. After that long hiatus the stadium which frequently hosted local and international soccer games will again be the home of the East Side High School football program.

The Giants partnered with the office of Mayor Ras J. Baraka and the Newark Board of Education to plan the event inviting area youth and high school football teams and other community programs to attend the “Back Together Saturday” community event.

The Giants have enjoyed a great relationship with the Newark football community and recently provided $10000 equipment grants to all six of the city’s public high school football teams. They have also hosted annual programs in partnership with the Newark Bronze Shields (the African American police officer’s association within the Newark Police Department) for Newark’s high school football teams to discuss topics including creating healthy relationships goal setting and preparing for college.

Eddie Moraes Stadium is one of six football fields in Newark that have been rehabbed through the LISC NFL Grassroots Program. The other five are:

Andre Tippet Field Branch Brook Park Newark NJ

Nat Turner Park Central Ward Newark NJ

Westside Park Newark NJ

Jesse Allen Park Newark NJ

Newark Collegiate Academy Newark NJ

The Ironbound Community Corporation secured a $250000 grant from the NFL for the refurbishment of Eddie Moraes Stadium.

The new stadium will be a multi-purpose sports facility which is expected to host its first high school football game in the fall. It was renamed last year in memory of Eddie Moraes an Ironbound resident who was a prominent soccer player and administrator across the county for 50 years.

The Giants are again holding their training camp at the Quest Diagnostics Center their headquarters in East Rutherford. They will hold joint practices with the Cleveland Browns in Ohio on August 19 and 20 (before the teams meet in a preseason game in Cleveland on August 22) and with the Patriots in Foxboro on August 25 and 26 (prior to the teams’ preseason game in MetLife Stadium on the 29th).

""I was back there with him"" Peppers said of waiting in line to receive the football. ""He was there. And then he wasn’t.""

It wasn’t quite a disappearing act but it was close. Ross quickly demonstrated what is the defining element of his skill set — elite speed — by taking the football and zipping the length of the field for a would-be touchdown at an impressively blazing pace.

That’s what the Giants had in mind when they signed Ross a former first-round pick of the Bengals as a free-agent wide receiver in the offseason.

""You know the old adage ‘Speed kills’ "" coach Joe Judge said.

Of course that’s what the Bengals thought too when they drafted him with the ninth overall pick in 2017. Injuries kept him from breaking out; in four years in Cincinnati he played in only 27 games with 20 starts and had only 51 catches. He was dangerous when he had the ball in his hands — 10 of his 51 catches resulted in touchdowns — but that didn’t happen often enough.

""My story is obviously out there"" Ross said. ""I think my biggest thing isn’t my ability it’s my availability and me being healthy. You can tell when I’m not healthy you can see when things aren’t going right and I think that’s my biggest thing. I haven’t played 16 games yet and I’m going on my fifth year. I think that says a lot and that’s a big deal.""

Now he’s hoping he can stay healthy enough to use that speed on a more regular basis.

Ross is not a lock to make the roster. He’s competing in a crowded field of wide receivers that has gotten thicker since he signed early in free agency before the team landed Kenny Golladay in free agency and Kadarius Toney in the first round of the draft. But even among those big names Ross has stood out.

""I’ve seen a lot of things in terms of how he’s working and producing on the field and there’s been a lot of encouraging things to build on"" Judge said. ""Obviously he has elite speed and obviously he’s a very good athlete.

But there’s a lot of fast guys. I mean over in Tokyo there’s a lot of guys that are handing batons off to each other who can’t help you on the field. I think John’s definitely got a skill set where he does a good job of combining that speed and athleticism with football instincts.""

Speed is a tool Ross has had all his life. He said he remembers his first football practice as a very young kid.

""We’re doing sprints and I’m just outsprinting guys"" he said.

It goes back past there even.

""Just being outside being in the neighborhood playing with all the kids we used to play a lot of games like freeze tag and stuff"" he said. ""I always felt like I would outrun kids. It was always kind of like that.""

In a way it still is. Especially when the football is coming in his direction as it was at Giants camp when he was working on those kickoff returns.

""I just think to myself ‘Go have fun go be yourself go be the person that got you here’ "" he said of what he thinks as the ball is headed his way knowing there probably isn’t anyone on the field as fast as he is.

It becomes like those games of freeze tag when he was growing up.

""Absolutely"" he said. ""Running away from people trying to get to my destination.""

Notes & quotes: Kadarius Toney seems to be inching closer to his on-field debut with the Giants this training camp. The first-round draft pick has sat out every workout thus far after first being listed on the COVD-19/reserve list and then since being cleared early last week working on the side to reestablish his fitness post-virus. ""We’re going to start phasing him in more and more"" Judge said of the wide receiver on Saturday night . . . The Giants players were off on Sunday and will return to the field on Monday. Tuesday will be their first day in full pads . . . Judge said LG Shane Lemieux is ""day-to-day"" with the knee injury he suffered on Thursday but he’s more likely to miss a few weeks of action . . . On his first day back after passing a physical and being activated from PUP potential starting right tackle Matt Peart was splitting first-team reps with Nate Solder at Saturday’s jog-through practice in Newark. ""To get a day like this was really valuable for him to come back on Monday and be able to practice at high intensity and full speed"" Judge said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlbnRzaWRlLmNvLnVrL2xpZmVzdHlsZS90aGlzLXBhcnQtb2YtYS1tYW4tcy1ib2R5LWlzLWRpcnRpZXItdGhhbi1hLXRvaWxldC1ib3dsX2FydDE4OTYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This part of a man's body is dirtier than a toilet bowl,"Men have a body part that is not as clean as you think - it attracts so much bacteria that it is proven to be dirtier than a toilet bowl!

Attention men with beards: your beard is not nearly as clean as you think it is! In fact studies made by microbiologists in Albuquerque New Mexico (USA) by swabbing a group of bearded men have shown that beards often prove to be dirtier than a toilet bowl. Why? Because facial fuzz forms a wonderful refuge for bacteria.

A through cleaning

Microbiologist John Golobic with Quest Diagnostics said:

I'm usually not surprised and I was surprised by this there would be a degree of uncleanliness that would be somewhat disturbing.

To stem the bacterial tide there are special shampoos you can use. A thorough cleaning by scrubbing the beard approximately three times a week can at least prevent unpleasant odours. Golobic's tips? Try to keep your hands away from your face as much as possible. Plus a fair amount of hand washing.

Skin care is vital

Having a beard therefore doesn't necessarily mean that you're dirty - what counts is the right care. Jack Gilbert from the University of Chicago said that:

Human beings are just laden with bacteria some of which have the propensity to cause disease. But for the most part they’re all commensal organisms which mean they won't cause us any harm.

Beard hair is hair just like any other so it also needs to be taken care of just like head hair. Investing in a good quality beard oil can help keep beard hair healthy and looking thick and lustrous.",,,,,,

The Tokyo 2020 Olympics have officially kicked off after an impressive opening ceremony complete with the parade of nations.

However while there were numerous standout fashion moments during the ceremony not everyone was impressed with the Ralph Lauren outfits worn by Team USA with many questioning why the fashion brand is “allowed” to keep dressing the country’s Olympians.

Ralph Lauren was first tasked with the creation of Team USA’s Olympic outfits in 2008 and has been an official outfitter for the US Olympians since then.

For Team USA’s opening ceremony Parade Uniform at the Tokyo Games the designer opted for a red white and blue look complete with a blue-and-white striped shirt and a navy blue blazer.

The jacket’s pocket bears the Polo Ralph Lauren logo while the other side is emblazoned with an Olympic patch. The look was completed with denim pants accessorised with a red white and blue striped belt which was made out of recycled plastic bottles and a patriotic scarf.

For the flag-bearers the designer opted for a white denim jacket that features cooling technology created to keep the athletes cool in Tokyo’s heat.

“Team USA’s 2020 Opening Ceremony Parade Uniform is a classic all-American look that incorporates sustainable materials within each piece” the company announced earlier this week.

However following the appearance of Team USA at Friday’s opening ceremony the uniforms were widely mocked on social media where people compared the outfits to everything from attire worn by “bad guys in a DisneyChannel original movie” to a look better suited for a vacation in Rhode Island.

“Abolish Ralph Lauren from designing the USA’s Olympic opening ceremony outfits. Have we learned nothing?” one person tweeted alongside photos from this year’s opening ceremony as well as years past.

Another person said: “Ralph Lauren making Team USA look like the bad guys in an 80s teen movie again…”

“My favorite Olympics tradition is when twitter gets a load of the hideous Ralph Lauren ensembles foisted on the US athletes” someone else tweeted.

The uniforms also inspired comparisons to “Karens” while someone else suggested that the outfits “look like they’d report you to HR for cursing”.

“I think it’s time for @USAOlympics to give a shot to another designer for their official uniforms. I love Ralph Lauren but every four years it’s a predictable design with maybe a different cut for the pants and jacket to reflect current trends. #TokyoOlympics” someone else tweeted.

Others raised valid questions such as whether it is time for Team USA to hire a more diverse brand that “more closely represents the diversity of America and our athletes”.

Answer: When it’s a traditional Madras shirt – as timeless and iconic as the style gets and a summer wardrobe staple for men in the know.

What Is Madras Plaid?

Madras is a lightweight cotton that’s perfect for the type of shirt you need when it’s hot outside and you want to look cool. Yet there’s also a genuine art and history to the Madras shirt. “Madras fabric is the eponymous cloth traditionally made in Madras [now called Chennai] India” says Paul Simons son and business partner of legendary London menswear designer John Simons. “It’s a loosely woven pure cotton that is traditionally dyed in a plethora of muted – and some not so muted – check patterns. “It’s characteristically soft and lightweight which lends itself perfectly to the button down shirt creating an easy-to-wear and extremely comfortable summer shirt. It was particularly popular in the Ivy League style of 1960s USA.”

The History of the Madras Shirt

Like a lot of menswear classics the Madras shirt was popular around the middle of the 20th century. It’s pure Americana but is a little unfairly associated with US tourists. It was also worn by mods in 1960s Britain and suedeheads in the 1970s although you could never call it counter-culture. Worn correctly however it’s proof that the much-derided short-sleeve shirt should have a permanent spot in your wardrobe. “It would definitely be seen as a casual shirt” says Simons. “But these days just wearing a shirt can be seen as smart. The shirt itself should have unlinked collar and cuffs to give it that perfect relaxed feel. Personally I like to wear them untucked with plain shorts tucked in an opened collar with a pair of jeans or even with a knitted tie.”

The Best Madras Shirt Brands

If you’re looking to add a few madras shirts to your wardrobe here are the best brands to find them from.

Ralph Lauren

Madras might be a traditionally Indian pattern cloth but Ralph Lauren is a cornerstone of modern US culture – a brand that exudes wealth corporate success and fine American living. It’s also standard issue for anyone who likes preppy fashion so of course it does a good line in Madras shirts. Colorful and extremely well made these shirts prove that being square might be hip after all.

John Simons

John Simons was one of the top menswear designers in 1960s London – the man who kitted out the mods and suedeheads. The business started back in the 1950s importing Ivy League-style clothes from the US and adding a British twist. With a store in Marylebone London the Paul Simons look is still going strong – a style that’s both defined generations and transcended them. Authentic Madras shirts have always been a key part of the collections such as this long-sleeved blue and yellow check made (as with all Paul Simons Madras shirts) in India from genuine Madras fabric.

J.Crew

Much like Ralph Lauren J.Crew is another American staple – an accessible lower-cost brand with high fashion aspirations and styling. At the forefront of the growing menswear industry J. Crew has been a proponent of the ever-popular urban lumberjack look – all checked shirts denim and big hipster beards – which makes the brand a natural fit for Madras shirts too. J.Crew’s version is traditionally made in India with a relaxed fit through the body and sleeves and exclusive plaid patterns.

Abercombie & Fitch

These days you don’t need to be a super-shredded college jock to shop at Abercombie & Fitch. The brand goes back almost 130 years beginning life as a sports goods store then becoming the place for preppy youth style. But A&F has been undergoing another change in recent years harking back to its sporting history to redefine its public image. A&F worked alongside Chennai artisans to produce its Madras range which has a range of colorways. Our pick is this deep maroon check – a look that will work for both summer and autumn.

Gant

The Sweden-based fashion label dates all the way back to the early 1900s. Originally based in the US it was a staple of the midcentury Ivy League look and still produces clothes based on that old-school Americana. It’s also known for popularising the button down shirt. Unsurprisingly this indigo Madras shirt is a no-nonsense classic described as an ‘American sportswear icon’ – the kind that fits both a smart or casual outfit.

Jacamo

Jacamo’s promise is to make clothes shopping easy particularly for men who struggle to find well-fitting clothes in regular high street retailers. So thank the tailoring gods for Jacamo because shopping for bigger sizes is an unnecessarily arduous chore – something most big-name brands still haven’t caught up with. True to form its mishmash Madras shirt comes in a range of sizes – from small to 5XL – but most important is the brand’s electric designs.

Gap

You know where are with the Gap – clothes that look good on just about everyone and stores that have something for almost any taste. And if you’re after a good-looking well-made and (most importantly – affordable) madras shirt then Gap is the place to go.

This Madras shirt is part of the Beams Plus range a rugged and masculine look based on heritage and workwear-style clothing. A pop-over shirt that’s more a Madras style than authentically Indian-made (because it’s Japanese-made of course) it has the distinct vintage worn-in feel of the Beams Plus range.

Lynch had come to Stanford as a quarterback and was converted to a part-time safety role under coach Dennis Green when he got a phone call that summer from the assistant for new Cardinal coach Bill Walsh who had returned to Palo Alto after leading the San Francisco 49ers to three Super Bowl titles.

“I got on the phone with coach and he asked me when I got back to the Bay Area if I could come back and meet with him” Lynch said. “I’ll never forget as long as I live he said ‘I understand the great opportunity you have in baseball but I believe that you can be an All-Pro safety in the NFL.’ It took all my courage to say ‘With all due respect coach Walsh I played one year at safety and played half the snaps if that. What leads you to believe?’”

Walsh’s belief turned into reality as Lynch stuck with football became a two-time All-Pro for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and then was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame earlier this year after making the final 15 seven times but never getting the honor.

The journey from part-time football player and baseball prospect to Lynch’s induction into the Hall of Fame on Aug. 8 began in earnest during that conversation nearly three decades ago when Walsh showed Lynch making plays similar to Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott.

“The detail that coach Walsh went through he had made a tape and it was a play I made my junior year then a play that Ronnie Lott had made the previous year. Then a play I made blitzing the quarterback and a play Ronnie Lott had made. I think of all the people who kind of spoke this into existence and coach Walsh was so instrumental because I would have just gone off and played baseball” Lynch said. “I signed with the Marlins my heart was with football but I said ‘Hey I’ve got a future in baseball.’ Until coach Walsh told me otherwise that’s where I was going. So I certainly would not be here without Bill Walsh.”

Lynch did plenty on his own since making the decision to stick with football. He intercepted four passes his final season at Stanford and showed enough to become a third-round pick by Tampa Bay. After three seasons as a part-time player Lynch earned a full-time role in coach Tony Dungy’s first season in 1996. He became a key part of one of the league’s top defenses with his fearsome hitting and smart play in the Bucs secondary.

Lynch earned his first of nine Pro Bowl selections in his second season as a full-time starter in 1997 was an All-Pro in back-to-back seasons in 1999 and 2000 then played a big part in Tampa’s first Super Bowl title in the 2002 season.

“It didn’t take off for me right away” Lynch said. “I started as a special teams player my first couple of years. Thank God for people like Tony Dungy and Herm Edwards and Monte Kiffin who saw and believed in me more than I believed in myself.”

Lynch’s success has carried him beyond the football field. He went from his career as a player into the broadcast booth where he became one of the top analysts at Fox. Then with an itch with for the competition of being part of a team Lynch was hired along with coach Kyle Shanahan to rebuild the San Francisco 49ers in 2017.

Lynch was voted executive of the year by the Pro Football Writers of America in his third season when he helped the Niners reach the Super Bowl and has the franchise in position to contend again this season. His ability to thrive in everything he does led Shanahan to nickname him “Captain America.”

“Usually people like that just on average usually I think I’m like all right the person’s got to be somewhat phony” Shanahan said before the Super Bowl in 2020. “What’s he really like? No one is really Captain America. So you’re waiting to see how they are really. That’s probably the opposite of how I am. But then you get with John day in and day out and that’s genuinely who he is. ... To have that type of personality that’s just exactly who he is and on top of that to be one of the most violent physical players I’ve ever seen I think it’s as cool of a combination as there is.”

This led to more revelations within the Latvia blacksite. Could the conversation hint at more revelations in season 9?

It’s been nearly a month since The Blacklist aired its season 8 finale “Konets” but we’re still unraveling the mythology from “Nachalo.” The penultimate episode found Raymond “Red” Reddington (James Spader) and former FBI agent Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone) at the secret Latvia blacklist site where analog communications get the necessary information to Reddington. While some remain focused on the ending of “Konets” it’s worth revisiting two important lines that “Godwin Page” presented as they might give clues about the journey ahead in season 9.

‘The Blacklist’ Season 8 in a nutshell

Season 8 of The Blacklist served up a bevy of information. From the belated premiere (thanks to the pandemic) the season kicked off with Liz’s quest for revenge against Reddington for killing her mother Katerina Rostova (Laila Robins). Later it was revealed that the woman wasn’t her mother but a superspy tasked with finding the real Katerina at all costs which meant — in Reddington’s world — she had to die to protect Liz and the secrets he keeps.

Liz who landed the top spot on Red’s blacklist after going rogue had all but planned to kill the man plaguing her for eight years — until he showed her the physical blacklist site in Latvia. The stand-alone episode “Nachalo” dove deep into the mythology revolving around Red’s list of underground criminals as well as a closer look at young Katerina’s life and choices that led them there.

The big reveal from ‘Nachalo’

Some of the revelations that came from the episode include what really happened the night of the fire when Liz shot her father. Katerina stated the real Raymond Reddington died in the car that night. The confession attempted to clear up some confusion regarding who was present who Liz shot and if Liz’s father lived or died but multiple fandom threads are still dissecting those answers.

The biggest reveal among the few told the tale of both Katerina and Ilya Koslov taking over Reddington’s identity to withdraw his money. Many assumptions were made in regards to James Brown’s “This Is a Man’s World” playing through the montage — namely that Reddington became Katerina at some point. “Konets” only amplified theories in the final moments when Liz is shot as she looks up at Reddington’s face and supposedly understands who he really is.

While we don’t have concrete answers about what it all meant. However we do have two of Reddington’s lines from “Godwin Page” that could sum it up.

These two lines might hint at what’s to come

At the tail end of “Godwin Page” Reddington and Liz stand outside the physical blacklist site in Latvia where they have one important conversation about Katerina Rostova.

“You’re lying” Liz said. “You framed my mother. Made the world believe she stole the archive.”

“You need to forget what you think you know” Red said.

After Liz re-iterated “you set her up” he shut it down.

“Elizabeth you need to listen to me” he said. “Katarina Rostova was neither framed or killed.”

He then explained that the Sikorsky archive was created with Katerina’s knowledge and blessing. If we look back to the pilot when Red confessed he’s a criminal and “criminals are notorious liars” can we deduce that everything we’ve been told up to this point was a lie — or are the revelations in “Nachalo” and “Konets” the lies?

How those lines from ‘Godwin Page’ might fuel Reddington in ‘The Blacklist’ season 9

We won’t touch the fan theories about the true identity of Raymond Reddington this time around but there are they’re mostly of two minds: either Reddington is Katerina or he isn’t. Whichever camp you fall into season 9 will likely ignore the ambiguous hints or they’ll confirm them. With Boone out — and series creator Jon Bokenkamp — the latter is more likely.

Season 9 could lean into Red‘s previous words about Katerina not being framed or killed with a more in-depth look at how it all came to be through multiple episodes as opposed to just one. And because we can’t take anything Red says at face value he already told us to forget what we think we know. If that’s a reference to either Katerina/Red theory scratch it. Season 9 will have to take some stance but we have a feeling it’ll be on the conservative side without Bokenkamp at the helm.

By now most know that The Blacklist creator Jon Bokenkamp announced his exit from the long-running NBC series. For eight seasons Bokenkamp manned the helm of one of TV’s most intriguing mysteries about FBI informant Raymond “Red” Reddington (James Spader). His departure leaves a lot of unanswered questions regarding the future of the show — namely how it’ll all end.

Jon Bokenkamp relied heavily on ‘The Blacklist’ bible to keep track of storylines

With nine seasons of storylines it’s tricky for The Blacklist to keep things consistent. The mythology surrounding the fulcrum Sikorsky Archive N-13 and all the Russian character backstories is especially complex. Bokenkamp never denied the fact that The Blacklist was his first go at TV. So how did he keep it all straight? At first things were drawn on a storyboard wall but then the series really took off.

“It’s more of a bible now” he previously told Digital Trends. “Occasionally if we bump up against something like ‘Does Liz speak Russian?’ — we have to go back to the bible to keep it straight and to be on point with exactly what the backstory is.”

He continued: “We’re very religious about being honest and true to the mythology of the show the origins of it and where we’re planning to go. So yeah we’re meticulous about the mythology and maintaining the bible that we’re adding to and checking against it to make sure we’re not contradicting ourselves in the storytelling.”

‘The Blacklist’ creator had an ending in mind long before his exit

The season 8 finale of The Blacklist left viewers stunned. Leading lady Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone) was killed off in a surprising twist. While it’s not the end of Reddington’s journey or that of the series just yet it is the end of an era. In that same Digital Trends interview Bokenkamp seemed confident in how the series would end.

“What I’ll say about the trajectory of the show and where it’s going — and where it’s been going since Day 1 — is that we do have a grasp on who these people are how they’re interconnected and what the agendas are” he said. “That of course shifts at times and adjusts just because of the nature of doing 22 episodes of TV each season — and we don’t want to get there too quickly.”

He continued: “We’re fortunate to know where we’re going and fortunate to have smart writers on staff who are keeping us in line with that. I don’t think we could tell as complex a story or as emotional a story if we were just winging it.”

Raymond Reddington is ‘The Blacklist’ guide

With the use of the bible the writers have crafted a complex narrative that we now know will end with season 10. Back in the day Bokenkamp reiterated:

“No matter how long we’re on? I have in my heart — and James Spader shares it and executive producer John Eisendrath and the people in the writer’s room do too — that we have a story and it’s one we’re sticking to” he said.

He added: “You figure out your destination you find a couple of towns you’re going to stop in along the way you look at the map and study it and then you throw it away. You still know exactly where you’re going and you know what marks to hit along the way. That’s true for each season and that’s true for the series. At times it adjusts slightly but the truth of who Reddington guides us in every single episode. It also makes writing the episodes incredibly difficult but it is our guide.”

So as long as Reddington is alive so is their guide.

Will the series still end with Bokenkamp’s original vision?

The sudden departure of Bokenkamp (along with star Boone) left a confusing mix of emotions among fans following the season 8 finale. The changes were reflected in season 9. Bokenkamp’s vision for the series finale seemed to be well thought out and planned in advance. It’s hard to know whether the remaining executive producers (one being Spader) will follow through or take a new direction.

All in all we’ll have to wait and see. New episodes of The Blacklist Season 10 air Sundays at 10 p.m. ET on NBC."

Hear me out okay? While adults have all these probabilities that they have to work out for whether we think it's likely or not we can achieve something kids often just do something anyway and see what happens and for one pre-teen in Florida it resulted in him bypassing a lottery so he and his dad could get their hands on a 3090 GPU.

We've talked at length about how difficult it is to get your hands on the latest generation of GPUs. The 30 series GPUs especially have been some of the most unobtainable pieces of tech on the market and when some do appear here and there lotteries are often held to make sure all the products aren't been snapped up by scalpers.

PCs are pretty huge sometimes which is why we're excited to see how Valve's new Steam Deck performs...

As reported by PC Gamer and PCMag there is one 11-year-old however who worked out how to bypass one such system altogether securing a shiny RTX 3090 for his family and this is how he did it.

Advert

Newegg as you may well be aware is a huge tech retailer and one of the places you're most likely to find 30 series GPUs at the moment. To try and make the system as fair as possible for consumers Newegg has implemented a lottery for people to enter to get the chance to buy an RTX 3090. So in theory the 3090 was in stock during the lottery right?

Ricardo Santana

Well Newegg also has a ""Build Your PC"" feature on the site too allowing people to purchase all the different components you'd need for a custom PC. When ordering a build the components appear in your basket separately including the 3090. And that's where Ricardo Santana Jr. thought to delete all of the other components and just check out with the GPU securing his family an EVGA RTX 3090 with no problem. Smart.

Newegg has since closed this loophole and assures users that a minimal number of GPUs were purchased in this way before the company fixed the issue. In an interview with PCMag about the loophole Ricardo's dad says: ""I thought about purchasing more but don't want to abuse it and would like to give other people the opportunity. I'm thinking that they (Newegg) are prioritizing selling custom builds with the inventory they have for the Shuffle. I'm not sure exactly how many people are winning the Shuffle but I tried the Shuffle so many times and never won. It's terrible that we have to go to this extent to be able to obtain these cards.""

Even a few years after its release Red Dead Redemption 2 remains one of the best-looking games ever – especially on PC and with the latest update bringing support for Nvidia's DLSS tech we've returned to see if we can finally play the game in full 8K glory.

Back in 2019 we originally tried running Red Dead Redemption 2 at 8K in our 8K test system with the $2499 (around £2000 AU$3600) Nvidia Titan RTX graphics card. At the time it was the most powerful consumer GPU Nvidia had made.

The results weren't pretty: with all the settings whacked up to full Red Dead Redemption hit 18.65 frames per second on average in the benchmark at the demanding 7680 × 4320 resolution.

However returning to the title today we were more confident of achieving a better result. For a start over the past two years since we tried it at 8K the game has had numerous updates many of which helped improve performance – including the latest one which adds DLSS.

Secondly we've replaced the Nvidia Titan RTX with the newer Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090. While this GPU is cheaper than the Titan RTX it actually performs a lot better thanks to the advancements Nvidia brought to its RTX 30 Series cards.

We revisited several games to see how the RTX 3090 performs at 8K compared to the Titan RTX and on the whole the RTX 3090 offered some impressive gains when it came to FPS.

In Red Dead Redemption 2 for example the Titan RTX managed just 18.65 frames per second with all the details set to maximum a far cry from the 60 fps we consider to be minimum for PC gaming these days especially with ultra-high-end GPUs.

The RTX 3090 meanwhile scored a better (though not ideal) 19.02 fps. However we re-ran the tests with the latest update with highest settings but the new DLSS feature off and it hit a much better 25.3 fps. This leap could be thanks to Red Dead Redemption 2 updates that have been released since our initial tests along with Nvidia driver improvements which have made

With that base improvement our hopes that Red Dead Redemption 2 at 8K could actually be a reality rose.

With a little help from my DLSS

The reason we loaded up Red Dead Redemption 2 at 8K once more was the fact that it now supports DLSS. Short for Deep Learning Super Sampling it uses the tensor cores in Nvidia’s GeForce RTX cards to upscale a game’s resolution.

Thanks to machine learning and AI it can take a game running at 1440p for example and upscale it to 4K – or higher. The idea is that this upscaled game should look a lot like it was running at that higher resolution natively but because it's actually running at a lower resolution it's less taxing on your GPU.

This could then be used to help lower-end GPUs achieve 'higher' resolutions while smoothing out frame rate drops for more powerful cards allowing them to keep a rock-solid fps.

We've tested a number of games with DLSS and have been really impressed. Even if there are noticeable differences between an upscaled game using DLSS and one running natively it's usually not that noticeable and most importantly it allows for better performance without impacting graphical fidelity all that much. It can also mean you can implement intensive graphical effects like ray tracing that your gaming rig may have traditionally struggled with.

So we were keen to see what a difference DLSS makes especially at the ultra-high 8K resolution. As usual we played the game using our 8K gaming PC provided by Chillbast along with Dell's UltraSharp UP3218K monitor. Check out the boxout on the right for the full spec of the PC we used.

After hitting 25.3fps at 8K with all graphical settings set to their highest levels but DLSS off we kept everything the same but turned DLSS to 'Auto'. The results were drastic with it now hitting 50fps on average – effectively doubling the frame rate.

While still not hitting 60fps on average it instantly makes the game actually playable at 8K something it wasn't without DLSS and it's a potent example of how much of a difference DLSS can make.

The minimum fps also rose from 21.5 to 29.7 fps while the max frame rates doubled from 31.3 to 62.2 fps. This leaps shows that with a bit of tweaking we should be able to get to 60fps on average at 8K – which was once considered unobtainable.

Visual-wise it looked fantastic if perhaps a little softer in distant details. Of course Red Dead Redemption 2 like most games hasn't been designed for 8K so textures aren't going to benefit from the high resolution but overall DLSS has shown just what it's capable of.

Red Dead Redemption 2 offers several DLSS options so we tested out 'Quality' mode next. This prioritizes graphics over performance so the impact to visual quality is minimized but then so to are the performance gains. This is because the resolution DLSS is upscaling from is higher. Still it's a decent bump hitting 34.4 fps on average. That's certainly playable though we don't think the visual benefits are worth the hit.

The 'Balanced' setting tries to find a line between image quality and performance but it just hit 38.4 which makes us feel it's still a little too weighted for image quality at the expense of performance.

Finally there's two performance options. We went straight for 'Ultra Performance' and hit 50.3 fps which gives us the impression that 'Auto' tends towards performance especially when you're trying to really push the game at 8K.

By coming so close to 60fps with everything set to its highest graphical settings it gave us flexibility to drop a few settings here and there which helped us hit that 60fps goal.

This is incredibly exciting as it shows the potential of DLSS when it comes to 8K gaming and as many of us hoped it could mean that gaming at 7680 × 4320 resolutions will one day become more widespread and achievable without having to invest in extremely expensive hardware.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzkwNjE5LW5leHQtZ2VuLWdwdXMtbG9vay1iaWctaHVuZ3J5LWJhZC1uZXdzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Next-gen GPUs look big and hungry and that's bad news,"A hot potato: Gamers who thought that the current crop of RDNA2 and RTX 30-series GPUs were already demanding might be in for a surprise if the most recent drop of leaks is to be believed.

Both kopite7kimi and Greymon55 established leakers in their own rights seem to be in agreement that some of Nvidia's upcoming Lovelace GPUs will land somewhere north of the 400W range. These figures would presumably be for the top models of the RTX 4000 series built on AD102 silicon successors to the RTX 3080 / Ti and RTX 3090.

Besides pushing the GPU core as hard as possible a great deal of this power budget will come from the continued use of the hot and power-hungry GDDR6X memory on Nvidia's top models.

Separately Bondrewd of the Beyond3D forums left hints on Navi 31 the top SKU from AMD's RDNA3 line-up suggesting that the multi-chiplet GPU would sit below 500W in total board power draw and below 350 mm² per graphics core die.

With an estimated size of 600-650 mm² for the two GCDs alone and perhaps 800 mm² for the whole GPU (when including the Infinity Cache-bearing MCDs) 3Dcenter believes that Navi 31 will end up in the region of 450-480W for total board power.

Although the GPUs are nowhere near from release these numbers are already concerning. In addition to being a bigger strain on PSUs and cooling in smaller cases the growing power draw of GPUs is increasingly leaving gaming laptops behind.

Size and weight constraints of gaming laptops limit their cooling ability and TDPs have remained stubbornly fixed as a result with mobile GPUs rarely given more than 150W to work with and that's the bulkier models that have lots of cooling.

That was good enough when the 180W GTX 1080 was the bar to beat but the RTX 2080 called for 215W and the RTX 3080 asked for 320W taking gaming laptops from near-parity to only half the power of a desktop card in just a few generations.

That's excluding how growing die sizes have locked out the top end GPUs from laptops entirely with the laptop RTX 3080 and RX 6800M actually using a lower tier silicon than their desktop counterparts. Or how partner cards routinely draw even more power reference numbers like EVGA's FTW3 pushing the RTX 3080 to almost 400W.

Surely 400W+ GPUs are unlikely to trouble top end battlestations with immaculately designed cooling and kilowatt power supplies. But for regular gamers – those using smaller cases or on laptops or keeping hold of an ol' reliable 500W PSU – they're becoming a major problem.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei94ZngtdG8tbGF1bmNoLWEtY3VzdG9tLXJhZGVvbi1yeC02OTAweHQtZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZC13aXRoLWFuLWVrLXdhdGVyLWJsb2Nr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,XFX to launch a custom Radeon RX 6900XT graphics card with an EK water block,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='videocardz.com', port=443): Read timed out.

A young woman from Alabama who vanished in Europe two years ago has finally been found her family says.

Nicole Denise Jackson 23 left her Birmingham area home for Germany at the end of 2018 and eventually stopped answering calls and texts. Her family hasn’t heard from her in two years.

On Friday a private investigator finally found her.

“Nicole has been located” the family told WBRC . “She’s safe and in good health. She has been verified by the State Department in person.”

Ms Jackson who is a singer allegedly moved to Germany to study music – and her family later learned to be with a man she’d met online. After she got there she continued speaking with her family for about a year occasionally sending a “Happy birthday” text or some other perfunctory communication.

Then around Christmas of 2019 she went silent.

“I know this is not like her’’ Ms Jackson’s older sister Ela Vaughn told AL.com in July. “When I say no one has talked to her I mean no one.”

In July Ms Vaughn and her father Antonio Jackson hired a detective to find Ms Jackson and also prepared to travel to Munich to look for her themselves.

The detective got to her first. Digging through Ms Jackson’s emails the P.I. managed to identify the man Ms Jackson was living with and contacted his employer and landlord.

Before long Ms Jackson – apparently aware her family was looking for her – walked into a State Department outpost and showed proof of her identity.

However she still hasn’t spoken to her family.

“She’ll reach out to us when he’s ready’’ Ms Vaughn told AL.com . “I feel a whole lot better. She will eventually reach out. I know she will.”

Ms Vaughn still doesn’t understand why her sister stopped communicating with their family but says the important thing is that she’s alive.

“I’m more at peace. I’d still like to hear her voice’’ Ms Vaughn said. “I’m happy to know our prayers have been answered. She’s safe and she’s OK.”

The bank had posted a net profit of Rs 93.55 crore in the year-ago quarter ended in June 2020 and that of Rs 127.81 crore in the previous quarter ended in March 2021.

""Net loss of Rs 630 crore for Q1FY22 is because of prudent provisions for Covid wave 2.0. Covid provision pool increased from Rs 375 crore to Rs 725 crore during the current quarter on a prudent basis to act as a cushion for Covid impact"" IDFC First Bank said in a release.

The bank expects to collect a reasonable proportion of these dues in due course it added.

Total income (net of interest expense) grew by 36 per cent year-on-year to Rs 3034 crore in Q1FY22 driven by the growth in NII and fee income the bank said. Its total income during Q1FY21 stood at Rs 2229 crore in June 2020 quarter.

The bank said its net interest margin (NIM) -- the difference of interest earned and expended -- was the highest ever at 5.51 per cent during the reported quarter. The NIM was 4.86 per cent in year ago quarter.

The net interest income (NII) rose by 25 per cent year-on-year to Rs 2185 crore.

On the asset front bank's gross and net non-performing assets (NPAs) were at 4.61 per cent and 2.32 per cent respectively as of June 30 2021.

The NPA ratios were up from 1.99 per cent and 0.51 per cent respectively from year ago period.

""The GNPA and NNPA include impact of 84 bps (basis points which is one hundredth of a percentage) and 71 bps respectively on account of one Mumbai based infra toll account which slipped during the quarter. The bank expects no material economic loss in this account eventually as this is an operating toll road and is only delayed.""



Bank deposits were up by 36 per cent to Rs 84893 crore. The retail loan book of the lender increased to Rs 72766 crore as on June 30 2021 from Rs 56043 crore.

The year-on-year growth of the retail loan book was 27 per cent excluding Emergency Credit Guarantee Line loan book of Rs 1645 crore. However it declined by 1.2 per cent on a sequential basis. The wholesale loan book fell by 15 per cent to Rs 34232 crore from Rs 40275 crore.

Capital adequacy ratio stood at 15.56 per cent with CET-1 (common equity tier-1) ratio at 14.86 per cent. Average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was at 166 per cent for Q1FY22.

""Within just two years we have made tremendous progress at the bank. Our CASA (current account savings account) ratio is high at 50.86 per cent despite reducing savings account interest rates by 200 bps recently which points to the trust customers have in our bank and service levels.

""Because of our low cost CASA we can now participate in prime home loans business which is a large business opportunity"" V Vaidyanathan Managing Director and CEO IDFC First Bank said. Regarding the loss during the quarter he said the bank has made prudent provisions for Covid second wave.

""We expect provisions to reduce for the rest of the three quarters in FY22. We guide for achieving pre-Covid level gross and net NPA with targeted credit loss of only 2 per cent on our retail book by Q4FY 22 and onwards assuming no further lockdowns"" he said further.",,,,,,,,,

“[Tests] have been watered down and watered down until we have almost no rules at all” said Dr. Weatherington-Rice.

Pennsylvania Gov. Wolf’s administration in coordination with Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection announced July 26 that it would begin to require quarterly testing of leachate for radium at all Pennsylvania landfills. The move comes five years after the release of the DEP’s 2016 TENORM study which found that radium in landfill waste was a cause for concern.

Public Herald editor-in-chief and co-founder Joshua B. Pribanic provided the following statement on the Wolf administration’s announcement:

“After two years of Public Herald investigations exposing the statewide radioactive leachate problem DEP’s response — while a step in the right direction — barely scratches the surface of the science required to tackle this problem. Worse yet DEP has again attempted to downplay the TENORM issue by releasing false propaganda about its 2016 study. While we hope the attorney general’s response would bring criminal action for the state’s negligence on this issue it appears the release of this material for over a decade into public waters will likely go uncharged. Public Herald will remain steadfast on informing the public and holding the governor the attorney general the DOH and the DEP accountable for their actions.”

The DeWine administration in Ohio however has yet to make a similar regulatory move leaving a hole in the knowledge the state has of what’s going into and coming out of its landfills and treatment plants — a point echoed by Dr. Weatherington-Rice.

“Those gate posts [at landfills] were never designed for that kind of [low level radiation] scanning. They were designed for hospital waste [for something that decays rapidly]” Dr. Weatherington-Rice said about places like Pennsylvania and Ohio who don’t use gamma spectroscopy to figure out radium levels in each load of waste. Without that kind of testing she says “They don’t know what they put in that landfill. They think they do but they don’t.”

While rules still exist in Ohio concerning the testing and facilitation of waste disposal they are scant and do little to control radioactivity. If future legislation does not address these issues the health of Ohio’s waterways will continue to be put at risk.

Increased competition among Wall Street enthusiasts to offer crypto services to clients

Fresh off State Street dispatching a committed advanced resources unit State Street Digital the institutional caretaker and speculation benefits firm with $3.5 trillion in resources under administration is adding computerized and cryptographic money resource store administrations.

The new computerized resource store organization apparatuses for private asset customers will be offered in association with crypto information benefits firm Lukka. State Street will use Lukka reference information and Lukka prime valuing information notwithstanding center and administrative center information the board devices to assist with giving compromise and detailing administrations among others.

The new administrations are intended to help expand institutional interest in adding advanced resource openness to more customary portfolios.

In the event that one contemplates the driver for a devoted computerized division inside State Street have the option to be checking out the corner and the speed for which advanced will play in a conventional portfolio for their customers as Jen Tribush options lead for State Street Digital expressed.

Financial investor in Lukka

It is a decent illustration of where they are to utilize the right device set according to an advanced point of view and have it incorporated in with the customary portfolio and their asset organization offering.

State Street is likewise a financial backer in Lukka having taken an interest in its $21 million Series C round in December 2020. Altogether the organization has raised $99 million to date at a $200 million valuation. Among its striking financial backers is S&P Global with whom it is banding together on crypto resource value lists.

According to Lukka’s viewpoint CEO Robert Materrazi noted that State Street is driving the charge to introduce the up-and-coming age of asset organization. Enormous conventional assets are quickly hoping to add crypto to their contributions which drives them to ask their current trusted assistance suppliers.

Increased competitors in the segment

Express Street’s move into the advanced resource space comes as other Wall Street banks have started offering crypto items to customers. Recently JPMorgan turned into the principal significant US bank to give select customers admittance to cryptographic money reserves.

In March Morgan Stanley MS – 0.3% started offering its most well off customers (those with basically $2 million in resources held) admittance to three assets with bitcoin openness and in June Goldman Sachs GS – 0.7% started offering crypto prospects to institutional customers and multifaceted investments.

Further a few financial backers are eager for the Securities and Exchange Commission to endorse a bitcoin ETF yet that is probably not going to happen this year. Talking with CNBC’s Bob Pisani on Wednesday SEC chair Gary Gensler repeated remarks that financial backers in crypto markets don’t have the full securities they have in the value markets.

State Street which has $3.6 trillion resources under administration and $40.3 trillion in resources under guardianship is the second of the five significant worldwide overseers to provide assistance for computerized resources. BNY Mellon additionally plans to offer crypto resource administrations for clients this year.

Nadine Chakar head of worldwide business sectors at State Street will lead the division and report to head working official Lou Maiuri. The bank likewise said the division intends to make new liquidity settings for our customers and financial backers.

Recently it said it has been loaning its unfamiliar trade innovation to a start- up called Pure Digital an interbank computerized cash exchanging scene that expects to be the go-to crypto exchanging stage for establishments.",,,

Becoming one of the family but from a northern climate I quickly saw and have enjoyed this truth for many wonderful years. I learned how to play cribbage because of Bob and loved all the funny and sporting phrases he used when we played. I learned love of community service from him and what I will always hold dear is how he looked at life from the ""glass half full"" perspective instead of the ""half-empty"" one I grew up with from my own father.

Bob was always a sweet & gentle man. He had a good life which he shared with family friends and community. We are thinking of you all and express our sincere thoughts & sympathy. - Sharon & Murray Galin  Savannah  GA

Ninety-eight years of exemplary exuberant life gave Bob lots of opportunities to commit his best to each endeavor and his warmth and kindness to every person. He was no softie though. He had rigorous ethics and performance standards. He believed in personal accountability and relegation of self to the common good. He sought no acclaim and made those around him the stars. Whether it be in banking service teaching or living in general Bob brought the genuine one hundred percent best of humanity. He glowed with goodness. It was an honor to know him and to have him know my son at DeRenne in Bob's photography class. Bob gave me a great parenting boost during those middle school years. I am stricken for all the Paddison family and wish each the very best kind of mourning the kind that illuminates a life performed exquisitely. - Louisa Abbot  Savannah  GA

Now as the world slowly emerges from the pandemic companies are hiring again. Gorton says every business she goes into is looking for candidates with strong skills particularly in business intelligence analytics and cybersecurity.

“The problem is they can’t find them” Gorton says. “As a result upskilling is the way to go and I’m telling companies I can find them good people but they are going to have to train them.”

From knowledge to profit

Links between professional development and the profitability of organisations are well established.

“CPD ensures the upskilling of employees’ technical capabilities leadership competencies stakeholder relationship management skills and the ability to strategise analyse and use that information to make more robust decisions for the business” says Gorton. The company benefits because staff get better at problem solving and identifying trends and opportunities for efficiencies and innovation.

What’s more staff who can apply their skills and play to their strengths daily are six times more likely to be engaged on the job according to a Gallup Poll.

“Professional development training is overlooked and underappreciated as an employee retention and recruitment tool” says Gorton. “In fact it’s often one of the first things to go when budgets get cut.”

Gorton thinks that’s a false economy. Instead companies should be using CPD as a tool to “attract top job candidates retain their best workers and identify future leaders”.

A price worth paying

While it is clear that CPD offers all-round benefits what is less clear is who should be paying for it.

Peter Polgar FCPA is executive chair of professional services firm Reanda Australia and says even after 50 years in finance and accountancy trying to keep abreast of what is going on in the industry is more challenging than ever.

He is in no doubt however that continued professional development should be a shared responsibility between the employer the employee and professional associations.

“Professional development should be a shared vision. We need to take ownership as we are all in this together” he says.

At Reanda employees are encouraged to take an active part in their own learning and are reimbursed for the cost of successfully completed training courses.

“Big firms like ours have the resources and capacity to budget for professional development but smaller firms are less able to do that and training becomes a discretionary cost” says Polgar.

""Employers recognise the importance of 'soft' skills training but it competes in priority with new product launches performance and growth... the appetite is there but it's not always a priority and that needs to change."" — Nicole Gorton Robert Half Australia

In order to help manage the cost of CPD for staff the employer should have a good understanding of the business’s cost revenue structure. Taking a strategic view of CPD means determining what the organisation needs and when and how to go about delivering that in the most cost-efficient way possible.

This may include delivering CPD through group training sessions or peer-to-peer knowledge sharing with employees presenting their learning to the wider team following a conference for example.

A weekly or monthly discussion group on problem issues could also bring a team closer together.

Cross-training or shadowing someone who is comfortable performing tasks another employee needs to learn is another cost-effective way of upskilling staff as is identifying an employee with strong communication and behavioural skills who is willing to act as trainer for others and would be happy to change their job description.

A business that prioritises CPD and develops a clear idea of how learning and development activities fit into the overall strategy is much more likely to achieve desired results without going over budget.",,,

At the recently held online ARC Industry Forum Asia titled Accelerating Digital Transformation in a Post-COVID World SUPCON participated as a Silver Sponsor. For the first time instead of hosting separate Forums across Asia (India Japan and China) we consolidated our efforts into a single virtual event that attracted over 2500 registrations with both Japanese and English language tracks.

ARC’s recent virtual Forums (USA and Europe) focused on the digital transformation of industry and infrastructure and this was also the theme of the Asia Forum. Companies such as SUPCON have made rapid progress in digital transformation spearheading new ways of doing business supporting customers leveraging available services and adapting to a changed business environment.

Founded in 1999 SUPCON is one of China’s leading providers of automation and information technology DCS products and solutions. It has grown rapidly on the back of cutting-edge systems for the development of innovative technology products. Kim Hock Teo Vice President of International Business at SUPCON Technology spoke about the mega market trends reshaping the global economy and digitalization of the process industries substantiated with real-life case studies. The company is undergoing a paradigm shift in the way it views interacts and delivers solutions to its customers by shifting to collaboration adding value and business partnerships on the digital transformation journey.

Mega Trends Sweeping the Industry

Research Innovate Enterprise 2025 (RIE2025) is a nationwide initiative in Singapore to restructure and build a digital economy said Mr. Teo. The key focus areas are:

Develop technology leadership to drive Smart Nation objectives

Reinforce Singapore’s position as a trusted digital innovation hub

Enhance local capabilities and create new partnerships

RIE2025 has identified the key shifts that are reshaping the global economy. In a rapidly changing business environment consumer preferences are changing and the focus is on sustainability. COVID-19 and geopolitics have dramatically changed international trade flows. Before the pandemic companies focused on efficiency but now the focus is on resilience in supply chains and production. Across geographies organizations are accelerating their digital transformation journeys prioritizing innovation.

Macroeconomic forces driving the market include convergence of technologies changing demographic landscape sustainable development goals and the shrinking world that intensifies competition with free flow of capital and technologies. Digitalization helps organizations to overcome the challenges ushered in by these market forces. In this context Mr. Teo spoke about how Covestro is adapting to the changed business environment.

Covestro

Premium polymer manufacturer Covestro is reorganizing its company to become a total solution provider instead of just selling materials to its customers. This was possible because of digitalization. Covestro has a three-dimensional view of digitalization: digital operations digital customer experience and digital business models.

Digitalization of the Process Industry

Mr. Teo traced the progress of process automation over the years. Each stage saw significant improvements. Initially operations were fully manual later operations were managed by the central control room (CCR) which led to integrated operations (production and maintenance teams). Today end users can take advantage of borderless digitalized operations. Advancements in automation and IT have improved operational safety and efficiency through centralized control and management. Today there is connectivity across all operational and enterprise layers from the corporate headquarters to warehouses customers and partners. It is about automating all the processes and breaking down the silos. The aim is to eliminate the need for spreadsheets/emails etc. in the plant. “Digitalization is a means of automating the workflow as well as the business processes” said Mr. Teo.

SUPCON’S Digitalization Strategy

At SUPCON there’s been a paradigm shift in approach and strategy and to create value for their customers the work ethos has changed. This is visible in the graphic below.

SUPCON focuses on five technologies to help its customers on their digital transformation journey: process equipment operation automation and information. Through these technologies SUPCON aims to deliver enhanced safety quality efficiency sustainability and control/reduce cost for their customers. “Digital transformation is about creating new values by greater cross-border collaboration with trusted information” added Mr. Teo.

SupOS the company’s scalable industrial operating system is the new paradigm that cuts through hierarchical/organizational layers. The focus goes beyond the plant to the operational issues and environment. SupOS is an open platform that provides connectivity from the plant to the outside world. Elaborating on the SupOS Industrial APP platform Mr. Teo said that it is a collaborative tool that is unified across the enterprise with many built-in features so that larger ecosystems can be established to build applications for industries. A few applications to achieve more efficient workflows such as online configuration dashboard display information security and multidimensional visualization were explained. Mr. Teo’s advice was to “think big start small and scale fast.” Next he showcased two case studies.

Shandong Chambroad Petrochemicals Digital Project: 5 ecosystem partners involved; 50+ industrial apps; integration of 30+ heterogeneous systems.

Conch Cement Big Data Platform National Research Project: Integration and interconnection of existing systems; remote maintenance and energy optimization; over 95 percent production stability.

Conclusion

The new normal created by the pandemic is impacting companies and propelling them to respond faster and become more agile and operationally resilient. It is imperative to leverage technologies for remote operations collaborate across geographies and improve project outcomes. Mr. Teo’s presentation made it clear that the digitalization of the process industry is accelerating and SUPCON is a valuable partner on this journey. Mr. Teo’s presentation video (Day 1 Session 3) will be available for the next three months on this platform: ARC Asia Forum 2021 (vfairs.com). The document and video link are also available at the SUPCON booth.

Today most industrial companies have two separate cybersecurity programs. Cybersecurity professionals in the CIO’s organization ensure the security of corporate data IT assets networks and business applications. Technical personnel in operations and engineering take care of the security of OT networks and assets.

Differences in IT and OT technologies goals and environments justified the development of separate security programs. But today’s siloed programs are leaving many plants at risk of a serious cyber incident. OT cybersecurity programs often lack the resources expertise and supporting technology to maintain defenses manage attacks and secure the new technologies being deployed in operating facilities. CISO efforts to manage security are also being hampered by the lack of OT system visibility and access.

This situation will only get worse unless companies act. The industrial cyber threat environment is already becoming more challenging with ransomware sophisticated attacks like SolarWinds and the explosion of digital transformation programs. These developments demand well-maintained end-to-end security of all corporate activities and rapid detection and response to all anomalous events. While most industrial IT security programs have the cyber professionals and advanced security solutions to deal with these new challenges many OT security programs are still struggling to achieve yesterday’s requirements.

IT/OT cybersecurity convergence offers a cost-effective way to address current and future OT security challenges. IT cyber professionals can fill critical resource and expertise gaps in OT security programs. Common cybersecurity processes can eliminate security gaps between IT and OT systems. Use of similar technologies can enhance visibility and incident response effectiveness.

While convergence offers many benefits experience shows that combining IT and OT programs can be challenging. Successful convergence efforts have clear convergence goals and proven approaches for addressing critical issues like cultural differences and OT reluctance to use conventional IT security practices and technologies. This report presents some of the lessons learned by leading companies that are already on cybersecurity convergence journeys.

Industrial Cybersecurity Today

Industrial cybersecurity teams face an awesome set of responsibilities and challenges. IT security teams which are often part of the CIO’s organization are responsible for managing the security of a wide range of information processing technologies including workstations servers networks printers websites cloud applications and mobile devices. This includes ensuring the confidentiality of all corporate information and the continuous availability of critical business systems and applications.

OT security teams are commonly assigned to specific facilities and commonly report to plant managers or corporate engineering managers. These people are responsible for ensuring the availability and integrity of control systems SCADA systems and a diverse collection of cyber physical systems like robots packaging systems etc. Managers expect them to prevent any cyber incidents that might impact safety product quality environmental compliance or operational continuity.

While IT and OT security teams may collaborate on security of interfaces decisions about OT security within facilities are generally made and funded locally based on each site’s risk appetite capabilities and preferences.

Cybersecurity Is More Mature for IT

IT cybersecurity programs are generally more advanced than those in OT. Most IT cybersecurity programs include passive and active security technologies comprehensive suites of security management solutions and a team of cybersecurity professionals. These capabilities enable timely management of security updates as well as rapid detection and response to anomalous events. Some large industrial companies also have security operations centers (SOCs) that leverage 3rd party threat intelligence and incident management support.

The picture is quite different for industrial OT cybersecurity programs. While many sites recognize the need for OT cybersecurity they rarely invest in more than the basic passive defensive technologies recommended by industry groups. Many also neglect the need to invest in people and solutions to maintain these defenses. Some have invested in anomaly and breach detection solutions but they are primarily used to improve asset inventories. Few have the resources or expertise to deal with the anomalous message alerts that could help them reduce the impact of sophisticated attacks.

There are various reasons for today’s OT cybersecurity situation. Some managers discount the likelihood of sophisticated attacks and believe that basic defenses are enough. Others do not believe they can justify the additional costs for active defense. Regardless of the reason the net effect is the money spent by industrial companies on OT cybersecurity products and services is typically less than 10 percent of that spent for IT cybersecurity.

A recall has been issued for several brands of frozen mango chunks due to concerns the lots may be contaminated with Hepatitis A.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency issued the Class 1 recall July 30 indicating multiple products originating from distributor Nature's Touch Frozen Food Inc should not be consumed.

The CFIA pinpoints distribution of the product in Manitoba New Brunswick Nova Scotia Ontario Quebec Saskatchewan Newfoundland and Labrador Prince Edward Island however the agency also notes some of the affected product was possibly distributed on a national level meaning some of the contaminated product might be in British Columbia.

Store brands Compliments sold at Sobeys Inc. stores like FreshCo Thrifty Foods and Safeway and President's Choice sold at Loblaw stores like City Market and Real Canadian Superstore are included in the recall.

There have been reported illnesses linked to the products in the recall notes the CFIA.

The CFIA and Nature's Touch indicate the following specific bags of frozen mangoes should be discarded:

Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased instructs the CFIA.

Food contaminated with Hepatitis A virus may not look or smell spoiled. Consumption of food contaminated with this virus may cause hepatitis and produce a self-limited disease that does not result in chronic infection or chronic liver disease. The illness is usually mild and starts about 15 to 50 days after the contaminated food is eaten. It generally goes away by itself in a week or two although it can last up to 6 months in some people. It can cause inflammation of the liver and symptoms may include fever low appetite nausea vomiting diarrhea muscle aches and yellowing in the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice).",,,,,,,,,

Independence of the Seas and Symphony of the Seas will both begin their simulated voyages so that they can get permission from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to sail with paying passengers.

So far four other Royal Caribbean ships have done test cruises and one other is underway right now.

Symphony of the Seas will sail from PortMiami on Sunday and is the second Oasis Class cruise ship to start a test cruise.

Symphony will sail a 3-night cruise that visits Perfect Day at CocoCay before returning to Miami.

Meanwhile Independence of the Seas will begin her test cruise from Galveston Texas.

If all goes well both ships could restart operations with paying passengers later this month.

The CDC requires these test cruises with unpaid volunteers to demonstrate new health protocols can keep guests and crew members safe onboard from the spread of Covid-19.

On other Royal Caribbean ships that have restarted operations the new protocols have worked extremely well at isolating and limiting the spread of the virus among passengers. The handful of cases across different sailings have been few and quickly dealt with.

This approach to safe cruising has been a mantra for Royal Caribbean which has long sought to make cruising ""safer than main street"" according to Royal Caribbean Group Chairman and CEO Richard Fain.

In his most recent video update Mr. Fain talked about the importance of making cruises safer than other aspects of life ""We wanted to be not only just as safe as the places we wanted to be safer.""

""We established a goal of being safer on board than a ship on Main Street. We've shown that an ambitious goal can be achieved based on hard work and an unemotional review of the facts and the science.""

Simulated voyages test out many facets of the cruise experience including a new approach to embarkation and disembarkation medical evacuation procedures and procedures for transferring symptomatic passengers and crew to isolation rooms set up on board the ships.

Other onboard protocols include restricting certain venues to vaccinated passengers only changes to dining onboard and modifications to the entertainment lineup and seating.

Royal Caribbean is electing to conduct test sailings instead of mandating 95% of its passengers be fully vaccinated because the cruise line feels very strongly about allowing children to sail whom are not eligible to be vaccinated.

Cruise ships that sail from the U.S. and can guarantee at least 95% of its passengers are vaccinated do not have to conduct test sailings and can go right to revenue sailings.

Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley recently explained his cruise line's restart plans are different than other lines because of their commitment to families ""In a normal year the majority of our guests are families. At any time throughout the year we carry approx 10 percent plus of our guests who are kids 12 and under and they of course travel with their family.""

""Because of the kids we have been sailing at around 90 percent vaccinated and so we would not be able to operate at the CDC 95 / 95 and so like Disney Cruises or MSC all family brands we chose this path.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHA6Ly9zdGx1Y2lhLmxvb3BuZXdzLmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzYtcGVvcGxlLXRlc3QtcG9zaXRpdmUtY292aWQtMTktYWZ0ZXItY2FyaWJiZWFuLWNydWlzZS000gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 people test positive for COVID-19 after Caribbean cruise | Loop St. Lucia,"Six passengers who sailed on a Royal Caribbean ship tested positive for COVID-19 near the end of their cruise and were immediately quarantined the company said Friday.

The passengers – four adults and two minors – were on the Adventure of the Seas ship for a 7-day trip that left the Bahamas last Saturday and returned on Friday said Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Lyan Sierra-Caro. They were tested Thursday while the ship was at sea.

The adults were all vaccinated against COVID-19 Sierra-Caro said and one has mild symptoms of the virus while the other three do not. They were not travelling together.

The two minors -- who were in the same group but not travelling with any of the four adults who tested positive -- were not vaccinated and were not showing symptoms the spokeswoman said.

All six are American citizens Sierra-Cano said. They were quarantined and people travelling with them were traced and tested negative she said.

Sierra-Cano said the six passengers would fly back to the US on private transportation at Royal Caribbean's expense and won't need to quarantine in the Bahamas.

The ship was in Freeport Bahamas on Friday where other passengers were free to go on shore and the cruise will end Saturday in Nassau as scheduled. Sierra-Cano said the company would tell other passengers about the infections once they were all back on board Friday.

Royal Caribbean Group says it requires passengers who are 16 or older to be fully vaccinated and provide a negative test for COVID-19 before boarding and children who aren’t old enough for the vaccines must test negative. All crew are fully vaccinated according to the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL3Nwb3J0cy9jcmlja2V0L3N0b3J5L3JhamFzdGhhbi1yb3lhbHMtM3JkLWlwbC10ZWFtLXRvLWJ1eS1zdGFrZXMtaW4tYS1jYXJpYmJlYW4tcHJlbWllci1sZWFndWUtdGVhbS0xODM1MDcwLTIwMjEtMDctMzHSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWF0b2RheS5pbi9hbXAvc3BvcnRzL2NyaWNrZXQvc3RvcnkvcmFqYXN0aGFuLXJveWFscy0zcmQtaXBsLXRlYW0tdG8tYnV5LXN0YWtlcy1pbi1hLWNhcmliYmVhbi1wcmVtaWVyLWxlYWd1ZS10ZWFtLTE4MzUwNzAtMjAyMS0wNy0zMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rajasthan Royals 3rd IPL team to buy stakes in a Caribbean Premier League team,"The owners of 2008 IPL champions Rajasthan Royals have acquired a majority stake in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) team Barbados Tridents becoming the third IPL franchise from the cash-rich league to be associated with the Caribbean league after Kolkata Knight Riders and Punjab Kings.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

You're not getting my vote"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpyLWphY2stc2NobG9zc2JlcmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using Cartoonish Accents J.F.K.'s Grandson Insults and Mocks Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,"The grandson of President John F. Kennedy this week savaged his presidential-candidate cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a series of mocking meant-to-be-funny videos that were inarguably uncharacteristically un-Kennedyesque escalating a civil war within America’s most storied political dynasty.

In a series of Instagram posts the grandson Jack Schlossberg 31 variously called Mr. Kennedy 70 a “prick” suggested he was using steroids said he was “lying to us” and portrayed him as a Russian stooge and a stalking horse for Donald J. Trump.

But what viewers may be more struck by or even insulted by are the heavily accented caricatures the young scion used to dramatize his points.

Biden’s team however argued in court that this ban violates the Second Amendment. They pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen which constrained the government’s power to regulate gun ownership.

Judge Maryellen Noreika however was unpersuaded. Norieka who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump noted that while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the drug-user ban to be unconstitutional in one situation — specifically as applied to a habitual marijuana user — that court explicitly emphasized that its decision was quite narrow. And she wrote that the “vast majority” of district courts who have reviewed the drug-user ban in the post-Bruen world have upheld it as constitutional.

She added that Biden can still challenge the constitutionality of the statute as it was applied to him once his trial is complete.

In a separate ruling also handed down on Thursday Noreika ruled against a motion Biden had filed seeking documents the Justice Department possesses involving communications between or among Donald Trump former Attorney General William Barr and other Trump-era senior department officials regarding the Biden case.

Earlier Thursday a three-judge panel on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the president’s son on a separate group of motions. Biden had sought to have the charges against him dismissed for several other reasons arguing he was the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution and that a pretrial diversion agreement he and prosecutors both signed last summer bars the government from charging him.

The federal judges ruled that Biden cannot make those arguments until after his trial is completed.

Russians to celebrate WWII victory on Vienna‘s streets. Ukraine asks authorities to ban events.

Hundreds of Russians marched through Vienna to celebrate the victory over Nazi Germany. Ukraine had asked Austria's authorities to ban the anniversary celebrations without success. Some of the participants were highly critical of Europe and Ukraine.

Just like in previous years Ukraine was again unable to obtain a ban on this event in Vienna. According to the Ukrainian embassy this celebration is anti-democratic and a mockery of all Ukrainians who are currently dying in the Russian war in Ukraine.

A Ukrainian protest was held right next to the anniversary celebration. Tetiana Bilyk a Viennese resident from Ukraine said: ‘We must mourn but not celebrate. There is nothing to celebrate. We must remember the victims and not spread Putin's propaganda. This is Putin's propaganda. He is abusing this important day.’

As the costs of solar power-generating equipment have fallen and public awareness of the benefits of clean energy have grown in recent years the demand for solar energy installations has soared. On an annual basis the sector grew by 43% in 2020 during which time more than 19 gigawatts direct current (GWdc) of solar power was installed according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

With over a decade of experience at the intersection of solar business process and software Blu Banyan CEO Jan Rippingale and her startup team saw a significant market opportunity to develop a solution optimized for solar installers of all sizes. As a NetSuite Solution Provider the leading platform candidate for Blu Banyan was NetSuite for all the reasons the company had itself committed to it – a single database supporting a robust cloud-based ERP suite with accounting at the core and mature development tools. Before undertaking the extensive development effort however Blu Banyan considered competitive options including Salesforce.com.

“Having everything connected makes a tremendous difference” said Rippingale. “Because of its CRM market presence we did evaluate Salesforce but quickly realized we would have had to use the Salesforce CRM plus FinancialForce; it’s two different databases with all the headaches that brings.”

Connecting the dots between those two databases would have been a “miserable experience” for a software developer Rippingale said. By working with NetSuite Blu Banyan was able to extend the ERP platform and especially its accounting and project management functionality to meet the specific needs of solar installers such as when small tweaks in system size (i.e. a customer who orders additional wattage) directly impact an installer’s accounting processes.

“Decades of work went into building the NetSuite unified foundation and getting it right; we obviously couldn’t reinvent that” said Rippingale. “We picked NetSuite for its strengths and then spent our time focusing on our particular value-add and building out those solar installation capabilities.”

Blu Banyan’s award-winning solution SolarSuccess helps residential commercial and utility solar installers manage their businesses and can significantly reduce their soft costs. These soft costs are the non-hardware costs associated with solar installations which include permitting financing and installation as well as all the expenses solar companies incur to acquire new customers pay suppliers train staff and cover their bottom lines. Soft costs comprise as much as 65% of the total cost of a new solar system according to the department of energy (DOE )  and make up the largest component of any installation.

The Power of Partnership

As one of the first companies to use NetSuite’s SuiteScript 2.0 to create customizations Blu Banyan received personalized support as it developed SolarSuccess. Leveraging contacts the company’s employees made at SuiteWorld and other events Blu Banyan gained insights and information directly from NetSuite developers and product managers throughout its development.

“We repeated the process until the software got better and better” said Rippingale.

Blu Banyan also benefited from NetSuite’s sales and marketing efforts which included making calls setting up scripts and advocating SolarSuccess’ advantages via NetSuite’s channel development reps (CDRs) which helps partners bring in prospects.

“Our fourth client on SolarSuccess was 100% from the CDR program” Rippingale said.

A Solution with a Specific Focus

Offered as a SuiteApp SolarSuccess provides enhanced sales pipeline management CRM accounting purchasing installation project management (including per project costing and profitability) inventory management customer invoicing universal financier connectivity team collaboration and business intelligence.

SolarSuccess integrates directly with NetSuite to give solar installers an application that’s specifically optimized for their needs. Together they provide:

A unified view of data across company operations

Integrated accounting project management CRM/sales and design-bid functions

Real-time insight into project status costs and profitability

Real-time inventory availability pricing and purchasing

Project milestones trigger accounting events

Synchronization of project bills of materials (BOM) on sales orders

Project-specific document management with revisions

Solar-specific custom key performance indicators (KPIs) dashboards and alerts

“When you’re aggregating a group of point applications—regardless of how good each of those programs is individually—you really need them to be able to talk to one another” said Clive Smith Blu Banyan’s chief business development officer. “The only way to make that happen is with an integrated or unified application suite on a single database.”

NetSuite-SolarSuccess in Action

Titan Solar Power a rooftop solar contractor that handles all aspects of a solar module installation was one of the early beneficiaries of the NetSuite-Blu Banyan partnership. It has seen steady growth since it was founded in 2013. It installed 153.5 megawatts (MW) of capacity during its last fiscal year making it the third -largest residential installer in the U.S. with about 1% market share of the total market. Yet its homegrown project management system couldn’t scale with its growth. In 2019 its management team realized that the company could no longer run on siloed disparate technology systems.

“We had a project management system a file storage system an accounting system and others” said Aaron Casillas Titan’s technology and infrastructure director. “Sharing data across these systems was difficult and in most cases our only way to ‘patch the holes’ was by adding labor. We wanted to get everything on one system.”

After considering its options Titan found what it was looking for in SolarSuccess. Working with Blu Banyan Titan went live on NetSuite-SolarSuccess in February 2020. As part of the implementation Blu Banyan also installed bluChat its native NetSuite communication and team collaboration tool.

Titan works with a nationwide network of sales organizations taking over installation once the deal is in place. It manages the design negotiates with utility companies secures the required permits and handles the loans leases or other financing required to see the project through to completion. Titan’s new system simplified its commission payout process and reduced the amount of labor needed to manage these transactions. “With NetSuite we’ve significantly decreased the amount of labor involved in paying out our partners” said Casillas “and made that process very consistent across the board.”

Since implementing NetSuite and SolarSuccess Titan has reduced the amount of time it takes to complete project installations added an “install portal” that homeowners can use to track the progress on their installations and gained better visibility over its operational data. The company has grown significantly since the implementation and is on track to expand even further in the coming years.

Moving the Needle

To NetSuite partners looking to build out their own micro-verticals Rippingale said the product-market fit is vital.

“Take the time getting to know both the industry-wide and customer-specific needs” she said.

Knowing the language and trajectory of your target industry is also important said Rippingale who leads a DOE/SunSpec Orange Button Working Group that focuses on data standardization across the solar industry and establishing a distributed energy taxonomy for the software development community. One of the first practical outcomes of the Orange Button work is a crowd-sourced public Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) Registry. Initiated by Blu Banyan in collaboration with the SunSpec Alliance the Registry tackles one of the thorniest and most costly operational challenges facing solar installers — identifying which of the nation’s 36177 AHJ’s has inspection and approval jurisdiction (including building electrical and fire codes) over any new solar installation.

Lastly Rippingale said knowing what “moves the needle” has helped Blu Banyan maximize its partnership with NetSuite while also carving out a competitive advantage in its target micro-vertical. Attentive discussions with early solar customers about the costs of multiple site visits due to bad weather led to addition of a basic weather portlet to the project manager’s dashboard. .

“We put thousands of hours into developing SolarSuccess” she said. “In four hours we built a portlet that wows and benefits our customers. It took a few years for us to get those needle-movers identified and dialed in but the results stand for themselves.”

It would not be wrong to say the tech elite of our world is running the show. The more they climb the success ladder the more we believe that uneasy lies the head that wears the crown! Earlier this month Anthony Di Iorio the billionaire co-founder of Ethereum who moves around with his own personal team of bodyguards quit the cryptocurrency world as he feels unsafe. It doesn’t come as a surprise that it’s imperative to spend millions to save the tech leaders that make billions; what’s surprising is the total sum of millions paid! Facebook spent more than $23.4 million on security costs for CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2020 according to the company’s annual executive compensation report. Zuckerberg’s security expenses are alarmingly high compared to his counterparts in the valley. Based on data compiled by Protocol below is a round-up of the cost to protect high-profile tech execs:





Apple CEO Tim Cook — $470000

Half a million in security costs for the head honcho of Apple is way too humble as per Silicon Valley standards. His personal security and travel expenses had surged in 2019 as Trump’s trade war with China threatened to gash Apple’s profit.



Lyft CEO Logan Green — $599000

The estimated net worth of Logan Green is at least $59.2 million and over the last five years he sold LYFT stock worth over $56994413. Security costs cover his business-related events and other personal expenses.



Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff — $1.31 million

This American internet entrepreneur enjoys a net worth of $8.8 billion. His company Salesforce spent $1.3 million on security arrangements for Mr. Benioff in addition to security arrangements provided while at work or on business travel.



Snap co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel — $1.67 million

When you become a billionaire at the age of 25 and enjoy a net worth of nearly $2.1 billion you can afford to part with a million for the sake of safety. The self-made billionaire usually takes private jets and wants full-time armed guards.



Lyft co-founder and president John Zimmer — $2.06 million

John Zimmer is the co-founder and president of Lyft an on-demand transportation company responsible for over one million rides a day and is available to 95% of the population of the United States. On December 5 2017 Lyft announced a Series H financing round worth $1.5 billion led by Alphabet Inc. Safeguarding the president for an expense of $2.6 million is chump change. His net worth is $800 million.



Oracle chairman Larry Ellison — $1.71 million

The 76-year-old billionaire is one of the most interesting men in tech. This yacht-racing co-founder is known for trash-talking his competitors. Considering that and his net worth of $84.3 billion a $1.71 million security expense sounds reasonable.



Google CEO Sundar Pichai — $5.4 million

Google spent over $1.2 million in 2018 on Pichai’s security unit compared to roughly $680000 the year prior. Pichai’s new ‘overall security program’ was approved in July 2018 three months after Nasim Najafi Aghdam shot three people and then herself at YouTube HQ in San Bruno.



Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg- $7.6 million

Sandberg required personal security which cost $4.37 million in 2019 up from $2.9 million in 2018. And her use of private aircraft cost Facebook $1.3 million in 2019 versus $908677 in 2018. She is currently one of the most prominent women in business and Facebook’s second-in-command.



Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg- $23.4 million

No one comes close to spending $23 million a year on security like Zuckerberg. Last year was intense for Zuckerberg and Facebook getting hit from all sides for everything from sowing doubt about vaccines to enabling an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. It doesn’t leave one feeling safe or secure or even with much of choice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY2lzY29zLTExLW1vc3QtaW1wb3J0YW50LWV4ZWN1dGl2ZXMtMjAyMS030gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cisco's 12 Most Important Executives,"Insider has identified 12 of the top executives Cisco has assembled to lead the company.

Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez returned from their respective serious knee injuries on Thursday in a friendly against Hertha Berlin but Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says it will remain a slow and steady process for them to return to full fitness.

Both centre-backs missed the majority of last season after Van Dijk damaged his ACL in October and Gomez suffered a serious knee problem in November in England training.

It was a cruel blow to Liverpool’s Premier League title defence which proved unsuccessful but both are now ready to compete again.

Neither would be considered match fit just yet having just played 20 minutes in a friendly in Austria but Klopp says they will be in action again this Thursday in a friendly against Bologna although he will be very careful with their progres.

‘Hopefully yes’ Klopp told Liverpool’s official website on whether the pair will play this week.

‘That’s how it looks in the moment. I want to make it really clear we push nothing. We just don’t. We wait a little bit the players come we have now with Dr Andreas Schlumberger a real specialist who is in constant talks and always observing everything.

Gomez and Van Dijk in action against Hertha Berlin in a friendly in Austria (Picture: Getty Images)

‘We know exactly how they feel – how they really feel and not what they tell us because they obviously are desperate to play again. It looks good this morning [it was a] normal training session. Sometimes in moments we swap Virgil and Joe a little bit so maybe the intensity doesn’t get too high but in general it looks really good.

‘How many minutes on Thursday I don’t know but there will be some minutes for sure.’

The Reds are playing two back-to-back friendlies against Bologna in France on Thursday with each match being 60 minutes long.

Klopp has enough players at his disposal now with most having returned from holidays after international duty to play two different teams across the two matches.

‘Yeah that’s the plan’ he said. ‘For sure now we have enough players who have to play 60 minutes that’s clear. But we have some they are maybe not allowed or should not play a full 60 so some will play 30 this kind of stuff.

‘It was just like this: we have for sure a team who could now play 90 minutes but it doesn’t make massive sense to do it already to push through. What we did this year was slightly different from other years.

‘I think everybody knows we train what we have to do and then you play the games on top of that but usually the next day when you play 45 early or 60 minutes early in the pre-season then you have to calm down a little bit in training and we didn’t do that this year.

‘We just could go through intensity-wise which helped I think a lot. So now we have the double 60 – I really like that Bologna was fine with it as well. So all good and then on the weekend – Sunday Monday – two big games at Anfield.’

Those two games at Anfield see the Reds take on Athletic Bilbao on Sunday 8 August and then Osasuna the following day.

The Barracuda 510 is a midrange brand at Seagate and this is a TLC-based PCIe 3.0 SSD that is situated between their lower-end QLC products and their higher-end Firecuda line. The underlying hardware on this Barracuda 510 should be familiar to anyone who has been reading our reviews a while; a Phison PS5012-E12 controller DRAM cache and Toshiba 96L TLC NAND are the building blocks for this drive. Let us dive in and see how the Barracuda 510 stacks up.

Seagate Barracuda 510 1TB NVMe SSD

The Seagate Barracuda 510 1TB comes in a single-sided M.2 2280 (80mm) form factor.

Beneath the product label is the Phison PS5012-E12 controller four NAND packages and a DRAM cache. The E12 controller is a variant of the E12S controller used on the Inland Premium 1TB drive we recently covered and that drive was a very good performer. The E12 controller is an 8-channel controller for TLC NAND here it is mated to Toshiba 96-layer BiCS4 TLC NAND. A 512MB DDR4 cache is also present on the drive which represents another minor deviation from the Inland drive which used a DDR3 cache.

The back of this single-sided drive contains nothing but unused pads. The 1TB model is the top SKU of the Barracuda 510 line but it is possible this PCB design is shared with other model drives.

Seagate Barracuda 510 SSD Specs

The Seagate Barracuda 510 line of SSDs is available from 250GB to 1TB.

Our 1TB SKU represents the top of this product stack with the best-rated performance at 3400 MB/s sequential read and 3000 MB/s sequential write. These rated specs are slightly higher than the Inland Premium drive though not by much. The Seagate also comes with a 5-year warranty in comparison to 3 years on the Inland drive. On the other hand Inland warrantied their drive for 1600 TBW endurance while Seagate has the Barracuda 510 at 640TBW a much less exciting number.

CrystalDiskInfo can give us some basic information about the SSD and confirms we are operating at PCIe 3.0 x4 speeds using NVMe 1.3.

Test System Configuration

We are using the following configuration for this test:

Motherboard : ASUS PRIME X570-P

: ASUS PRIME X570-P CPU : AMD Ryzen 9 5900X (12C/24T)

: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X (12C/24T) RAM: 2x 16GB DDR4-3200 UDIMMs

Our testing uses the Seagate Barracuda 510 1TB as the boot drive for the system installed in the M.2_1 slot on the motherboard. The drive is filled to 85% capacity with data and then some is deleted leaving around 60% used space on the volume.

Next we are going to get into our performance testing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy85ODc4L3NlYWdhdGUtZmlyZWN1ZGEtNTMwLTF0Yi1zc2QtdGVzdGVkLXdpdGgtd2luZG93cy0xMS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seagate FireCuda 530 1TB SSD Review (tested with Windows 11),"TweakTown's Rating: 99% The Bottom Line Seagate's FireCuda 530 1TB SSD proved itself TweakTown elite. Enough said. Buy at Amazon

Introduction & Drive Details

Seagate's newest is one of the most highly anticipated SSDs of 2021. And it's no wonder with Seagate teasing some of the highest sequential speeds ever seen. Then to top it off Seagate announced that its forthcoming FireCuda 530 with heat sink is the first SSD to be certified compatible for the PS5's newly enabled M.2 storage expansion slot. That announcement has millions of PS5 console peasants salivating at the prospect of finally getting some decent storage capacity for their favorite console.

Sony states the PS5 will support PCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe SSDs with capacities ranging from 250GB up to 4TB. Additionally expansion SSD's will need to have 5.5GB/sec of sequential read speeds or better. Seagate specs its FireCuda 530 for up to 7300 MB/s sequential read across all offered capacities (500GB - 4TB). With throughput like that on tap it is no wonder the FireCuda 530 series is first to receive certification for PS5 usage.

Popular Now: Scientists use supercomputer to find out when humanity will perish

So enough with the console talk it's making us nauseous anyway. The FireCuda 530 is fast. The 1TB model that is the subject of our review today can exceed stated factory sequential speeds of 7300/6000 MB/s as demonstrated by the following CrystalDiskMark screenshot taken on our AMD system:

33 33

VIEW GALLERY - 33 IMAGES

Sequential read speeds are known to be fastest on AMD X570 systems and ours is delivering jaw-dropping sequential speeds of 7461/6102 MB/s. Impressive and proof that Seagate's FireCuda 530 has the best overall sequential throughput of any 1TB flash-based consumer SSD available at this time.

As it did with the FireCuda 520 Seagate has again partnered with Phison Electronics to bring forth the FireCuda 530. Propelling the FireCuda 530 to these record level speeds is a controller we are intimately familiar with the Phison E18. Phison's E18 controller is by far the most prolific controller in its class finding its way onto more Gen4 SSDs than any other. However until now E18 based retail drives have only been paired with 96Layer Micron flash.

The FireCuda 530 is bit different than the plethora of current E18 based SSDs for a few reasons most notable of which is its fresh out of the fab 176Layer Micron flash array. This new flash is fast reaching speeds of 1600 MT/s which really lets the E18 controller eat. Another aspect that differentiates Seagate/Phison collaborations from others is controller firmware exclusive to Seagate. Custom Seagate enhanced firmware is what Seagate did with the FireCuda 520 as well and that drive did indeed seem to have a little extra sauce as compared with other similarly configured SSDs.

Another difference between the FireCuda 530 and current 1TB-2TB E18 based SSDs with 96Layer flash is controller placement. The E18 controller when paired with 176Layer flash is placed on the center of the PCB between flash chips. A centralized location enables optimal trace lengths which in theory at least makes for more efficient data transfers.

The FireCuda 530 is fresh and new and affords us the perfect opportunity to debut our new SSD testing regimen utilizing a fresh and new Windows 11 Pro OS. Windows 10 is old news and pretty much garbage compared with Windows 11 even in beta form. We find Windows 11 to be superior in every way including storage performance. Windows 11 is serving up superior storage performance where it matters most so we feel compelled to make the switch right now.

With a fresh and new theme in mind we've updated all benchmarks to the latest versions changed the way we look at certain results and streamlined others. Additionally and after much verification through extensive testing we've decided that a 150GB install accomplishes the same end result as filling the drive to 50%. Turns out what's important is we test as OS disk with data on it. The amount of data we test with makes virtually no difference except in ultra-rare corner case scenarios that are typically outside consumer use case scenarios.

As a final note before we get into testing Seagate's 1TB FireCuda 530 we will be providing Windows 11 results run on our INTEL Z590 system and Windows 10 results for the FireCuda 530 run on our AMD X570 system. Benchmark screenshots will be provided for our Windows 11 results.

We decided to review the 1TB FireCuda first because it will likely be the best seller of the series. Additionally it's a preferred single-sided design. A single-sided design can fit into more places than double sided because it is thinner. Also a single-sided SSD is easier to cool because heat emanates from one side of the PCB.

We notice endurance is up significantly compared to E18 based SSDs with 96Layer Micron flash. In fact it's nearly double with 176Layer flash. Wow. Alright time to find out what this bad boy can do for you.

As mentioned previously and as demonstrated on our charts the FireCuda 530 does indeed deliver the highest overall throughput for any currently available 1TB consumer SSD. As impressive as these sequential speeds are we are more impressed with the drive's QD1 random performance.

Anvil's Storage Utilities

We've always said that our primary focus when looking at Anvil results or any synthetic results for that matter is read performance. After all host reads are 80% of typical consumer data transactions and as such it could be said that read performance is 4X more important than programming or writes. With this in mind we've decided to no longer chart write scoring or total score.

Low queue depth random read performance (up to QD16) is way up on Windows 11 as is random write performance at queue depths of up to 4. This performance where it matters. At the same time high queue depth (above QD4) random write performance (performance that is practically meaningless for consumer applications) is only half what it is on Windows 10. It's almost as if Microsoft is beginning to focus on performance that matters. This in a nutshell is why we are dumping Windows 10 starting today.

Looking at where our test subject sits on our charts clearly demonstrates that it is capable of delivering data to the host as good as anything flash-based we've ever had come across our bench.

ATTO

With the newest version 4 of ATTO we are looking at 128K sequential speeds in GB/s rather than MB/s as we did when using version 3 of this popular storage benchmark. Here again we get further validation that the FireCuda 530 1TB offers the overall highest throughput of any currently available 1TB flash-based SSD. And again we are reminded that AMD delivers the best sequential read performance. However INTEL delivers by far the best overall storage performance which is why we primarily test storage with INTEL Z590.

The 1TB FireCuda 530 handles our extremely difficult-to-digest 100GB data block with relative ease turning in one of the best performances we've gotten from any E18 based SSD regardless of capacity.

33 33

33 33

As we alluded to previously we are far more interested in read performance than write and here we find the FireCuda 530 1TB delivering the goods big time. The 1TB FireCuda 530 even manages to outdo the higher spec'd 2TB Phison OEM E18 with 176Layer (B47R) flash. Impressive.

Game Level Loading

Gaming is a performance metric that matters to the majority of DIY consumers especially to the enthusiast crowd that TweakTown caters to. The 1TB FireCuda 530 does gaming about as good as it gets especially running on a high thread count AMD 5900X system. Phison E18 based SSDs populate the top of our gaming chart with the quickest load time going to those with 176Layer Micron flash. Wow.

PCM10 Storage Tests

PCMark 10 Storage Test is the most advanced and most accurate real-world consumer storage test ever made. There are four different tests you can choose from; we run two of them.

The Full System Drive Benchmark and the Quick System Drive Benchmark. The Full System Drive Benchmark writes 204 GB of data over the duration of the test. The Quick System Drive Benchmark writes 23 GB of data over the duration of the test. These tests directly correlate with mainstream user experience.

PCMark 10 Full System Drive Benchmark

This particular test writes over 204GB data and covers a broad range of common consumer tasks including booting Windows 10 file transfers Adobe and Office applications and startup times for games including Battlefield V COD Black Ops 4 and Overwatch. Unlike synthetic numbers this is comprehensive real-world data which is why we use it to rank SSDs in terms of user experience.

Our results here backup our assertion that Intel has the edge over AMD in overall storage performance. The Firecuda 530 1TB exceeds our expectations by essentially delivering the same otherworldly user experience as the higher spec'd 2TB Phison OEM SSD with the same hardware configuration. Elite. Performance where it matters and performance that is significantly better on Windows 11.

Again the 1TB FireCuda 530 impresses with performance where it matters most. Anytime a drive scores higher than 3500 points on this test we consider it to be Elite. The 1TB FireCuda 530 is an Elite SSD.

Final Thoughts

While seemingly every other SSD retailer jumped on the E18 train early on Seagate chose to wait for E18 based SSDs to reach their full potential via flash arrays composed of 1600 MT/s speed flash. Time will tell if this was the way to go or not. The new flash costs a pretty penny as reflected by the FireCuda's premium pricing. Is it worth it? The enthusiast in us is screaming hell yeah it is but the consumer in us would like to see lower pricing. Ultimately the market will render its verdict.

33 33

We rank SSDs in terms of overall user experience (performance where it matters most) as expressed by PCMark 10 storage tests. Here again Seagate's FireCuda 530 1TB demonstrates that it delivers a flash-based user experience that is as good as money can buy. Anytime an SSD can score over 7000 here we consider it to be Elite.

Additionally more data can be gleaned from this chart and summarized as Windows 11 delivers significantly better storage performance than Windows 10. If you are not sure about that compare any of our benchmark results with any other on the planet and you will find our assertion to be correct.

33 33

Looking back at our results we can boil everything down to a few simple statements. Seagate's FireCuda 530 is the overall throughput leader for a 1TB class flash-based SSD. Period. It's also as good as it gets for gaming so this SSD should be on the shortlist for gamers of all stripes including PS5 enthusiasts. Finally and most importantly the FireCuda 530 proved by its user experience ranking that it is TweakTown elite.

While you may want to load and run the latest hottest games off a faster SSD the FireCuda Gaming Hub ($219.99 for 8TB; $399.99 for 16TB as tested) is a great desk addition for backing up and archiving your collection. You can keep a game mega-library on board. With the 16TB version you should be able to store up to several hundred AAA titles as well as assorted movies and other content. It's more of a classic desktop external hard drive than a gaming centerpiece—it could use some more physical ports to bulk up the ""Hub"" part of its resume—but look at it as a bottomless box for your bytes with some connectivity benefits.

Spinning Up Near-Endless Storage

The FireCuda Gaming Hub is a desktop-style hard drive in an external enclosure measuring 1.9 by 5 by 8.1 inches and weighing 2.7 pounds. Within the frame is a 3.5-inch hard drive that spins at 7200rpm. The drive is powered by an included wall-wart style adapter.

The FireCuda Hub rests on four tiny rubber feet however you orient it. One set of feet is on the wide flat bottom while another set is on one long edge so you can stand the drive on its side while running it or lay it down.

As a hub the FireCuda is rather basic. In back next to the power jack is the main connector for system direct-attachment: a USB Micro-B port. A USB Micro-B-to-A cable is included.

(Photo: Molly Flores)

On the front are USB Type-C and USB Type-A ports to which you can attach peripherals...

(Photo: Molly Flores)

We'd have liked to see at least one more USB Type-A port. If you intend to connect a keyboard and mouse through the Gaming Hub both will likely have USB Type-A connectors. And if both are connected you'd want a third port at least for jacking in the occasional USB flash drive or external SSD.

The FireCuda Gaming Hub comes in two capacities the $219.99 8TB and $399.99 16TB models cited earlier. This works out to about 2.8 cents per gigabyte for the 8TB version and a mere 2.5 cents per gigabyte for the 16TB one. That's about a fourth of the cost per gig of the cheapest external SSDs.

Tools and Twinkling Lights

For software you can (and should) download the Seagate Toolkit—there are versions for both Windows and macOS—once you register the drive. Functions include backup restore and sync/mirror plus controls for one of the Hub's niftiest features: the on-chassis RGB LED lighting.

By default when you plug the drive in and attach it to a computer the lighting will pulse red. From the RGB tab in the Toolkit you can change the color (to a fixed color or a rainbow flow) and alter the lighting pattern's behavior (to static breathe blink or slide actions).

Alternately if you happen to own a Razer PC or a piece of lighting-enabled Razer gaming gear you could use the company's Chroma light-syncing tech to control the lighting by downloading the Razer Synapse hardware configuration utility. Even when using the basic lighting-control functions in the Toolkit though I found the display versatile and captivating.

Testing the FireCuda Gaming Hub: No Slouch for a Platter Drive

The FireCuda Gaming Hub’s results on our external-drive benchmark tests show that it performs as expected for a recent 7200rpm hard drive. (Seagate does not publish read and write speed ratings for the drive.)

Its sequential read and write speeds as measured by the Crystal DiskMark 6.0 test are 268MBps and 255MBps respectively. The read and write speeds measured by the Mac-based BlackMagic Disk Speed test are very similar—233MBps and 255MBps. We mapped the FireCuda drive out below against a host of other portable platter hard drives we have tested in the last couple of years. (We haven't seen any desktop external drives with a single 3.5-inch mechanism of late for direct comparison.)

As you can see these numbers are considerably faster than those of 5400rpm-rated portable (not desktop 3.5-inch) hard drives such as the WD My Passport 5TB and the Seagate Backup Plus Ultra Touch 2TB shown in our table. The FireCuda Gaming Hub’s speeds are still shy though of the very lowest-end external SSDs and no match for current USB 3.2 Gen 2 external SSDs. (See how we test hard drives.)

(Photo: Molly Flores)

The PCMark 10 storage benchmark measures how fast a drive is at performing certain everyday tasks including program loading. The FireCuda Gaming Hub’s score of 537 is lower than the scores for most lower-end external SSDs. (Most of our hard-drive comparison products were tested using a previous PCMark version whose scores are not directly comparable with PCMark 10 so their scores do not appear in our chart.) From this we can surmise that the FireCuda Gaming Hub is best for game backup and storage and less ideal for loading and running newer graphically intensive AAA games.

A Drive for Game and Movie Backup

Although the Seagate FireCuda Gaming Hub is fast for a spinning external hard drive thanks to its 7200rpm platters it is plodding compared with most external SSDs. No platter drive can really compete with a current SSD for copying and loading recent high-impact AAA games rife with graphical content. It's also the bare minimum feature-wise as a hub due to its limited range of connectors. A true hub might gain you display capabilities and act as a connect/disconnect point for say a gaming laptop. This design is more basic than that.

However the FireCuda Gaming Hub's immense capacity makes it ideal for game storage and backup if you hoard hundreds of games. Most gamers should be able to store their entire collection on the Gaming Hub with plenty of room left over for movies other media and most any other files they might want to store. (Just know that anything unique on the drive such as family photos needs a second copy stashed somewhere for safety; drives do die.) And it fits in with any gaming setup with its cool RGB lighting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvY25ldHdvcmsubmV0L3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktbmV3cy93ZXN0ZXJuLWRpZ2l0YWxzLXdkX2JsYWNrLXNuODUwLW52bWUtc3NkLXRvLWJlLXBzNS1jb21wYXRpYmxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Western Digital’s WD_BLACK SN850 NVMe SSD to be PS5 compatible,"PS5 fans have been patiently waiting as Sony works through the beta test of its upcoming firmware update that is going to unlock the ability to upgrade the storage with certain compatible M.2 NVMe SSD models. We already know that Seagate has a qualified model they have been testing for the new firmware. Now Western Digital (WD) is next up to confirm similar successes with its SN850 series.

The SN850 series features incredibly fast drives available as 500GB (currently $118) 1TB (currently $199) and 2TB (currently $394) options (prices based on the time of this article and without heatsink). They aren’t the “fastest” PCIe Gen4 drives out there but they are a tad more affordable than some of the other options.

We recently reviewed the 500GB model with great results earlier in the year. It should make for a great addition to any PS5 console. However you will still have to wait until the firmware is made available–which should be happening sometime next month.

Currently Western Digital is still “testing” things with the new console to make sure there aren’t any surprises. There is a number of factors that come into play such as performance and the physical size available inside the console for adding a new drive. Thankfully WD seems pretty confident (and you have the Seagate option as well) and it shouldn’t be long before the firmware is made available and you can take to upgrading things yourself.",,,

Getting Back to Business,"City leaders reveal the reasons Cleveland's core is well on its way to reaching 30000 residents by 2030.

One of the key indicators of the health and vibrancy of any business district is real estate.

While there was a noticeable decrease in foot and vehicle traffic during the pandemic downtown residential development remained on track. Now as businesses start to return commercial real estate occupancy rates are starting to return to pre-pandemic levels.

“We met our goal of reaching 20000 residents in the first quarter of this year” says Michael Deemer president and CEO of Downtown Cleveland Alliance (DCA). “And with the new development that is taking place we are marching steadily toward our next goal of 30000 residents by 2030.

“We added over 1000 apartments downtown over the course of last year and there are a number of projects soon to be underway like the renovation of 55 Public Square the City Club Apartments and the Centennial at 9th and Euclid.”

Even more encouraging for downtown businesses is the recent groundbreaking of CrossCountry Mortgage’s new headquarters which will eventually bring more than 600 new jobs to downtown.

“We’re also expecting Sherwin-Williams to begin construction on its new headquarters by the end of the year” Deemer adds.

It’s part of a mass migration of new businesses to downtown which also includes iHeartMedia moving its operations into the city. With more than 1700 employees RightSource will also locate its headquarters downtown.

Karen Paganini president and COO of K&D Development and chairwoman of DCA is understandably bullish on Downtown Cleveland.

“It’s extremely important to us because about a third of our portfolio is downtown” she says.

While residential occupancy remained strong during the pandemic commercial occupancy rates slipped into the 40% range says Paganini.

“But it’s come roaring back” she says. “We passed 60% quite a while ago and we are about 80% back to work.”

While companies are still making a determination on whether or not to let some people work at home with all of the new companies retargeting downtown it would appear that commercial space will soon be at a premium.

Another company adding new jobs to downtown is Rocket Mortgage.

“There is a tremendous talent pool in Cleveland and we have made a years-long commitment to expanding our operations in the city for this exact reason” says Mike Malloy chief amazement officer for Rocket Mortgage. “The Midwest has expanded into being a major American tech hub.”

The company made recent partnerships with the city of Cleveland and state of Ohio agreeing to add more than 700 new jobs in Downtown Cleveland over the next five years.

“We are proud to have a large footprint in the city” adds Malloy. “Our commitment to Cleveland is stronger than ever and we are excited to continue connecting residents to well-paying jobs that will help their family and the entire community.”

The transition started on July 21 with team members returning to the Higbee Building says Malloy.

“This is not only important for internal collaboration it also helps us support the downtown businesses that will welcome the additional traffic.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWFjb25qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDcvMzEvZ3JlYXRlci1ha3Jvbi1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS1zYWxlcy1oZXJlcy13aGF0LWhvbWVzLXNvbGQtd2Vlay1qdW5lLTctMjAyMS81Mzk4MDE2MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greater Akron real estate sales: Here's what homes sold for week of June 7 2021,"Beacon Journal

Los precios de las materias primas subieron en los últimos meses a niveles máximos. De hecho a nivel local la soja es uno de los mayores referentes en ese sentido por la dependencia del país en la exportación de dicho cultivo.

Ahora bien esto también ocurre a nivel internacional con otro tipo de commodities como otros alimentos y metales.

El dato que movió la brújula del mercado en los últimos meses también fue que los precios del grano de café han subido ""drásticamente"" en la Bolsa de Nueva York.

Esto generó que comiencen a abirse oportunidades de inversión en activos de empresas e instrumentos bursátiles que tienen cierta relación con este cultivo.

""Los motivos de este incremento van desde las malas cosechas en los grandes países productores como Brasil Vietnam y Colombia hasta el aumento de la demanda durante más de un año de crisis sanitaria"" resume en un informe Maximiliano Donzelli jefe de Research en IOL invertironline.

Y agrega: ""Esta situación se atenuó aún más el último mes ya que las heladas han exacerbado la ya existente escasez provocada por la sequía y la falta de contenedores para el transporte"".

En números el contrato de futuros más cercano que se está negociando en el mercado que es el de septiembre 2021 se encuentra actualmente en alrededor de los u$s190 registrando de esta manera incrementos que superaron 20% en dólares en la última semana.

Los rendimientos de los activos bursátiles vinculados al campo han subido de forma abrupta en 2021 en los distintos países.

Instrumentos para invertir en café

De acuerdo a la opinión de Donzelli la alternativa más directa para aprovechar la escalada del precio del café y posicionarse en este commodity es mediante el ETN ""iPath Series B Bloomberg Coffee Subindex Total Return"" (JO).

Este es un instrumento que permite la exposición a los contratos de futuros del grano.

""Refleja los rendimientos que están potencialmente disponibles a través de una inversión apalancada en los futuros sobre el café"" explica Donzelli.

Otras de las opciones para invertir en café es a través de invertir en los activos de las principales empresas que se dedican o que tienen su estructura de negocio relacionada con el grano.

Al respecto desde IOL invertirOnline mencionan dos compañías del sector cafetero que consideran como ""interesantes"".

""Por un lado The JM Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) que es un fabricante estadounidense de productos alimenticios en América del Norte. Si bien no es específicamente una empresa dedicada al sector del café sus acciones son en realidad una de las mejores formas de invertir en el consumo del grano"" detalla Donzelli.

De hecho esta compañía posee varias marcas que se dedican al café para consumo doméstico como Folgers 1850 Café Bustelo o gama de café para el hogar que se vende en Dunkin Donuts.

""Las acciones de la compañía tuvieron un gran desempeño en el último año impulsadas por los cambios de hábitos y la creciente demanda ya que al estar confinadas por la pandemia las familias optaron por la elaboración de café en sus casas. Es importante destacar los buenos dividendos que paga la empresa a sus inversores reflejando un rendimiento del 301%"" acota Donzelli.

Desde fines de febrero pasado hasta la actualidad pese a su volatilidad esta acción subió más de 17% en Wall Street.

Las acciones de Starbucks Coffee han escalado 18% en todo el 2021 gracias al mayor consumo de café y por el incremento del precio del grano.

Por otro lado la otra alternativa recomendada es Starbucks corp. (NASDAQ:SBUX) la cadena de cafeterías más grande del mundo que también puede ser operada en el mercado local con Cedears.

""Destacamos la rápida recuperación cambiando fácilmente su sistema de negocio al dar la opción de hacer envíos a domicilio en marzo de 2020 para mitigar las consecuencias de la pandemia"" comenta Donzelli.

Al respecto desde abril pasado las acciones de Starbucks se encuentran en niveles máximos históricos que fueron alcanzados el pasado 26 de julio cuando tocaron los u$s126.

Y desde principios de este 2021 hasta la fecha escaló casi 18% en el Nasdaq de Wall Street.

""La perspectiva es más que positiva ya que podemos esperar ver cierto crecimiento en este sector a medida que los países de todo el mundo controlen el Covid-19 y las cafeterías puedan volver a abrir"" finaliza Donzelli.-",,,,,,,,,,,,

EASTENDERS star Toby-Alexander Smith shared a loved up snap with Emmerdale's Amy Walsh after their secret romance was revealed.

Amy looked stunning in a green dress with a black petal styling making up her face with red lipstick.

Toby looked a world away from his serial killer character in a red blazer with a black top underneath.

The Emmerdale actress captioned the pic: ""At the Machin-Crane Wedding 2.0""

The Sun revealed in December last year that Toby was in a relationship with Amy after dating in secret.

The couple made their first public appearance on the red carpet at A Christmas Carol in London.

An insider told The Sun: “It’s early days but they really like each other. They’re both very busy with packed work schedules at opposite ends of the country but they try to spend as much time together as they can.”

Hopefully it’s a happy ending for Amy who hasn’t had the best luck with her love life in the past.

She was engaged to ex Bradley Jaden in February 2017 - but they split in April 2018 and Bradley moved on from her with his Wicked co-star Olivia Kate Holding within weeks.

The 50-year-old former Real Housewife made a splash as she flashed a wide smile as she waded into the waters wearing a chic white one-piece.

The New Yorker's post comes just days after she celebrated her fiancé's birthday by sharing a sweet video to her account.

White hot! Bethenny Frankel looked like a mermaid in a sizzling Instagram snap on Sunday

Frankel's simple suit exposed her toned arms and offered a hint of cleavage via a low-scoop neck.

The piece featured a curved text graphic on its upper right portion that read 'summer of love.'

The reality television personality also wore a rainbow-colored necklace during her time in the water.

Her gorgeous brunette locks remained soaked and fell onto her backside.

Special occasion: Last week Frankel shared a video to her Instagram account to commemorate her fiance's birthday

Last week Frankel shared a video to her Instagram account to wish her fiance Paul Bernon a happy 44th birthday.

The clip was comprised of several loved-up shots of the pair spending time together at various locations.

The two were initially romantically linked in 2018 when they matched on a dating application.

Prior to becoming involved with her current fiance the former Real Housewives Of New York cast member was married to two other individuals.

Moving quickly: Frankel and Bernon initially met in 2018 when they matched on a dating app

Frankel's first marriage was to entertainment executive Peter Sussman although they divorced in 1997 after just a year of being together.

She later dated Jason Colodne who was featured in several of the first RHONY episodes although they later split up.

The entrepreneur eventually began a relationship with pharmaceutical executive Jason Hoppy and the two went on to tie the knot in March of 2010.

The pair welcomed a daughter named Bryn aged ten just months after they made their union official.

Former family: Frankel previously welcomed a daughter named Bryn with her ex-husband Jason Hoppy; the three are pictured in 2014

However the former couple separated in 2012 and the reality television figure filed for a divorce the following year.

After several years of drawn-out legal issues Frankel and Hoppy finalized their divorce this past January.

The Bravo star went on to begin a relationship with Bernon and the two became engaged just two months after her second marriage was officially ended.

Big development: The former RHONY cast member became engaged to Bernon just a few months after the official end of her second marriage

She spoke to People not long after the big news was made public and described her fiance as 'an absolutely beautiful person.'

Frankel also gave the media outlet a bit of information as to how her partner popped the big question and noted that she was happy as to how it happened.

She recalled that the proposal took place 'on an island off of Florida. No makeup no manicure no ring photos. It was very simple and beautiful.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15bG9uZG9uLm5ld3MvbmV3cy9jZWxlYnMvZWFzdGVuZGVycy1zdGFyLXBhdHN5LXBhbG1lci1wb3N0cy0yMTE5NjkxNtIBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15bG9uZG9uLm5ld3MvbmV3cy9jZWxlYnMvZWFzdGVuZGVycy1zdGFyLXBhdHN5LXBhbG1lci1wb3N0cy0yMTE5NjkxNi5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EastEnders star Patsy Palmer posts bikini throwback snap with important message,"We have more newsletters

Amanda Holden amazes fans with snap of her lookalike sister on beach in Thailand

Fans are no stranger to being shocked by Amanda Holden and her lookalike sister Deborah.

The Britain’s Got Talent judge shared a snap of her younger sibling looking dazzling in a patterned bikini whilst on holiday.

Amanda 50 shared the picture with her 1.7 million Instagram followers which showed her 48-year-old sister coming out of the sea in Thailand.

She captioned it: “My sister @deblholden living her best life.”

The blonde beauty showed off her toned figure and long locks in a blue and pink two-piece bikini and a dark pair of sunglasses.

This isn’t the first time Amanda has shocked her fans with how much the sisters look alike.

In 2018 the mum-of-two posted pictures of them enjoying a concert at Royal Albert Hall.

One of her followers commented: “Oh my god I can’t tell the difference.”

Amanda has previously spoken about how close the sisters are due to their strained relationship with father Frank - who she says was “hardly ever there” - when they were children.

Frank split from their mother Judith due to his alcohol-fuelled behaviour.

The recent snaps come after Amanda showed off her own incredible figure in a green and white swimsuit while enjoying a glass of wine by the pool.

She also showed off her sense of humour in a series of TikTok videos captioned: ""jumping into a pool using different categories"" and pulling off a series of poses including ‘superman' and ‘running man’.

One of her daughters even got involved to recreate the iconic ET scene.

Amanda has been sharing several pictures on Instagram showing off her incredible figure in the summer sun during the family's break in an unknown location.

It must run in the family as the radio host also shared a snap of her stunning daughters Alexa 15 and Hollie nine.

The trio all looked flawless as they huddled up for a photo in front of the sunset with the caption “my babies”.

Just a day before Amanda posted that she was able to enjoy a rare date night with her husband of 13 years Chris Hughes.

The pair met in Los Angeles in 2003 but only began dating in 2004.

Chris who is a record producer is Amanda’s second husband after previously being married to Les Dennis.

This comes after Muireann said earlier this week that she had a ""beautiful day"" in Kerry on the first day of her holiday.

Muireann took to her Instagram to share some snaps from her first day in Kerry with her boyfriend and mum.

They spent the day at Derrynane Beach and in the first snap she shared Muireann was sitting on the beach and was wearing a black and brown swimsuit with some sunglasses.

She followed this snap with some of the gorgeous views they saw while they were at the beach.

The last picture she posted was of the delicious pizza that she and her boyfriend had along with some drinks.

Muireann captioned these pictures saying: ""Missed most of the tropic weather but a beautiful day on Derrynane beach.

""Swam away from jellyfish went to say hi to Granny on Abbey Island and told everyone who’d listen to read A Ghost in the Throat by @doireann.ni.ghriofa.

Now I'm trying to help save this historic building""","The following has been republished with permission from Our Southern Souls and published by Lynn Oldshue. The original article can be found here.

I grew up in Lexington Mississippi. Ever since the day I painted my name on her bedside table at three years old my mom has said I was artistic. I never stopped. I wrote my name on everything I owned and didn’t own. In high school I designed yearbook covers and t-shirts. In college I majored in educational psychology because I always thought art was just something I could do for fun. It was when I was home with my first baby that I realized art could be my career. It will never be a job as long as it’s fun.

I am a self-taught artist who learned by trying and failing.

I tried for several years to get studio space at the Triangle Cultural Center in the heart of downtown Yazoo City. I finally got this studio two years ago. The building was built in 1904 and was originally a schoolhouse. It’s the perfect place for me to create. I am a self-taught artist who learned by trying and failing. This year I started taking art lessons for the first time to go back and learn the basics.

In the last few years I have seen positive changes in Yazoo City. Young people are buying older houses downtown and renovating them. Several people bought houses they saw on the “For the Love of Old Houses” Facebook page and moved to Yazoo City just to transform the homes back to what they used to be.

Unfortunately the Triangle is in danger of collapsing and in need of its own transformation. Bricks are falling off the exterior walls and 2×4’s are propping up parts of the ceiling on the inside. Rain leaks down the walls and into the basement. We haven’t had air conditioning in the building for a year. After sweating all day I wrote a letter to the editor of the Yazoo Herald describing the condition of the Triangle. I’ve never done anything like that but somebody had to stand up and say something. I am also trying to get it nominated as one of this year’s Ten Most Endangered Historic Places to receive a grant and aid from the Mississippi Heritage Trust. The more votes the Triangle gets the better its chances for the nomination.

I imagine the people who have walked these halls for over 100 years.

The building has its own history and personality and the beautiful floors tell their own story. When the sunlight hits the main floor you can see all of the dents grooves and lines. I imagine the people who have walked these halls for over 100 years. My mother-in-law was a member of the organizations that helped get the Yazoo history museum started and made it something special. She put so much time and love into it. There are fossils from 45000 years ago Native American relics and pictures from the flood of 1927. There are exhibits about Jerry Clower Stella Stevens Willie Brown Robert Johnson Zig Ziglar and Casey Jones.

Writer Willie Morris is part of that history and the museum. He went to school here and loved to write in the library next door. We have typed pages of notes from his book North Towards Home. There’s just something about downtown Yazoo City that inspires artists and writers. There is so much to learn in this building but if we don’t do something to save it all of the work of past generations to preserve our history will be in vain.

There has been little help from the city so we have to find other ways to save it. We can’t wait until it’s too late.”

Here is the letter Olivia wrote to the Yazoo Herald.

Dear fellow citizens of Yazoo

I would like to reintroduce you to a familiar place in our downtown that for more than a century has been an important landmark in our community. When you come to the intersection of Main and Washington Street -look around… you are staring right at an important piece of Yazoo history. The triangular shaped lot that is formed by this busy intersection holds memories common to so many Yazooans. The triangle has been the site of countless parades festivals and community events. This plot of land is home to the old Main Street school (1904-1975) now the Triangle Cultural Center (1975-present) and our beautiful B.S. Ricks Memorial Library.

This brings me to the importance of community and what it means for places such as the Triangle. Surely no other building still standing in Yazoo houses as many memories and emotions such as this one.

If these walls and halls could talk they would profoundly reminisce on what all they have seen.

If these walls and halls could talk they would profoundly reminisce on what all they have seen. They would tell you about witnessing many first times such as when kindergartners learned to read. The excitement and wonder in their eyes when they were praised by their teachers! We heard many giggles as students passed notes under desks. There have been a plethora of skinned knees and too many bandaids to count. Oh we can’t forget about the musicals and plays. Those were the days! The way the acoustics took their notes all over this big place. We will never forget the armistice of WWI and the teachers crying “Children oh children the war is over! Thank God it’s over!” The parade that followed this joyous occasion and the hardships to come. Oh but we prevailed! We recall the many graduates that passed through our doors spelling bees and all of the recitals that were held here. We were even present when the cries of grieving children rang through our halls as they were told their daddies would not be returning home from WWII. The war came to an end which marked the ending of an era and the turning of a page. We watched quietly as children read their daily assignments amidst our towering walls and large windows.

When it was announced that the building would close as a school we waited and wondered what would happen to this old place. Our community quickly stepped up to save us. They did more than salvage our structure they preserved our town history and more than proudly displayed it. It is all still here today in our amazing museum. Our walls and creaky floors await the next curious person to come wandering through our town’s past history. All credited to a community that cared and put their ideas into action. A type of community that our walls and halls so desperately long for today!

Now citizens of this community must know and see the pivotal stage we are facing in our town. If we do not band together as the faithful community we once were and bring this back to the respected structure that it once was then who will? The hard work and endeavors of our community’s past will be in vain.

As I sit in my art studio on the north side of the triangle my heart stirs with so much emotion when I think of the downfall of this beloved building. I hope this letter stirs an emotion within you and also may it bring awareness to the dire situation we are facing.

Lastly these walls and halls long to hear the notes of a piano the lines from a play the roar of an audience the pitter patter of little ballerina feet and the multitude of sounds coming from within! If this makes you feel any sort of way please reach out to me to come listen and take a look at what this building has to offer for our community!

Written sincerely from the heart of someone who loves this building the history it holds and the life it has left in it!

___________________________________

From Lynn: Yazoo City is my hometown. I grew up taking ballet and baton lessons at the Triangle in an old classroom with mirrors that reached from the wood floor to the high ceiling. As Ms. Christie taught the three positions or plié and relevé I watched out the big windows as folks walked along Main Street or the Delta sunset made the room and floors glow orange. There were art camps at the Triangle and chances to sing and dance on stage–the first time for many Yazoo kids to give those a try. Some of those programs were organized by my mom to have good activities for my brother and me. The Triangle has provided education and arts in Yazoo City for 117 years but it may not be around for many more.

Every town needs an Olivia who can see the magic and significance of these places. Who fights to stand up for them. Who encourages the community to join in.

A reactor at Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in southern China’s Guangdong province has been shut down because of fuel rod damages the company that runs the plant said in a statement on Friday.

State-owned China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) said in the statement that “a small amount of fuel damage” had occurred during operation but it’s still “within the limits allowed by the technical specifications.”

It added that “after thorough discussions between French and Chinese technicians Taishan Nuclear Power Plant decided to shut down Unit 1 reactor for maintenance and to examine the reasons of fuel damage and replace the damaged fuel.”

The statement further emphasized that the reactor is “safe and under control.”

CNN first reported in June that the French company Framatome – which supports operations at Taishan – had warned of an “imminent radiological threat” at the plant prompting the United States government to investigate the possibility of a leak.

Framatome is a subsidiary of French power giant Electricite de France (EDF) which holds a 30% stake in the plant’s owner and operator Taishan Nuclear Power Joint Venture Co. Ltd – a joint venture with CGN.

The Chinese government responded in June by saying that radiation levels around the plant were normal adding “less than 0.01 percent” of more than 60000 fuel rods in Unit 1 reactor were damaged. It said the damage was “inevitable” due to factors including fuel manufacturing and transportation.

In July an EDF spokesperson said the situation was “serious” but not an emergency.

The spokesperson said if the reactor was in France the company would have shut it down already due to “the procedures and practices in terms of operating nuclear power plants in France.”

The spokesperson did not directly call on China to halt operations at the plant noting it was a decision for CGN."

Many companies can’t hire fast enough as employees decline to return or quit for new opportunities. So how does your company land the right employees?

An Ambler-based international company thinks it has an answer. Phenom People uses artificial intelligence to automate tasks and personalize job searches. And in its decade in operation Phenom has achieved attention-grabbing “unicorn” status — which occurs when a start-up reaches the rarified ranks of being valued at more than $1 billion. According to market intelligence firm CB Insights it’s a relatively exclusive club with just more than 700 members worldwide.

Crafting an experience based on each user’s communication and other preferences Phenom claims to streamline the process for candidates to match them with the right job for current employees to land a promotion for recruiters to discover talent and for managers to build teams faster.

“The appeal of AI-based recruitment and talent management has led to a large amount of venture capital being invested in innovative start-ups in the HR Tech space” said William Filip managing director of Delancey Street Partners in West Conshohocken. “For most companies today their competitive advantage comes down to constantly having the best people. This means a continuous commitment to recruiting talent.”

Led by brothers Mahe and Hari Bayireddi Phenom’s more than 400 global clients include Cigna Southwest Airlines Microsoft and LinkedIn Switzerland-based transport and logistics company Kuehne+Nagel  UK-based software firm Micro Focus and multinational food processing company Marel.

Phenom reached unicorn status earlier this spring valued at $1.3 billion in April and has raised $161.4 million over five funding rounds. Its 11 investors include B Capital Group AllianceBernstein and Sierra Ventures according to Crunchbase. There’s talk of an IPO down the road.

“We are not predicting a time frame; however we do see an IPO as part of our future” Mahe Bayireddi said.

Founded in 2011 Phenom is using its own platform to make hires. Phenom has 300 employees in the United States increasing its ranks at its Ambler headquarters to 220 from 150 last year. An additional 700 employees work out of offices in London India Israel Netherlands and Germany.

Phenom doesn’t have one universal job platform. Rather its platform is integrated into the back end of a client’s site. A candidate’s job search is personalized to that person’s skills and experience.

A candidate may start at a company’s career page seeking jobs in a specific category. Phenom’s software can help shape the search by recommending opportunities based on the candidate. Automation and artificial intelligence or AI streamline interview scheduling and job status updates and speed up the application process.

When candidates go to Kohl’s jobs website for instance they enter Phenom People’s platform integrated to mimic Kohl’s website. The digital tools guide a candidate from online application to orientation steering them to match skills to roles and explaining the interview process and next steps.

Mahe compares Phenom to Shopify which provides an e-commerce platform to host a client’s online store. “What Shopify is for e-commerce” — providing a shopping platform — “we are that for companies’” hiring efforts said Mahe who sat for a recent interview in Phenom’s colorful Ambler headquarters with brother Hari.

Phenom’s business model is software as a service or SaaS where the company doesn’t sell shrink-wrapped units of software. Phenom’s centrally hosted products are delivered to clients through the cloud on a subscription basis which has the advantages of cutting out delivery costs and setting up the SaaS company with recurring revenue.

Phenom made three acquisitions during the pandemic that show how the company is evolving.

“We built the road map of the company in the middle of the pandemic” Mahe said.

The acquisitions include My Ally an AI-driven talent management program to improve its scheduling. Phenom also snapped up TalentCube a video recruiting software company to improve its video capabilities. More college students and graduates are posting brief video resumes online to network and get jobs. Mahe said Phenom’s goal is to make video interviewing “feel as authentic and engaging as in-person hiring.” Rounding out the trio Phenom added Amsterdam-based data-driven recruitment agency Endouble in December. The terms of the various deals were not disclosed.

While declining to say whether the acquisitions have contributed yet to revenue or profits Mahe said the companies have brought the prospect of accessing new markets while advancing Phenom’s Talent Experience Management (TXM) platform technologies and adding talent to the team.

Colleen Stratton Global Leader Workforce Development at SEI in Oaks which hires 300 to 400 people a year from college grads to data scientists to operations and marketing said Phenom’s integration cut the job posting process from 2 to 4 weeks to 1 to 3 weeks. In a purposeful overhaul starting in 2017 Stratton said SEI wanted to address inequities for women and minorities while making sure employees could see all promotion opportunities. Partnering with Phenom delivered on all fronts.

“I’m so happy with quality diversity of candidates and the expanded geography with the hybrid option” Stratton said. “I’m very bullish about 2021.”

Phenom’s technology and mission meet an unprecedented moment. U.S. employers added 850000 workers in June the largest monthly gain since last August and wages rose for the third straight month — a sign that employers are using higher pay to attract applicants and that workers are gaining bargaining power.

According to Mahe hot job sectors are knowledge workers delivery drivers and front-line service industry personnel.

In an increasingly automated world the roles of recruiters and human resources leaders are even more critical especially given that clear communication and trust can make or break a hiring experience.

Peter Cappelli a Wharton School management professor said that data analytics level the playing field allowing platforms to serve up best-fit selections for users. But he added a bigger question may be: Can recruiters and HR managers let algorithms a set of instructions computers use to solve a problem or accomplish a task do their job?

“People almost always want to go with the person they like. Are you going to be able to make [hiring managers] follow the algorithm?” said Cappelli director of the Center for Human Resources at Wharton.

When asked about competitors Mahe said Phenom competes in different categories of client experience but doesn’t have one direct rival who delivers all of the platforms that it does.

Delancey Street’s Filip cited a few examples of companies using competing methodologies to solve the same problem — efficiently finding great talent. Among the companies are: NYC-based Pandologic takes a specific job description and the recruitment budget a company has for those jobs and optimizes the online advertising placement. Salt Lake City-based HireVue provides video interviewing technology. And San Francisco-based Mya Systems provides an online conversational AI recruitment platform to facilitate job searches at entry levels including for recent college graduates.

Before the pandemic: Phenom offered one million jobs at any one time on platforms across 130 countries.

During the pandemic: Job offerings fell to 550000 with hospitality and restaurant roles sinking the most. Phenom saw growth in life sciences logistics and manufacturing jobs while global companies remained stagnant.

Almost every business sector is coming back so there are now 1.6 million jobs on the Phenom platforms.

“In the 2008 crisis the real hero was the CFO. But in the COVID crisis the hero is the chief HR officer” Mahe said.

Yet I still found myself slightly stressed when completing the many steps required to bypass the state's mandatory 10-day quarantine the strictest in the country.

Take Hawaii's COVID-19 testing requirement. I was well aware I couldn't walk into the urgent care center I used for so many precautionary pre-travel tests because Hawaii only accepts certain tests from a lineup of trusted testing and travel partners.

Prices are going up for ingredients and food across the retail industry but Starbucks says it has coffee prices locked in for months.

Starbucks buys coffee beans using a method called hedging. Basically Starbucks locks in a price to buy coffee beans over an agreed-upon future period ""hedging"" against risk. The contract acts almost like insurance protecting Starbucks from paying higher prices if coffee beans spike due to a weather event shortage or some other issue.

""Over the years we've created a very thoughtful approach to how we source warehouse and use hedging techniques to ensure we always have supply of premium Arabica green coffee at an attractive cost basis"" Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson told investors in an earnings call in July. ""In fact we purchase green coffee 12 to 18 months in advance and we never stopped buying green coffee through the pandemic.""

Coffee bean prices just hit a six-year high as Brazil a major coffee producer was hit by a drought followed by the worst frost in over 20 years. The full effect won't be realized until the 2022 crop is harvested meaning coffee prices could remain inflated for months or longer.

Starbucks is insulated from those price increases for a while though.

""We currently have over 14 months of price-forward coverage which means we have price locked on our coverage for the next 14 months which gets us through the rest of fiscal year 2021 and most of fiscal year 2022"" Johnson said in the earnings call.

Starbucks declined to comment further on how it buys coffee beans.

Starbucks' buying strategy ""looks really smart right now"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told Insider. ""They've been doing it for years.""

Hedging coffee beans is working out well for Starbucks right now but it can also go the other way for example if the chain bought coffee beans at a high price before the rate dropped. For now though Starbucks can avoid price increases for customers if the price of coffee beans spikes in the coming months and goes back down.

Hedging is a common strategy in other industries. ""Most international companies hedge commodities and raw materials"" Yarbrough told Insider. ""A lot more companies than you think hedge.""

For example fuel prices can have a major impact on airlines' bottom lines so some airlines hedge on fuel using the same method Starbucks applies to buying beans. When oil prices plunged in 2020 British Airways and other airlines saw major losses.

Construction progresses on a new Starbucks on Valleydale Road in front of Walmart Neighborhood Market on July 8.

Starbucks will soon open a location off the U.S. 280 corridor at the intersection of Valleydale Road and Caldwell Mill Road. It will be a freestanding location built in the parking lot of the Walmart Neighborhood Market.

Located at one of the busiest intersections west of 280 this will fill the need for a coffee shop in the area. Neighborhood Brew was located near the area but closed in November 2019.

Julie Krause director of portfolio management for Midland Atlantic Properties which represents the Valleydale Marketplace shopping center said the spot was identified a number of years ago.

“We have been looking for a use for this outparcel for a while and we thought Starbucks would be really great in this market” Krause said.

Krause said her company has worked with a Starbucks at a number of other locations.

“Around 2016-17 we reapproached Starbucks who had looked at this site in the past and decided to reapproach the issue” she said. “It took a while and we had a lot of hurdles to get through.”

Krause said they worked with Shelby County and the town of Indian Springs to make sure they were satisfied and requirements were met.

The location at 2653 Valleydale Road will include a drive-thru. It will be around 2000 square feet and is scheduled to open in early fall. “It has definitely been a challenge in a lot of ways but we have been able to get it done” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vNDc1NjAxL3RoaXMtbWlnaHQtYmUtdGhlLWV4YWN0LWRhdGUtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXB1bXBraW4tc3BpY2UtbGF0dGUtcmV0dXJucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Might Be The Exact Date Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte Returns,"This Might Be The Exact Date Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte Returns

Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Lattes are just as coveted as their red holiday cups if not more. Some would say that it's the Pumpkin Spice Latte that marks the onset of not only fall but also the festive season that goes on until the end of the year. ""The return of the PSL marks the start of autumn for many *cue crackling bonfires* ... The drink is now a seasonal staple synonymous with cozy knits as the temperatures cool and we finally say farewell to summer"" says Starbucks and they're spot on.

Pumpkin Spice Lattes aren't popular for no reason. The drink contains the signature Starbucks Espresso Roast a pumpkin pie-flavored sauce milk and whipped cream and it's topped with rich autumnal spices like cinnamon nutmeg and cloves. No wonder the drink tastes like a liquid version of a Thanksgiving dinner pumpkin pie.

If the track record of the last few years is any indication the iconic Pumpkin Spice Latte might be out sooner than you think too. While the rest of the world deals with sticky hot summer afternoons if rumors are to be believed Starbucks is already going to be gearing up to bring back the PSL in just a few weeks. Eat This Not That! observed that Starbucks has been introducing the PSL to its menu on the third Tuesday of August every year for the past few years. So if that is true the drink will be back in Starbucks outlets across the country likely on Tuesday 24 August this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuQFodHRwczovL3N0b3JpZXMuc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLmNhL2VuLWNhL3ByZXNzLzIwMjEvc3RhdGVtZW50LXN0YXJidWNrcy1jYW5hZGEtcmVhY2hlcy1hLWNvbGxlY3RpdmUtYmFyZ2FpbmluZy1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtd2l0aC11bml0ZWQtc3RlZWx3b3JrZXJzLXVuaW9uLWZvci1kb3VnbGFzLXN0cmVldC1kcml2ZS10aHJ1LWxvY2F0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Statement: Starbucks Canada reaches a collective bargaining agreement with United Steelworkers union for Douglas ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://stories.starbucks.ca/en-ca/press/2021/statement-starbucks-canada-reaches-a-collective-bargaining-agreement-with-united-steelworkers-union-for-douglas-street-drive-thru-location/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuQFodHRwczovL3N0b3JpZXMuc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLmNhL2VuLWNhL3ByZXNzLzIwMjEvc3RhdGVtZW50LXN0YXJidWNrcy1jYW5hZGEtcmVhY2hlcy1hLWNvbGxlY3RpdmUtYmFyZ2FpbmluZy1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtd2l0aC11bml0ZWQtc3RlZWx3b3JrZXJzLXVuaW9uLWZvci1kb3VnbGFzLXN0cmVldC1kcml2ZS10aHJ1LWxvY2F0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL21lbmRvZmV2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDEvY292aWQtMTktY2FzZS10aWVkLXRvLXVraWFocy1wZXJraW5zLXN0cmVldC1zdGFyYnVja3MtcGF0cm9ucy1lbmNvdXJhZ2VkLXRvLXRlc3QtZm9yLXRoZS12aXJ1cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID-19 Case Tied to Ukiah's Perkins Street Starbucks; Patrons Encouraged to Test for the Virus,"The Mendocino County COVID-19 Department Operations Center has confirmed positive COVID-19 case at the following location:

LOUIS At first Chassidy Howard thought she was hearing fireworks. Then she felt the pain in her leg.

It was excruciating — she had been shot. Howard fell down behind a car and listened to her grown son Buddy call out from down the street.

“Mama mama I’ve been hit! I’ve been hit!” Buddy screamed.

Moments earlier the mother and son had been chatting with friends near their home on Genevieve Avenue in north St. Louis. They were out late that night in August 2013 and Buddy had just come over to tell his mom it was time to head home.

The house they had been sitting in front of was abandoned as was the home across the street where it was rumored the guns had been stashed until the shooting started.

It was another example of a phenomenon law enforcement gun violence researchers and residents have described in different ways for years. Vacant lots and abandoned buildings attract crime so much so that it almost seems as if bullets are drawn to them by a magnet as in Howard’s case.

Both St. Louis and Kansas City are blighted with acres of abandoned property owned publicly and privately. Gun violence follows the vacancy from neighborhood to neighborhood virtually without fail data shows.

Why did we report this story? This story is part of a series The Star and its partners across the state are producing this year focusing on public health issues that contribute to gun violence. These include income housing food insecurity built environments and school quality. After kicking off the series earlier this year and publishing stories that explored the roles of income housing and food insecurity in gun violence we began reporting on issues of built environment. That includes negative features in neighborhoods such as vacant lots and abandoned buildings. The effort is undertaken as part of the Missouri Gun Violence Project a two-year statewide solutions journalism collaboration supported by the nonprofits Report for America and the Missouri Foundation for Health. The Star has partnered in the project with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the Springfield News-Leader and The Missouri Independent.

Ten people were killed in Howard’s neighborhood just last year. On her stretch of Genevieve Avenue along the northeastern end of the Walnut Park East neighborhood nearly 75% of the homes on the block have been abandoned. Some have been left to crumble for decades though longtime residents remember when their street was cared for and safer.

Across St. Louis gun violence festers in neighborhoods riddled with vacant lots. The city has counted 25000 of them. And the burden is not shared equally. North of Delmar Boulevard which divides the city along racial and economic lines 30% of properties are vacant compared with only 3% in the south.

All but one of the top 10 neighborhoods for shootings had higher than average vacant lot rates according to a Star analysis of data from the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive and the city’s land bank. Four of the 10 neighborhoods had the highest rates for both shootings and vacant lots.

Public health researchers have shown that the built environment of a community — including negative features like vacant lots and abandoned buildings — has an impact on the risk of gun violence. It is part of an overall picture of well-being in a neighborhood that includes factors such as income housing food insecurity and education. Cleaning up and maintaining neighborhoods can reduce gun crimes studies show.

And in recent years St. Louis has committed tens of millions of dollars to doing just that.

Voters in 2017 approved a $40-million bond issue for rehabbing vacant homes and buildings owned by the city’s land bank. In June a new land trust was established with a $1 million grant from the state and matching funds.

Those investments are needed to uplift communities harmed not only by high vacancy and crime but also poverty said Neal Richardson executive director of the St. Louis Development Corporation.

“We should be doing more” Richardson said. “Right now in the city of St. Louis there are some streets blocks and entire areas that are vacant. And that just creates pockets of challenges and dark spots within our city for crime to happen.”

On the other side of the state Kansas City has not dedicated as many resources.

“Not many people recognize that the way a neighborhood looks and violent crime can relate” said Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas. “When we come to the solution side we don’t actually think about how if we fix something like vacancy and housing we can lower our violent crime.”

To fully repair the generations of structural racism and systemic disinvestment in either city experts say would mean reinvesting hundreds of millions of dollars. Some even put the figure as high as $1 billion.

Even so Howard believes Walnut Park can once again be a safer thriving place to live and raise a family.

Today she operates a small barbecue stand next to a vacant home hardly a block from where she was shot. As she works a slight limp from the gun injury is noticeable. Her left calf bears the scar from where the bullet entered and exited her leg.

“I took a bullet for Genevieve” she said with a smile flipping ribs on a charcoal grill.

Someday she would like to convert one of the nearby vacant buildings to a brick-and-mortar restaurant serving rib tip sandwiches and chicken wings. She draws hope from the efforts of two neighbors Troy Gardner and Sundy Whiteside who remember what the neighborhood was once like and share a vision for its future. Both are longtime residents and Whiteside is a leader in the St. Louis vacancy effort.

“It’s so hard to see this neighborhood look like this” Howard said. “I really want this to one day be a community and these two women are the reason I’m hopeful that it will. You still have people that stick around and care about this community.”

Life on Genevieve

The neighborhood was not always like this.

In 1975 When Troy Gardner’s mother bought a house on Genevieve the neighborhood was thriving.

Every house on the block was cared for. Front lawns were mowed. Neighbors looked out for one another. Half of the residents were Black and the other half were white.

In the decades since Gardner has seen how white flight redlining and disinvestment have devastated this part of the city. She’s lived in her mother’s old home since the 1990s and now shares it with her dog Cupcake.

Gardner 67 is one of the few residents remaining on her block. Across the street six houses sit vacant and crumbling. The house to the left of hers hasn’t been occupied for 20 years and it shows.

Around the corner on Beacon Avenue the Johnson family used to own a candy store. But that has since been abandoned and Gardner tries to avoid that block entirely because it isn’t safe.

How did we report this story? To research this story reporters from The Star analyzed data from city land banks police departments and the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive. The reporters mapped vacant lots abandoned buildings and shootings in St. Louis and Kansas City to show how built environments relate to gun violence. Reporters interviewed residents neighborhood leaders city officials public health experts and researchers who study gun violence and urban environments. To learn more about how these issues play out on the ground a reporter traveled from Kansas City to St. Louis. They visited residents in the neighborhoods most impacted who are working on solutions. The story builds on reporting the Star gun violence team began last year examining gun violence as a public health problem. For this story the St. Louis Post-Dispatch contributed photography.

As the families and businesses moved out the gun violence moved in behind them.

Bullet holes now dot Gardner’s home including one over the headboard in her mom’s old bedroom. Another has punctured the storm drain just above her rocking chair on the front porch. She has woken up at night to the sound of automatic gunfire 60 rounds at a time.

Last year she was dropping a slice of pie off at her neighbor’s house when she had to throw herself to the ground to avoid bullets flying down the street.

“For the first time in my life I am scared” Gardner said. “I have never once been scared. But I am now and I am so tired.”

Fortunately Gardner is not alone.

Up the block is Sundy Whiteside who Gardner has known since she was a young girl. And together they are working on making their little corner of the world a better place.

Making a difference

Whiteside knocked on the door of a stranger’s home in an affluent section of south St. Louis.

When the homeowner answered she told them the story of a sinking ship.

This was part of a city-wide effort Whiteside had joined in 2015 through the St. Louis Association of Community Organizations. They were seeking voter support for a bond issue to rehab thousands of vacant homes in St. Louis.

In talking to voters Whiteside would compare St. Louis to a large ship with a hole in one side. While people on the side with the leaking hole are frightfully aware of how the ship is sinking she would say those on the other side remain oblivious.

Her point: even if residents in one neighborhood don’t live with the same struggles as the other all of them should care because it affects the whole region.

“We have to think of ourselves as a big unit rather than just 79 individual neighborhoods” Whiteside said. “So when something happens over here we have to work together to bring solutions and not make it the burden of one geographical area.”

She and fellow organizers were campaigning for Proposition Neighborhood Stabilization also known as Proposition NS a $40-million bond to fund improvements on vacant homes owned by the St. Louis Land Reutilization Authority.

The bond passed in an April 2017 election but a lengthy court battle delayed real action. It wasn’t until last year that the funds became available to fix up properties. The $40 million is distributed over roughly 7 years. Each year about $6 million will go toward fixing 200 vacant LRA homes.

The Reutilization Authority which is staffed by the St. Louis Development Corporation will provide up to $30000 to repair a single-family home or $50000 for a multi-family unit or commercial property.

It’s not always enough to make the homes brand new again but is meant to stabilize them so they can be sold to homeowners individual rehabbers or small developers.

One crucial part Whiteside said is that the people in the neighborhoods have a say over which properties get selected for rehab. Anyone can nominate a property and then each nomination is assessed to see what work needs to be done and the likelihood of the fixed up home selling at auction.

The price of the homes is also supposed to remain affordable. A rehabbed home in Walnut Park would sell for around $500 Whiteside said. The idea is not to bring in gentrification but to retain existing residents and give them the chance to be homeowners.

In June a $1-million grant from the Missouri Department of Conservation and matching funds from public and private sources established a St. Louis Community Land Trust.

That will create a mechanism for community ownership with a board primarily made up of residents of the neighborhoods. That way plans are made with the neighborhoods in mind and the benefits are for the people who live there said Laura Ginn a vacancy strategist who works for the St. Louis Land Reutilization Authority.

It’s all about putting power in the hands of the people she said.

Whiteside now serves as board president of the St. Louis Association of Community Organizations and co-chairs the Vacancy Collaborative’s advisory committee. She still sees more that needs to be done and wants more long-term and sustainable funding for improving vacant land.

Ginn estimates that to clean up all the vacant property in the city’s land bank it would cost $100 million a year for five years and then $15 million a year after that to continue maintaining the land.

“I would estimate it’s at least a billion dollars worth of investment needed to help historically disinvested communities in Kansas City” said Geoff Jolley executive director of the Greater Kansas City Local Initiative Support Corporation.

“And when I tell funders that they get real nervous they’ll say but we’ve put a few million dollars into this. But a few million dollars isn’t going to change a neighborhood that has had years of lack of intention and investment.”

But in order for those funds to be spent wisely advocates and researchers say they must work with neighborhood leaders who know their community best to bring about effective change.

Kansas City

In Kansas City the nonprofit Urban Neighborhood Initiative has recommended the city create a bond issue similar to St. Louis’ Proposition NS.

That could generate resources that would go toward vacancy and housing said Dianne Cleaver the president of the Initiative.

Neighborhood leaders have long been trying to address vacancies and blight in their communities. It was one of the first things Cleaver heard about when she became president of the nonprofit in 2013.

“All of our neighborhoods were very concerned about their vacancies because they breed crime and blight” Cleaver said.

Join American Public Square at Jewell and The Kansas City Star at 12:30 p.m. on August 4 for a digital program in our series Gun Violence in Missouri: Seeking Solutions. Our discussion will focus on how improving the built environments where people live supports the public health approach to gun violence prevention thus improving outcomes for Missouri.

Two ZIP codes with the most vacancy in the city — 64127 and 64130 — are also home to neighborhoods that experience the most gun violence in the city according to a Star analysis of land bank addresses and shooting locations.

In 2015 the Urban Neighborhood Initiative started a program to rehab vacant lots and buildings in 10 neighborhoods including Blue Hills Ivanhoe and Manheim Park.

The effort seeks to reduce barriers to working on a vacant property clearing titles and encouraging developing vacant land into affordable housing green spaces and urban farms. The nonprofit also created a calculator to estimate the time and money needed to fix up a given property.

When Vacant to Vibrant started Cleaver said roughly 50% of the land in the 10 neighborhoods was vacant. Now it’s down to 39%.

Kansas City doesn’t have nearly as much publicly owned vacant land as St Louis — the city’s Land Bank currently manages nearly 3000 vacant properties of all kinds.

But so far Kansas City also has not invested in solutions the way other cities have.

Some efforts in recent years including a citywide sales tax for development on the Prospect Corridor and a housing trust fund have included goals of rehabbing vacant properties but were focused also on other priorities.

A housing trust fund established by the Kansas City Council in 2018 never received funding until last year when the city put in $12.5 million in federal dollars from the American Rescue Plan. The trust fund is meant to focus on housing not the problem of vacancy specifically.

“We are calling for a more comprehensive approach instead of these piecemeal approaches they are piecemeal because we have piecemeal powers “ Cleaver said. “So we have to find a way to get significant dollars into this issue then you can begin to look at more comprehensive approaches.

“Funding really is the biggest challenge it’s not like the city doesn’t want to address this issue.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWlzc291cml0aW1lcy5jb20vc3QtbG91aXMtY29tbXVuaXR5LWNvbGxlZ2VzLXJ1bi1vZi1zdWNjZXNzLWhhcy1pdC1wb2lzZWQtdG8tbWVldC1sYWJvci1zaG9ydGFnZS13aXRoLXByb3Atci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Louis Community College's run of success has it poised to meet labor shortage with Prop R,"St. Louis Community College’s run of success has it poised to meet labor shortage with Prop R

ST. LOUIS — Dr. Jeff Pittman is the epitome of the St. Louis Community College motto: “Expanding minds. Changing Lives.”

When he inherited the leadership of the largest community college in the state in 2015 it was languishing. Pittman was the fifth chancellor in eight years. But since coming to St. Louis from Indiana Pittman has deftly implemented his mission of stability and efficiency to St. Louis Community College (STLCC).

The multi-million-dollar budget deficit has been erased and today the budget stands balanced from a series of cost reduction efforts including rightsizing staffing levels and eliminating administrative duplications. Since 2015 the college has reduced its expenses by $15 million Pittman said.

In an effort to streamline the community college process Pittman introduced the school to the Guided Pathways model an approach that connects students throughout the collegiate process to improve retention.

“It’s removing barriers on the front end for students. It’s doing things like making the registration process simpler helping students complete the FAFSA getting them enrolled in the right classes that they need assigning an education coach for the student as they go all the way through their educational journey” Pittman said. “It’s not the old model of community colleges where you provide students with minimal advising throughout their time at the college.”

Pittman was born and raised in Bloomfield Indiana a rural area close to a large Naval weapons manufacturing center that requires the types of workers the community college system trains.

“I really like the system we have here in Missouri. While I was in Indiana I started out as a teacher and faculty member. Eventually I was chancellor of the Terre Haute region for 13 years” Pittman said.

In Missouri the community college system is segmented into 12 districts. STLCC includes all of St. Louis city and county as well as small parts of adjoining counties. It has the largest taxing base of any community college in the state. Because of that and some effective budgeting the system has been able to maintain a $122 credit hour for all courses — one of the lowest in the state.

Pittman is famous for a quote too blunt to have been often heard in academia: “Unless you hate money why would you not go here?”

However all of the innovations have not been focused on correcting the budget. STLCC has begun a series of partnerships to innovate its course offerings.

It has upgraded its presence in state government enabling the system to get several state grants and some from MoExcels. Gov. Mike Parson recently provided the college a $4 million grant for a new childcare center removing a huge roadblock for students at the Forest Park Campus. But one of its most successful partnerships has been its relationship with LaunchCode a company that provides IT training and is headquartered in St. Louis.

The partnership utilizes LaunchCode’s innovative curriculum and has allowed the college to train workers who are needed the day they graduate. The curriculum is taught over a 14-week period as a full-time cohort-based class. It starts off with 20 students and realizes an amazingly high graduation rate. It also provides students with transportation support and offers other measures of financial assistance if needed.

There are approximately 2000 coding position vacancies right now in St. Louis and the partnership with LaunchCode will assist in filling these positions.

“Any community has to be ready when an economic development opportunity arises. Now more than ever that means having the right workforce training facilities and programs” said Rob Dixon director of the Missouri Department of Economic Development. “Dr. Pittman understands that workforce training is the best economic development strategy there is.”

STLCC has also embraced a cohort system to help students not just in the classroom.

“This is the model of wrapping support around students and having a defined pathway and cohorts — the value of students being together” Pittman stated. “I can’t begin to describe the value of that.”

STLCC is expanding health care services and food programs for students and developing family resource centers in an effort to put all those services into one place. STLCC has begun hiring social workers; as the college has never employed social workers in the past it has started with hiring one for each campus to help students with life challenges.

“The dialog about social workers and student success coaches began a while back and every year it’s just grown. These are the things that help a student with staying and completing. When you have this coach that helps you along the way that is what gets the student through and is successful” said Kedra Tolson executive director of Marketing and Communications with STLCC. “With sustainability and leadership you’re able to gain traction and every year it grows and gets better.”

A key goal of the entire leadership team is to show students how to make education a part of their life and not simply an added burden.

That plan has focused on removing barriers on the front end for students. It has included making the registration process simpler helping students complete the FAFSA getting them enrolled in the right classes and assigning an education coach for the student as they go all the way through their educational journey. It’s not the old model of community colleges where students have minimal guidance but a holistic design of assisting students with every part of their lives.

The average community college student usually completes 15-18 credit hours too many for their program because they haven’t been on a Guided Pathway to stay on track. At STLCC the health care programs are the most regimented and these students graduate on time with the right credits — eliminating wasted time and costs.

“We need to make all of our programming this efficient” Pittman said.

One area of growth within the college has been the increase in high school students earning dual credit.

“We saw the relationship grow between school counselors and college administrators and the relationships gained with school systems” said Tolson. “So when you start to talk about opportunities for kids it becomes ‘We’re all on board with that; how do we make it happen?’”

“With our early college students we found they should come in cohorts and not as individual students” she continued. “It was nice that they came in groups so it would be this group of students that come together and carpool because that was the sense of safety some of the parents needed and wanted.”

When Pittman got to STLCC he had employees work as a college to put together a strategic plan that has evolved over the years. STLCC recently completed a master facility plan that is comprehensive in nature and allows flexibility with what can be done with each campus.

“Dr. Pittman has proven to be an asset to St. Louis Community College as his innovative leadership has been so beneficial to his students and the community” Rep. Jim Murphy said. “His dual enrollment program has given many high school students a very valuable head start.”

Those innovations and reforms — combined with the renewed confidence Pittman has instilled in the college — have led to Proposition R.

The transformation has set the stage to do more with Prop R

All of the transformations of the past six years have led the St. Louis business community to encourage STLCC to increase its role in training the skilled workforce they are seeking. The end result is Prop R that is on the ballot this week.

“We have the opportunity to be an area of real growth if we can prepare our workforce” Pittman said. “Companies that consider moving here are asking ‘Can we recruit the people that we need who are committed to the community?’ And I think the St. Louis Community College already has demonstrated a track record of achievement that’s very compelling.”

Previously STLCC’s district publicly-set levy was around 30 cents. A state law change lowered that without a vote of the district. Prop R would simply return that levy to just below what it was previously.

Dr. Mark Wrighton chancellor emeritus of Washington University in St. Louis has led the campaign for Prop R.

“I’ve been involved in higher education for nearly 50 years. I believe the work that is being done by Dr. Pittman and STLCC is vital to our community to provide the workforce we need to grow and I believe Prop R is the right investment in the future of the St. Louis area” Wrighton said.

Beginning in 2020 Wrighton was involved in a community-wide effort to consider how to bring about new jobs and inclusive economic growth. The initiative was originally led by business development organizations. The result of that work was to bring to the forefront the need for workforce development and a talented group of people to take the jobs.

“We still have a large number of underemployed and unemployed people who can benefit enormously from the kind of education and training that takes place right here at St. Louis Community College. There are shortages and I believe that in order for us to support the growth of businesses in this region and to attract new businesses we have to be able to have a talented diverse and well-prepared workforce” Wrighton said.

“I’ve been involved in the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center that is today the No. 1 largest plant science start-up center in the world” he continued. “They need educated [and] trained science technicians and the community college partnered. Vincent Hill is a start-up community. It’s a so-called unicorn coming out of the Danforth Plant Science Center — a unicorn meaning it’s going to be valued at over $1 billion. Their corporate headquarters is out there in Creve Coeur right by the Danforth Plant Science Center. They already have significant employment. It’s biotechnology and in order to prepare people to work in the biotechnology areas you need specialized facilities. The community college on each of its four campuses with Proposition R will have the opportunity to enhance their facilities and prepare for this expanded employment opportunity in biotechnology.”

With an 8 cent increase Prop R is estimated to add $24 million to the college’s budget annually. The current levy is set at just less than 20 cents and Prop. R would raise it to 28 cents — making it still one of the lowest in the state for community colleges.

“If Prop R were to pass this would modernize the campuses with expanded programs in health care IT financial services biotechnology and manufacturing and will enable a bonding capacity of $350 million” Wrighton said. “The support that comes in the short run will enable the college to modernize outdated facilities … and redevelop campuses in the next four or five years. There will be many jobs that are created in the construction sector. A lot of redevelopment will take place as the current campuses need to be updated to provide students with real-world work environments.”

“Supporting Proposition R is an easy choice when I consider Chancellor Pittman’s leadership of the community college. Dr. Pittman has demonstrated a bold vision for innovation. He’s aggressively sought and embraced new models of education and job training that push outside beyond conventional programs” said LaunchCode Executive Director Jeff Mazur. “He’s led the college to be a genuine partner and investor in accelerated accessible non-credit opportunities like the ones our organizations work on together which is aimed squarely at solving a huge regional talent problem. St. Louis is fortunate to have Dr. Pittman helping shape the workforce at a pivotal moment for our community.”

Thus far the business community hasn’t just encouraged STLCC to grow its degree programs. It has put its money where its mouth is. Several big employers such as Enterprise Centene Ameren Washington University and St. Louis University have contributed to the campaign. Almost every building trade has signed on. Mercy Hospital made a large donation last week.

“There is an education gap and if we don’t close it we can’t be competitive as a region. It is really is a critical thing. That’s why I got involved in this and the chancellor has inspired our community to know how important the community college is in closing this gap” Wrighton said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aWNrZWRsb2NhbC5jb20vc3RvcnkvaGVyYWxkLWNpdGl6ZW4vMjAyMS8wNy8zMS9ub3ctc3RhdGVzLXdpbm5pbmdlc3Qtd3Jlc3RsaW5nLWNvYWNoLWhpc3RvcnktY29zdGEtY3JlZGl0cy1mYW1pbHktYXRtb3NwaGVyZS1sZWdhY3ktc3VjY2Vzcy1zdC1qb2huLzUzNzczNTgwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Now the state's winningest wrestling coach in history Costa credits family atmosphere for a legacy of success at St ...,"Chad Konecky

Special to Wicked Local

Among the hundreds of high school wrestlers Manny Costa has coached throughout 31 years at St. John’s Prep a 16-year-old heavyweight from Andover took on historic importance when he closed out the Division 1 state title clash late last month with a 3-0 decision over his New Bedford opponent.

The outcome of the showdown – a 63-9 Eagles win – was a foregone conclusion much earlier in the match but rising junior star Charlie Smith’s victory made official a staggering statistic. Costa a Danvers resident and Peabody police officer is now the winningest wrestling coach in state history.

The 55-year-old’s 778th career victory capping a 17-0 season put him one win ahead of North Reading’s Larry Tremblay the longtime coach at Winchester who is now at the Melrose helm. The mark also stands as the New England record while ranking 11th nationally.

“I’ve been fortunate to have been around great young men” says Costa. “My own wrestling record at the Prep is 0-0. It’s the wrestlers who don the shoes and singlets and step into the circle who have won the meets. They are the ones who have bought into the system bought into the St. John’s wrestling family and bled and sweated for each other to continue a great tradition of excellence. Yes I’m the constant throughout this ride but full credit goes to the guys who took to the mat. They are the ones who actually won the meets.”

Since he was hired as head coach in 1990 Costa has insisted his wrestlers call him only by his first name. He believes the practice elevates his wrestlers to the level footing they deserve.

“I’ve always been ‘Manny’ not coach” he says. “Keeping to my first name has kept me on equal terms and hopefully be more approachable to them. It’s our team not my team. We are equal parts so we all go by given birth names or nicknames. That’s how I’ve operated all 31 years. I believe in a family atmosphere.”

Without question it’s been a winning formula. Costa coached his first individual state champion in 1992. He’s now shepherded 33 to that mountain top. He’s even more proud of the 88 Academic All-Americans the program has produced during his tenure. A model of patience and persistence Costa had to wait until this season to see his Eagles take home the program’s first Division 1 Dual Meet state title. The Prep had reached the finals in eight of the past 10 seasons and claimed four sectional crowns but 2021 marked a breakthrough including the remarkable coincidence that the landmark win also gave Costa the record.

No charge

The fact that Costa’s record now sits at 778-148-6 (.945 winning percentage) with Tremblay at 777-105-5 is an unlikely story and one worth telling.

For example there have been multiple occasions on which Costa thought that he would walk away from the job for a variety of reasons. Surprisingly one of those was not the fact that he did the job for free for a while.

Costa had been a volunteer coach for two seasons at the Prep when he ran into a friend and fellow member of his judo club Steve Ring at the North Shore Mall in October of 1990. Ring’s son Ben Class of 1992 was a junior captain for the Prep wrestling squad and his dad was concerned that the Eagles hadn’t yet named a varsity head coach for the forthcoming season.

“Based on that conversation I went to see (the late) headmaster Brother William Drinan” recalls Costa a 1983 Peabody graduate. “He asked how much I was looking to be paid and I said I’d do it for free. He pulled out a contract on the spot and asked me to sign it. Now here we are three decades later.”

Hindsight has proven the former headmaster to be both gutsy and prescient in hiring a 23-year-old first-year police officer who had never wrestled in high school or collegiately. Costa did possess relevant big-time experience. He was a two-time High School All-American in judo and a U.S. National Team member from 1981-90. He was also a resident and captain at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs and served as an alternate on the 1987 and 1989 World Championship teams as well as the 1988 U.S. Olympic Team.

Coaching has added even more accolades to Costa’s resume. He was inducted into the Massachusetts Interscholastic Wrestling Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2010 the New England Council Hall of Fame in 2011 and the St. John’s Prep Hall of Fame in 2014. The Massachusetts Chapter of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame honored Costa with its Lifetime Service Award in 2018.

“Manny’s record is a testament to the hard work and dedication he’s given to our program for most of his life” says St. John’s athletic director Jameson Pelkey a Groveland resident.

“He does a tremendous job working with our student-athletes on the mat during the season and demands excellence from his guys in the classroom throughout the year. He is a great leader and mentor to those who wrestle for him.”

Ironically Costa thought he would step down almost 30 years ago after Ring graduated. But Doug Alton Class of 1995 also practiced judo at Costa’s club so he hung around another season to coach him. During that campaign he saw the potential in the fellow Peabody native and stayed on to see him through his scholastic career.

Similar circumstances continued to keep him on the job until Mike Pedro Class of 2002 the son of Olympic judo medalist Jimmy Pedro Class of 1988 graduated after winning four individual state championships. At that point Costa figured he was through.

“Everybody then started buzzing about the program falling apart with Pedro gone” recalls Costa. “I couldn’t have that. So in 2003 we had 10 guys place at the individual state tournament and we had qualifiers in all 14 weight classes.”

By this time Costa’s own sons were potential Prep wrestlers. He remained on the job to coach Jared Class of 2014 and Hunter Class of 2016. He figured he’d quit at that point to follow his kids’ collegiate careers but he didn’t. After that he stopped setting arbitrary benchmarks to step away.

Costa is quick to deflect credit for his success and pushes his wrestlers and his assistant coaches to center stage especially alumni assistants J.C. Honer Class of 1997 Kevin Cote Class of 1996 Mark Skandier Class of 2001 the late David Blais Class of 2003 and Steve Campbell Class of 2000 along with current assistants Frank Gwynne Class of 2001 and Ryan Harding Class of 2009.

“I’m grateful for the opportunity to coach here” says Costa who earned his undergraduate degree from Salem State University and a master’s from Anna Maria College.

“If the Prep hadn’t given a 23-year-old the chance and if the wrestlers hadn’t bought into what I asked of them we wouldn’t be where we are today. Alumni continue to follow the program. Each team continues our tradition of excellence. Over the years we’ve wrestled everyone and anyone. We challenge our wrestlers to seek the best competition to better their experience.

“It’s incredible to think of all the hard work by so many people over the years to get to this point” he added. “I tell the guys that even when I read articles on Prep wrestling I still shake my head at the level of success. It’s hard to explain and it’s humbling. I am honored to be the head coach of this team.”

This state-of-the-art vehicle took six months to build and has many new safety features.

The 2021 ambulance includes numerous airbags in case of an accident or rollover and a new type of stretcher system from Stryker called “Powerload” which lifts and loads patients up to 750 pounds if needed.

This resource will prevent back injuries of firefighters and “vastly improve how Lynn Fire provides emergency medical services (EMS) to the city of Lynn” said Fire Capt. Joseph Zukas.

The Lynn Fire Department responds to approximately 15000 incidents each year with over 10000 of these calls being EMS related according to Zukas.

Responding to these calls are 39 firefighters/paramedics and 135 firefighters/EMTs all of whom will benefit from this new ambulance.

“The Lynn Fire Department would like to thank Mayor McGee and Chief Financial Officer Michael Bertino for approving the purchase of this ambulance” Zukas said. “In addition we would like to recognize Capt. Ed Miles and firefighter/paramedics Pat Carritte and Marc Churchill for all of their assistance in the planning and putting into service one of the most advanced ambulances in the state.”

This ambulance costs $300000 and was made at Greenwood Emergency Vehicles in North Attleborough.

Greenwood Emergency Vehicles was incorporated in Massachusetts in 1979 as a dealer for Emergency One Inc. which is one of the largest manufacturers of fire apparatus in the United States.

According to the company website E-One built the first aluminum fire truck in 1974 using what is now recognized as the “material of choice in the construction of apparatus…adding years to the life expectancy of these vehicles.”

Greenwood serves as the exclusive dealer for E-One in much of New England.

News oi -Vivek

JEDEC the solid-state technology association have now announced a new standard for the low-powered memories -- LPDDR5X which is an improved version of the LPDDR5. As one can expect the LPDDR5X (JESD209-5B) offers faster data transfer rates with over 33 percent performance improvement.

LPDDR5 standard came to mainstream flagship smartphones in 2020 and most of the premium smartphones launched post that period are being equipped with LPDDR5 RAM. Given JEDEC has officially unveiled the LPDDR5X standard we expect the upcoming flagship smartphones to use the same.

What's New With LPDDR5X?

LPDDR5X offers a peak max rate data of 8533Mbps which is 33 percent higher than the LPDDR5. LPDDR5X has a max density of 32 Gbit and it is a single-channel memory with x16 width. It also offers signal integrity improvements using TX/RX equalization along with reliability improvements using Adaptive Refresh Management technology.

We can expect to see LPDDR5X memory modules from Samsung Electronics Micron Technology and Synopsys. Micron Technology has also confirmed that the upcoming 5G smartphones will come equipped with the LPDDR5X RAM. Not just that the fast memory will also help smartphones to offer better gaming media streaming and photography features.

LPDDR5X Vs LPDDR5

LPDDR5 offers a max data rate of 6400Mbps while the LPDDR5X offers 8533Mbps. The LPDDR5X does this while consuming the same voltage (Max 1.1v) which is now variable hence one can lower the data rate by reducing the voltage.

Due to the increase in the data rate a smartphone with the LPDDR5X RAM will have a memory bandwidth of 68.26GB/s. Thich should help to increase the performance of both CPU and GPU this results in an overall smartphone performance improvement. Lowering the data rate will reduce the power consumption hence the LPDDR5X is actually more power efficient when compared to the LPDDR5.

It is now said that the Xiaomi Mi 12 is expected to be the first smartphone to feature LPDDR5X along with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 898 SoC and all the phones with the Snapdragon 898 SoC are likely to use the same LPDDR5X RAM. Hence we can expect to see smartphones with the LPDDR5X RAM probably in Q1 or 2022.

AT&T vs. T-Mobile vs. Verizon,"The best phone carriers are so eager for you to hop on to their new 5G networks they're even willing to give you a free phone to get you to check out the faster wireless standard. But which one is offering the best free 5G phone deal?

That depends entirely on what kind of phone you want the device you have on-hand for a trade-in and — above all — the quality of the 5G coverage in your area.

You can understand why carriers are willing to part with a phone if it means more people using their networks. In the two-plus years since 5G networks started going live the major carriers have expanded aggressively bringing coverage to a wider number of people. With 5G set to be with us for years to come those same carriers want to plant their flag now and lock in subscribers. It also helps that many of these 5G phone deals require an unlimited data plan thus securing recurring revenue for the cost of a smartphone freebie.

But customers can benefit from these deals too. While we have a long way to go before 5G coverage is ubiquitous it reaches enough areas to make upgrading worth your while. And when switching to a new phone getting something for free is usually preferable to paying full price especially if you're eying one of the more expensive entries on the list of best 5G phones .

Here's a closer look at the free 5G phone offers from each phone carrier and whether they're the right fit for your needs.

T-Mobile free 5G phone deal: The most straightforward offer

Deal 1: Get a free OnePlus Nord N200 5G or Revvl V+ 5G when you trade in any functioning cell phone

Get a free OnePlus Nord N200 5G or Revvl V+ 5G when you trade in any functioning cell phone Deal 2: Get an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21 free when you trade-in a phone and sign up for a Magenta Plus unlimited plan

T-Mobile’s best free 5G phone offer: Trade in any functioning cell phone (or activate a new line of service on an eligible wireless plan) and T-Mobile will give you a free 5G phone.

The eligible phones: You have a choice of two phones under this plan — either the OnePlus Nord N200 5G or the Revvl V+ 5G.

We can't speak to the quality of the Revvl V+ which is T-Mobile's in-house brand of phones built by TCL. But we do have a OnePlus Nord N200 5G review in which we declared that this $239 phone was the best 5G value out there.

With the Nord N200 don't expect great performance or cameras that measure up to the best inexpensive camera phones like the Pixel 4a. But OnePlus did equip this phone with a 90Hz refresh rate and it lasts a long time on a charge.

No matter what phone you get in this deal you pay the sales tax up front and receive monthly bill credits for 24 months. Leave T-Mobile before then and you're on the hook for the balance of the phone.

OnePlus Nord N200 5G: Now free @ T-Mobile

Turn in any working phone to T-Mobile and the carrier will give you a free OnePlus Nord N200 5G. You'll get bill credits toward the phone spread out over 24 months.

The 5G network: T-Mobile 5G is without question the most extensive 5G network reaching more than 300 million people. T-Mobile is in the process of converting its far-reaching Extended Range 5G network into a faster Ultra Capacity 5G network with a goal toward completing that transition by year's end.

At least one testing firm already rates T-Mobile as the top-performing 5G network in the U.S. Opensignal says T-Mobile delivers faster download speeds than both AT&T and Verizon. In its reports though RootMetrics places AT&T ahead of T-Mobile in terms of speed.

Other T-Mobile free 5G phone deals: The OnePlus Nord N200 may be a good 5G value but it's hardly the flashiest phone. T-Mobile also has a deal where you can pick up an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21 for free though you have a lot more hurdles to clear.

First of all you have to trade in a relatively recent phone to get the full credit that would give you either the iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21 free. In the case of Apple phones that trade-in has to be an iPhone X or later; the iPhone 8 released at the same time as the iPhone X only nets a $730 savings. For Samsung phones you'll need a Galaxy S20 or later to reap the maximum trade-in value.

In addition to trading in a device you must sign up for a Magenta Plus unlimited plan to get a big discount on the iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21. That's T-Mobile's most expensive unlimited data plan at $85 a month though you do get truly unlimited data plus HD video streaming among other benefits.

As before the rebate value is paid out to you in bill credits spread over 24 months. You'll enjoy a much better free (or more accurately ""discounted"") phone but T-Mobile's other free 5G phone deal is a little bit more straightforward.

The verdict: Unless you need the latest and greatest device a simple trade-in can get you a OnePlus Nord N200 5G which is a perfectly fine phone for enjoying T-Mobile's 5G network.

Verizon free 5G phone deal: Generous trade-ins for good phones

Deal 1: Trade in any phone even damaged ones for credit toward an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21/Galaxy Note 20.

Trade in any phone even damaged ones for credit toward an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21/Galaxy Note 20. Deal 2: Get a free Galaxy S20 FE by activating a new line of data on an unlimited plan.

Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12 (Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Verizon’s best free 5G phone offer: Trade in your old phone even if it's damaged and get money back on your 5G phone purchase.

The eligible phones: Verizon lets you apply that credit to the four iPhone 12 models as well as any Galaxy S21 or Galaxy Note 20 device. In the case of the iPhone you can get a maximum credit of up to $1000 while Galaxy shoppers can get up to $1100 back.

As with T-Mobile you'll need a recent phone to get the biggest return though Verizon is pretty generous with its rebates. My iPhone SE from 2016 for example qualifies for a $350 credit spread out over 24 months. T-Mobile doesn't even offer a rebate when you trade in an original iPhone SE. It's also worth emphasizing that Verizon accepts broken phones something other carriers do not.

The iPhone 8 nets a savings of $700 essentially letting you get an iPhone 12 mini for free or an iPhone 12 for $99.

You'll need to sign up for one of Verizon's unlimited data plans but you'd need to do that anyway if you wanted to use the carrier's 5G network.

Galaxy S21: Get it for free @ Verizon

Trade in any phone at Verizon — even if it's broken — and you can get credit to use for a Galaxy S21. The newer the phone the more credit you can receive — enough to get the Galaxy S21 for free. Verizon has similar deals on the iPhone 12 or Galaxy Note 20.

The 5G network: Verizon's nationwide 5G network reaches 230 million people in 2700 cities. The carrier's Ultra Wideband service doesn't have that wide a reach — it's currently in parts of more than 70 cities.

Opensignal says Verizon 5G download speeds are equal to AT&T's with both carriers trailing T-Mobile. Verizon also has the lowest 5G availability in Opensignal's rankings. That said RootMetrics' last report rated Verizon the best for 5G availability.

Other Verizon free 5G phone deals: While Verizon's trade-in program favors current flagships you can get a completely free 5G phone from Big Red without even bothering with a trade-in.

Sign up for an unlimited plan with the carrier and activate a new line and you can get a Galaxy S20 FE for free. (You'll receive bill credits over 24 months.) The Galaxy S20 FE offers the best features of Samsung's Galaxy S20 flagships with few compromises. But it may soon be replaced by the Galaxy S21 FE  so you're not exactly getting a cutting edge phone.

The verdict: If you've got a broken phone Verizon's trade-in deal makes perfect sense for upgrading to a new 5G phone. And you may be surprised by just how much your older phone can reduce the price of a 5G upgrade.

AT&T free 5G phone deal: Good phones and a strong network

Deal: Get a free Galaxy S21 or iPhone 12 mini when you trade-in a working phone and sign up for unlimited data.

AT&T’s best free 5G phone offer: Get a free 5G phone from AT&T when you trade-in your current phone — it needs to be working — and you sign up for an unlimited plan.

The eligible phones: The free phone in question can either be a Galaxy S21 or iPhone 12 mini . Be aware though that not every trade-in device qualifies for the full discount; in other words if you have a much older phone you'll be getting your S21 or iPhone 12 mini at a reduced rate but not free.

For example the iPhone 8 or higher gets you the full trade-in value; anything older than that — as well as the iPhone SE (2020) merits just a $350 discount. A Galaxy S9 or later gets you the full rebate as well.

iPhone 12 mini: Free with any trade-in @ AT&T

AT&T will give you enough credits to get a free iPhone 12 mini when you turn in a working phone. You'll need to sign up for unlimited data with the carrier. The Galaxy S21 is also eligible under AT&T's deal.

The 5G network: AT&T 5G now reaches 250 million people with its nationwide network. The faster 5G Plus service is currently available in 38 cities and 20 venues with plans to hit 40 cities and 40 venues by the end of the year.

AT&T's 5G performance has gotten high marks from network testing firms with RootMetrics previously saying the carrier has the fastest 5G speeds. OpenSignal says that AT&T trails T-Mobile in average download speed but that its 5G reach is on the rise.

Other AT&T 5G phone deals: AT&T doesn’t have any other free promotions at the moment. But if you don't need a flagship phone AT&T offers both the Moto G Stylus 5G and the Samsung Galaxy A32 for $5 a month over 36 months. The key appeal here is that you don't have to trade in any phone — just sign up for an unlimited data plan with AT&T.

The verdict: AT&T's 5G network impresses and if you've got a phone that qualifies for the full rebate a free Galaxy S21 or iPhone 12 mini can be yours.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvaG9tZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2l0cy10aW1lLXRvLXB1dC10aGUtaGVhZHBob25lLWphY2stYmVoaW5kLXVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It's time to put the headphone jack behind us,"It's been five years since Apple took it upon itself to take the headphone jack out of its iPhones. The change brought backlash from fans but to their dismay the industry followed suit. Nowadays you'd be hard-pressed to find a flagship phone that has one.

The fact of the matter is five years have passed and that's a long time in tech. We've seen innovation in wireless audio technology come on leaps and bounds. In its infancy it was spotty but now we have codecs that can almost mimic the fidelity of lossless audio. Not to mention the extra real estate freed up by the 3.5mm headphone jack's omission.

Having personally ditched the wires back in 2016 I came back to them for this video and found them miserably cumbersome. I'm not saying there isn't a place for the headphone jack but maybe its omission from our phones is just part of the industry's wider move from analog to digital with even the charge port doubling as a point for data transfer. (And that may be the next to go.)

For the full lowdown take a look at the video above and let me know your thoughts in the comments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9ndWlkZS10by1yY3Mtd2h5LWl0LW1ha2VzLXRleHRpbmctYmV0dGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Guide to RCS and Why It Makes Texting So Much Better,"Next year Verizon will join AT&T and T-Mobile in preloading Android phones with Messages by Google as the default texting app. It's a big win for RCS the chat protocol that Google has been pushing us all to adopt. But what exactly is RCS and why do you need it?

The short version: It's an upgrade on the standard SMS/MMS texting standards that smartphones have been using from the beginning. It brings better support for all the cool add-ons we're used to in our messaging apps like read receipts and images and it adds some extra security layers too.

Yes it's a lot like iMessage from Apple—though it's not quite that simple. It's less of an app and more of a standard that apps can use.

The long version: RCS which stands for Rich Communication Services is a fundamental standard rather than an app like WhatsApp or Telegram. It requires carrier support to work which is why the backing of Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile is a big deal (it now works in dozens of countries).

RCS enables features such as read receipts. Screenshot: Google via David Nield

The Messages app on Android developed by Google is the main way to get access to everything that RCS offers—though theoretically other apps can support the standard as well. One of the big questions about the future of RCS is whether or not Apple will agree to support it putting Android users on more of an equal footing inside the Messages app on iPhones and other Apple devices.

SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) weren't really built for the modern way that we communicate through our phones and RCS tries to fix that. It adds or improves support for sharing large-resolution images and video group chatting read receipts video calls and messages that actually go beyond 160 characters.

You can add reactions to messages see when someone else is typing and drop extra elements like GIFs stickers and your current location into conversations—features you may well be used to and accept as standard in other apps.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcmVjb2RlLzIyNTY1OTI2L3BvbGljZS1sYXctZW5mb3JjZW1lbnQtZGF0YS13YXJyYW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Read the privacy policy: police can easily get your data from third parties,"If you’ve ever read a privacy policy you may have noticed a section that says something about how your data will be shared with law enforcement which means if the police demand it and have the necessary paperwork they’ll likely get it. But maybe like most American adults you don’t read privacy policies very carefully if at all. In that case you might be surprised to learn how much of your data is in the hands of third parties how much access law enforcement has to it how it might be used against you or what your rights are — if any — to prevent it.

Many of the Capitol insurrectionists might be discovering this now as cases against them are built with evidence taken from internet services like Facebook and Google. While they left a trail of digital evidence for investigators (and internet detectives) to follow not all of that data was publicly available. If you read through cases of people charged with crimes relating to the events in Washington on January 6 you’ll find the FBI also obtained internal records from various social media platforms and mobile phone carriers.

But you don’t have to be an alleged insurrectionist for law enforcement to get data about you from another company. In fact you don’t have to be suspected of a crime at all. The police are increasingly using tactics like reverse search warrants to grab the data of many people in the hope of finding their suspect among them. You might get swept up in one just because you were in the wrong place at the wrong time or looked up the wrong search term. And you might never know that you got caught in the dragnet.

“Investigators are going to these providers without a suspect and asking for a broad set of information that is not targeted in order to basically identify suspects that they didn’t already have in mind” Jennifer Granick surveillance and cybersecurity counsel for the ACLU’s speech privacy and technology project told Recode. “These more mass surveillance techniques are increasingly common.”

Basically if a company collects and stores your data then the police can probably get their hands on it. And when it comes to your digital life there’s a lot of your data held by third parties out there to obtain. Here’s how they get it.

How law enforcement buys your data no warrant needed

The good news is there are some privacy laws that govern if and how the government can get your data: The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) first enacted in 1986 established these rules.

But the law is several decades old. While it has been updated since 1986 many of its tenets don’t really reflect how we use the internet today or how much of our data stays in the hands of the companies that provide those services to us.

That means there are gray areas and loopholes and for some things the government doesn’t have to go through any legal processes at all. Law enforcement can and does purchase location data from data brokers for instance. And while location data companies claim that their data has been de-identified experts say it’s often possible to re-identify individuals.

“The notion is that if it’s available for sale then it’s okay” said Kurt Opsahl deputy executive director and general counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). “Of course one of the problems is that a lot of these data brokers are getting information without going through the consent process that you might want.”

And it’s not just location data. Facial recognition company Clearview AI’s entire business model is to sell law enforcement agencies access to its facial recognition database much of which was culled from publicly available photos Clearview scraped from the internet. Unless you live in a city or state that has outlawed facial recognition it’s currently legal for the police to pay for your face data regardless of how flawed the technology behind it may be.

This could change if something like the Fourth Amendment Is Not for Sale Act which bans law enforcement from purchasing commercially available data were to become law. But for now the loophole is open.

“One of the challenges with any technology law is technology evolves faster than the law” Opsahl said. “It is always a challenge to apply these laws to a modern setting but [ECPA] still has all these many decades later provided a solid privacy protection. There definitely could be improvements but it’s still doing good work today.”

What law enforcement can get through the courts

If you’re suspected of a crime and police are looking for evidence in your digital life then ECPA says they must have a subpoena court order or warrant before a company is allowed to provide the data they’re requesting. That is to say the company can’t just hand it over voluntarily. There are a few exceptions — for instance if there’s reason to believe there’s imminent danger or a crime is in progress. But in the case of criminal investigations those exceptions don’t apply.

Broadly the legal process that investigators have to use depends on what data they’re looking for:

Subpoena: This gives investigators what’s known as subscriber information such as your name address length of service (how long you’ve had your Facebook profile for example) log information (when you’ve made phone calls or logged into and out of your Facebook account) and credit card information.

Court order or “D” order: The D refers to 18 US Code § 2703(d) which says a court may order internet service providers to give law enforcement any records about the subscriber other than the content of their communications. So that could include who emailed you and when but not the contents of the actual email.

Search warrant: This gives law enforcement access to content itself specifically stored content which includes emails photos videos posts direct messages and location information. While the ECPA says that emails stored for over 180 days can be obtained with just a subpoena that rule dates back to before people routinely kept their emails on another company’s server (how far back does your Gmail inbox go?) or used it as a backup. At this point several courts have ruled that a warrant is necessary for email content regardless of how old the emails are and service providers generally demand a warrant before they’ll agree to hand them over.

If you want to get an idea of how often the government requests data from these companies some of them do release transparency reports that give basic details about how many requests they get what type and how many of those requests they fulfill. They also show how much those requests have increased over the years. Here’s Facebook’s transparency report here’s Google’s and here’s Apple’s. The EFF also put out a guide in 2017 showing how several tech companies respond to government requests.

You don’t have to be a suspect or involved in a crime for law enforcement to get your data

So let’s say you’ve decided that you will never commit a crime so law enforcement obtaining your data will never be an issue for you. You’re wrong.

As mentioned above your data could be included in a purchase from a data broker. Or it may be scooped up in a digital dragnet also known as a reverse search warrant where police request data about a large group of people in the hope of finding their suspect within them.

“These are novel techniques to discover things that never could have been discovered in the past and which have the capacity to rope in innocent people” Granick of the ACLU said.

Two examples of this: where you went and what you searched for. In a geofence warrant law enforcement gets information about all the devices that were in a certain area at a certain time — say where a crime occurred — then narrows them down and gets account information for the device(s) they think belong to their suspect(s). For keyword warrants police may ask a browser for all the IP addresses that searched for a certain term related to their case and then identify a possible suspect from that group.

These situations still represent a legal gray area. While some judges have called them a Fourth Amendment violation and refused the government’s requests for warrants others have allowed them. And we’ve seen at least one instance where reverse search warrants have led to the arrest of an innocent person.

You may not be told for years that your data was obtained — if you’re told at all

Another troubling aspect to this is that depending on what’s being requested and why you may never know if police requested your data from a company or if that company gave it to them. If you’re charged with a crime and that data is used as evidence against you then you’ll know. But if your data is obtained through purchase from a data broker or as part of a bulk request you might not. If a company tells you that law enforcement wants your data and gives you advance notice then you can try to fight their request yourself. But investigators can get gag orders that prevent companies from telling users anything at which point you’re left to hope that the company fights for you.

According to their transparency reports Google Apple and Facebook do appear to fight or push back sometimes — for example if they think a request is overly broad or burdensome — so not every request is successful. But that’s them. It’s not necessarily true of everyone.

“Not every provider is a Google or a Facebook that has a deep-bench legal department with serious expertise in federal surveillance law” Granick said “Some providers we don’t know what they do. Maybe they don’t do anything. That’s a real issue.”

The majority of government requests even to the biggest companies in the world result in the disclosure of at least some user data and we’ve seen cases where someone’s data was given to the government and that person didn’t know for years. For instance the Department of Justice obtained Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff’s and Eric Swalwell’s subscriber records (and that of their family members) from Apple through a grand jury subpoena. This occurred in 2017 and 2018 but the Congress members only found out about it in June 2021 when the gag order expired.

If your information is swept up in something like a reverse search warrant but you’re never identified as a suspect or charged you may never know about it at all if the company that provided it doesn’t tell you. Opsahl of the EFF said that most of the major tech companies post transparency reports and it’s considered an industry best practice to do so. That doesn’t mean they all follow it nor do they have to.

How you can prevent this

When it comes to your data held by third parties you don’t have much control or say over if and what they’ll disclose. You’re relying on laws written before the modern internet existed a judge’s interpretation of them (assuming it goes before a judge which subpoenas may not) and the companies that have your data to fight them. If you’re notified about a pending order you might be able to fight it yourself. That’s no guarantee you’ll win.

The best way to protect your data is to use services that don’t get it in the first place. Privacy concerns including the ability to communicate free from government surveillance have made encrypted messaging apps like Signal and private browsers like DuckDuckGo popular in recent years. They minimize the data they collect from users which means they don’t have much to give if investigators try to collect it. You can also ask services to delete your data from their servers or not upload it to them in the first place (assuming those are options). The FBI can’t get much from Apple’s iCloud if you haven’t uploaded anything to it.

At that point investigators will have to try to get the data they want from your device ... which is a whole other can of legal worms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL211c2ljLW5ld3MvbG9sbGFwYWxvb3phLWRhYmFieS1oaXYtYWlkcy0xMjM0OTkxMjYxL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL211c2ljLW5ld3MvbG9sbGFwYWxvb3phLWRhYmFieS1oaXYtYWlkcy0xMjM0OTkxMjYxL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lollapalooza Drops DaBaby After Homophobic Remarks,"Lollapalooza has dropped DaBaby from its Sunday lineup after the rapper has come under fire for homophobic remarks he made during his set at another music festival last weekend.

Lollapalooza’s official Twitter account posted Sunday morning that the festival celebrating its 30th anniversary with this year’s edition this weekend in Chicago “was founded on diversity inclusivity respect and love. With that in mind DaBaby will no longer be performing at Grant Park tonight.”

As part of the change the festival said Young Thug would perform at 9 p.m. on the Bud Light Seltzer Stage and G Herbo will perform at 4 p.m. on the T-Mobile Stage.

At the Rolling Loud festival in Miami on Sunday July 25 DaBaby asked fans to shine their cellphone flashlights if they “didn’t show up today with HIV/AIDS any of them deadly sexually transmitted diseases that will make you die in two to three weeks.”

The rapper known for his hit “Rockstar” and being featured on a remix of Dua Lipa’s “Levitating” went on to make more crude comments about women and gay men.

DaBaby addressed his remarks Monday on Instagram Live claiming gay and straight fans enjoyed his performance.

“I wasn’t going on a rant. That’s called a call to action. That’s what that’s called cause I’m a live performer” he added. “I’m the best live performer.”

He went on to say his gay fans don’t have HIV/AIDS” because they’re not “nasty” or “junkies.” “They got class” he said.

He apologized on Twitter on Tuesday writing “Anybody who done ever been affected by AIDS/HIV y’all got the right to be upset what I said was insensitive even though I have no intentions on offending anybody. So my apologies. But the LGBT community… I ain’t trippin on y’all do you. y’all business is y’all business.”

Still DaBaby’s continued to face criticism for his comments from a number of prominent musicians including Elton John Madonna and Questlove.

John tweeted on Wednesday that he was “shocked” to hear about DaBaby’s remarks saying such comments lead to “stigma and discrimination and is the opposite of what our world needs to fight the AIDS epidemic.” The longtime HIV/AIDS activist said musicians should bring people together.

For her part Dua Lipa who’s faced calls to remove the rapper from the “Levitating” remix said on Instagram on Monday that she’s “surprised and horrified” at his comments.

“I really don’t recognize this as the person I worked with” she added. “I know my fans know where my heart lies and that I stand 100 percent with the LGTBQ community. We need to come together to fight the stigma and ignorance around HIV/AIDS.”

Lollapalooza is expected to wrap up Sunday after kicking off Thursday in Chicago’s Grant Park. Before the festival began amid concerns about rising COVID-19 case numbers in the U.S. due to the more contagious delta variant organizers said attendees would have to show proof that they had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested negative for the disease within the last three days. Anyone who isn’t vaccinated is required to wear a mask.

The event was expected to welcome roughly 100000 daily attendees the Associated Press reported and will be Chicago’s largest gathering since the pandemic began and one of the largest gatherings in the country since March 2020."

In preparation for Take-Two's Q1'22 earnings call tomorrow I decided to chart GTA franchise revenues on a quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year basis. The results were just as eye-opening as the huge GTA V game sales graphs I put together.

According to numbers provided by Take-Two Interactive the Grand Theft Auto franchise has made $6.468 billion in revenues as of Fiscal Year 2021 (bear in mind this is total GTA revenues not just GTA V but most of if is from GTA V).

4

This eight-year span encompasses a number of milestones including the game's initial launch on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 which skyrocketed GTA earnings past $1.6 billion as well as subsequent re-releases on PS4 Xbox One and PC. These new launches also helped spark revenue and game sales growth. In November of this year Rockstar will do it again by re-releasing GTA V on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

4

Taking a closer look at the numbers shows the game owes a sizable part of its goldmine to Grand Theft Auto Online. We don't know the exact digital mix (yet) but Take-Two has routinely accounted GTA Online as one of its top-earners in microtransaction revenues.

GTA Online has helped the game grow its revenue base years after launch and other promotions like the Epic Games Store freebie--which coincided with the single-largest quarterly revenue spike since the game's launch in 2013--and the inclusion on Game Pass are also major drivers to sales and earnings.

Take-Two Interactive will reveal more info about Grand Theft Auto's earnings and sales figures during its Q1'FY22 earnings call tomorrow August 2.

We've also compiled a closer look at Red Dead Redemption 2's sales growth since launch which you can find here.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our portfolio company Swvl has recently announced that it will list on NASDAQ through a merger with a SPAC entity and will raise additional funding from PIPE investors. I have been approached by many people asking what is a PIPE deal and how does a SPAC work.

I decided to publish this post to address the queries raised.

What is a SPAC Company?

A Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) is a newly formed company with no commercial operations and it raises cash in an IPO with the sole purpose of acquiring an existing company (Target company). SPAC uses the cash or the equity of the SPAC (or both) to fund the acquisition of one or more target companies through a business combination (known as SPAC transaction). Before completing an acquisition SPACs hold no material assets other than cash; therefore they are also often referred to as “public shell companies” or “blank check companies”.

How SPACs work?

Benefits of a SPAC

Traditional IPO takes a very long time and is very expensive for smaller companies (here the Target companies). SPACs make it possible for smaller companies to go public with much more ease cost-effectively and faster. In a SPAC transaction the funds already exist (raised by sponsors) and the price is set before completing the transaction. Thus removing the price uncertainty for the Target companies and the need to gauge public demand. The Target company management also gets the benefit of partnering with the sponsors their experience and financial acumen to raise future funds.

What is a PIPE deal?

Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE Deals) refers to a private placement of shares of an already listed company to a select group of accredited investors. In simple words it is a way for companies to raise a large amount of money quickly. The PIPE investors have the advantage of buying the company shares at a discounted price. PIPE investors are large private investors (such as hedge funds mutual funds and other larger institutional investors like investment arms of large corporations) investing money in public equities. These deals are allowed only for large sophisticated investors (accredited) because of the risks involved and they (Investors) are attracted to a PIPE deal as they believe they can get a price advantage than they would get if invested directly via stock purchase in the market.

How PIPEs work?

Why PIPEs are popular

PIPE deals are popular because a) of their efficiency; especially compared to other kinds of secondary offerings and b) they are subject to less scrutiny from the regulators. Any publicly traded company can initiate a PIPE deal with an accredited investor. In a structured PIPE deal the issuing company can also issue convertible debt which is usually converted to the issuing company’s stock at the investor’s option. For such PIPE deals the purchase agreement generally contains specific pricing parameters which may include a cap on the maximum number of shares that may be issued to the PIPE investors.

PIPE and SPAC combined

PIPE deals are often seen in SPAC transactions because sponsors need to raise more money than they get in their IPO to complete the acquisition of companies that are viable for the purpose of the SPAC. These viable companies sometimes cost more than the money SPAC sponsors have in their trust account from the public fund-raising.

These PIPE investors are often given material non-public information from the SPAC about which target they’re looking to acquire. They then invest at the SPAC’s IPO price or most times at a slight discount to the IPO price.

Swvl SPAC Listing

In Swvl’s transaction the SPAC is Queen’s Gambit Growth Capital (“QGGC”). QGGC has raised $300 million in Jan’21 and added $45 million via an underwriters’ overallotment option focusing on startups in clean energy mobility and healthcare sectors.

The PIPE investors are Zain Group (Kuwait) Agility Logistics (Kuwait) and Luxor Capital (NY USA) and together they invested $100 million in QGGC taking the total funding to $445 million for the transaction.",,,,,,,,,,,,

At a higher price point than Tesla’s two newer models these veteran EVs offer a combination of the efficiency performance and luxury that originally put Tesla on the map. Below is a thorough comparison of Tesla’s Model S sedan vs. its Model X mid-sized SUV.

What is the Tesla Model S?

The Model S sedan is Tesla’s longest running EV in production to date. It made its official debut in 2012 after years as a prototype for the automaker. Since then the sporty EV has held a reign as the best selling plug-in electric in both 2015 and 2016.

Sales of the veteran Tesla have slowed since the launch of the automaker’s more cost-friendly Model 3 and Model Y EVs but the Model S still sits as a premiere sedan that offers a variety of luxury and performance for those who can afford it.

Especially following its latest refresh and the introduction of the Plaid powertrain.

What is Tesla Model X?

Tesla describes its Model X EV as a “mid-sized SUV” that currently sits as the automaker’s second longest running model on its shared assembly lines with the Model S. The two EVs also share over a quarter of the same parts although they look quite different in design.

Originally unveiled in 2012 first deliveries of the Model X didn’t begun until 2015 due to a focus on the Model S production followed by a slew of delays.

While neither of these two Tesla models saw arguably overdue overhauls to their design in 2020 the new year said otherwise. In late 2020 Tesla had announced a complete production shutdown for both models through the holidays and into the new year. This move has led toward speculation about a possible refresh of both EVs. Finally Tesla came forth and confirmed a refresh was in fact coming for both veteran models.

Performance

As the two higher end EVs currently available from Tesla both the Model S and Model X have plenty to offer drivers under their floor. Both models now come with dual motor or tri-motor AWD Plaid (AWD) options to choose from. Let’s begin with the elder Tesla’s Model S.

Model S

The least expensive version of the Model S sedan is still a powerhouse of EV achievement. The current Long Range trim can travel 405 miles on a single charge hit a top speed of 155 mph and can fire from 0-60 mph in 3.1 seconds.

Previously the Model S came in a Performance trim focused on speed but that was dropped to make way for the upcoming Plaid powertrain.

Plaid and Plaid+

In the fall of 2020 Tesla confirmed an even higher end version of its banner EV with the unveiling of its tri motor “Plaid” powertrain. In 2021 Tesla surprised customers with the announcement of the Plaid+ powertrain. This version was advertised to offer the same speed as its Plaid counterpart but with a 520+ mile range on a single charge.

While tons of Tesla disciples put in their reservations for the Plaid+ the automaker scrapped the entire trim altogether as Elon Musk declared that consumers don’t need more than 400 miles of range and the regular Plaid is “just too good.”

The Plaid was originally scheduled to arrive in late 2021 but Plaid has sinced moved around quite a bit on the calendar. Currently the Plaid Model is is scheduled to deliver in September or October although the Long Range Model S has since been pushed to February or March of 2022.

Nevertheless the Plaid specs are still quite staggering as the new EV has already shattered some track records.

The Plaid Model S has ended up with a mere 396 EPA estimated range compared to the 520+ miles originally advertised on the Plaid+. That being said it can still hit a top speed of 200 mph and travel 0-60 mph in 1.99 seconds.

Here’s the latest to get you up to speed on the whole debacle:

Model X

Similar to the Model S before Tesla’s Plaid announcement the Model X came in two different trims focused on either range or speed. With the new refresh however the Model X is now available in either dual motor AWD or a tri motor Plaid option.

The dual motor Model X Long Range can travel 360 miles on a single charge (a slight downgrade of 11 miles from the previous Long Range Plus trim). I can however hit a top speed of 155 mph… if you upgrade to the 22″ Turbine Wheels for an additional $5500.

It’s 0-60 mph acceleration of 3.8 seconds loses its head to head battle with the Long Range Model S but is still an improvement of .6 seconds compared to its previous version.

Much like the Model S Tesla has dropped the Performance trim in favor of a tri motor Model X Plaid. This version can travel an EPA estimated 340 miles and reach a top speed of 163 mph with the Turbine Wheels upgrade. The Model X Plaid can also travel 0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds.

Truthfully this feels more like a rebranding than anything as the the Plaid powertrain offers nearly the same specs as the previous Performance trim. Plaid loses one mile of estimated range in exchange for .1 seconds saved on its 0-60. The top speed of 163 mph remains the same.

Additional Features

After reading above it’s clear that either Tesla option will offer you a drivetrain performance you’re looking for to get you where you need to go. Yes it’s obvious that one option is a five seat sedan while the other is a mid-size SUV.

There are more subtle differences between the two that may end up being the deciding factor in your EV search. Here are a few comparisons of the additional features available on our two Tesla models.

First let’s compare what these two Teslas have in common. Both come with standard black interior included although the X comes with carbon fiber trim while the Model S has Ebony Wood Decor. This surrounds new yoke steering offering a (mandatory) futuristic look for drivers.

Both refreshes have also seen new horizontal touchscreen displays as well as a second display in the back seat. Both models now feature Tesla’s heat pump and chrome delete trim.

Just recently Tesla revealed both the Model S and Model X are moving to 12 volt lithium-ion batteries offering more capacity and life.

Lastly both models still come equipped with a HEPA air filtration system to prevent viruses and bacteria from entering the cabin.

Differences between the Model X and Model S

The first feature the Model X can boast over its predecessor is its doors. The current Model X comes with self presenting and closing front doors as well as Falcon Wing rear doors. The latter provide easier access to the second and possible third row seats of the interior another feature available solely on the Model X and Model Y SUV.

In addition to the extra seats the Model X hosts a best in its class cargo space of 88 cubic feet. Its cargo space is quite a bit larger than the 28 cubic feet of extra room in the Tesla Model S. The Model X also comes with a tow hitch standard capable of pulling up to 5000 lbs.

The best feature on the Model S is its tri-motor Plaid option offering the very best in range and speed.

Overall the Model S and Model X share many of the same included features sure to offer any driver comfort and intuitive functions. That being said the Model X has more to offer in terms of additional features and upgrades all inside and out of a much larger interior.

Prices

Of course performance comfort and an interior loaded with features are all important when choosing an EV like a Tesla. More often than not however you quickly find yourself wondering how much does a Tesla cost?

The bottom line may be particularly important when comparing a Model S to a Model X since these two EVs are hands down the most expensive options in Tesla’s current fleet.

Below is a detailed breakdown of each trim to offer the full spectrum of how little or how much each of these Teslas can cost.

Please note: None of the prices include destination or documentation fees taxes or federal tax rebates.

Model X

Starting with the Model X Long Range trim the most basic model including white paint and zero added features starts at $94990. If you were to add all the most expensive additional features including red paint custom interior 22″ Turbine Wheels and full self-driving capabilities (FSD) the price jumps to $121490.

Note that this price includes the six-seat interior (most expensive option) for $6500. The seven-seat option would be $3000 less while the five seat interior comes standard.

The new Plaid trim picks up just above where the high end Long Range version left off at $119990 and can go as high as $146490 including the same wheels and six-seat captain’s chair interior.

For full perspective the most basic bare bones Model X will cost you almost $95000 and can go as high as $147000 all in.

Model S

Compared to the Model X Tesla’s Model S starts at a slightly lower price and can quickly hockey stick upward as you add more performance.

Starting with the Long Range trim this Model S starts at a purchase price of $84990 completely standard. If you were to add each and every additional feature such as the red paint 21″ Arachnid Wheels custom interior and FSD capabilities for an additional $10000 you’re looking at a price of $98990. We’re just getting started on price tags too we haven’t gotten to the Plaid yet.

For a brand new white Plaid Model S with only the included features you’re looking at $129990 off the bat. Adding all available features including the add-ons above and 21″ Arachnid Wheels the Plaid Model S can cost $148990.

That’s really only $2000 more than the fully-loaded Model X Plaid. To offer additional texture you could use that money to purchase three brand new Model 3 Standard Range Plus Teslas and still have nearly $28000 leftover for upgrades.

Which to choose: Tesla Model S or the Model X?

Overall these are Tesla’s longest produced vehicles for a reason. Both helped make the automaker a household name and provide the luxury and performance many other EVs have yet to match.

In terms of overall performance the Model S in any trim stands on its own. Head to head the Model S won on paper in nearly every category except price and cargo space offering more performance value for your dollar.

That being said the Model X SUV sits as a close second especially after this latest refresh. It offers impressive performance on a larger and heavier vehicle.

The Model X is also a clear winner in additional features tendering Falcon Wing doors best in class cargo space and multiple seating options to fit five to seven passengers.

If your preference is performance (particularly speed) the Model S is the better bet. However if you prefer to get behind the wheel of an EV that can haul a lot of cargo and/or passengers while still providing great range and speed the Model X is a no brainer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vZW1lcmdpbmctZXVyb3BlLmNvbS9hZnRlci1ob3Vycy93aG8tb3ducy1uaWtvbGEtdGVzbGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who owns Nikola Tesla?,"Croatia plans to put Tesla on its euro coins and enrages Serbia with the idea.

Croatia’s central bank said it would put Nikola Tesla on its future 50 20 and 10-cent coins. The decision to feature the inventor and the pioneer of alternating current electricity on the coins came from an online poll in which Croatian citizens could vote for various designs. Tesla had won beating out the traditional cravat the Vukovar Water Tower and the Dalmatian dog.

Reactions from Serbia came hard and fast. The Serbian National Bank said the Croatian move is “usurping the cultural and scientific heritage of the Serbian people” and threatened that “appropriate actions within EU institutions will be taken” if the plan materialises.

The Croatian National Bank said that Serbia has no right to object as that right is reserved only for EU member states.

Nikola Anušić a historian and professor at the Zagreb Faculty of Philosophy says that seeing the situation in terms of provocations and appropriation is “narrow-minded.” He points out that Tesla himself stresses both his belonging to the Serbian people and loyalty to his Croatian homeland.

“The Croatian decision to feature [on the euro coins] a distinguished member of the Serbian community in Croatia can be read as well-intentioned as a message to Serbs in Croatia as an integral and historic part of Croatian society that the modern Croatian state doesn’t intend to renounce.”

Bruce Lee from the Balkans?

Croatia’s Deputy Prime Minister Boris Milošević — who like Tesla is an ethnic Serb — said he was “proud and happy” with the plan.

Croatian President Zoran Milanović was a bit less even-handed when he made a provocative statement saying that “Tesla is connected to Serbia as much as Bruce Lee.”

“The statement can justifiably be seen as a provocation that is strengthening the mistrust of the Serbian public toward the Croatian initiative” says Anušić. “Therefore I consider it politically irresponsible.”

The back and forth between the heads of state and the national banks have somewhat warmed up the tensions between the countries. In Serbian tabloids the interior minister Aleksandar Vulin linked the current issue with the Ustashe regime crimes during the Second World War.

It’s hardly the first time that Tesla’s national origins were in dispute. Both Serbia and Croatia maintain a claim to the famous inventor that lived most of his life in the United.

Occasional flare-ups of disagreement happen regularly.

Last month Elon Musk of Tesla Motors prompted a mild controversy on Twitter when he said that Nikola Tesla was born in Croatia to Serbian parents.

Interestingly or perhaps tellingly there is no factual error in Musk’s tweet. Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 to a Serbian family in the village of Smiljan which then belonged to the Austrian Empire and now to modern-day Croatia.

“It seems to me that there are no disputes about Tesla’s origins” Anušić tells Emerging Europe.

But if the facts are not in dispute then what is? Ildiko Erdei an anthropologist and professor at the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade says that it’s about nationalism.

“The nationalisation of cultural heroes is a part of the cultural politics of nationalism that wants to culturally legitimise the ethnic purity of the nation and increase the symbolic capital of its glory” Erdei tells Emerging Europe.

Disputes over who can claim important historical figures are not uncommon in the Western Balkans.

A global genius

Such disputes exist over the Nobel laureate and a novelist poet and short-story writer Ivo Andrić (was he Serbian Croatian Bosnian or Yugoslavian?) and the revolutionary Goce Delčev (Bulgarian or Macedonian).

But Erdei points out that actually the disputes make using people like Tesla for political purposes easier.

“Katherine Verdery [American anthropologist] notes this process in the 1990s Eastern Europe as the ‘political life of dead bodies’ and shows that the political instrumentalisation of cultural heroes is that much more effective if there is a possibility of reading their biographies in different ways on which the current actors base the appropriation of their character and deeds” Erdei explains.

So what’s actually in dispute is which country has a legitimate “claim” on Nikola Tesla.

“Even though [Tesla’s] origin is not in dispute his dual identity is being made debatable because it doesn’t fit with the exclusivity of ethnonational identity canons in post-Yugoslavian states” Anušić explains.

Since the breakdown of Yugoslavia countries have tried to distance themselves from one another culturally but due to decades and sometimes centuries of shared history this hasn’t always been possible.

And in the case of Tesla it’s probably the most correct that he belongs to the whole world. Tesla’s inventions paved the way for modern society and he has left an indelible mark on global society and culture.

Lying on his deathbed at the age of 86 in a hotel room in New York in 1943 Tesla perhaps reflected on his successes and thought about his family childhood and his homeland. He was certainly proud of where he came from as he wrote in 1936: “Thank you very much for your much-appreciated greetings and honours; I am equally proud of my Serb origin and my Croat homeland. Long live all Yugoslavs.”

“It’s ironic that Tesla’s genius made its mark thanks to a European education and American investors and not thanks to his Serbian ethnicity and Croatian homeland” Anušić concludes.

Currently Tesla has two brand new compact vehicles under development. The first vehicle’s development is already underway and is being undertaken by Tesla China. And according to leaked information the vehicle will begin limited production by the end of this year.

Another vehicle under development is the $25000 compact car Tesla partially announced at the company’s Battery Day event.

According to Tesla this vehicle will be unveiled to the public in 2022 however it’s not yet clear when it will begin production. Tesla expects the vehicle to be the main car for the company’s upcoming robotaxi network.

The vehicle is also expected to come with Tesla’s breakthrough technologies which include the 4680 cells and a structural battery pack.

This vehicle when it comes to production is expected to be the most affordable Tesla replacing the Model 3’s current position. However according to plans Tesla shared at the Battery Day event the $25000 car is not expected to replace the Model 3 but rather will be sold side by side to the mid-sized luxury sedan.

However a new rumor according to Tesla Twitter personality and Elon Musk’s friend Whole Mars Catalog suggests that Tesla is planning to discontinue the Model 3 after the introduction of the compact car.

Whole Mars Catalog has tried to confirm this rumor directly from Elon Musk however the Tesla CEO has yet to respond.

that’s what we heard…— Whole Mars Catalog (@WholeMarsBlog) August 1 2021

Due to the significant shift in strategy the rumor is claiming and the counterintuitive nature of the claim it’s hard to believe it to be true short of Tesla or Elon Musk directly coming out and saying so.

Even Whole Mars Catalog who heard the claim from his sources doesn’t seem too convinced and is still looking to confirm the rumors either one way or the other.

Even though the Model Y is fast approaching to take its throne the Model 3 is still by far Tesla’s best-selling vehicle. And it doesn’t make sense why Tesla would decide to discontinue the largest contributor to its bottom line.

Related news: Drones Deployed Over Tesla Megapack Fire In Australia After It Went Ablaze A Day Into Operations

Some on Twitter have tried to find clues to support this claim. The first is that Tesla hasn’t said anything about giga casting for the Model 3. Giga casting if you are unfamiliar is a new manufacturing technique developed by Tesla that significantly decreases parts that make up the chassis of the vehicle.

Giga casting improves the stiffness and handling of the vehicle and decreases complexity and manufacturing cost. Tesla has said going forward all vehicles will need single-piece front and rear casting in order to have Tesla’s next-generation 4680 battery cells and a structural battery pack.

However despite Tesla integrating the single-piece rear casting on the Model Y and saying this manufacturing process will also go into the Giga Berlin and Giga Texas made Model Ys and the Cybertruck Tesla hasn’t said anything about the Model 3.

This is certainly odd however one simple explanation is Tesla does not want to shut down the Model 3 production line for an extended amount of time in order to make the significant upgrades necessary to install a giga casting machine.

Elon Musk in an interview with Sandy Munro previously stated upgrading the Model 3 chassis to a single-piece cast part is like “trying to upgrade a plane mid-flight.”

Interestingly enough Sandy Munro believes Tesla shouldn't build the upcoming $25000 compact vehicle as it will be difficult for the company to make a profit at that price point.

Another theory going around the Twitter-verse is owners are getting really high quotes from Tesla when they trade in their Model 3. Some even to the point the price they have been quoted is enough to buy a brand new Model 3 of the same trim.

This has led some to speculate Tesla is offering these high trade-in quotes cause the Model 3 will soon be discontinued which will increase its demand and cause prices to go higher.

In my opinion this seems a bit far-fetched. Let me know what you think about this theory down in the comments below.

As for me if Tesla is indeed planning to shut down the Model 3 production line after the compact vehicle begins production I believe it’s more likely to upgrade the Model 3 production line to integrate the 4680 cells and the structural battery pack.

Ultimately we will know if the rumors are true if Tesla or Elon Musk comes out and makes a comment. We will be sure to keep you posted if we hear further information. Make sure to visit our site torquenews.com/Tesla regularly to get the latest update.

It’s his sixth puzzle for The Times and his second Sunday crossword all from 2021 (you may remember “Karaoke Bars” which spun through some pop favorites). I think today’s puzzle is a lot of fun and I found it to be one of the more difficult big grids that we’ve had recently.

There’s a lot of off-kilter cluing in the fill for starters and the theme is limitless — as Mr. Stock says in his notes it’s one of those sets that looks full of possibilities until you figure out that it isn’t whether you're solving or constructing. I only got one theme entry without a majority of its squares filled; the rest I got backward with crosses. This is fine! It’s a good brainteaser and it brought to mind the “choice paralysis” that all of us capitalist rats deal with daily turned on its head.

Tricky Clues

This grid is strewn with loopy and crunchy elements that make the fill really fun. Loopy to me is a clue like “Qualification shorthand” — which makes me think of academic abbreviations on a résumé — solving to FWIW meaning “For what it’s worth” which I use when I dispense great advice that I know someone will never ever take. Crunchy entries include a lot of excellent trivia: interesting names of note botany and numismatics.

But what about those first integrated circuits from the early 1960s? Commercial integrated circuits appeared in 1961 and recently Texas Instruments published a fascinating retrospective on the development of their first few digital ICs.

TI’s original IC product on the market was the SN502 a transistor flip-flop that debuted at $450 (about $4100 today) which caught the interest of NASA engineers who asked for logic functions with a higher performance level. The response was the development of the 51 series of logic chips whose innovation included on-chip interconnects replacing the hand interconnects of the SN502. Their RCTL logic gave enough performance and reliability for NASA to use and in late 1963 the Explorer 18 craft carried a telemetry system using the SN510 and SN514 chips into orbit. 52 and 53 series chips quickly followed then in 1964 the 54 series TTL chips which along with their plastic-encapsulated 74 series equivalents are still available today.

Considering that in 1961 the bleeding edge of integrated circuit logic technology was a two-transistor chip with hand interconnects it seems scarcely conceivable that by ten years later in 1971 the art had advanced to the point at which the first commercially available microprocessors would be produced. It’s unlikely that many of us will stumble upon any of the three-figure SN1-series logic chips but to read about them is a fascinating reminder of this pivotal moment in the history of electronics.

Free from the constraints of the en route air traffic system tower en route control can save you time and effort planning your next cross-country.

Tower en route control is an FAA program of predetermined routes that keep a flight solely within approach control airspace. Instead of working with air route traffic control centers and the coordination behind the scenes that comes with it a TEC route enables a flight to move efficiently from one city to the next. This can reduce workload for the pilot and the control facility.

The process starts with the pilot. Go to the applicable chart supplement and search the table of contents for TEC found generally at the back of the book. We’ll save you the time and tell you that TEC routes have only been designated for areas in the Northeast Northern California Southern California and parts of Texas and Louisiana.

Of these the routes in California best exemplify how a TEC can save everyone time and effort. Simply check your departure airport find the destination on the list of possibilities and the route is detailed. As a bonus the routes are also named which makes filing one quite easy. You simply file the name of the route in the flight plan and put “TEC” in the remarks. Your clearance will be provided by the named route much like a departure or arrival procedure. For example flying the short 25 nautical miles from Long Beach to Bob Hope Airport in Burbank filing the CSTP1 route will take you SLI V23 POPPR SMO125R SMO SMO311R SILEX.

In contrast to all this efficiency GPS navigators generally don’t store the routes by name. So be prepared to add the full list of waypoints. Sometimes that’s a simple direct-to between two airports and sometimes it’s six different points in a short 50 miles. If you’re lucky enough to be able to beam your ForeFlight or Garmin Pilot data to your GPS you’re in business because the routes are programmed in those apps.

The routes in the Northeast and Texas and Louisiana are structured more like traditional preferred routes in that you file the entire route in the flight plan and put “TEC” in the remarks section. Even here there are benefits. For precise planners knowing what to expect for your clearance and in many cases minimal reroutes is a winning strategy. The routes may not always be the most direct but predictability can be beneficial in a busy environment. When you consider that especially in the Northeast TECs function much the way preferred routes do filing one makes a lot of sense.

Altitude is also a consideration. The Texas routes specify they be flown at 5000 feet or 7000 feet while the California and Northeast routes have altitude maximums that are dependent on the type of aircraft. In no case is it higher than 10000 feet and many max out around 8000 feet. Some may also designate specific altitudes and it’s easiest to file and expect those.

Especially in California be ready for a workout. Many of the TECs specify legs and turns based on radials and distance and not named intersections. It’s great practice for VOR users and it requires some advanced knowledge when using GPS.

TECs often align with preferred routes so you may end up receiving one whether or not you ask for it. It’s yet another reason to carry a chart supplement or know where to find the information on your iPad app.

BenQ TK700STi

Short Throw 4K Gaming Projector

AUD $2595 RRP

What was once the niche domain of teens loitering in gaming arcades has now become mainstream. Modern gaming has grown into an industry reportedly worth over US $150billion in 2020. If you needed proof of the impact this has in the AV world look no further than the fallout over the HDMI 2.1 bug that impacted many AVR OEMs this year and the lengths manufacturers went to in developing fixes. Given this ripening market it's no surprise that companies are looking to harness the unique needs of gamers in developing products.

BenQ is the latest brand to join this growing party with its new TK700STi projector aimed squarely at gamers. It is offering short-throw and large screen thrills with fast refresh rates and low input lag partnering with some gamer-specific visual trickery to give the edge in competitive environments where visual perception and every millisecond can count.

The jewel in its crown is the new Texas Instruments DLP471TE DMD chip which has been updated with a High-Speed Serial Interface (HSSI) something BenQ takes advantage of to deliver a claimed 16.67ms input lag in their 4K60Hz Fast Mode 8.33ms at 1080p 120Hz via HDMI or as low as 4ms in 1080p mode at 240Hz via PC interface. Being among the first to market with the DLP471TE-based design means that the TK700STi is currently in rarified air for input lag which gives it a distinct advantage over its competitors in gaming applications.

Similar to the established players in this segment this is not a native 4K chip and instead uses 1920x1080p micromirrors performing engineering magic on a 4K input signal to increase the output by 4 pixels per frame of resolution – with the end result a true 4096x2160p image with 8.3million distinct addressable pixels. To purists this may be a sore point but if you are set on avoiding a DMD 4K device you're going to spend a lot more and sacrifice input response which sits in contradiction to much of what BenQ are trying to achieve here – so it's a compromise worth making.

Outside of resolution we have an incredibly bright reported 3000-lumen output which is not only helpful for displaying supported HDR10/HLG content but can be used to light up a screen size anywhere from 30 to 300 inches. However BenQ recommends sticking between 60 and 200 inches for optimal image quality. Importantly as a short-throw projector you can send out a 100-inch image from as little as two metres away making this perfect for table-top applications.

The TK700STi also sports an Android TV interface via an included HDMI streamer which sits curiously in a hidden third HDMI port behind a rear cover plate. This lets you access most streaming services with the exception of Netflix which requires to be cast from a laptop or secondary streamer due to licensing concerns. Rounding off the inclusions there's a built-in 5W speaker and a slim-profile remote. The remote is the same one that's included with other BenQ models such as the recently reviewed W2700 and is easy to use with direct access to Amazon Prime and a Google voice-command button prominently placed. The TK700STi will also support 3D via a planned firmware update expected later this year.

The projector itself is a compact unit. Measuring in at 312x110x246mm and a lightweight 3.1kg it's easy to store and move which does speak towards portability for table-top use or when gaming night moves to a new location. Typical of this level of projector it has a very business feel with a basic rectangular shape and clean white/grey exterior. Physical setup requires careful planning for this unit with a small zoom range and complete absence of even a manual lens-shift leaving your only physical adjustability coming from outright placement or three levelling feet on the bottom of the projector.

There is a robust and effective 3D keystone adjustment including rotation control but this is at the expense of resolution – and critically in fast mode (which is arguably the main reason you would buy this projector) the keystone adjustments are bypassed in the pursuit of input response. Additionally the narrow throw ratio of 0.9 to 1.08 can mean there is a very small window of distance you can place the TK700STi in if you are planning to illuminate a specific screen size. If you are ceiling mounting this unit within the right throw distance or projecting onto a temporary screen or wall you will find this not to be an issue but if you have a long room with rear placement or a screen mounted very high this could cause problems.

Getting the projector up and running is wonderfully simple; there isn't much to do but plug in your source and go. The projector starts up with a (thankfully muteable) beep and briskly reaches full brightness. BenQ claim - and indeed I tested a 35dB noise level from the TK700STi which compares to a claimed 26dB for the Optoma UHD50X. This is a side-effect of the high output from the 240W lamp which requires active cooling but does get quieter if you select one of the Eco light modes. Even with my Playstation 5's Pulse3D headphones on I could hear the fan noise but in a conversational room or once you get started in your gaming this is quickly forgotten.

The menu system is a simple and uncluttered display but in some cases the options can be confusing in the way that they appear and disappear contextually depending on what you are watching. As an example despite possessing many picture settings such as Bright Living Room and Cinema when the TK700STi detects an HDR source it defaults to one of two selectable options – HDR10 or HDR10-Game (and presumably HLG although I was unable to test with any HLG content) leaving you to wonder where the other options are. It took me a while to figure out the keystone bypass in Game mode while wondering why it wasn't working for me as the menu doesn't allude to this being the case.

Once you become accustomed to these quirks it's an easy-to-use system with a surprising amount of depth in its colour management. One such here is BenQ's so-called Brilliant Colour adjustment which adds a lot of body and highlight to the image but there is also an abundant menu system for RGBWCMY saturation hue and gain adjustment. Given the market this product is aimed at I think this is likely to go unused in most cases. I suspect it's likely a default BenQ menu option that was harder to remove than to leave in and it will be nice for people intending this for media watching to know there is a level of customisability to suit your preferences if you aren't happy with the default picture.

Gamers have a specific HDR-Game setting which lets you select not only the Fast Mode (off/low/high) but also one of three purposely designed image and sound profiles for FPS (First Person Shooter) RPG (Role Playing Game) and SPG (Sports). Each will subtly adjust the colour and sound to suit the content. For example FPS mode will highlight mid-tones to help objects stand out in dark areas of the screen so that you have the best chance of finding loot or seeing enemies before they see you. RPG mode will enrich colour saturation to provide a more appealing setting for exploration and Sport mode aims to give a more 'real' colour profile to proceedings. Each of these also has an impact on the sound from the built-in speaker even if it is a meagre little thing.

Plugging in my PS5 and loading up Gran Turismo Sport it was easy to see the benefit in the response rate of the projector. Inputs felt noticeably more direct and there was a more connected sensation with what was happening on the screen. Dare I say the responsiveness helped me feel like a better driver! There was no perceptible rainbow effect with the DLP colour wheel (to my eyes) and the picture was bright vibrant and drew me into the game. Projecting onto a 130” 16:9 screen in my dedicated room with light control it was a clear image but even with my wall sconces on the bright output was such that it was still easy to play and comfortable on the eyes.

For those of you more suited to role-playing Ghost of Tsushima provides expansive and rich landscapes of feudal Japan to really test the immersion that the BenQ could provide while running in fidelity mode on the PS5. Similar to my previous experience the BenQ maximised my screen real estate really drawing me into the lush island scenery of Tsushima. The autumn colours of the first island were beautifully represented and the ability of BenQ's Brilliant Colour really shows in bringing out exceptional colour detail – claimed by BenQ at 96% of Rec 709. Turning this setting down induces a noticeable dulling of the image but leaving it on I never felt like it was giving me too much saturation in any of the colours.

One area the TK700STi did seem to struggle with (and I only noticed it in this game) was the gradients of the sky scenes. Particularly in the third section of the game where mist/snow was present. While my Sony X9000F renders this flawlessly the BenQ introduces noticeable colour banding made more obvious by the scale of the image. Turning Fast Mode on or off or moving from HDR-Game to HDR10 did not seem to induce any noticeable difference to this. It's possible that a calibration may resolve some of the issue – but again considering the market for this projector I think most users are likely to look past this.

Upping the graphical ante the newly released Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart on PS5 was a perfect opportunity to see just how sharp the BenQ could go with a true next-gen title. I can assure you that anyone concerned about the ability of a DMD to render 4K can take a sigh of relief. The game looks as glorious on the TK700STi as it does on my Sony TV. Moments like the opening sequence left me wide-eyed at Rivet and Ratchet's insanely detailed fur or Clank's brushed metal finish glinting in the light. The rich colour palette of the various dimensions are represented wonderfully the TK700STi faithfully displaying all the hallmarks of this true next-gen showpiece.

As a gaming display then the BenQ was a truly eye-popping experience. Any projector involves an inherent level of compromise but you will easily forget such thoughts when your brain is hit with 100 inch-plus versions of your favourite games in silky-smooth and twitch-responsive detail. The biggest complaint I had about the TK700STi for gaming was that I will never be able to unsee just how “cardboard cutout” the trees in Gran Turismo are. Blowing a last-gen game up to almost life-size proportions is utterly unforgiving but a credit to the ability of the TK700STi to cast such a large image in small spaces.

Many will be considering this projector for a media room so it was prudent to sample some film content to get a feel of how the TK700STi would respond. I started with the best 4K60 demo I could think of – 2019's Gemini Man. The 60Hz HFR (High Frame Rate) capture of this movie albeit less than the 120Hz cinema release along with the high contrast cinematography played right into the strengths of the TK700STi. Motion was clear and sharp and highlight detail was dazzling perfect for scenes like the motorcycle chase through Cartagena. But despite the great daylight showing when we move on to the catacombs fight scene we can see the TK700STi does have difficulty showing detail in dark scenes. This comes down to a combination of a poor black floor and the limited contrast ratio of 10000:1 compared to market rivals the Optoma UHD50X with 500000:1 or even 100000:1 for the Epson TW7100.

Moving onto something less “60fps” and 2013's Oblivion is another title that has some sweeping motion as Jack Harper's “bubble-ship” flies across the Icelandic landscapes. Again colour detail and HDR highlights are pleasing and enjoyable – reflecting the efforts of BenQ's Brilliant Colour but when faced with darker picture areas the TK700STi struggles such as reproducing the texture details in Tom Cruise's hair – an issue not helped by the 2K intermediate for this film.

Considering something more realistic and gritty and the 2017 war epic Dunkirk was a good opportunity for the BenQ to shine. The opening scene showed a lively and tangible Malo-Les-Bains streetscape the showering propaganda leaflets almost popping out of the screen – but again the BenQ is let down by the black-crush in the shadow detail as Tommy crouches by a darkened alley before being interrupted by a hail of gunfire. That's not to say that these issues make the BenQ unwatchable – far from it but it's an area where the picture output gives away the more budget price-point at odds with the expectation set by the high brightness.

THE VERDICT

Ultimately the BenQ TK700STi is quite a niche product. If you are looking to fill a media room where gaming is only a small part of a larger entertainment equation then high operating noise poor black levels and BenQs baffling relationship with Netflix on their Android TV devices make it hard to recommend the TK700STi over other more balanced options.

However if you are serious about gaming and want the fastest 4K response time on the biggest screen possible at a great price then this is completely unrivalled. For gaming its shortcomings are easily overlooked in pursuit of that almighty low lag and its brightness and short-throw make it suitable for almost any viewing environment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tLmF1LzIwMjEvMDcvMzEvd2h5LWJldGFzaGFyZXMtbmFzZGFxLTEwMC1ldGYtYXN4bmRxLWNvdWxkLWJlLWEtZ3JlYXQtaW52ZXN0bWVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX:NDQ) could be a great investment,"The Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF could be a good investment to think about.

The Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ) has a number of compelling reasons to consider it as a long-term investment.

It's one of the larger exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with net assets almost $2.1 billion.

This investment is provided by BetaShares one of the biggest providers of ETFs in Australia.

But size is not one of the key factors why it could be worth considering Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF.

Here are three to think about:

Diversification

The S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) is dominated by two industries: financials and resources. Within that there are a few sizeable businesses including Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) Westpac Banking Corp (ASX: WBC) BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) and Rio Tinto Limited (ASX: RIO).

But the Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF is very different. It has 100 non-financial businesses in its portfolio. Resources don't feature in the portfolio either. Almost half of the portfolio is classified as 'information technology' with another 19.7% in 'communication services' and 17.3% in 'consumer discretionary'.

But those classifications may not be exactly what you're thinking. Amazon and Tesla count as consumer discretionary businesses whilst Alphabet (Google) and Facebook count as communication services businesses.

Not only can an investor get exposure to 100 businesses outside of the ASX but those underlying earnings are being generated from right across the world. Think how many countries there are where people can use Google Search. Facebook is also in most countries in the world. And so on.

High-quality businesses

But this ETF isn't just about diversification for the sake of being different.

Many of the businesses in the Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF portfolio are among the best if not the best at what they do.

Apple is one of the global leaders in smartphones computers and the extra services it offers. Microsoft is very strong in numerous categories like office software cloud computing and gaming. Amazon has online retail cloud computing and so on.

However there are quite a few great companies in there not just the 'FAANG' shares.

PayPal is a huge player in the payments and online retail space. Adobe has a number of important offerings.

Broadcom Qualcomm Texas Instruments Intuit Moderna Applied Materials Advanced Micro Devices Intuitive Surgical Zoom and so on.

There are so many quality names in the portfolio that are generating strong profit growth and creating very powerful economic moats.

Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF's strong returns with a reasonable fee

Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF has an annual management fee of 0.48%.

The portfolio of quality names has produced sizeable returns over the shorter-term and longer-term.

However it's important to note that past performance is not an indicator of future performance.

Over the last 12 months the ETF has seen a net return of 31.6%. Since inception in May 2015 Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF has delivered an average return per annum of 22.5%.

However investors will have to wait and see what the next few years of returns looks like."

Hundreds of people gathered in the sweltering heat to celebrate lesbian gay bisexual transgender and other non-heterosexual orientations and identities at Harlinsdale Park.

A 30-by-60-foot rainbow flag hanging from a crane marked the entrance.

More than 80 vendors offered local crafts food drinks and information to crowds milling around the pastoral site off Franklin Road.

The festival started with a dance party to an electronic beat behind Diana Ross's classic funk-soul song ""I'm Coming Out.""

A shirtless man in a gladiator-inspired costume and a woman wearing rainbow pants and a mesh top stuffed with colored balls led the dancers.

This is first pride event in all of Williamson County said Franklin Pride president Robert McNamara.

The organization partnered with PFLAG Franklin to plan the now-annual event.

""My husband and I moved here six years ago and didn't know if there was a gay community here"" McNamara said. ""I just want to be proud of where I live. I know there are a lot of people reaching out and don't know where to go.""

A group of Brentwood High School students wearing rainbow-colored accessories excitedly bopped to the dance music.

""This is so cool. We love it"" said Ava Doyle. ""We're trying to raise awareness in our school. They know about gay pride but there's a lot of stigma with it.""

Vendors included local Democrat and Republican political organizations Cracker Barrel Truist Bank Tractor Supply and Tennessee Fairy Hair.

Music City PrEP Clinic advertised its free sexually-transmitted infection testing HIV prevention and other services. The agency is in the process of expanding its offices in East Nashville and recently reached a milestone of treating 6000 patients in the region.

""We try to destigmatize HIV and AIDS"" said Ned Siriyutwatana senior clinical manager at Music City PrEP Clinic. ""We want to encourage testing so people know where they stand. We want everyone to feel confident in themselves and get help in a way that they're comfortable with.""

Tractor Supply earned the longest lines at its booth by offering giveaways of dog toys pet beds and other items.

""This is our home"" said employee Autumn Ericksrud. ""The important thing for people to know is that Tractor Supply is very open inclusive and we're a safe fun place.""

Throughout the event ""free hugs"" were advertised and children were entertained with crafts and face painting.

PFLAG Franklin president Ginny Bailey said they focused on being as inclusive as possible welcoming all political and sexual orientations.

""There are people in rural areas that really need a place to come be visible and not worry that somebody's going to be mean to them"" Bailey said. ""That's the biggest reason we're here: To provide one day where you can come be yourself.""

The retailer which also has a store in Roanoke County near Tanglewood Mall has more than 350 stores across the country a portfolio that now includes the Salem location housed in a former Kmart building.

William Wright a regional sales director for American Freight who also grew up in the Roanoke area said the company felt it could serve Salem with its products and build a positive relationship with the community.

Wright said American Freight is known for its “everyday low prices.”

“With a warehouse-type atmosphere we’re able to buy direct from the manufacturer. It really keeps the costs low. We also have payment options that fit everyone’s budget” he said such as a program that allows customers to take home items that day after putting down $50.

The company has recently made appliances an area of focus which Wright said was a response to inquiries from customers and they are available at the Salem location.

The Salem store spans more than 25000 square feet. In addition to the furniture and appliances on display Wright said a portion of the space is used for backstock which means customers can often take home their purchases that day.

American Freight occupies a space in the former Salem Kmart which was subdivided to allow for multiple commercial tenants. Its neighbors include a Planet Fitness that opened earlier this year and a Tractor Supply Co.

American Freight is at 1357 W. Main St. in Salem. It’s open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday.

Mr J F Gamble MP president who presided said that when the sealed Order by the Ministry had been served on the milk suppliers to a number of creameries some of the suppliers were “naturally frightened because a sealed order in the past was something which must be obeyed”.

Fortified by the opinion of senior counsel the UAOS advised farmers to continue to send their milk to the creameries.

He said that the ministry had said that they would not prosecute “but would starve them out by not paying them for their milk” and that the creameries could only pay them 5 ½per gallon.

Zara Davis Ballyrobert won an award with her dog at the pet show. She was congratulated by Lyle Fleming Glenburn Veterinary.

“We call this intimidation but the farmers are not frightened” Mr Gamble declared. “The UAOS is proud of the stand Omagh farmers have taken and of the splendid example they have set.

“We can not think that the ministry will refuse to pay farmers the full price of their milk because if they [the farmers] refused to obey an order that will have meant severing their connection entirely with their own creameries leaving them idle and useless and upsetting their present system of farm economy.”

Mr Gamble added: “If the ministry presses this matter it will definitely lead to legal proceedings because we will do our utmost to see that the Omagh group of farmers get justice and fair play.”

SUPPLIES DIVERTED

Organisers Robert Wallace and James White pictured at the Loanends Presbyterian Church vintage tractor and classic car road run.

It was noted that ministry had been diverting for the past few weeks and increasing the supply of milk from a number of the creameries to the factories.

Mr Gamble commented: “From the beginning of the dispute we have informed both the ministry and Messrs Nestles that the farmers in Omagh area were quite willing to supply the factory with milk but only through their creameries.

“The minister stated very definitely that such milk would be quite unsuitable and that they must get it direct from the farmers.

“Last week some 20000 gallons of milk were supplied direct to the factory from creameries as far away as Killyman on one side and Killen and Leckpatrick on the other and next week supplies will be drawn from Enniskillen and Springfield in Co Fermanagh.

Hugh Bingham Lylehill brought his 1921 Hornsby engine and impressive display of rally plaques to the vintage event hosted by Loanends Presbyterian Church.

“So that was the answer of the factory to the creameries’ milk supply being unsuitable.”

He added: “The Omagh group of creameries can supply those requirements and there is no difference in the quality of the milk.”

He asked: “How can the ministry under present conditions justify the expenditure of petrol and lorries transporting thousands of gallons of milk a distance of 40 miles or over when the milk required was available within a few miles?”

Mr Gamble said that the UAOS had been “further advised” by senior counsel that as the order in question did not apply to milk supplied to creameries for manufacture then the milk going from these creameries to the factory was still going for manufacture.

“If compelled to so in order to secure justice for the farmers we will instruct creameries to refuse to supply the factory on the direction of the ministry after a certain date” warned Mr Gamble.",,,

Don’t panic when stocks collapse.

That investing maxim proved absolutely correct during the rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic panic of early 2020.

Remarkably shares of 57 of the 75 largest North Carolina-based public companies increased by at least 30% during the year ending June 30. Five tripled in value while another 12 doubled. The star performer was Belmont-based Piedmont Lithium which shot up more than 11-fold aided by a big contract to supply electric automaker Tesla.

Only four of the 75 stocks lost ground during that period.

We expanded this annual list from 50 companies to 75 this year reflecting the market’s increased bullishness.

A dozen companies are new to the list led by No. 7 Trane Technologies which was spun off from Ingersoll Rand. Trane is based in Dublin Ireland but senior executives work in Davidson. Five newcomers emerged after initial public offerings: nCino Driven Brands Krispy Kreme Bioventus and Fathom Holdings.

Other newcomers include companies that relocated their headquarters. Hayward Holdings moved from New Jersey Phreesia from New York and Avaya from California.

Departures included Raleigh-based BMC Stock acquired by Builders First Source and Charlotte-based Extended Stay America which was sold to Blackstone and Starwood Capital.

Old Dominion Freight Line SPX PRA Health and Cree repeated as four of the best stock market performers over the past five years. PRA was acquired in July by Ireland-based Icon while PPD and Select Bancorp have also announced plans to be sold.

Klook was founded in 2014 by Bernie Xiaokang Xiong Eric Gnock Fah Ethan Lin and is based out of Central Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong with two tech hubs in Singapore and Shenzhen China. The name derived from ‘Keep Looking’ is apt for a platform that connects travelers with various activities and experiences allowing them to find and book trips all over the globe. The vast catalogue of Klook covers over a hundred thousand different experiences across various destinations across the world. Though it is a global platform a significant amount of its business is focused on the various tourist spots of Asia.

The Platform

Unlike airlines and transportation the actual bookings for tourism destinations and activities are yet to be dominated by online companies. The in-destination tourism sector is dominated mainly by small local operators who mostly utilize word of mouth for marketing and offer offline bookings only. This generates only minimal buzz and not the wide popularity for attracting more tourists.

Klook aims to penetrate this market helping users to find these destinations and promoting these activities to tourists. The platform which has a website as well as an app is dedicated to recommending trips and vacation spots across the globe for tourists. They have provided travel operators with online booking as well as redemption facilities generating traffic from travelers and tourists looking for destinations online.

The Technology

Klook helps domestic travel operators gain global exposure via their online platform. While it helps the smallest players the company as a whole is still a worldwide operation which requires top tier digital infrastructure and support. They operate on AWS Cloud platform for scalability and reliability. This helps them handle large volumes of recommendations transactions and visits regularly. They also utilize their platform to help travelers book on the go and redeem services using QR code vouchers completely digitizing the booking process

Investments And Support

The Hong Kong based platform has enjoyed massive support from investors gathering over $720 million in funding across 7 investment rounds. They are supported by giants like Sequoia Capital China Boyu Capital SoftBank Vision Fund and others. Their most recent investment round was their Series E round announced in January 2021 led by Aspex Management generating $200 Million in capital. The company aims to use this money to penetrate the western market as well as diversify their operations.

The Pandemic Effect

COVID-19 has had a negative impact on the travel sector due to the lockdowns imposed around the world. International travels dipped to a minimum and even local travels were restricted for a large period of time. During this phase Klook has streamlined their workforce by temporary leaves or headcount reduction and has also diversified its business. In April 2020 they announced their entry into the food delivery sector in Malaysia during the Movement Control Order(MCO) period.

Its latest round of funding shows good signs for the company. The investors continue to support them heavily and the ease in restrictions for many places as well as the vaccine has allowed them to operate better. Like most travel operators they aim to focus more on local travels while diversifying their businesses.

Vanessa Hampton says her primary goal along with her team at Truist has always been to put client and community first. During the pandemic that was amplified and expanded. “Our team came together to support our clients and each other” she says. “I feel like our clients saw it before but maybe now with everything everyone has gone through it’s more visible.”

Hampton who will celebrate 20 years in banking in August works with large nonprofits primarily those focusing on health care and education. Many of her clients successfully sought assistance from the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program.

“Seeing my nonprofit clients’ resiliency through the pandemic was incredible” she says adding that time and effort was required from everyone. “There were a lot of consultative conversations around applying: what the program looks like how the program is beneficial to them.”

Hampton also added a new role: leading Truist’s Women’s History Month steering committee which created 20 virtual company events. “Most of my day-to-day is with clients and business leaders; this gave me the opportunity to work with outstanding women leaders throughout the company.”

At home Hampton and her husband and daughter each claimed their own space to remain focused taking daily family walks an essential break to maintain her own energy and resilience.

“I’m a leader mother and wife” she says. “We tend to put ourselves on the back burner; even taking 30 minutes to go outside and enjoy the outdoors is an important reset.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcmVzdG9yYXRpb25uZXdzbWVkaWEuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3dpbHNvbnRpbWVzL2JhcnRvbi1zdGFkaXVtLXRvd2VyLWFsbW9zdC1yZWFkeS1mb3ItZm9vdGJhbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barton stadium tower almost ready for football - Restoration NewsMedia,"Officials say the new tower over Truist Stadium’s home grandstand will be operational in time for Barton College’s opening football game in a month.







The Bulldogs will take the field on Sept. 4 against the Newberry College Wolves at Electric Supply Company Field.

“We look forward to hosting our campus our alumni and the greater community in Truist Stadium at Electric Supply Company Field” college President Doug Searcy said in a prepared statement. “I am also very pleased with the work accomplished by our Barton team and our contracting partners to create this well-equipped and professional facility to welcome and serve our guests.”

Workers have spent several months preparing the tower for this moment.

“The ground level of the tower will include restroom facilities and a concession area” said Kathy Daughety Barton’s public relations director. “The upper level of the tower will include a press box for media as well as spaces providing support for home and visiting coaches officials and radio and TV/internet streaming production. The upper level will also include a president’s box for college guests.”

The building’s facade is being prepared for expansive glass windows overlooking the field to be installed.

CT Wilson Construction is the general contractor for the Truist Stadium project. Outdoor Aluminum was hired to install the stadium bleachers. Owens Construction provided support for concrete and hardscape work.

“There are 3200 total seats in the stadium for spectators” Daughety said “and there is also standing room for spectators in designated places.”

Daughety said interest in the upcoming football season has been high.

“There has been a strong response for platinum gold and silver season ticket passes for the 2021 fall season and individual game tickets for fall are now on sale” Daughety said.

Tickets are available online at www.barton.edu/football/.

Barton held a five-game season this spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic but spectators had limited access. The abbreviated term marked Barton’s first football season in 60 years.

College officials expect to open the entire stadium to be open this season. Daughety said Barton will continue to follow local and state COVID-19 guidelines for all outdoor athletic events.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3RoZWF0bGFudGF2b2ljZS5jb20vaGFuay1hYXJvbi1pbnZpdGF0aW9uYWwtYnJpbmdzLW91dC1rZW4tZ3JpZmZleS1qci1jYy1zYWJhdGhpYS1yeWFuLWhvd2FyZC1jdXJ0aXMtZ3JhbmRlcnNvbi10by10cnVpc3QtcGFyay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hank Aaron Invitational brings out Ken Griffey Jr. CC Sabathia Ryan Howard Curtis Granderson to Truist Park,"Saturday MLB and the MLBPA and the Atlanta Braves hosted the top 44 elite high school baseball players from the Hank Aaron Invitational for a special showcase game at Truist Park. The players were selected to participate based on their performance the week prior at the Jackie Robinson Training Complex in Vero Beach Fla. which hosted the bulk of this premier development experience. Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. joined the players to deliver an inspirational pre-game pep talk and encourage them in their efforts. Team Hank Aaron ended up narrowly winning the showcase with a score of 6-5 over Team Jackie Robinson.

According to a release The Hank Aaron Invitational is a special diversity-focused development experience for kids around the country held over a two-week period at the Jackie Robinson Complex for high-school-age players (13-18). The Hank Aaron Invitational is operated by MLB and the MLB Players Association and supported by the MLB-MLBPA Youth Development Foundation and USA Baseball.

Before the game CC Sabathia Ryan Howard and Curtis Granderson hosted a Players Alliance Gear for Good equipment giveaway handing out baseball and softball equipment to youth players. MLB-MLBPA Youth Development Foundation also hosted an equipment giveaway.

Last night Sabathia Granderson Howard in addition to Bob Kendrick President of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum and Michele Meyer-Shipp MLB Chief People & Culture Officer joined a Players Alliance AMPLIFIED conversation around diversity in baseball the importance of access and opportunity for youth within the sport and how Hank Aaron’s legacy is being upheld.

During the panel Granderson said: “For the players here today know it’s possible. We used to be you and Hank Aaron showed us it’s possible…After Hank Aaron broke the [home run] record a white fan was one of the first people to come out and greet him. A white fan. That shows you we are all the same. We all come together around the sport of baseball.”

Despite collecting only three hits with the final 14 hitters going down in order the Brewers edged the Atlanta Braves 2-1 at Truist Park.

The victory gave the Brewers a 5-1 record on the trip and moved them back to 20 games over .500 for the season (63-43). They are 34-19 on the road.

Veteran left-hander Brett Anderson started for the Brewers and delivered his second strong outing of the trip limiting the Braves to three hits and one run over 5⅔ innings with a walk and three strikeouts. Including his gem in Pittsburgh Anderson allowed only six hits and one run over 11⅔ innings.

""Brett was great today on a day where it’s obviously really warm out there"" said manager Craig Counsell whose team is 10-4 since the all-star break. ""He pitches with such great pace. He’s telling the other team to hit it and see what happens and he puts them in swing mode a little bit.

""He tantalizes them and get ground balls and doesn’t let the ball get in the air and it’s a fast five innings.""

BOX SCORE:Brewers 2 Braves 1

Veteran right-hander Charlie Morton had been throwing the ball well for the Braves and that trend continued in general but the Brewers had a quick strike in the first. With two down Willy Adames jumped on a first-pitch cutter and drove it out to right-center for the 13th home run since joining the Brewers on May 22 and 18th overall this season.

After that Morton settled into a groove retiring 11 consecutive batters. That streak ended with one down in the fifth inning when Lorenzo Cain legged out an infield hit to third base. Luis Urías followed with a blooper to shallow left-center that shortstop Dansby Swanson got a glove on but couldn’t snag resulting in a base hit that put runners on the corners.

Jackie Bradley Jr. grounded out to second base sending home Cain to give the Brewers a 2-0 lead. The Brewers would never put another runner on base the rest of the afternoon.

""It was a quiet offensive day for us"" Counsell said. ""Early in the game we hit a lot of balls hard. They played some great defense early in the game.

""'Lo' Cain’s base-running on the second run was really really impressive. I don’t think there’s very many players that end up on third base on that ball. Most players are between first and second it drops the end up on second. The way he saw that play is pretty special. Then the fact that he’s on third base gives us that run.""

Anderson got off to a strong start for the Brewers putting down the first six hitters before Guillermo Heredia opened the bottom of the third with a double into the left-field corner. Kevan Smith tapped out to Anderson moving Heredia to third but he was stranded there as Morton struck out and Ozzie Albies grounded out to short with first baseman Rowdy Tellez making a nice pick of Adames’ one-hop throw.

Anderson cruised through the fourth and fifth innings before finding trouble in the sixth. With one down Albies punched a single through the right side beating the shift and Jorge Soler drew a walk.

After retiring the lefty-hitting Freddie Freeman on a liner to center Anderson was replaced by right-hander John Curtiss whose debut with the Brewers the previous night went very poorly. Curtiss wasn’t helped by his defense in that outing but nevertheless allowed five runs in two-thirds of an inning including a grand slam by Swanson.

Austin Riley who struck out in both at-bats against Anderson grounded a single up the middle to score Albies and cut the Brewers’ lead to 2-1. Swanson then sent an opposite-field drive to deep right that Bradley hauled in with an over-the-shoulder catch.

""The Braves are a good lineup - especially with the way they can kind of mix and match with the trades they made over the deadline"" Anderson said. ""It’s a tough lineup. But I’m happy to get out of the heat. That’s the biggest thing for myself.

""Today it was just try to get outs as quick as I could because it was hot and I don’t want to be out there in the heat. So just try to be as efficient as possible and up until the last inning I was able to do that for the most part. Keep the ball on the ground and let my defense work behind me.

""There were some hard-hit balls but they were in the right spots. Morton did a good job. I think the time was 2½ hours so anytime you can play a getaway day get a win and play a game under 3 hours it’s a good day all around.""

Brad Boxberger retired the first two batters in Atlanta’s seventh before running into some big trouble. Smith a .180 hitter singled to right and pinch-hitter Joc Pederson took a breaking ball off his back foot to reach base.

That brought to the plate Albies who hit a hard grounder to first that Tellez deftly fielded for the third out.

Devin Williams took over in the eighth and allowed a leadoff single to left by Soler. Williams struck out Freeman on a changeup but Riley singled to left to move the potential tying run to second.

Williams left Soler there by striking out Swanson and Adam Duvall the latter on three straight changeups that Duvall swung through. Williams gave an emphatic fist pump as he walked off the mound after that one.

Josh Hader closed out the Braves in the ninth to convert the first save opportunity he was presented since July 8. With the all-star break off days on the schedule and an improved offense providing bigger leads for the most part Hader has pitched only three times in the second half.

""Our starters are just eating up innings going deep into games which saves our bullpen and the longevity part of it"" Hader said. ""We don't have guys going in in the fourth or fifth inning and using up our whole bullpen for a game. At the end of the day it starts with them. They set the tone they really do.

""The way our guys have been throwing has been fun to watch and it helps us out on the back end. We just have to keep continuing to do what we do and keep winning games.""

The showcase game offered more than a chance to play on a big league field for outfielder Elgin Bennett who played for Team Aaron. The University of Illinois commit from Georgia was inspired by representing the all-time greats who paved the way for him to play baseball.



“It’s very significant for me myself with everything they’ve been teaching us about Jackie and Hank Aaron” Bennett said. “I just feel like it’s inviting me even more to work harder and just show people what I can do on and off the baseball field.”



Marvin Freeman who spent nearly half of his 10-year career in Atlanta served as an on-field coach during the Invitational and said he felt that the players walked away with meaningful information.



“It’s just been everything that we are in coaching for” Freeman said. “We want to pass on to the next generation the things that we’ve learned -- the mistakes we’ve made some of the successes that we’ve had -- and hopefully they can avoid some of those pitfalls and traps that we had to go through -- and leapfrog over that and be a little more successful without going through those same things.”

Mayor Kenneth Nail who was at the scene with the Hanceville Fire Department said that the origin of the fire appeared to involve grease and animal by-products. The Cullman Emergency Management Agency surveyed the scene and reported that the fire did not appear to involve any hazardous materials.

In addition to Hanceville the call went out for assistance to all 26 fire departments in Cullman County with special requests for tankers to get water to the site. Crews at the scene requested additional help from multiple departments across Blount Walker and Winston Counties.

Departments known to have responded on Friday afternoon include Hanceville Garden City Cullman Vinemont/Providence Berlin Crane Hill Good Hope Joppa Bethsadia Cold Springs and Walter. The Hanceville Police Department sent its tank trailer. The Mount High and West Blount departments from Blount County also responded.

Late Friday afternoon Air Evac Lifeteam was called to the scene to provide air transport for an unspecified emergency.

A source in the fire service said that crews were having trouble combatting the fire and might attempt to contain the blaze and let it burn itself out.

A year later the Salt Lake City company has three times as many positions available.

Zions is offering certain perks to new employees including signing bonuses for select positions and the opportunity to enroll in benefits immediately instead of waiting the standard 30 days. But sometimes those enticements aren’t enough.

The $87.2 billion-asset company has seen a sharp decrease in applicants across its 11-state footprint and it is now negotiating compensation on virtually every job offer that it makes according to Trina Eyring its director of recruiting.

“This is the most challenging recruitment environment I’ve seen in my career” Eyring said.

“Everywhere I go I see ‘help wanted’ signs” she said. “Candidates today know they have bargaining power when they’re applying for jobs because there are so many different options.”

Like other companies banks are grappling with an unusually competitive labor market that is leading to higher wages and giving many prospective hires the leverage to demand a continuation of the remote-work arrangements to which so many Americans have become accustomed.

At Synovus Financial in Columbus Georgia executives are providing raises to all employees who earn less than the company’s median salary. Synovus is also providing pools of money to managers to “match or combat what’s becoming a fairly competitive landscape” Kevin Blair its president and CEO told analysts last month during the company’s quarterly earnings call.

Capital One Financial — which recently adopted a hybrid work schedule — has warned investors that “the cost of technology talent is visibly moving upward” because the demand for tech workers exceeds the supply.

Some banks are trying to get ahead of the competition for workers. Bank of America will raise its hourly minimum wage from $20 to $25 by 2025 while Synchrony Financial in Stamford Connecticut — which has already adopted a permanent remote work policy for its entire workforce — will move from a floor of $15 per hour to $20 in August.

Across the industry salaries have been climbing fast. Among the 50 largest U.S. commercial banks the median salary expense per full-time-equivalent employee rose to $148000 in the first quarter of 2021 up from nearly $129000 in the same period a year earlier according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

An analysis of the second-quarter data which is based on information that banks disclose in regulatory filings will not be available until mid-August. But the data will likely show another increase in salary expenses as banks boost wages to attract and retain workers especially those who can bring in new business to counteract persistent revenue headwinds according to Jennifer Demba an analyst at Truist Securities.

She expects wage pressure to keep building throughout the next year because “there is so much demand for revenue producers” across business lines.

“The war for talent has definitely heated up in the last several quarters” Demba said.

Economists and other observers have been waiting to see how increased access to COVID-19 vaccines will impact the labor market which was battered when the pandemic delivered widespread layoffs and double-digit unemployment rates. In June employers added 850000 jobs the highest number since August 2020.

Still companies say they continue to struggle to find workers especially lower-wage employees. Some are hopeful the situation will change in September when the end of enhanced unemployment benefits could change the calculus for many people who are currently out of the labor force.

In the banking industry hiring activity is stronger than it has been in three or four years partly because of the rapid digitization of banking which has increased the demand for technology workers and partly because of the retirement of baby boomers according to Eric Pikus head of North America global financial services at the consulting firm Korn Ferry.

To lure prospective hires and keep existing employees on board banks are granting more bonuses and equity awards ditching relocation requirements and retraining those already on the payroll he said.

“It is a red-hot job market” Pikus said.

The human resources team at The Cooperative Bank of Cape Cod in Yarmouth Port Massachusetts is feeling the effects. The $1.2 billion-asset community bank has always faced recruitment challenges because of its rural location but the struggle to find and keep talent reached a whole new level this spring said Lee Ann Hesse the bank's chief engagement officer.

The company — which employs 175 people and currently has eight job openings — recently lost an employee of eight years who decided to take a remote job in another industry for almost the same compensation Hesse said.

This week the bank plans to launch a program that will allow nearly 60% of its employees to work remotely three days per week Hesse said. “If we don’t do this we are not going to be competitive” she said.

Similar decisions are being made at Norway Savings Bank in Norway Maine. The $1.6 billion-asset bank normally has five or six job openings at this time of year but this summer it has 14 positions available including eight front-line jobs and two manager-level positions.

The bank is increasing its starting pay offering hybrid and fully remote work options and providing more flexibility than it did in the past said Richelle Wallace senior resources officer at Norway Savings.

She said in an email that the bank expects its average wage increase in 2022 to be higher than in previous years as Norway Savings seeks to keep pace with competitors. The bank also is investing in technology in an effort to become more efficient so that it can continue to grow while minimizing the addition of new employees Wallace said.

Codorus Valley Bancorp in York Pennsylvania has adopted a “long-term remote work policy” that will allow certain employees to work off-site on an as-needed basis the $2.2 billion-asset company announced in its second-quarter earnings release.

“This new employment strategy provides more work flexibility broadens the employment geographic market allows for the redeployment of office space and ensures that we remain competitive in a tightening labor market” the company said in the release.

More banks large and small may take similar stances in order to attract and retain workers said Cameron Boyd director of the financial services practice at the executive search firm Smith & Wilkinson. This month he recruited a credit analyst who initially accepted an offer from an unnamed bank but later turned it down because the employer would not offer remote work.

“The bank wanted this person in the office five days a week and this person’s current employer said ‘Not only will we pay you more to stay you can stay home to work’ ” Boyd said. “That’s the first time that I’ve had that happen where it’s directly related to remote work.”

“And we know and our clients know that if they don’t afford flexibility they’re going to lose people” he added.

At Zions job candidates have turned down positions because they would not be allowed to work from home Eyring said. She noted that the company has not made an across-the-board decision on remote work in part because it is waiting to see whether the tightness in the labor market continues.

Zions also has not made any policy changes on salaries in response to wage pressure. But such decisions could be up for consideration if the tight labor market persists according to Eyring.

“I think we’re moving right into the time that will tell if we have to offer retention bonuses to get people to stay if we have to make counter-offers if we have to increase salaries for internal equity purposes” she said.

There are bright spots for Zions where the relatively high number of available positions is due to both turnover and job creation. The pool of applicants appears to be rising in recent weeks and the time it takes to fill positions has not changed despite the recruiting challenges Eyring said. The company still fills about 80% of job openings within 60 days of posting them.

“I think we’re making progress with people who were not participating in the workforce who are now getting back to work” Eyring said.

It remains to be seen how long the tight labor market in banking will persist. But if strong economic growth continues Pikus said “I think we’ll have a good couple of years of this kind of market.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvZ29sZG1hbi1zYWNocy1yYWlzZS1wYXktanVuaW9yLWludmVzdG1lbnQtYmFua2Vycy1idXNpbmVzcy1pbnNpZGVyLTIwMjEtMDgtMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman Sachs to raise pay for junior investment bankers - Business Insider,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-raise-pay-junior-investment-bankers-business-insider-2021-08-02/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvZ29sZG1hbi1zYWNocy1yYWlzZS1wYXktanVuaW9yLWludmVzdG1lbnQtYmFua2Vycy1idXNpbmVzcy1pbnNpZGVyLTIwMjEtMDgtMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpa2luZ3MuY29tL25ld3MvamFrZS1icm93bmluZy1xdWFydGVyYmFjay10cmFpbmluZy1jYW1wLW5pZ2h0LXByYWN0aWNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jake Browning is Lone Vikings QB Available for Night Practice,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV5LmNvbS9lbl9iaC9maW5hbmNpYWwtc2VydmljZXMvaG93LWJhbmtzLWFyZS1yZWltYWdpbmluZy10aGVpci1nbG9iYWwtd29ya2ZvcmNlLWFuZC1yZW1vdGUtd29ya2luZy1zdHJhdGVnedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How banks are reimagining their global workforce and remote working strategy,"In the MENA region there are clear positive impacts on financial inclusion and the informal sector through a shift away from cash and expedited digitization of banking services. These not only improve the prospects of inclusive economic growth but have altered the way that banks communicate and engage with their stakeholders. The surge in digital banking solutions enables banks to maintain engagement with existing customers while speaking to new previously untapped segments in remote environments.

Today banks and financial institutions (FIs) in the region are embarking on the uncharted territory; freeing up office space shifting some functions and departments abroad as well as providing increased flexibility to work from home. While the opportunities are abundant managing this shift also presents a multitude of challenges – and banks must strike the right balance.

There are three fundamental pillars that banks and FIs need to consider as part of their remote working strategy. These areas bring with it its own questions. For example how do banks ensure that customer satisfaction is maintained when the nature of working — as well as the act of banking — has become more remote than ever? Additionally how do banks balance new opportunities to enhance financial inclusion while addressing the challenge of supporting vulnerable customers who do not use digital tools?

Similarly how do banks keep their workforce continuously engaged prepare them for new ways of working and help them to develop skills for their overall careers? And how will banks change their approach to source future talent – particularly now that remote working has removed national boundaries?



1. Continuing to serve customers and society in a world of remote working

As banks engage with their customers primarily through digital channels many of them must re-examine their customer journeys improve the experience and efficiency and tailor their approach to meet the priorities of their customers.

Serving vulnerable groups



Banks now have a new challenge; to realize the transformative potential of digital transformation while safeguarding the interests of vulnerable groups — such as elderly people who were traditionally reliant on branches for normal services. These vulnerable sub-groups have also been targeted in a variety of digital frauds and scams as cybercrime unleashes a new wave of threats globally.

Banks will also need to focus on their most valuable asset: their people. Training will be necessary to ensure a sufficient empathetic response particularly in cases where customers may have faced multiple levels of customer service.

Maintaining client engagement

Ongoing communications are imperative to keep customers informed engaged and help build trust. FIs must continue to adapt their customer engagement and fully utilize tools such as mobile apps “push” notifications SMS messages emails and other digital media. Ultimately using a multichannel strategy can help ensure that customers feel heard and that resolutions occur quicker.



Providing resilient payment services

While payment services infrastructures were complex even before the pandemic the COVID-19 pandemic has starkly highlighted the dependencies of societies on electronic payment services. Massive pandemic-induced growth in electronic payment systems has created significant new stress as a result of additional payment volumes and required operational changes.

In this new environment it becomes crucial to map out a comprehensive front-to-back view service create early warning systems to address payments service issues enable payment services to degrade gracefully and establish structured data-driven emergency response mechanisms. In particular customers and SME businesses will continue to seek out flexible and dependable payment services which they can access without having to visit branches or wait in telephone queues."

The UK government has announced a partnership with businesses to encourage uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine.

The scheme includes ride-sharing apps Uber and Bolt and the food delivery app Deliveroo.

The aim is to get more young people aged 18-29 vaccinated.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Several UK ride-sharing and food delivery apps are offering discounts to young people who get their COVID-19 vaccine.

Food delivery and taxi firms including Uber Bolt Deliveroo and Pizza Pilgrims will offer discounts as a part of the Government drive to have more young people take their COVID-19 vaccinations.

Uber will be sending notifications to all users in August to urge them to get the vaccine and will offer discounted rides and meals on Uber Eats for young adults who get the jab.

Bolt – another popular taxi app – will be offering free ride credit to vaccination centers.

Deliveroo will be offering vouchers to young people who get their vaccine with Pizza Pilgrims joining on a similar offer.

A Deliveroo spokesman said: ""We want to do our small part to support the NHS during the pandemic including delivering a million free meals to frontline NHS staff and vaccine centers. This is the next step in helping people get vaccinated and safely back to normal.""

Thom Elliot Pizza Pilgrims Founder said: ""By making getting your jab as easy as grabbing a pizza hopefully we can help our teams and our customers get both their first and second doses as easily and quickly as possible. Watch this space for more details.""

Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""I'm delighted that more than two-thirds of young people in England have already had a first dose of a vaccine helping to build a wall of defense around our country.

""Thank you to all the businesses who are stepping up to support this important vaccine drive. Once available please go out and take advantage of the discounts.""

The UK has a high vaccination rate with 88.4% of eligible people having received one dose and 71.8% had received two.

This particular campaign is focusing on the 33% of people aged 18-29 who have not received a first dose of the vaccine.

This campaign comes as the UK sees a decline in the recent peak in COVID-19 cases which at its peak saw almost 43000 cases of COVID-19 be diagnosed in a single day.

Restaurants ride-hailing apps and food delivery services are backing Britain’s COVID-19 vaccination drive offering discounts and even free slices of pizza to persuade young people to roll up their sleeves and get the shot.

The program announced Sunday by the Department of Health and Social Care is designed to boost the vaccination rate among adults under 30 as Britain races to inoculate as many people as possible before colder weather arrives.

While more than 90% of adults in Britain have received at least one dose of vaccine the rate for people between the ages of 18 and 30 is about 60% according to government statistics.

As he thanked businesses for helping out Health Secretary Sajid Javid urged people to “take advantage of the discounts.” Uber Bolt Deliveroo and Pizza Pilgrims are among the brands to offer incentives.

“The lifesaving vaccines not only protect you your loved ones and your community but they are helping to bring us back together by allowing you to get back to doing the things you’ve missed” he said.

Britain is not the only nation to try more carrot — and less stick — to persuade the reluctant to roll up their sleeves. U.S. President Joe Biden this week called on states and local governments to join New York and Minnesota in offering $100 rewards hoping a financial incentive will spur the hesitant to be vaccinated as the highly contagious delta variant sweeps through parts of the country.

Britain is keen to increase vaccination rates amid a surge in new infections as the government seeks to fully re-open society.

Meanwhile politicians are anxious to bolster the economy as the national furlough program which guaranteed the wages of millions of people who were unable to work due to government restrictions comes to an end.

Treasury chief Rishi Sunak is urging Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ease international travel restrictions arguing that Britain’s “draconian” rules are unnecessary given the success of the vaccination program.

The Sunday Times reported that Sunak wrote to Johnson to encourage him to let people enjoy their summer holidays while expressing concern about the impact the restrictions are having on tourism and the hospitality industry.

Johnson's Cabinet will meet later this week to review the current travel rules which require expensive COVID-19 testing for people arriving from most popular holiday destinations in Europe and force anyone coming from France to self-isolate for up to 10 days.

Uber Bolt Deliveroo and Pizza Pilgrims are among the brands that will offer incentives to encourage young people to get vaccinated.

Almost 3 million under-30s are yet to receive a first COVID vaccine dose.

""It really is for us just the right thing to do"" Gavin Smith director at Pizza Pilgrims told Sky News.

The London-based restaurant chain is hoping to convert two sites into pop-up vaccination centres where unprotected customers will receive a free slice of pizza if they get a jab.

""If that is the difference for somebody who is tight on time to come and get their jab then we're happy to give them a slice of pizza when they've had their jab"" Mr Smith said revealing that 70% of his staff who are younger than 26 are yet to be fully vaccinated.

""This is to encourage as many of our young employees as much as the general population to get their jab"" he said.

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said taxi app firm Uber will be sending reminders to all users in August encouraging them to get jabbed.

The company will offer discounted journeys for young adults who receive a vaccine as well as cheaper meals on its food delivery platform Uber Eats.

Bolt another ride-hailing app will offer ""free ride credit"" to vaccination centres following a similar scheme earlier this year when it offered £250000 worth of free rides to London vaccination facilities.

Deliveroo will give vouchers to young people who get jabbed.

A spokesman said: ""We want to do our small part to support the NHS during the pandemic including delivering a million free meals to frontline NHS staff and vaccine centres. This is the next step in helping people get vaccinated and safely back to normal.""

Health Secretary Sajid Javid urged people to ""take advantage of the discounts"" and thanked the businesses involved for ""stepping up"".

Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said there was ""strong enthusiasm"" among young people so far to get vaccinated adding: ""Please get your jabs as soon as you can and grab a bargain.""

But some scientists fear the scheme could backfire due to confusing government messaging.

The positive incentives follow suggestions from ministers that university students may need to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus to attend lectures.

""I think you could easily alienate people"" Professor Lawrence Young a specialist in viral oncology at Warwick Medical School told Sky News.

""What we've got to do I think is have much better messaging to younger folk about the benefits of vaccination for them personally and the people around them.

""What I don't understand is why aren't we being more proactive with social media and with the various celebrities that the 18 to 30-year-olds will perhaps respond to better?""

The government added: ""Companies will not ask for or hold any health data for the incentive scheme.""

Up to 30 July 46811298 people in the UK have had a first coronavirus vaccine with 38126702 double jabbed.

This means about 88.5% of adults had at least one jab and 72.1% had two.

Uber Bolt and Deliveroo among those to offer incentives for people to get the jab with more set to join soon

Young people urged to get jab to protect themselves and loved ones and support cautious return to normal life

Some of the country’s top food and travel businesses have joined the national effort to get as many people as possible vaccinated against COVID-19.

Uber Bolt and Deliveroo are among the household names who will be offering discounts and incentives to customers who get a COVID-19 vaccine and help protect the country from the virus as we continue the cautious return to normality.

Uber for example will be sending reminders to all users in August encouraging them to get the vaccine and will be offering discounted Uber rides and meals on Uber Eats for young adults who get the jab. This follows earlier Uber campaigns offering free trips to vaccination centres earlier this year and for NHS staff during the height of the pandemic.

Bolt will be offering free ride credit to vaccination centres. A similar scheme by Bolt included offering £250000 in free ride credit to London vaccination facilities earlier this year.

Other incentives being discussed could include vouchers or discount codes for people attending pop up vaccine sites and booking though the NHS social media competitions and promotional offers for restaurants.

The government is set to release further details on these partnerships in due course.

Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said:

I’m delighted that more than two-thirds of young people in England have already had a first dose of a vaccine helping to build a wall of defence around our country. Thank you to all the businesses who are stepping up to support this important vaccine drive. Once available please go out and take advantage of the discounts. The lifesaving vaccines not only protect you your loved ones and your community but they are helping to bring us back together by allowing you to get back to doing the things you’ve missed.

Companies will not ask for or hold any health data for the incentive scheme.

Jamie Heywood Uber’s Regional General Manager for Northern and Eastern Europe said:

As cities open up we all need to proceed with caution and ensure that all adults are vaccinated against COVID-19. We’re proud to be working with the government on this important campaign to encourage everyone to get their jab.

Sam Raciti Bolt’s Regional Manager for Western Europe said:

Bolt is delighted to support this campaign. Get a Bolt grab a jab get living.

A Deliveroo spokesperson said:

At Deliveroo we want to do our small part to support the NHS during the pandemic including delivering 1 million free meals to frontline NHS staff and vaccine centres. This is the next step in helping get people vaccinated and safely back to normal.

Among other companies in discussion with the government to help with the vaccine uptake is Pizza Pilgrims based in London and Oxford.

Thom Elliot Pizza Pilgrims Founder said:

We are excited to do our bit in the push to get every adult in the UK vaccinated against COVID-19. By making getting your jab as easy as grabbing a pizza hopefully we can help our teams and our customers get both their first and second doses as easily and quickly as possible. Watch this space for more details.

The government is working closely with the NHS to make it as easy as possible to get a vaccine including through ‘grab a jab’ pop-up vaccine sites across the country.

Over 600000 people were vaccinated last weekend at these walk-in clinics from London’s Tate Modern Gallery to a Primark in Bristol. Further sites have been made available this week – including at Thorpe Park in Surrey and Circus Extreme in Yorkshire.

The government and NHS are also working together to provide information and advice at every opportunity on how to get a vaccine and its benefits including through a range of partnerships with industries catering for predominantly younger audiences.

This work includes partnerships with high-profile entertainment and sports personalities on short films encouraging people to get the jab such as film stars Jim Broadbent and Thandiwe Newton and football legends Harry Redknapp and Chris Kamara. The government has also partnered with dating apps and social media platforms on adverts and incentives to get the vaccine.

Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said:

It is great to see the strong enthusiasm among young people so far to get their vaccines. Getting both doses of the jab is the most important thing you can do to protect yourself and avoid unknowingly passing the virus on to someone who may be more vulnerable to COVID-19. Thank you to the businesses who have backed this mission – please get your jabs as soon as you can and grab a bargain.

A total of 84.7 million doses have been administered in the UK with 46.7 million people receiving a first dose (88.4%) and 37.9 million people receiving both doses (71.8%). Around 67% of people aged 18 to 29 in England have already received a first dose of a vaccine.

The latest data from Public Health England ( PHE ) and Cambridge University shows that around 60000 deaths 22 million infections and 52600 hospitalisations have been prevented by vaccines up to 23 July.

Data from PHE shows COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against hospitalisation from the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. The analysis shows the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 96% effective and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is 92% effective against hospitalisation after 2 doses.

YouGov polling shows the UK continues to be one of the top nations where people are willing to have a COVID-19 vaccine or have already been vaccinated and ONS data published on 2 July shows that more than 9 in 10 (96%) adults reported positive sentiment towards the vaccine. The latest ONS data shows 90% of adults under 30 have said they have received or would get a COVID-19 vaccine.

Vaccines are available free of charge and from thousands of vaccine centres GP practices and pharmacies. Around 98% of people live within 10 miles of a vaccination centre in England and vaccinations are taking place at sites including mosques community centres and football stadiums.

Born on January 8 1954 in Cleveland OH she was the daughter of the late Carmen and Jean Cozza.

Kristen Kay Cozza Powell was beloved by all who had the privilege of knowing her and was in an elite class of her own volition.

“Kristy” as her family called her was born to be a nurse. She was protective of her two younger siblings and enjoyed taking care of them.

Kristy prided herself as being the “mother to all” and devoted her life to making others lives better. As her parents aged she spent countless hours tending to their needs even when her own health began to fail and her loyalty to those she loved will forever be unmatched.

Since her “Daddy” was the head football coach of Yale it goes without saying how she was Yale’s biggest fan until her final hour.

With 12 years on the Orange BOE and PTA President at Race Brook School Kristy loved being around children. She went to Yale School of Nursing and was a proud member of the newborn special care unit who specialized in the “failure to thrive” infants who needed a little extra love and attention.

Her selflessness would carry into her marriage to her husband David Powell. Their engagement in the nursery with her holding two boys would foreshadow her own life as a mother to be. Being a Navy wife was not without his challenges but the adventures around the world with her “Dave” made it special nonetheless.

As her children began to grow she opened her home to everyone and would have countless dinner parties and sleep overs for all of her sons’ friends. Anyone who walked in the door was offered her famous “magic bars” which was her signature treat along with her infectious smile.

Holiday decorating and tailgates were among her favorite times and she would often look back on those “hectic” times with such fondness. During her free time she loved to swim and never missed an episode of the Golden Girls and Everybody Loves Raymond for laughter she felt was the cure to all ailments.

Being a mother to Michael (Mikey) and Mark (Markie) or “M and M” as she called her 15 month apart bookends was by far her greatest joy and devotion. RBS Amity NDWH SRU and Lafayette College would not have been the same without her loving image and presence.

It has been said that everyone has the best: mother sister daughter niece cousin and friend; however Kristen Cozza Powell was and will continue to be unmatched for her love was truly in a league of their own.

Along with her husband Kristen leaves behind her sons Michael Powell (Patrick Bell) and Mark (Stephanie) Powell; one grandchild on the way; siblings Kathy (Anthony) Cozza Tutino and Karen (John) Cozza Pollard; nephews Eric Pollard and Christopher Pollard; niece Elizabeth Tutino; and many extended family and friends. She was predeceased by her parents-in-law Raynor and Joan Powell.

A Funeral Service will be celebrated on Friday July 30 2021 at 10:00 a.m. at Saint Peter’s Episcopal Church 71 River St. Milford. Interment will follow at Orange Center Cemetery Orange Center Road Orange.

The family is being compassionately cared for by the staff at Cody-White Funeral Home 107 Broad Street Milford CT 06460.

On Sunday's episode of the Bravo hit Gizelle Bryant and Robyn Dixon had a conversation at their work photoshoot about Mia 36 and her recent arguments with Dr. Wendy Osefo. As Robyn 42 suggested that Mia likely ""didn't really know which way to go"" due to her bond with Karen Huger Robyn wanted to arrange a time to get to know Mia without Karen. (Karen 58 had brought Mia into the fold but she also recently feuded with Gizelle during the season 6 premiere.)

""I almost feel like we probably should reach out to her"" Robyn said adding that they should ""try to get together with her on our own.""

Gizelle 50 then created a group to extend the invitation to Mia. ""Maybe like we can get together for some drinks or something"" Gizelle said. ""I'm going to say 'Hi Mia chatting with Robyn. We would love to get together for drinks.' And I'm going to say 'without Karen.'""

Gizelle noted in a confessional that Karen ""is not a good judge of character"" but that Mia ""seems nice"" and she's interested in ""getting to know her better.""

Mia later invited Karen over to her home to catch up over tea. At the time they discussed Gizelle and Robyn's drinks invitation that purposely excluded Karen.

""I'm not saying that one day moving down the road you and Gizelle won't have cocktails together but she's got to come at you a different way"" Karen said as Mia replied ""And I would absolutely go have cocktails with her but she can't put stipulations on who I can and can't bring. That's not what we're doing here.""

Robyn in turn discussed Mia's response to their invitation after an outdoor workout session with Wendy 37 and friend Askale Davis. Recalling how Mia told Robyn and Gizelle that she didn't ""have time"" to talk to them unless it pertained to business and that she could have her assistant ""pencil"" them in Robyn told Wendy and Askale that she ""couldn't let that go.""

Reading off her reply Robyn said: ""'Hi Mia. I'm quite taken aback by your rude response. Was something done to you that we are not aware of? Is this how you treat people who are trying to get to know you? What am I missing?'""

Robyn — who told her costars that she ""had nothing"" to say in response to Mia who believed she was just ""being direct"" rather than ""rude"" — theorized in a confessional that Karen ""is influencing Mia"" and wants to make her and Gizelle ""the bad guys.""

""We invited Mia because we wanted to get to know her and we were coming from a good place"" Robyn continued. ""But clearly Mia is being misguided. When you're friends with Karen Huger that's what happens.""

Toward the end of the episode the entire cast — sans Ashley Darby — were invited over to Candiace Dillard Bassett's home for a pajama-themed party. Early arrivals Karen and Robyn made small talk about their respective relationships before Gizelle entered saying to Karen: ""Hi the hater is here!""

As more of the ladies popped in they addressed whether they were ""going to be nice"" to Mia when she arrived. ""Is Mia going be nice to us?"" Wendy asked in response as Robyn added ""Her text messages were so completely rude.""

Karen then recalled the conversation she had with Mia about her heated text exchange with Gizelle and Robyn which led Gizelle to say in defense: ""I said 'without Karen' because I already know you. So the issue was for me and Robyn to get to know her. Not you her.""

Karen suggested her name ""shouldn't have been in the text"" but Gizelle countered that ""yes it should have."" Gizelle then said that Mia needed to set the record straight on the situation.

Right as Mia arrived she was immersed into the discussion regarding the trio's ""choice of wording"" in the text messages. ""I'm saying it was wrong to say 'Not Karen.' Grown women don't do that because she wouldn't have brought me anyway"" Karen said as Gizelle argued ""Grown women say whose going to be invited so I chose the invitation list. Period.""

Mia chimed in ""I will own the fact that maybe I was a little bit aggressive in my response but I don't allow people to dictate or put stipulations on what I do.""

As Askale chimed in to point out Mia's ""delusion"" in the situation Mia questioned the amount of businesses she owns. Askale pointed out that she is in charge of ""several"" companies to which Mia replied: ""So you're going to tell me that you have time for people who come to you and put stipulations on how you move?""

Following Mia's attack on Askale Wendy said that ""when you're with a group of girlfriends you don't talk to your girls like that."" Candiace in turn stepped in to break up the argument.

""I think that this is not going to get solved here today but I think that there needs to be individual conversations because these are individual problems"" Candiace 34 explained. ""For now I want to play Prosecco pong.""

As the ladies gathered to play the game Mia pulled Gizelle aside to try and clear the air. ""Gizelle I really think that you know we just got off to the wrong foot"" Mia said as Gizelle disagreed ""No we didn't Mia. I was extremely nice to you. I didn't have anything bad to say to you no ill will. And out of the kindness of my heart [I] was like 'Hey let me get together with this girl to get to know her better.'""

Sophy Holland/Kelvin Bulluck/Bravo

Mia chimed in ""You did. Well what I'm saying now is that I will try with my deliverance to be better.""

Gizelle then said that she ""never"" wants Mia to text her like that again and Mia agreed to not do it.

Later in a confessional Mia acknowledged how her approach can often rub others the wrong way. ""There's probably things that I do that a lot of women are like you know what they don't really rock with me"" she admitted. ""It's something that I'm going to be working on so I'm just gonna apologize for making you feel that way honey.""

The business owned by Westport residents Chris and Rita Marcocci kicked off with a farm stand Saturday and more expansive offerings are planned over the coming weeks.

The motto of Local to Market is “Eat Well. Live Well. Do Well” a reference to the store’s plan “to create a community of consumers and producers all giving back to Connecticut charities to support those in need.” The logo of the former Remarkable Book Shop now the site of Local to Market 177 Main St.

The Good Clinic under former MinuteClinic CEO Michael Howe 68 quietly launched in February with a flagship site in a residential-commercial complex called NordHaus in bustling lower Northeast.

Good Clinic also plans sites in Eden Prairie St. Louis Park and St. Paul by December as well as 50 clinics in in several states over the next three years.

Good Clinic is a subsidiary of publicly held Mitesco an over-the-counter stock with bigger-market aspirations which recently hired investment banker E.F. Hutton to raise a yet-to-be specified sum to finance the growth of Good Clinic and other ventures.

Mitesco said it will spend about $900000 to build out and market the Nordhaus clinic with a 7.5-year lease and that it will need $50 million for the next 50.

Like MinuteClinic Good Clinic is built around nurse practitioners as primary heath care providers. It has agreements or negotiations with major insurers including Medicare.

Howe said the difference with the typical clinic-in-a-store model is that Good Clinic will provide a ""medical home"" instead of more one-off visits to treat strep throat or an earache or panic attack.

""We want the accountability of health care to be [in the hands of the patients]"" Howe said last week. ""But they need the coaches education and empathy. And study after study about the value of primary care shows that for every dollar you invest you save $13 in downstream health care costs.""

Good Clinic will locate in dense-population urban areas with a spa-like feel and wellness plans for every patient. The focus will be convenience value and satisfaction.

Amid a primary-care doctor shortage care increasingly is being delivered by physician assistants and nurses often outside traditional doctor offices.

There's lots of competition. CVS acquired Target's pharmacy business in 2015 for $1.9 billion and added MinuteClinics in many stores. Walmart Walgreens and others are in the walk-in primary-care business.

Mitesco CEO Larry Diamond 58 a Wall Street veteran who once worked for UnitedHealth Group said Good Clinic is focused on the 70% of Americans who consume 25% of the rising U.S. health care spending as opposed to the 5% who use about 50%.

Part of the Good Clinic secret sauce is an ""activation tool"" that helps determine if patients can self-manage and how providers can best work with them.

""We never knew 50% of the population is not good at self-management"" Howe said. ""Our clinicians are now armed with the information. A diabetic has 10 things to do every day. Some people struggle with that. We parse it down to the vital few that they have to do.""

Howe stayed with MinuteClinic since relocated to CVS headquarters for about three years after the 2006 acquisition.

His team designed Good Clinic around sustainable personal and virtual relationships.

Mitesco based in Minnetonka raised $15 million in preferred stock proceeds in spring 2020 following discussions between Howe and Diamond that led to acquisition of Good Clinic. Earlier Diamond and other investors acquired a near-dormant public company and changed its name and purpose to be a holding company for health startups.

Diamond said the advantage of initially capitalizing Good Clinic through a public company compared with the more traditional route of venture capital and private equity will allow retail investors to get in on the ground floor. That's where big gains often accrue.

Rob Goldman a former Piper Jaffray analyst who now runs Goldman Small Cap Research of Baltimore was paid $4000 by Mitesco to produce an introductory analysis in February.

Mitesco (ticker MITI) shares have slid since winter from 40 cents to about 20 cents; it now has a market value of $38 million. Goldman in a late-June update projects 2022 revenue of $18 million and forecasts a price of $2 per share within a year.

""MITI offers unusual upside potential"" Goldman wrote in the update.

Good Clinic senior management includes several MinuteClinic veterans: Dr. Jim Woodburn president and chief operating officer was a former medical director of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota; Dr. Rebecca Hafner-Fogarty chief medical officer and primary-care physician held a senior role at Zipnosis; and Kevin Lee Smith the chief nurse practitioner was a founder of MinuteClinic and also is a veteran of Zipnosis.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the necessity of critical infrastructure with everything from the supply chain to healthcare systems put at risk at different points over the past year-and-a-half.



Alarmingly there has been a measurable increase in the number of cyber and information security attacks on critical infrastructure over this same period. These attacks are prompting organizations to shore up their defenses and due to a cybersecurity skills shortage now is an excellent time for young professionals to consider working in cyber and information security within critical infrastructure sectors.

“Sixty-five percent of organizations report a shortage of cybersecurity staff” and “a lack of skilled/experienced personal is the top job concern among respondents” according to the 2019 Cybersecurity Workforce Study conducted by ISC².



The sixteen sectors designated as critical under the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are varied and there is a growing need within each of them for eager young professionals to pursue positions that will also help them future-proof their careers. The following four sectors weathered attacks during the pandemic and could be ideal starting points for future career development.

Financial Services Sector

The Financial Services Sector includes global corporations and entities that do everything from printing currency to digitizing finance. These efforts bring products and lines of business into the purview of cyber adversaries. Malware and ransomware as with most sectors are the most pressing threats. Indeed commercial and state-owned banks credit unions insurance companies and global financial technology firms must contend with these threats on a daily basis. While the financial sector can—and should—be seen as a hard target this doesn’t deter organized crime and nation state attacks from targeting the Financial Services Sector.



Throughout the pandemic professionals in the Financial Services Sector observed a significant increase in cyber activity focused on targeted intrusion via social engineering and on July 10 2020 the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) issued a warning about a rise in ransomware attacks on U.S. financial firms. Much of this activity related to the new normal of remote work and COVID-19-related programs and it provided opportunities for threat actors to use campaigns and scams to conduct fraud a trend which is ongoing.

Healthcare and Public Health Sector

Working in the healthcare and public health industry is rewarding. People join to help others and to support healthcare professionals who provide medicine and rehabilitate patients. The pandemic continues to put a great amount of pressure on healthcare entities in particular. For healthcare organizations to provide care their technology infrastructure must be supported.



The healthcare and public health sector has been increasingly targeted by cyber criminals and the sector remains vulnerable. On 27 September 2020 a massive ransomware attack struck healthcare giant Universal Health Services (UHS) which has hundreds of facilities across the United States and the United Kingdom. Thankfully UHS was able to respond effectively following policies and procedures and ensuring no lives were lost—but not every health system is so lucky.

As young professionals begin their careers or consider a transition looking to critical infrastructure is a prudent choice.

By default the sector can’t defend itself well against attacks as it still uses many legacy systems which are not compatible with security protections or can’t be upgraded due to their criticality for an organization such as legacy database systems. Healthcare organizations’ priority is to save lives and often legacy systems stay in place long after it is prudent from a security standpoint.



Due to the rising number of attacks this sector has a significant need for young professionals with competencies in both new and legacy systems. It’s also very rewarding to use your security competencies to contribute to saving lives.

Energy Sector

The Energy Sector supports all other critical infrastructure sectors providing energy via oil gas and electricity. As in other sectors cyber threats such as ransomware and malware can spell disaster due to the energy sector’s reliance on connected technologies: networked computer systems manage energy production distribution and monitoring.



On 9 May 2021 ransomware attackers successfully breached the corporate network of Colonial Pipeline (a U.S. fuel pipeline operator that supplies nearly half of the U.S. East Coast). In response to ensure the integrity of its operational networks Colonial Pipeline chose to shut down its operations. This led to panic buying and fuel shortages in the Southeastern United States.



Further Colonial Pipeline suffered reputational damage and shares of its stock fell. This event also affected aviation transport fare in the region. Finally this led Colonial Pipeline to pay a ransom worth $5 million in cryptocurrency to the threat actors.



To minimize the effect of cyberattacks in this sector providers require up-to-date backup systems strategic investments in cybersecurity controls intelligence gathering on potential threat actors industrywide collaboration on sharing of intelligence data and deployment of trained cybersecurity professionals (an area where most young professionals should consider) to monitor these networks and control centers.

Water and Wastewater Sector

Finally the Water and Wastewater Sector is another sector where a successful attack could result in direct loss of life. In February 2021 a hacker attempted to increase the amount of sodium hydroxide in the water supply at a water treatment facility near Tampa Florida. If successful this attack would have put the lives of everyone in the served municipality at risk. Thankfully an alert worker intervened to stop the attack.



The Water and Wastewater Sector is likely to be an overlooked sector for young professionals to consider. Specialization in water related utilities could help a young professional become an expert with dual expertise. Young professionals can point to the above attack during their interviews and the need for skilled professionals in this sector—as in the above sectors—without question.



If considering a security career in the Water and Wastewater sector surprised you it may be worth scanning the CISA list of critical infrastructure sectors to see if any other sectors also come as a surprise. You may already work in a critical sector or may be considering companies that fall within one or more sectors.



Cyber and information security threats to the critical infrastructure sectors discussed above remain serious and common and every sector of critical infrastructure will need skilled young professionals to help protect from these types of attacks. Each one of the critical infrastructure sectors has a common goal to provide services which are needed for a functioning society or the health and safety of the population.



As young professionals begin their careers or consider a transition looking to critical infrastructure is a prudent choice. Young professionals can have an impact within these important organizations and can help guide them through these increasingly treacherous times. As long as we live in a connected world pursuing work in the security of critical infrastructure entities will be an excellent career path for young professionals.

The Year of Action is a historic opportunity to transform the way the world tackles the global commitment to eliminate child malnutrition.



Breastfeeding is central to realising this commitment.



Initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of birth followed by exclusive breastfeeding for six months and continued breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond offer a powerful line of defence against all forms of child malnutrition including wasting and obesity. Breastfeeding also acts as babies’ first vaccine protecting them against many common childhood illnesses.



While there has been progress in breastfeeding rates in the last four decades – with a 50 per cent increase in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding globally – the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the fragility of those gains.



In many countries the pandemic has caused significant disruptions in breastfeeding support services while increasing the risk of food insecurity and malnutrition. Several countries have reported that producers of baby foods have compounded these risks by invoking unfounded fears that breastfeeding can transmit COVID-19 and marketing their products as a safer alternative to breastfeeding.



This year’s World Breastfeeding Week under its theme ‘Protect Breastfeeding: A Shared Responsibility’ is a time to revisit the commitments made at the start of this year by prioritizing breastfeeding-friendly environments for mothers and babies. This includes:



Ensuring the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes – established to protect mothers from aggressive marketing practices by the baby food industry – is fully implemented by governments health workers and industry.



Ensuring health care workers have the resources and information they need to effectively support mothers to breastfeed including through global efforts such as the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative and guidelines on breastfeeding counselling.

Ensuring employers allow women the time and space they need to breastfeed; including paid parental leave with longer maternity leave; safe places for breastfeeding in the workplace; access to affordable and good-quality childcare; and universal child benefits and adequate wages.

As we approach the UN Food Systems Summit in September and the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit in December governments donors civil society and the private sector all have an opportunity to make smart investments and commitments to tackle the global malnutrition crisis – including protecting promoting and supporting breastfeeding – through stronger policies programmes and actions.



Now is not the time to lower our ambitions. Now is the time to aim high. We are committed to making the Nutrition for Growth Year of Action a success by ensuring that every child’s right to nutritious safe and affordable food and adequate nutrition is realized from the beginning of life starting with breastfeeding.

MANILA Philippines — The Philippines should lure more foreign investments in the healthcare system as the country continues to fall behind in Southeast Asia.

In a discussion paper state-run think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) argued that the country has long been lagging behind neighboring countries in the region in terms of critical health outcomes and access indicators.

PIDS research fellow Valerie Ulep and research analyst Lyle Casas said this is because public health spending in the Philippines is one of the lowest in Southeast Asia.

According to the World Health Organization the Philippines spends only about 1.5 percent of its gross domestic product on health which is significantly lower than that of Thailand Vietnam Singapore and Malaysia.

Ulep and Casas also said that this is also a reflection of the longstanding challenges in terms of health financing health service delivery governance and health human resources.

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely overwhelmed the country’s healthcare system since last year prompting repeated lockdowns to avert its collapse.

To address this the authors emphasized that the government should attract domestic and foreign investments to finance and close the country’s health infrastructure gap in the medium and long term.

“This can be done by increasing the equity threshold for hospital foreign investments to 100 percent imposing additional tax breaks for hospital investments and accelerating investment approvals for health services and medical equipment among others” they said.

Data showed that the country needs 400000 hospital beds to meet the population need for hospital care or about 2.7 beds per 1000 population.

Securing more investments would also allow additional Filipinos to have timely access to primary healthcare facilities.

Last year only 50 percent of Filipinos were able to access primary health care within the standard time frame set by the government which is 30 minutes.

In terms of preparedness for public health emergencies the Philippines also received an average score of 53 percent from WHO’s International Health Regulations making the country one of the poorest performing nations in the region.

Apart from investment Ulep and Casas called on the government to adopt digital reforms in providing health services through the eHealth Systems and Services Bill to serve as the regulatory framework and to institutionalize telemedicine.

The authors likewise stressed the need to implement robust domestic reforms to liberalize the country for cross-border health integration.

“Pushing for regional health integration will be relevant to the country’s pursuit of universal health care and openness to regional integration may be a way for the domestic system to be resilient in facing disasters” they said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2luZGlhZWR1Y2F0aW9uZGlhcnkuaW4vdW5pb24taGVhbHRoLW1pbmlzdGVyLXNocmktbWFuc3VraC1tYW5kYXZpeWEtY2hhaXJzLWEtcmV2aWV3LW1lZXRpbmctd2l0aC1uYXRpb25hbC1tZWRpY2FsLWNvbW1pc3Npb24tbm1jL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Union Health Minister Shri Mansukh Mandaviya chairs a review meeting with National Medical Commission (NMC),"New Delhi: The Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Shri Mansukh Mandaviya chaired a review meeting with the National Medical Commission today. Important issues of medical education were discussed in the meeting.

As apprised by officials of NMC in the meeting efforts are underway to ensure that the National Exit Test ( NExT) will be conducted in the first half of 2023 as per the roadmap. To test the procedure and remove anxiety among medical students a Mock Run is also being planned and will be conducted in 2022. It was also discussed that the results of NExT (Step 1 and 2) will then be used for

(i) Qualifying Final M.B.B.S. Exam.

(ii) To get License to practice Modern Medicine in India.

(iii) For merit-based allocation of PG seats in Broad specialties.

During the review meeting ways to make NExT an examination of world-class standard was also discussed and deliberated. The importance of the NExt Exam lies in the fact that it will be the same for everyone whether trained in India or any part of the world and hence it will solve the problem of foreign medical graduates (FMGs) / Mutual recognition. While addressing the meeting Shri Mansukh Mandaviya emphasised that the Government of India is committed to creating quality medical education and transparent examination infrastructure and health services and is relentlessly working with all stakeholders to achieve this objective.

Debido al cierre de las tiendas físicas el ecommerce adquirió protagonismo una circunstancia que fue aprovechada por determinadas marcas para canalizar sus stocks vía online y comercializar sus productos de manera directa al público final.

Las grandes multinacionales han sido las principales enseñas que han recurrido a esta práctica; la cual dicho sea de paso no es nueva puesto que ya venían realizando ventas al consumidor final antes de la explosión de la pandemia. Una venta directa que se producía online pero también a través de sus tiendas propias.

No es Nike la marca que más canaliza sus productos a través de los canales propios

En este sentido y basándose en datos divulgados por Company Reports Statista ha elaborado una infografía que muestra cuáles son las marcas que incurren en esa práctica. Pese a que podía pensarse que la multinacional norteamericana Nike sería la firma que mayor atención prestaría al negocio directo al consumidor las estadísticas demuestran que cuando menos proporcionalmente no es ésa la marca que más canaliza sus productos a través de los canales propios.

Según esa fuente Adidas sería la marca con un mayor porcentaje de ventas directas al consumidor. Asimismo el gigante alemán evidenció durante el pasado ejercicio el correspondiente al estallido del coronavirus el mayor despegue en esa faceta pasando de un 33% de sus ventas en 2019 hasta el 41% durante el pasado año.

Under Armour del 34% de hace un par de años pasó a vender directamente al público final el 40% de su facturación

Similar evolución experimentó Under Armour que del 34% de hace un par de años pasó a vender directamente al público final el 40% de su facturación. Nike aparece en tercer lugar con un incremento menor del 32 al 35%. No obstante aquí cabe efectuar un par de consideraciones. La primera hace referencia a que el ejercicio fiscal de Nike finaliza el 31 de mayo por lo que los efectos del Covid-19 no quedan del todo reflejados en esas estadísticas. Asimismo cabe tener en cuenta que la multinacional norteamericana casi dobla en resultados a su inmediata competidora la alemana Adidas.

Basta decir al respecto que otros datos recabados por Statista muestran como solo en calzado Nike supera en facturación al agregado de sus cuatro inmediatas perseguidoras: Adidas Asics Puma y Under Armour. En el caso de Adidas se incluyen además los datos de Reebok.

Puma vende poco más de una cuarta parte al consumidor final

(Bloomberg)

Los resultados del segundo trimestre de Amazon.com más débiles de lo esperado han hecho caer la fortuna de su fundador.

El patrimonio neto de Jeff Bezos cayó 13 mil 500 millones de dólares después de que los resultados del mercado secundario del jueves no cumplieran con las expectativas de Wall Street y presagiaran el fin del aumento de las ventas impulsado por la pandemia del minorista. La caída borró el 80 por ciento de sus ganancias de riqueza durante el año.

Las acciones de Amazon cayeron un 7.2 por ciento a 3 mil 339.18 dólares a las 9:53 am en Nueva York reduciendo la fortuna del ex director ejecutivo de la compañía a 193 mil 600 millones de dólares. Sigue siendo la persona más rica del mundo según el Índice de multimillonarios de Bloomberg unos 8 mil millones de dólares por delante de Elon Musk de Tesla.

Ha sido una semana mixta para los multimillonarios tecnológicos más ricos de Estados Unidos. Si bien las ganancias prometedoras de Alphabet empresa matriz de Google impulsaron el patrimonio neto de los cofundadores Sergey Brin y Larry Page los sólidos resultados de Microsoft y Facebook no se tradujeron en un aumento de riqueza para sus accionistas multimillonarios.

Mark Zuckerberg quien pasó la semana promocionando su visión del futuro de Facebook como un “metaverso” que lo abarca todo perdió 5 mil 400 millones de dólares el jueves debido a que las acciones de la empresa de redes sociales cayeron más en dos meses por la preocupación por el crecimiento de las ventas publicitarias.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cnQubmV0LnRyL2VzcGFub2wvZWNvbm9taWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wMS90b3lvdGEtc2UtbWFudGllbmUtY29tby1sYS1jb21wYW5pYS1saWRlci1lbi12ZW50YS1kZS1hdXRvbW92aWxlcy1lbi1lbC1tdW5kby0xNjgyOTM00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toyota se mantiene como la compañía líder en venta de automóviles en el mundo,"1682934

(AA-Servicio en español)

Toyota vendió 547 millones de vehículos en el mundo en los primeros seis meses de 2021 según informó el gigante automovilista nipón.

En una nota de prensa la compañía compartió los resultados fiscales del primer semestre de este año.

La empresa señaló los efectos negativos del COVID-19 y los problemas en el suministro de chips semiconductores como a las principales causas en la disminución de las ventas globales.

Toyota incrementó sus ventas globales en un 313% en comparación con el mismo período durante el año pasado.

Las ventas en el exterior aumentaron un 365% el equivalente a 43 millones de vehículos mientras que sus ventas nacionales aumentaron un 15% o 117 millones de vehículos.

El fabricante de automóviles recalcó el impacto de la demanda hacia sus nuevos modelos en los mercados de América del Norte y China en las ventas de automóviles.

Las ventas de Toyota superaron a las del gigante alemán Volkswagen que vendió 497 de vehículos en el mismo período manteniéndose como el mayor vendedor de automóviles en el mundo.

El Ministerio Público investiga a 14 personas acusadas de integrar una organización criminal que concertó compras sobrevaloradas por más de S/18 millones en plena emergencia sanitaria.

La presunta organización según la hipótesis fiscal es liderada por Fiorella Molinelli Aristondo presidenta ejecutiva de Essalud desde el 6 de marzo de 2018 quien habría centrado las coordinaciones de las compras irregulares realizadas por la entidad. Otros seis funcionarios de la institución también están involucrados.

Entre los investigados también se encuentran siete directivos y accionistas de las empresas Tecnología Nacional e Industrial SA (Tecnasa) Importaciones Via Ayaychan SAC. y Speedymen's SAC. Una cuarta empresa Q-Medical SAC fue incluida en el allanamiento por presuntamente participar en una cotización sobrevalorada en perjuicio del Estado.

Según la fiscalía anticorrupción tres contrataciones registraron una sobrevaloración de S/18 millones.

Un dato relevante en este contexto es conocer cómo estas compañías aumentaron sus contratos durante los últimos años. De acuerdo a un análisis realizado por OjoPúblico dos de estas cuatro empresas investigadas por la fiscalía anticorrupción incrementaron sus ventas con Essalud entre el 2018 y 2020 precisamente durante la gestión de Molinelli Aristondo. El caso más resaltante es el de Importaciones Via Ayaychan S. A. C. que entre junio y noviembre de 2020 registró ventas de dispositivos médicos por más de S/19 millones aunque no tenía experiencia previa como proveedora del sector salud.

Según su partida en Registros Públicos Importaciones Via Ayaychan fue fundada en 2016 por Manuel Altamirano Ramírez y Carlos Reyes Montoya con un capital de S/30 mil. La empresa con sede en el distrito de La Victoria (Lima) registró como rubro económico el de prensa y publicidad. Antes de la pandemia había obtenido contrataciones por servicios publicitarios con otras entidades del Estado como el Poder Judicial el Ministerio de Energía y Minas y el Banco de la Nación entre otras por un total de S/1’034.537.

En junio de 2020 la empresa suscribió un contrato con Essalud para la venta de alcohol isopropílico por S/42 millones. Según el Ministerio Público un mes después en el marco de una indagación de mercado de Essalud para la adquisición de lentes antisalpicaduras Importaciones Via Ayaychan S. A. C. modificó su rubro económico agregando la venta de productos como mascarillas y lentes protectores.

En octubre logró otro contrato por la venta de lentes de seguridad por S/9 millones de los cuales al menos S/837 millones corresponden a una sobrevaloración respecto al precio del mercado de acuerdo con la investigación del Ministerio Público. La hipótesis fiscal sostiene que esta empresa coordinó con los funcionarios para adecuarse a las bases del proceso de contratación y pagó coimas para ingresar lotes de productos en mal estado a los almacenes de Essalud.

Una tercera venta de lentes protectores por S/59 millones también está en investigación por una sobrevaloración de S/49 millones según la fiscalía anticorrupción.- Después de concretar todas estas ventas Via Ayaychan S. A. C. entró en liquidación.

La fiscalía anticorrupción también plantea que un accionista de esta empresa Manuel Altamirano tenía comunicación personal con Molinelli Aristondo quien “autorizó las contrataciones directas” que hoy son materia de investigación. Además habría intervenido en la adquisición de seis tomógrafos ofrecidos por la empresa Tecnasa con una sobrevaloración de casi S/5 millones.

En el caso de los lentes protectores Importaciones Via Ayaychan vendió cada unidad hasta a S/215 cuando su precio en el mercado es de S/288. Según la Fiscalía esta empresa concertó con otro proveedor Q-Medical S. A. C. para que cotice el precio unitario de este producto en S/23 de modo que su propuesta sea bien recibida.

Q-Medical S. A. C. es una empresa fundada en 2002 por José Díaz Sandoval Christian Portugal Valenzuela y Rodolfo Pacheco Salas con un capital de S/3 mil. Según información de Registros Públicos se constituyó para importar y vender productos médicos. En setiembre de 2020 como informó OjoPúblico esta empresa importó pruebas rápidas de Covid-19 sin certificación sanitaria.

Desde marzo de 2008 hasta marzo de 2018 esta compañía suscribió contratos con Essalud por S/3 millones según información del Organismo Supervisor de las Contrataciones del Estado (Osce). A partir de esa fecha logró ventas totales por S/33 millones con el seguro social.

A diferencia de Via Ayaychan Q-Medical ha logrado ventas en el rubro médico por S/119 millones con otras instituciones públicas entre 2008 y 2021. Entre los productos más vendidos se encuentran material quirúrgico y dispositivos médicos a los hospitales Hipólito Unanue Cayetano Heredia establecimientos del Ministerio de Salud entre otros. El análisis de los datos permite identificar que las ventas a otras instituciones se incrementaron progresivamente a lo largo de los años. No obstante en el caso de Essalud hubo un crecimiento marcado a partir de 2019.

OjoPúblico intentó comunicarse con las empresas Q-Medical y Tecnasa así como con Manuel Altamirano accionista de Via Ayaychan. Sin embargo hasta el cierre de esta publicación no obtuvo respuesta. Asimismo este medio se contactó vía telefónica con la empresa Speedymen's pero el interlocutor se negó a brindarnos mayor información.

Así funcionaba la organización

De acuerdo a la Segunda Fiscalía Provincial Corporativa Especializada en Delitos de Corrupción de Funcionarios de Lima seis funcionarios de Essalud liderados por la presidenta ejecutiva de la entidad intervinieron en la compra irregular de seis tomógrafos y 779 mil lentes de seguridad contra salpicaduras. El esquema permitió favorecer a ciertos proveedores al establecer montos de dinero generar documentaciones y regularizar trámites.

La investigación fiscal inició en 2020 a partir de las escuchas legales del caso Los Gánsters de la política que involucró al congresista y líder de Podemos Perú José Luna Gálvez. Durante estos seguimientos los agentes de la División de Investigación de Delitos de Alta Complejidad (Diviac) identificaron indicios de compras irregulares en las conversaciones que mantenía el fallecido Fernando Obregón Mansilla presunto operador político de Luna Gálvez con otros interlocutores de Essalud. Esta unidad alertó al Ministerio Público que solicitó ampliar el seguimiento de las comunicaciones para el caso El Club de las Farmacéuticas.

Según la fiscalía anticorrupción Molinelli Aristondo era la persona clave en la organización al tener el control de las labores administrativas. “Habría permitido y avalado la ejecución de las actividades ilícitas previa concertación con otros funcionarios y personas ajenas a la institución” sostuvo el Ministerio Público. La presidenta ejecutiva de Essalud fue mencionada en varias comunicaciones telefónicas que dieron cuenta de una relación cercana con Manuel Altamirano accionista de Importaciones Via Ayaychan S. A. C.

Habría permitido y avalado la ejecución de las actividades ilícitas"" sostiene el Ministerio Público sobre Molinelli.

Un primer grupo incluido en la indagación está integrado por funcionarios públicos de Essalud: el gerente general de la entidad Alfredo Barredo Moyano considerado el brazo derecho de Molinelli Aristondo y Carolina Cabanillas Horna gerente de Abastecimiento de Bienes Estratégicos quien tenía a cargo el requerimiento de los bienes. Ambos firmaron los contratos con las empresas Via Ayaychan y Tecnasa.

De acuerdo a la tesis fiscal también están involucrados los funcionarios Marco Ortiz de la Cruz quien como subgerente de Adquisiciones de Bienes Estratégicos tenía a cargo la formulación y preparación de los expedientes de contratación y César Carreño Díaz gerente de la Central de Operaciones quien emitía informes favorables a las contrataciones. A ellos se suman Jorge Polanco Zevallos especialista en contrataciones y presunto encargado de revisar la documentación presentada por los proveedores favorecidos y Rafael Sotelo Zorrilla ayudante de almacén que recibió los productos en mal estado sin reportar el hecho en la institución.

El segundo grupo considerado en el esquema de la organización figuran Manuel Altamirano Ramírez accionista de Via Ayaychan y quien es considerado financista proveedor favorecido y presunto intermediario en las negociaciones con otras empresas. La fiscalía anticorrupción sostiene que Altamirano Ramírez junto al fallecido Fernando Obregón realizaron las coordinaciones para internar determinados bienes adquiridos sin controles además de realizar gestiones para conseguir la buena pro en la contratación de Tecnasa.

En este grupo de investigados también están Duilio Mesinas Chiabra y Jorge del Busto Herrera representante legal y dueño de Tecnasa respectivamente por la sobrevaloración de los tomógrafos. Además Bertha Ángeles Chumacero (esposa de Altamirano Ramírez) Alfonso Wun García José Chumaranga Santibáñez y Rocky Carrillo Gutiérrez por integrar la empresa Speedymen’s a través de la cual Vía Ayaychan realizó la importación de productos de acuerdo a la tesis fiscal.

Compras sobrevaloradas



Tres contrataciones han servido de sustento para requerir el allanamiento y descerraje de las viviendas de los involucrados. Las dos primeras están relacionadas a la compra de 779 mil lentes de seguridad contra salpicaduras por un monto de S/15 ’613.237 a Importaciones Via Ayaychan S. A. C. Cada unidad fue adquirida por Essalud en S/2150 en el primer proceso de compra y en S/18 en el segundo. Es decir hasta más de siete veces su precio estimado en el mercado. Lo que da como resultado una sobrevaloración de más de S/13 millolnes de soles.

Otra irregularidad advertida en la investigación es que Importaciones Via Ayaychan S. A. C. no tenía experiencia como proveedora del sector salud. Incluso no registró importaciones de los productos que vendió a Essalud. Según el Ministerio Público Manuel Altamirano creó esta empresa como una fachada de Speedysmen’s S. A. C. que sí importó varios lotes de lentes protectores desde China a USD 075 la unidad. Esta firma pertenece a su esposa —Bertha Ángeles Chumacero— y fue sancionada por Osce en 2015 por presentar información falsa.

El tercer contrato que sustentó los allanamientos fue el de la compra de seis tomógrafos básicos de emergencia a Tecnasa. Según la investigación fiscal inicialmente esta empresa cotizó los equipos con una sobrevaloración de un millón de soles cada uno. Sin embargo los intermediarios Manuel Altamirano y Fernando Obregón intercedieron para que la empresa bajara sus precios y gane así el proceso de contratación.

Para mantener los beneficios los intermediarios propusieron a la empresa ofrecer tres tomógrafos a precio de mercado y otros tres con una sobrevaloración. Las actualizaciones de precios coincidieron con las fechas de las comunicaciones entre Altamirano y Obregón. De acuerdo a la documentación recabada Tecnasa habría importado tres tomógrafos valorizados en USD 165.000 para venderlos a USD 391.575 el precio de un modelo superior.

En las comunicaciones la Fiscalía advirtió que Manuel Altamirano tenía un vínculo directo con Molinelli Aristondo. Incluso según las conversaciones del intermediario fue la presidenta ejecutiva quien le indicó que un funcionario de Essalud Juan José Bobadilla Aguilar había advertido la sobrevaloración. Más adelante Altamirano Ramírez reveló que Molinelli Aristondo le pidió información para retirar a este funcionario “por haber cuestionado el proceso de contratación de los tomógrafos”.

El proceso de allanamiento en las viviendas de los involucrados en el Club de las Farmacéuticas se extendió el último viernes por más de ocho horas. El fiscal Carlos Nivin Valdiviezo informó que Molinelli Aristondo —quien no estuvo presente durante las labores de la Fiscalía— será citada en los próximos días para brindar su declaración por el caso.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXJlcHVibGljYS5jby9pbnRlcm5ldC1lY29ub215L25pbnRlbmRvLXN3aXRjaC1lbmNhYmV6YS1sYS12ZW50YS1kZS1jb25zb2xhcy1kdXJhbnRlLWxvcy1wcmltZXJvcy1tZXNlcy1kZWwtYW5vLTMyMDk3NzDSAYQBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubGFyZXB1YmxpY2EuY28vaW50ZXJuZXQtZWNvbm9teS9uaW50ZW5kby1zd2l0Y2gtZW5jYWJlemEtbGEtdmVudGEtZGUtY29uc29sYXMtZHVyYW50ZS1sb3MtcHJpbWVyb3MtbWVzZXMtZGVsLWFuby0zMjA5Nzcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nintendo Switch encabeza la venta de consolas durante los primeros meses del año,"Desde su lanzamiento en 2017 ha vendido 8527 millones de unidades acercándose a las ventas récord del ‘Xbox 360’ y la ‘PlayStation 3’

La competitividad del mercado de videojuegos se ha visto superada por la consola ‘Nintendo Switch’ tras liderar las ventas en el mundo durante los primeros meses de 2021 con 686 millones de unidades vendidas según estadísticas reveladas por Ampere Games.

La novena consola desarrollada por Nintendo y conocida en el ámbito de desarrollo por su nombre código «NX» se dio a conocer en octubre de 2016 y fue lanzada mundialmente el tres de marzo de 2017. En el primer trimestre del año tuvo una variación anual de sus ventas de 12%.

Desde su lanzamiento ha vendido 8527 millones de consolas acercándose a las ventas récord del ‘Xbox 360’ y la ‘PlayStation 3’. Se espera que siga liderando el sector en lo que queda del año.

En segundo lugar se encuentra el ‘PlayStation 5’ de Sony que vendió 283 millones de consolas durante el primer trimestre para sumar un total de más de ocho millones de unidades.

Con estas cifras supera las ventas de la línea de consolas ‘Xbox Series X’ y ‘S’ fabricada por la compañía de tecnología Microsoft y que vendió 131 millones en ese mismo lapso.

Y a pesar de estar en el puesto dos de la lista este producto se ha convertido en uno de los mayores éxitos de la firma tras superar las 65 millones de ventas desde el inicio de su venta cifras que se sitúan por encima de lo que en su momento registraron consolas como ‘Xbox One’ que vendió 57 millones y ‘Xbox 360’ que llegó a 5 millones.

Videojuegos más vendidos

En la misma industria los juegos son otra línea de ganancias y competencia para las empresas tecnológicas y no todas ofrecen el mismo producto para las diferentes consolas.

En lo que respecta a todo el mercado los más vendidos son Super Mario 3D (Switch); Monster Hunter Rise (Switch); Animal Crossing: New Horizons (switch); Grand Theft Auto V (PS4); Fifa 21 (PS4); Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition (Switch); Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Switch); Ring Fit Adventure (Switch); Spider-man: iles morales (PS5).

Para PS5 los que lideran el ránking son: Spider-man: miles morales; Demon’s Souls; Marvel’s Avengers; Assassin’s Creed Valhalla y Sackboy: a big adventure.

En el caso del ‘Xbox Series’ se encuentran en los primeros lugares: Assassin’s Creed Valhalla; Little Nightmares II; Immortals: fenyx rising; Call of duty: black ops cold war y Hitman 3.

Aunque los ordenadores o PC no son consideras consolas juegos como The sims 4 y Afia: trilogy lideran el mercado."

That depends entirely on what kind of phone you want the device you have on-hand for a trade-in and — above all — the quality of the 5G coverage in your area.

You can understand why carriers are willing to part with a phone if it means more people using their networks. In the two-plus years since 5G networks started going live the major carriers have expanded aggressively bringing coverage to a wider number of people. With 5G set to be with us for years to come those same carriers want to plant their flag now and lock in subscribers. It also helps that many of these 5G phone deals require an unlimited data plan thus securing recurring revenue for the cost of a smartphone freebie.

But customers can benefit from these deals too. While we have a long way to go before 5G coverage is ubiquitous it reaches enough areas to make upgrading worth your while. And when switching to a new phone getting something for free is usually preferable to paying full price especially if you're eying one of the more expensive entries on the list of best 5G phones .

Here's a closer look at the free 5G phone offers from each phone carrier and whether they're the right fit for your needs.

T-Mobile free 5G phone deal: The most straightforward offer

Deal 1: Get a free OnePlus Nord N200 5G or Revvl V+ 5G when you trade in any functioning cell phone

Get a free OnePlus Nord N200 5G or Revvl V+ 5G when you trade in any functioning cell phone Deal 2: Get an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21 free when you trade-in a phone and sign up for a Magenta Plus unlimited plan

T-Mobile’s best free 5G phone offer: Trade in any functioning cell phone (or activate a new line of service on an eligible wireless plan) and T-Mobile will give you a free 5G phone.

The eligible phones: You have a choice of two phones under this plan — either the OnePlus Nord N200 5G or the Revvl V+ 5G.

We can't speak to the quality of the Revvl V+ which is T-Mobile's in-house brand of phones built by TCL. But we do have a OnePlus Nord N200 5G review in which we declared that this $239 phone was the best 5G value out there.

With the Nord N200 don't expect great performance or cameras that measure up to the best inexpensive camera phones like the Pixel 4a. But OnePlus did equip this phone with a 90Hz refresh rate and it lasts a long time on a charge.

No matter what phone you get in this deal you pay the sales tax up front and receive monthly bill credits for 24 months. Leave T-Mobile before then and you're on the hook for the balance of the phone.

OnePlus Nord N200 5G: Now free @ T-Mobile

Turn in any working phone to T-Mobile and the carrier will give you a free OnePlus Nord N200 5G. You'll get bill credits toward the phone spread out over 24 months.

The 5G network: T-Mobile 5G is without question the most extensive 5G network reaching more than 300 million people. T-Mobile is in the process of converting its far-reaching Extended Range 5G network into a faster Ultra Capacity 5G network with a goal toward completing that transition by year's end.

At least one testing firm already rates T-Mobile as the top-performing 5G network in the U.S. Opensignal says T-Mobile delivers faster download speeds than both AT&T and Verizon. In its reports though RootMetrics places AT&T ahead of T-Mobile in terms of speed.

Other T-Mobile free 5G phone deals: The OnePlus Nord N200 may be a good 5G value but it's hardly the flashiest phone. T-Mobile also has a deal where you can pick up an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21 for free though you have a lot more hurdles to clear.

First of all you have to trade in a relatively recent phone to get the full credit that would give you either the iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21 free. In the case of Apple phones that trade-in has to be an iPhone X or later; the iPhone 8 released at the same time as the iPhone X only nets a $730 savings. For Samsung phones you'll need a Galaxy S20 or later to reap the maximum trade-in value.

In addition to trading in a device you must sign up for a Magenta Plus unlimited plan to get a big discount on the iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21. That's T-Mobile's most expensive unlimited data plan at $85 a month though you do get truly unlimited data plus HD video streaming among other benefits.

As before the rebate value is paid out to you in bill credits spread over 24 months. You'll enjoy a much better free (or more accurately ""discounted"") phone but T-Mobile's other free 5G phone deal is a little bit more straightforward.

The verdict: Unless you need the latest and greatest device a simple trade-in can get you a OnePlus Nord N200 5G which is a perfectly fine phone for enjoying T-Mobile's 5G network.

Verizon free 5G phone deal: Generous trade-ins for good phones

Deal 1: Trade in any phone even damaged ones for credit toward an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21/Galaxy Note 20.

Trade in any phone even damaged ones for credit toward an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21/Galaxy Note 20. Deal 2: Get a free Galaxy S20 FE by activating a new line of data on an unlimited plan.

Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12 (Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Verizon’s best free 5G phone offer: Trade in your old phone even if it's damaged and get money back on your 5G phone purchase.

The eligible phones: Verizon lets you apply that credit to the four iPhone 12 models as well as any Galaxy S21 or Galaxy Note 20 device. In the case of the iPhone you can get a maximum credit of up to $1000 while Galaxy shoppers can get up to $1100 back.

As with T-Mobile you'll need a recent phone to get the biggest return though Verizon is pretty generous with its rebates. My iPhone SE from 2016 for example qualifies for a $350 credit spread out over 24 months. T-Mobile doesn't even offer a rebate when you trade in an original iPhone SE. It's also worth emphasizing that Verizon accepts broken phones something other carriers do not.

The iPhone 8 nets a savings of $700 essentially letting you get an iPhone 12 mini for free or an iPhone 12 for $99.

You'll need to sign up for one of Verizon's unlimited data plans but you'd need to do that anyway if you wanted to use the carrier's 5G network.

Galaxy S21: Get it for free @ Verizon

Trade in any phone at Verizon — even if it's broken — and you can get credit to use for a Galaxy S21. The newer the phone the more credit you can receive — enough to get the Galaxy S21 for free. Verizon has similar deals on the iPhone 12 or Galaxy Note 20.

The 5G network: Verizon's nationwide 5G network reaches 230 million people in 2700 cities. The carrier's Ultra Wideband service doesn't have that wide a reach — it's currently in parts of more than 70 cities.

Opensignal says Verizon 5G download speeds are equal to AT&T's with both carriers trailing T-Mobile. Verizon also has the lowest 5G availability in Opensignal's rankings. That said RootMetrics' last report rated Verizon the best for 5G availability.

Other Verizon free 5G phone deals: While Verizon's trade-in program favors current flagships you can get a completely free 5G phone from Big Red without even bothering with a trade-in.

Sign up for an unlimited plan with the carrier and activate a new line and you can get a Galaxy S20 FE for free. (You'll receive bill credits over 24 months.) The Galaxy S20 FE offers the best features of Samsung's Galaxy S20 flagships with few compromises. But it may soon be replaced by the Galaxy S21 FE  so you're not exactly getting a cutting edge phone.

The verdict: If you've got a broken phone Verizon's trade-in deal makes perfect sense for upgrading to a new 5G phone. And you may be surprised by just how much your older phone can reduce the price of a 5G upgrade.

AT&T free 5G phone deal: Good phones and a strong network

Deal: Get a free Galaxy S21 or iPhone 12 mini when you trade-in a working phone and sign up for unlimited data.

iPhone 12 mini (Image credit: Tom's Guide)

AT&T’s best free 5G phone offer: Get a free 5G phone from AT&T when you trade-in your current phone — it needs to be working — and you sign up for an unlimited plan.

The eligible phones: The free phone in question can either be a Galaxy S21 or iPhone 12 mini . Be aware though that not every trade-in device qualifies for the full discount; in other words if you have a much older phone you'll be getting your S21 or iPhone 12 mini at a reduced rate but not free.

For example the iPhone 8 or higher gets you the full trade-in value; anything older than that — as well as the iPhone SE (2020) merits just a $350 discount. A Galaxy S9 or later gets you the full rebate as well.

iPhone 12 mini: Free with any trade-in @ AT&T

AT&T will give you enough credits to get a free iPhone 12 mini when you turn in a working phone. You'll need to sign up for unlimited data with the carrier. The Galaxy S21 is also eligible under AT&T's deal.

The 5G network: AT&T 5G now reaches 250 million people with its nationwide network. The faster 5G Plus service is currently available in 38 cities and 20 venues with plans to hit 40 cities and 40 venues by the end of the year.

AT&T's 5G performance has gotten high marks from network testing firms with RootMetrics previously saying the carrier has the fastest 5G speeds. OpenSignal says that AT&T trails T-Mobile in average download speed but that its 5G reach is on the rise.

Other AT&T 5G phone deals: AT&T doesn’t have any other free promotions at the moment. But if you don't need a flagship phone AT&T offers both the Moto G Stylus 5G and the Samsung Galaxy A32 for $5 a month over 36 months. The key appeal here is that you don't have to trade in any phone — just sign up for an unlimited data plan with AT&T.

The verdict: AT&T's 5G network impresses and if you've got a phone that qualifies for the full rebate a free Galaxy S21 or iPhone 12 mini can be yours.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9ndWlkZS10by1yY3Mtd2h5LWl0LW1ha2VzLXRleHRpbmctYmV0dGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Guide to RCS and Why It Makes Texting So Much Better,"Next year Verizon will join AT&T and T-Mobile in preloading Android phones with Messages by Google as the default texting app. It's a big win for RCS the chat protocol that Google has been pushing us all to adopt. But what exactly is RCS and why do you need it?

The short version: It's an upgrade on the standard SMS/MMS texting standards that smartphones have been using from the beginning. It brings better support for all the cool add-ons we're used to in our messaging apps like read receipts and images and it adds some extra security layers too.

Yes it's a lot like iMessage from Apple—though it's not quite that simple. It's less of an app and more of a standard that apps can use.

The long version: RCS which stands for Rich Communication Services is a fundamental standard rather than an app like WhatsApp or Telegram. It requires carrier support to work which is why the backing of Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile is a big deal (it now works in dozens of countries).

RCS enables features such as read receipts. Screenshot: Google via David Nield

The Messages app on Android developed by Google is the main way to get access to everything that RCS offers—though theoretically other apps can support the standard as well. One of the big questions about the future of RCS is whether or not Apple will agree to support it putting Android users on more of an equal footing inside the Messages app on iPhones and other Apple devices.

SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) weren't really built for the modern way that we communicate through our phones and RCS tries to fix that. It adds or improves support for sharing large-resolution images and video group chatting read receipts video calls and messages that actually go beyond 160 characters.

You can add reactions to messages see when someone else is typing and drop extra elements like GIFs stickers and your current location into conversations—features you may well be used to and accept as standard in other apps.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yMzQyNTc1L3RlbGVjb20tbWFya2V0LXRvLXdpdG5lc3MtaHVnZS1ncm93dGgtYnktMjAyMS0yMDI3LXZlcml6b27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Telecom Market to Witness Huge Growth by 2021-2027 | Verizon Vodafone Deutsche Telekom,"Telecom Market to Witness Huge Growth by 2021-2027 | Verizon Vodafone Deutsche Telekom

VRTX,Vertex Pharmaceuticals,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA3LzMxL2JldHRlci1idXktdmVydGV4LXZzLWNyaXNwci10aGVyYXBldXRpY3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Vertex vs. CRISPR,"Vertex might be undervalued CRISPR Therapeutics might be overvalued but both are looking for a home run.

It's very common in the life sciences industry for small biotech companies to partner with larger pharmaceutical businesses. The biotech company typically has innovative treatments in the pipeline with years of clinical trials ahead of them while the pharma company generally has the cash and resources to help get through regulatory approvals and ramp up manufacturing and sales.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.91%) and CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP -4.44%) have formed a partnership for just that reason. The companies are hoping to be first to market with the groundbreaking CTX001 therapy using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to treat and perhaps cure sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT).

Comparing apples and oranges

With both companies focused on the same goal of being first to market with a CRISPR-Cas9 treatment investors should be asking ""Which stock is the better buy?"" To answer that we need to dig into some of the unique advantages these partners bring to the table:

Vertex

Market position: It's a profitable business with a durable franchise based on its highly effective treatments for cystic fibrosis (CF). The high safety and efficacy of the CF treatments coupled with a long-term patent portfolio should keep revenue and profitability high for years.

Cash: It finished last year with $6.7 billion in cash and generated more than $3 billion in free cash flow. That much cash provides a lot of optionality to fund another blockbuster or acquire another company with a later-stage pipeline.

Pipeline: It's focused on deploying all that cash to fund internal development and external partnerships. CRISPR Therapeutics is an industry-leading partner in a promising field with a solid chance of being first to market with a gene-editing treatment worth billions.

Valuation: The stock price is down 29% from its 52-week high over concerns about limited growth potential in the CF market and a decision to stop development of two early-stage pipeline candidates. As a result Vertex has a P/E ratio of less than 20 versus an average of 31 for the S&P 500.

CRISPR Therapeutics

Market position: Co-founder Emmanuelle Charpentier was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. The company's mission is ""developing transformative gene-based medicines for serious human diseases."" CTX001 is one of the first attempts to translate CRISPR research into medicine.

Cash: The company finished the first quarter with $1.8 billion in cash. In April CRISPR announced it had received an additional $900 million payment from Vertex to increase its stake in CTX001. With a first-quarter net loss of $113 million that cash infusion gives CRISPR more runway to support the years of research and development ahead before generating any sales.

Pipeline: In addition to CTX001 CRISPR has several cancer immunotherapy programs in clinical trials along with an early-stage regenerative medicine program targeting diabetes. Vertex is also a partner in a number of other CRISPR-Cas9 in-vivo (in the body) research programs.

Valuation: The stock price is up 732% from its IPO in 2016 although it's 47% off its January high which was set when the market reacted to positive clinical trial results from competitor Intellia Therapeutics. With a market cap of $8.9 billion and essentially no sales it's easy to build a case that CRISPR Therapeutics is overvalued.

And the winner is ...

Biotech and pharma companies tend to appeal to different investors and these two companies present an interesting choice if you're deciding to buy one or the other.

You might pick Vertex Pharmaceuticals if you like the idea of a strong franchise generating tons of cash with upside potential from promising investments. One way to think about Vertex: Would you like to be a limited partner in a venture capital fund having a very informed view of where to invest on the frontier of medicine? If so Vertex may be the stock for you.

You might pick CRISPR Therapeutics if you don't mind valuation concerns or price volatility and/or if you're not worried too much about a non-zero chance that the company will fail after a problem in clinical trials. One way to think about CRISPR: Would you like to be part owner of a baseball team where everyone in the lineup is swinging for the fences and you either win big or lose big? If so CRISPR may be the stock for you.

Still undecided? Then consider investing in both putting a bit more in the one you find more aligned with your investing style. Gene editing has the potential to change the way healthcare is delivered and both these companies are in the middle of that transformation. For patient buy-and-hold investors Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics could be good additions to your portfolio.",,,,,,,,,,,,

MORGANTOWN (KDKA) - Mylan is closing its Viatris manufacturing plant in Morgantown on Saturday.

Viatris says the changes are part of a restructuring plan and the research and development center will not be affected.

Nearly 1500 employees are losing their jobs as a result of the decision.

According to our news partners at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette a severance agreement had been reached.

Workers will get two weeks of pay for every year of service as well as free healthcare for the length of those payments.

Severance will be capped at 52 weeks and the minimum payout is 12 weeks regardless of years of service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3ZtZXRyb25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMzEvZW5kLW9mLWFuLWVyYS1teWxhbi13b3JrZXJzLWxlYXZlLW1vcmdhbnRvd24tcGxhbnQtd2l0aC1mb25kLW1lbW9yaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,End of an era: Mylan workers leave Morgantown plant with fond memories,"MORGANTOWN W.Va. — After more than 55 years of operation in Morgantown the oral solid dose facility formerly operated by Mylan Pharmaceuticals now Viatris has closed.

The closure eliminates an estimated 1400 workers 850 are members of the United Steelworkers Union.

Many employees like Joe Gouzd president of the United Steelworkers Union Local 8-957 reflected Friday on what the company culture was prior to the 2009 exit of founder Mike Puskar.

“Mr. Puskar walked the halls he talked to our people he talked to me” Gouzd said Friday on MetroNews “Talkline.” “He asked if there were things that needed to be done- caring sharing giving.”

Joe Gouzd President of the USW Local 8-957 speaks with @DaveWilsonMN about the Mylan plant closing. WATCH: https://t.co/yCFQ3nDJuy pic.twitter.com/0jPPubQBMr — MetroNews (@WVMetroNews) July 30 2021

Mylan completed a merger last November with Pfizer Inc.’s Upjohn unit to form Viatris. Former Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin retired at the closing. Upjohn group’s president Michael Goettler assumed the chief executive’s post at Viatris.

At the time the new company said it was targeting about $1 billion in cost cuts but hadn’t provided details right away. The combined company has about 45000 employees.

In addition to providing hundreds of jobs over the life span of the company the names Puskar Milan and Mylan are affixed to many landmarks throughout the Morgantown area.

“Mr. Puskar was able to give back folds and folds over and above what the people of West Virginia expected” Gouzd said. “He found a way in his heart through his success and determination to help people.”

According to Gouzd there are too many people that have worked at the plant and family members who have benefited from those jobs that the name will live on.

“Mylan Pharmaceuticals will never dissolve” Gouzd said. “Mr. Puskar’s legacy will never be erased- we stand proud we’re Mylan Pharmaceuticals.”

Puskar’s daughter Johanna has watched Mylan Pharmaceuticals grow to one of the largest companies in the area. She has also watched as her went from running the facility to ultimately not being allowed to enter the building after a leadership change in 2009.

“He always treated people like human beings and he respected his employees and he appreciated his employees” Puskar said. For it to go from that to where it is now just devastates me.”

According to U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito work is still going on at the federal level to save the facility. Capito said the last several months have been evaluated by officials in order to avoid repeating some of the problems experienced early in the pandemic.

“Some sort of repurposing could be the best route then that would make it critical to the nation because we are working now to make sure we have all the strategic reserves if there were another pandemic and not relying on China” Capito said.

Viatris issued a WARN notice in late May. The company said it’s anticipated 1431 workers would lose their jobs as a result of the closing. There would be 482 non-union workers and 764 union workers lose their jobs on July 31. Additional job separations will take place on Aug. 31 Oct. 31 Dec. 31 and March 31 2022.

The WARN notice lists the job titles affected.

The plant has more than 200 categories of non-union workers with most categories made up of one worker. The non-union categories with the most workers who will lose their jobs include Chemist II (58 jobs) and Area Lead/Cleaning Supervisors (31 jobs).

There are 57 categories of union workers at plant who will lose their jobs including 65 in the category of Utility Worker D 61 Department Coordinators 40 Blended Operators and 36 Fluid Bed Operators.",,,,,,,,,

In many cases they were already working remotely from France either with or without their employers' knowledge/permission but either way not registered with URSSAF and suddenly because of Brexit it became a biggie. I don't know how many of them managed to regularise their situation but as Bev pointed out an employer outside of France would need a good reason to justify taking on all the obligations and expense imposed on them by the French code du travail (pay the high social security contributions provide mutuelle cover put them on a French contract which gives the employee a lot of protection doesn't allow easy hire and fire etc). Depending on what skills are involved you could probably hire three or four employees in say India for the cost of one in France.

""Israel's 'A+' rating balances a diversified high value-added economy which proved resilient to the COVID-19 pandemic strong external finances and solid institutional strength"" Fitch's report read.

""The Israeli economy contracted by 2.6% in 2020 due to the COVID-19-related restrictions imposed from 2Q20 [2020's second quarter] and is forecast to grow by 5.1% and 5.7% in 2021 and 2022 respectively"" the report stated. ""The economy has been more resilient to the pandemic shock than many rating peers reflecting the strong performance of high-tech industries and the early and fast progress in vaccination.""

""Fitch forecasts a budget deficit of around 7% of GDP in 2021 down from 11.6% in 2020 mainly due to the economic rebound the gradual withdrawal of pandemic-related support measures and buoyant revenues from high-tech sectors"" the report read. ""The new government is preparing the first regular budget in three years covering the end of 2021 and 2022 and the final vote on it is scheduled for November. Fitch expects that the government will be able to adopt a full budget by November 2021 consistent with its commitment to stabilize the public debt/GDP ratio in 2022.""

Despite the positive forecasts  the report also mentioned the unstable political situation.

The report noted the government's slim parliamentary majority and its diverse nature as a factor that could hinder policymaking. It also noted that ""Israel has only had technical budgets based on an adjusted 1/12th rule since 2019 due to a run of inconclusive elections. There are also expenditure pressures from social inequality and low employment in particular among ultra-Orthodox and Arab groups.""

The report also addressed Israel's current security situation.

""Israel's credit profile has shown resilience to periodic conflicts. Key risks include instability in Syria and relations with Iran in the context of the latter's nuclear program and apparent Israeli countermeasures. Israel remains concerned by Iran's influence in neighboring Syria and Lebanon and reportedly continues to intervene in Syria with air strikes to counter the presence and activities of Iran or Iranian proxies. Risk remains of another conflict with Hezbollah although there has not been a large-scale clash since 2006 and both sides would suffer losses and Lebanon is in the middle of a domestic crisis"" the report read.

The report took note of the Abraham Accords but said that ""It remains to be seen whether they lessen the geopolitical risks facing Israel. Economic benefits are likely to be limited given the modest size of their economies compared with existing trade partners.""

The report even took note of the internal tensions during the May fighting in Gaza. The report's analysis stated that even though the clashes between Israelis and Palestinians revealed ""serious fault lines"" these only had a limited adverse effect on the economy.

""THE EXACT methodology used by the ratings agencies is not publicly released. But ratings are based on a mix of public information and private information provided by the debt issuers"" according to Eliza Wu Associate Professor in Finance at the University of Sydney. Wu's explanation appears in ""The Conversation"" a not-for-profit media outlet written by academics and researchers.

""When it comes to giving the federal government a rating agencies will use publicly available economic data such as economic growth income per capita and unemployment and inflation rates. This gives the agency an idea of the current state of the economy as well as where it might be in the short and long term"" Wu explained.

She continued ""Agencies will also look at the federal government’s budget. They will consider the gap between revenues and expenditures when the government’s debts are due and the quality of assets that the government could sell off.""

Wu added that ""the agency will look at the wider economic and political context. This includes the quality of financial regulators and levels of corruption and political stability. It also includes potential internal or external vulnerabilities such as an economic slowdown in China or the possibility of a trade war. All of these factors have an impact on the ability and willingness to repay debt even if they are beyond the government’s control.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9idXNpbmVzcy9jaGFydGVyZWQtYWNjb3VudGFudC1ncmFudGVkLXVhZS1nb2xkZW4tdmlzYS1za2F2bTNobNIBXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9idXNpbmVzcy9jaGFydGVyZWQtYWNjb3VudGFudC1ncmFudGVkLXVhZS1nb2xkZW4tdmlzYS1za2F2bTNobD9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chartered Accountant granted UAE Golden Visa,"Noor Karim Afridi a Chartered Accountant from England and Wales with over 18 years of diverse experience in Auditing and Business Advisory is among the latest business professionals to have been granted the Golden Visa by the UAE.

Associated Press

Tokyo — The United States had its best weightlifting result at the Olympics for 21 years. Ecuador had its first ever female champion.

Neisi Dajomes of Ecuador won the women’s 76-kilogram weightlifting event as Kate Nye of Berkley took silver for the United States’ best result in the sport since 2000 on Sunday.

“It feels surreal” Nye said. “I'll definitely savor this moment. I'm just so happy. I'm going to celebrate this because it's a huge win for me.""

Dajomes lifted 118 kilograms in the snatch and 145kg in the clean and jerk for a total 263 beating Nye by 14kg.

It’s Ecuador’s second gold of the Tokyo Olympics after Richard Carapaz won the men’s cycling road race and only the South American nation’s fourth medal of any sort in history. All three previous medals were won by men.

The only U.S. weightlifting medals this century were gold for Tara Nott in 2000 in the first ever women’s Olympic competition bronze for Cheryl Haworth the same year and a bronze for Sarah Robles in 2016.

Nye said the silver medal came after “the most challenging year of my career so far."" She has been open about her 2019 diagnosis of bipolar disorder and said the coronavirus pandemic brought more challenges by limiting some of her usual methods for working on her mental health.

For the 22-year-old Nye it’s another step in a remarkable rise to prominence in the sport. A former gymnast who didn’t get into the sport until she was in high school at Rochester Adams Nye became the youngest U.S. women’s world champion in weightlifting in 2019. She also won the junior world title earlier that year and became the first American to be named the International Weightlifting Federation’s Lifter of the Year.

More: Niyo: For Michigan's Kate Nye Olympic dream was worth the weight

""I think USA Weightlifting has been looked down on for a very long time now and I feel like the talent and all of our hard work is finally showing now"" she said. ""I just hope that I can inspire a new generation of American weightlifters to expect more out of themselves because we can do it.""

Moving up in weight class from the non-Olympic 71kg division was tough and “between that and COVID a coaching switch lots of personal stuff with my mental health it’s been a really hard year"" Nye said. ""But I think all of those trials and tribulations made me the person I am today and I don’t think I would be in that second-place spot without them.”

Aremi Fuentes took bronze for Mexico on a total 245kg after South Korean Kim Suhyeon had a lift which would have been enough for bronze judged invalid because she straightened her arms too late in the lift. Kim was already celebrating when the decision was announced and left the stage in tears.

American 22-year-old Katherine Nye delivered the best performance for a U.S. weightlifter at the Olympics in over two decades Sunday winning a silver medal in the women's 76 kg/156 lbs category at the Tokyo Games.

Nye lifted a personal-best total of 249 kg (549 lbs) between a 111 kg (245 lbs) snatch and a 138 kg (304 lbs) clean & jerk also a PB. She placed behind only Ecuador's Neisi Dajomes who won her country's first weightlifting medal of any color a gold with a 263 kg (580 lbs) total.

Nye is the first American to win silver or better in weightlifting at the Olympics since Tara Nott lifted to 48 kg/106 lbs gold at the Sydney 2000 Olympics.

The Berkley Michigan native first took up weightlifting as a teenager through CrossFit training after spending 11 years as a gymnast. In 2019 she became the youngest American to win a world weightlifting championship when she lifted a total of 248 kg (546 lbs) to top the non-Olympic 71 kg/156 lbs weight category. She was 20 at the time.

She moved up five kilos in the two years since to compete in the 76 kg/156 lbs division which is contested at the Olympics.

Nye completed her first snatch attempt of the competition at 107 kg (236 lbs) with relative comfort. She was just as convincing on her second lift at 111 kg (245 lbs).

For her final snatch attempt Nye successfully raised a personal best 114 kg (251 lbs) in what appeared to be a dream start to the competition. Nye was visibly thrilled and threw her arms in the air in celebration immediately after being awarded the lift.

That proved to be a costly error.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHliaXouY28vYXJ0aWNsZS8xMTI5Mzcvbnl1LXN0ZXJuLXJlY2VpdmVzLTUwLW1pbGxpb24tZ2lmdC1mcm9tLWl0cy1uYW1pbmctYmVuZWZhY3Rvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NYU Stern Receives $50 Million Gift from Its Naming Benefactor,"New York University’s Stern School of Business received a $50 million gift from alumnus Leonard N. Stern (BS ’57 MBA ’59) for undergraduate scholarships in the Stern School enabling a significant expansion of the School’s Breakthrough Scholars Leadership Program. This gift comes on the heels of another $50 million gift also directed towards undergraduate scholarships earlier this month from NYU Stern alumnus and Chair of the NYU Board of Trustees William R. Berkley (BS ’66) and his wife Marjorie.

“Unequal access to higher education is one of the great problems of our time. Leonard’s gift is a wonderful show of leadership in this context helping level the playing field. I am very happy to see Leonard and NYU Stern leading the way on this important issue” said Mr. Berkley.

The Breakthrough Scholars Leadership Program was established in 2015 through a pioneering gift of $5.75 million from Leonard Stern and exemplifies the School’s commitment to making college accessible to highly talented and high-performing students from diverse backgrounds. Breakthrough provides full financial support but goes well beyond financial aid by working to equip this select group of students with the skills and networks needed to excel at Stern and beyond. The program has been hugely impactful with graduation rates of 100% in each of the three graduating classes to date; Breakthrough Scholars have held key leadership positions at Stern including President of the Student Council and Stern Commencement speaker and have graduated into impressive professional careers at organizations ranging from Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan to Live Nation and Bloomberg Philanthropies. Leonard Stern’s latest transformative gift will allow for a significant increase in the size of this program through the next decade by admitting a minimum of 20 new Breakthrough Scholars each year beginning in fall 2022.

“We are deeply grateful for Leonard Stern’s continued dedication to the Stern School” said NYU President Andrew Hamilton. “With this gift and the recently announced $50 million from Bill and Marge Berkley NYU Stern has raised $100 million in new funding this year for undergraduate scholarships—a truly transformative step toward increasing access to one of the world’s premier undergraduate business schools.”

“Leonard has always shown extraordinary vision—from creating one campus for all students undergraduate and graduate through his naming gift in 1988 to funding the launch of the initial Breakthrough Scholars Leadership Program in 2015 to supporting this tremendous expansion of the program today. It is a matter of enormous pride for us to partner yet again with Leonard to increase access to and further elevate the Stern School” said Raghu Sundaram Dean NYU Stern.

“Students who have exceptional ability and fortitude but lack the resources for a world-class education deserve to have the doors at NYU Stern open to them. I encourage others to take on the challenge of access to education and change the lives of talented and deserving young people” said Leonard Stern.

Walmart is the world’s largest retailer by sales and America’s largest company by revenue and employees. It has 10526 store locations worldwide and about 2.3 million employees. Last year its sales hit $559 billion which will almost certainly keep it at the top of the Fortune 500. Walmart actually has more locations outside the U.S. than it does in America.

Walmart breaks its business into three pieces. The first is Walmart U.S. which has 4743 stores. Next is Sam’s Club its wholesale retailer business. The third is Walmart international with 5184 stores. In the most recent quarter for which it posted financial data U.S. revenue hit $93 billion. International revenue reached $27 billion and Sam’s Club contributed $17 billion. The international business does not get the visibility that the U.S. unit does. When earnings were announced CEO Doug McMillon mentioned the U.S. business and e-commerce operation. International and Same’s Club were left out of his comments.

Founder Sam M. Walton opened his first store in 1945 as a Ben Franklin variety store. Its international business started at a joint venture in Mexico in 1991. According to its annual report…”as of January 31 2021 our Walmart International segment conducted business in 25 countries.” It has exited two of its largest markets in recent years. These include Argentina and Brazil. It sold Walmart Argentina earlier this year and a majority of Brazilian operations in 2019.

Walmart’s store configurations outside the U.S. are in formats similar to the U.S for the most part. These include supercenters supermarkets hypermarkets warehouse clubs (including Sam’s Clubs) and cash & carry.

Management breaks international operations into regions:

Walmart International operated through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada Chile and China as well as our businesses classified as held for sale in Japan and the United Kingdom as of January 31 2021. Walmart International also operates through our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana Ghana Kenya Lesotho Malawi Mozambique Namibia Nigeria South Africa Swaziland Tanzania Uganda and Zambia) Central America (which includes Costa Rica El Salvador Guatemala Honduras and Nicaragua) India and Mexico.

For most communities this is not a sight that we typically see under normal circumstances but over the last year and a half we’ve grown accustomed to many “non-normal” circumstances.

Walmart recently announced that all employees are required to wear masks inside their stores again regardless of vaccination status in places with “substantial or high transmission” like Florida. The new policy is effective immediately the nation’s largest retailer said Friday.

Walmart store managers will receive local updates every Monday to determine their facility’s necessary protocol.

Customers will not be required to wear masks but they will be strongly encouraged and facilities will post signs to remind them of the CDC’s new guidelines.

Walmart is currently not mandating that its employees get vaccinated however it says it will soon put in place a new process to verify their vaccine status and is encouraging its workers to get vaccinated. The company is offering employees the chance to get vaccinated while on the clock and if they experience a reaction to the vaccine they can also receive up to three days of paid leave. Walmart is doubling its current vaccine incentive to $150 which prior to this change was $75."

That’s right the long-awaited film adaptation of Disney’s Jungle Cruise is finally here taking the Disney Parks attraction we know and love and bringing it to life. Actors Dwayne Johnson Emily Blunt Jack Whitehall and Edgar Ramírez sat down in July to talk about their new movie Disney’s Jungle Cruise when it first came to theaters and Disney+ with Premier Access.

Dwayne Johnson who plays skipper Frank Wolff is also a producer on the film. He explains of his decision to climb aboard the project “I immediately just saw the potential of the opportunity to [adapt] a beloved and iconic Disney ride since 1955 when the park opened. This was Walt Disney's baby.” And the spirit of the attraction is alive in this film. Jack Whitehall who plays MacGregor Houghton brother to Emily Blunt’s Lily Houghton says “I would say the element to the Jungle Cruise ride that I like the most is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and I think that that is definitely something that we took over into the movie.” Blunt shares “I know when [Dwayne] and I first met Jaume [Collet-Serra the director] we both asked him the same question. We said ‘Well what do you feel this movie's about?’ And he goes ""You know it's about love."" It was so perfect 'cause you could've talked about all the action the spectacle and the myths and the legends and all that. But that's when I knew in Jaume we had an innate romantic and a world builder and that's what you need for this type of movie.”

Blunt felt the chemistry between Johnson and herself immediately. “It was instant” Blunt shares. “We were pals for life immediately.” Edgar Ramírez who plays Spanish conquistador Aguirre complimented Johnson and Blunt’s chemistry and how it gave way to the fun banter seen on screen. “That tone to be witty and romantic and funny and snide but cute at the same time that is very difficult. We as actors we know that tone is very difficult to achieve and you guys killed it” he exclaims. Though Blunt notes the hard work that went into achieving that electricity — “Tonally we just needed to strike a chord that was really well-crafted and that we curated with so much love” she also acknowledges “It was like I knew when we met. We had this rapport that like ping-pong back and forth so quickly.” Ramírez laughs “I was a little bit jealous when I was watching the movie. It's like ‘Ugh I wish I was a little bit more on that boat’ you know? Because I'm sure you had so much fun.” And Blunt admits “We did.”

Because of the heart in this project Jungle Cruise isn’t your typical action-adventure movie. Whitehall explains “I think what's so great about this movie is that all of the characters feel so fleshed out and all of them have interesting backstories and are fully realized. In a lot of movies of this kind of genre you'd have characters that are a little bit two-dimensional. But I think it's so great that we get to understand so much about each of these characters and they all have reasons for being where they are. And it makes you invested in them and it makes you care about them. It makes you really [go] on that journey with them.” But the movie is still true to the fun inherent to the genre. Says Blunt “[It] was made in the spirit of the films that we all grew up watching. Like they are just joy bombs and they're nostalgic and I think we just needed to pierce people's hearts directly with the spirit of those films that we all loved as children.” It’s fitting then when later in the interview Johnson refers to Blunt as “the female Indiana Jones over here.” Blunt shares that she personally feels more similar to the bold Lily Houghton than she does to her past role as Mary Poppins in Mary Poppins Returns: “I feel like Lily's sort of more of a mess. Poppins is so pulled together and perfected and I don't feel I walk through life that way.”

How could Lily not be a bit of a mess when she’s traveling down the Amazon? The situation is ripe for comedy. Whitehall shares “There was a fair amount of improv. The script was amazing but also we were given the space to improvise and add stuff to it and these two [Johnson and Blunt] created this environment where we were able to do that and it felt like such a safe space. Some of the great moments that you see in the film are genuine moments that we came up with in the moment and Jaume was so good at encouraging that as well.” Blunt shared that one of the most difficult scenes to shoot was when she and Johnson were swinging on a vine. The stunt itself would’ve been difficult enough but then Johnson kept improvising dialogue and she couldn’t stop laughing. “For me it was the most challenging because he would not let me get one straight take in. He pushed it so far every time to try and make me laugh on that vine swing. Every time I was like just tell me what you're gonna say this time so I can be prepared.” But no — “I wouldn't tell her” laughs Johnson.

That vine swing comes as Johnson and Blunt’s characters are trying to escape some villainous conquistadors led by Edgar Ramírez’s Aguirre. His character is frequently accompanied by a variety of Amazonian snakes but luckily for Ramírez who has a fear of snakes they were mostly computer generated. “I was very happy that those snakes weren't anywhere near me during the shoot. 'Cause I'm super afraid of snakes and we encountered some of them when we're shooting in Atlanta.” Another person afraid of snakes? Ramírez’s mother. After seeing the movie she told Ramírez “‘Why didn't you tell me? I missed half of your performance because I couldn't look at you with all those snakes.’” But despite the snakes Ramírez loved playing Aguirre. “He’s misunderstood” he says. “It comes from pain.” Blunt tells Ramírez “I love that you were like this operatic bad guy” while Whitehall jokes that he understands Aguirre because “I'd be pretty angry if I had a load of snakes in my face all the time.” On a more serious note Ramírez who is Venezuelan said of the film’s authenticity “We shot in real locations and we dressed them to look like the Amazon. It's incredible. I come from an Amazonian country and I saw the movie for the first time two days ago at the premiere. And guys — I'm so happy.”

Later when asked what they’d bring with them on an actual jungle cruise Whitehall jokes “Having rewatched the movie the most useful element may have been taking a snake charmer 'cause that seems to be the main threat in the film. Had they had a snake charmer aboard that ship we would've been absolutely fine. That's where we got bogged down. So I would take a snake charmer.” Everyone laughs.

Overall the cast could not stop raving about how the movie manages to transcend genres. “[The movie] has such ambition and scale and it's beautiful and the sets are incredible and the set pieces and the action — it's got all of that. But at the heart of it as well it's not a movie that takes itself too seriously. It has wit it has humor” says Whitehall. Of striking the perfect balance between all of these elements Blunt shares “It took a lot of tempering and beautiful conducting from Jaume who was just extraordinarily free-spirited with us in this massive spectacle of a movie.” But Whitehall emphasizes “It's got some of the best puns I've ever heard. It's got Dwayne Johnson doing a standup comedy routine” and Blunt adds “Someone said the other day ‘Welcome to the pungle.’”

He spent years working hard and nearly failing but he always believed that one should keep moving forward and that is exactly what he did. As a young man he left his small town of Marceline Missouri and moved to Kansas City to pursue his dreams. It was in Kansas City that the original Imagineer created his first studio called Laugh-O-Gram Films.

It is rumored that this is the studio where Walt came up with the concept of Mickey Mouse as he had to deal with a myriad of mice in the studio and finally got one to sit still long enough as he sketched.

In 1923 Walt left Kansas City shortly after he went into bankruptcy and he had to give up the Laugh-O-Gram studio. However while Walt may have left Laugh-O-Gram Films behind his legions of fans did not. Thank You Walt Disney Inc. — which is not associated with The Walt Disney Co. — now owns the building and has been working for years to bring the building back to its former glory stating the renovation will cost around $5.5 million. Thank You Walt Disney Inc. hopes to open another studio in the building as well as make an animation museum in honor of Walt.

Unfortunately the renovations being made to the building suffered a major setback recently. On July 30 Thank You Walt Disney Inc. posted to their Twitter page that a car had crashed into the building and caused significant damage.

Well friends this is NOT the type of post we want to write. In the midst of our beautiful restoration project Walt Disney’s historic Laugh-O-gram Building was hit by a car last night. As Walt said though we will keep moving forward.

As you can see in the shared image a black car crashed into the building not only ruining exterior work being done but also ruining construction materials and scaffolding that were being used at the site.

According to The Kansas City Star the accident happened around 4 a.m. but no information on the car or the driver has been released at this time. It is also currently unknown as to what caused the car to lose control and crash into the building.

Fundraising for the renovation and now for fixing the damages is being conducted online. If you would like to contribute to bringing this building back to its full glory you can do so by visiting the Thank You Walt Disney Inc. website.

Are you sad to see such an awful setback happen to the iconic building? Let us know in the comments."

With more money than ever in their pockets New Zealand’s richest have adapted some of their spending and investment habits in the covid-hit world.

According to experts in the high-net-worth sector lavish real-estate assets bold stock-market investment strategies luxury cars jewellery and art are the preferred spending options for New Zealand’s 1 percent right now.

Real estate remains a top priority despite recent government reforms intended to cool the market. Mark Harris co-founder and managing director of New Zealand Sotheby’s International Realty says the pandemic and recent policy changes have not dampened Kiwis’ appetite.

“There has been an uptick since last June and consecutively each month has been the best month we’ve had” he says. “It has been a remarkable recovery off the back of lockdown.”

Lifestyle blocks and homes around the southern lakes are in hot demand with many Aucklanders among the buyers Harris says.

“Waiheke is also on an unbelievable run. We are getting multiple offers on listings and are running out of stock. There’s a lot of demand in the $10 million-plus range. We see activity from Kiwis overseas and Aussies looking for New Zealand lifestyle properties.”

Government reforms to curb residential property investment have not had any impact on the rich because as buyers they are less reliant on leverage Harris adds. “At the moment it’s just a lack of stock affecting things.”

In addition to residential real estate wealthy New Zealanders are making “plenty of enquiries” about commercial property he says. “We’ve seen some pretty substantial commercial property investments.”

The high-end car market has also enjoyed a boom. Shaun Summerfield of Auckland luxury car dealership Giltrap Prestige says sales have been “more resilient than expected” after the lockdowns with recent heightened demand fuelled by the government’s “feebate” scheme or clean car discount.

“It has remained consistent” Summerfield says. ""The [feebate scheme] has created more interest across the network with the growing Audi E-Tron range. There are a lot more electric vehicles at the higher end such as the Porsche Taycan and brands like Lamborghini and Bentley will feature electrification across their entire model ranges within five years.”

Summerfield says the traditional sports-car market has remained resilient with the likes of Lamborghini Bentley and another favourite Aston Martin enduringly popular with wealthy buyers. However a logjam in the international supply chain has affected availability.

“There’s a global squeeze due to a variety of reasons including semiconductor supply. As a result the delivery times for some cars can be longer.”

Specialist auctioneers Webb’s have also seen a rise in demand over the past year with wealthy individuals seeking collectable items across the jewellery art and prestige-car markets.

Charles Ninow Webb's head of art says a broader range of buyers has emerged for prestige art pieces especially works with “cultural capital” and significance. “All of the old buyers are there but something has changed. There’s a huge volume of new buyers and the market is getting bigger and younger.”

Ninow says works by prominent artists such as Tony Fomison have attracted record valuations in recent months. Two of his paintings recently sold for more than $500000 each.

Works by Colin McCahon Philip Clairmont and Gretchen Albrecht have also attracted record valuations Ninow says. “Vendors are attracting great prices and that is bringing more amazing paintings out of the woodwork.”

Beyond the art world high-value collectables have also attracted lofty price tags. A rare Audemars Piguet Royal Oak watch recently sold for $100000 at a Webb's auction.

Wealthy buyers have also shown keen interest in 1970s sports cars such as Porsches and other more unconventional vehicles. A 1970 Ford XW Falcon GT-HO Phase II sold at auction for more than $432000 in March.

While some spending patterns look familiar investment habits among the rich have changed since the pandemic hit according to Jack Powell an adviser at Private Wealth Advisers which handles portfolios for high-net-worth clients.

Before covid wealthy Kiwis sought safe investments anticipating a market correction following a long bull market. Although markets tanked in March last year they have recovered strongly aided by record-low interest rates and government stimulus packages. As the boom continues clients have readjusted.

“People are becoming more aggressive with their investment strategies” Powell says. “There’s the acronym TINA which defines the market right now: ‘there is no alternative’. Everyone is going into the sharemarket and there are staggering statistics about the market.”

Alternative assets have also captured the imagination of the wealthy as traditional fixed-income products deliver meagre returns in a low-interest-rate environment.

Local venture capital funds such as those managed by Icehouse Ventures have attracted investors Powell says. “People are looking at private equity and private credit offerings. There’s a domestic focus with private equity while global private credit funds have been popular.”

Amid concerns over inflation he says many high-net-worth clients have rotated out of growth stocks and into value shares which have historically offered steadier returns. Clients have taken varying approaches. “Some believe that they are not overexposed to growth assets as they think the low-interest-rate environment will be around for much longer. Others think we are going into higher sustained inflation and moving into value. There’s a massive split.”

Powell believes property investment looks less attractive to the rich following the government’s housing reforms: “The yields are so low [on residential property] and valuations are so high.”

He says yields on commercial real estate could also come under pressure from rising interest rates.

Diversification remains a key factor for wealthy clients Powell says. “Clients need diversification and downside protection. Sitting on the sidelines in this environment doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. We could be in this environment for five or six years so you need to invest but invest with caution — and have an exit strategy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZXZlcnl0aGluZ2hvcnNldWsuY28udWsvZXhwbG9zaW9uLXctbGl2ZXMtdXAtdG8taGlzLW5hbWUtZHVyaW5nLWZpcnN0LWhvcnNlLWluc3BlY3Rpb24tZm9yLWp1bXBpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explosion W lives up to his name during the First Horse Inspection for Jumping,"Explosion W lives up to his name during the First Horse Inspection for Jumping at Tokyo

Living up to his name the talented KWPN gelding was unable to contain his excitement during their time in the spotlight while other Team GB members all passed the First Horse Inspection including travelling reserve pairing Harry Charles and Romeo 88.

There were two horses sent to the Holding Box and they will be reinspected at 17.00 tomorrow. They were Argentina’s Cannavaro 9 (Matias Albarracin) and China’s Caesar (You Zhang).

The horses were beautifully turned out and so were the athletes The Netherlands’ Willem Greve Marc Houtzager Harrie Smolders and Michael van der Vleuten really cutting a dash in suits that blended an “Our Man in Havana” look with a touch of Vaudeville.

But they can all look forward to familiarisation and training over the next few days taking in the sights and sounds of the fabulous Baji Koen stadium before the Jumping action gets underway next Tuesday.

Sign up for our newsletters to stay up to date on the stories that matter.

Over the years Curious City has answered a lot of questions about problems with city trash.

We’ve looked at how the city handles recycling  contaminated materials  yard waste and food scraps — and what experts say could be done better.

Chicago has the worst big-city recycling rate in the nation a poorly advertised and inconsistent yard waste collection strategy and no municipal food composting program.

Progress on these issues had long been stalled. But that changed this month when Mayor Lori Lightfoot released the City of Chicago Waste Strategy . The plan takes on a lot of the concerns our readers have shared and offers solutions many very similar to those we’ve presented in the past.

According to the city the plan aims to “minimize landfilling increase diversion and recycling reduce cost and increase efficiency maximize economic investment and workforce development opportunities and address social and environmental justice inequities.”

What It Would Take For Chicago To Compost Food Scraps read more

Here are 10 things to know about this long-awaited plan:

NO SET GOALS: The plan features dozens of recommendations but doesn’t include any specific targets or deadlines for waste reduction. Evanston  for example has a goal of reaching 50% waste diversion by 2025.

“I would certainly like to see a little more metrics and accountability and [information on] what happens if we don’t meet goals” says Carter O’Brien vice president of the Chicago Recycling Coalition an environmental advocacy group.

A NEW RECYCLING HAULER: Before the plan was released the city took a major step toward potentially improving its recycling program.by implementing a new contract with a different recycling hauler.

A 2018 Better Government Association investigation found the city’s main recycling hauler Waste Management was diverting relatively large amounts of “contaminated” recycling materials into the garbage and could potentially profit from that diversion if the materials went to its own landfills. The company denied the allegations but three years after the investigation it lost its contract with the city.

A DOZEN PRIORITY ITEMS:The strategy outlines dozens of long-term suggestions including 12 for 2021-2022. The prioritized items range from supporting waste reduction legislation to helping consumers find places for their old electronics and clothes.

VEGETABLE SCRAP DROP-OFF: The plan calls for partnering with community gardens to create compostable food waste drop-off points. Chief sustainability officer Angela Tovar says she believes the program will be available by the end of the year. But she stresses it will require educating the public on the right food scraps to collect and how to store them for composting.

CITY-RUN COMMERCIAL GARBAGE PICK-UP: Angela Tovar the chief sustainability officer says the city is researching the possibility of overseeing not just residential garbage but also commercial garbage pick-up. This would give the city more oversight on how much commercial waste is diverted away from landfills.

PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROPOSALS: The Waste Strategy calls for supporting the passage of statewide legislation that would make manufacturers more responsible for the recycling their products.

MORE BLUE BIN EDUCATION: The plan supports creating new ways to teach residents how to recycle better so fewer blue bin loads get so contaminated with food broken glass or other contaminants that they can’t be recycled.

SMASHING PUMPKINS: City recommendations include hosting more events like “pumpkin smashes” where people can bring their old moldy Halloween pumpkin for composting.

“These are very important events” says Angela Tovar the city’s chief sustainability officer. “Think about all of the pumpkins after Halloween that enter the waste stream. This is an opportunity for us to really raise visibility on organic waste to say ‘Hey you know what that pumpkin does not go in the landfill.’ ”

RIGHT-SIZING OUR CARTS: The new plan calls for reevaluating the number size and distribution of the city’s black and blue carts to potentially improve recycling rates. This might even include a “Pay As You Throw” model (where you pay for bigger trash bins) advocated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that has been adopted by communities across the country.

CLOTHING RECYCLING: The plan suggests “establishing a revenue-sharing partnership with a textile recycling company for collection of clothes shoes and other textiles otherwise ending up in landfills.”

President Joe Biden’s executive order on “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad” issued on his eighth day in office included the imperative for all federal agencies to incorporate an environmental justice framework into their decision-making a goal echoing an order from President Bill Clinton in 1994 that while a breakthrough for the movement still left much undone.

“It’s really the first time you’ve seen this level of weigh-in from any president since we’ve been having this conversation” said Vernice Miller-Travis a Harlem activist who has fought for environmental justice for more than 30 years. “I could not have predicted this.”

Late last month the Biden administration released interim guidance for implementing the executive order’s Justice40 Initiative. It designated 21 priority programs to begin enhancing benefits to disadvantaged communities as part of the president’s pledge that 40 percent of climate energy and infrastructure spending go to overburdened and marginalized neighborhoods.

The guidance promised a community outreach plan in 30 days a full list of all covered programs in 60 days and a methodology for the Office of Management and Budget to determine benefit levels. The administration is also developing a Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool that takes into account various environmental and demographic indicators to ensure the money goes to the right places.

But many in the movement harbor doubts given the enormity of the challenge posed by decades of systemic environmental racism and the disproportionate harms suffered by communities of color related to climate change air pollution toxic contaminants and the siting of power plants landfills refineries and other polluting facilities. It has already been a long struggle since the movement nominally began almost 40 years ago at a North Carolina landfill laced with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) a chemical linked with cancer and birth defects. However extensive Biden’s commitments have been thus far it’s unclear whether a bill codifying the lofty goals of his executive order can make it through Congress before the midterm elections when both houses could change parties.

Details for Biden’s environmental justice strategy were proposed by the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council (WHEJAC) created by his executive order. The 26-member group consists of activists from around the nation including several pioneers of the environmental justice movement.

This moment is a far cry from the Clinton era when the idea that communities of color were more likely to live near toxic hazards because of systemic forms of discrimination was hard for many to swallow. But the environmental justice movement has transformed since then—from an idea and a rallying cry to its current embrace by the Biden White House.

“More than ever before the Biden administration has put environmental justice on the national agenda” Richard Moore co-chair of WHEJAC told the House Oversight and Reform Committee at a July 21 hearing on Biden’s American Jobs Plan and its impact on environmental justice.

Still small fissures were evident even in the interim Justice40 guidance which did not include recommendations from WHEJAC to stop funding for nuclear power and carbon capture technologies favored by the fossil fuel industry.

The nation meanwhile remains deeply divided politically and Biden’s jobs and climate priorities are stalled in the Senate.

The Oversight and Reform Committee’s ranking Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky summarized the deadlock saying Justice40 represented “massive new spending with no strings attached and little climate impact.”

A Movement Begins

The struggle against environmental injustice dates back to at least 1978 when a group of white men illegally dumped 30000 gallons of oil laced with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by spraying it from a moving truck over six weeks in the dead of night. The black streaks covered 211 miles of road across 14 counties in North Carolina.

After the four men were caught numerous methods of remediation were rejected including a proposal to treat the soil where it lay. More than 90 locations were considered for disposal before North Carolina’s governor ordered the 60000 tons of contaminated soil to be collected and hauled to a yet-to-be constructed landfill in Warren County which was 61 percent black and had one of the highest rates of poverty in the state.

Locals expressed concerns that the landfill would leak property values would plummet and that further hazardous facilities would move into the area. And they delayed construction for three years by seeking an injunction based on the assertion that its siting was racially discriminatory. But a judge ended up denying their request.

When dump trucks carrying the soil drove toward the landfill on Sept. 15 1982 people in Warren County began gathering in nonviolent protest even lying down in the street to halt the vehicles. Most of them were women and their children. The demonstrations which lasted for weeks and resulted in the arrests of more than 500 people ultimately failed.

While there is no consensus on what started the environmental justice movement this showdown which generated unprecedented national attention for the environmental plight of a mostly minority community is invoked most often. All around the country African Americans Latinos Asians Indigenous peoples and the poor saw a version of their own local battles.

This conflict belongs to the movement’s lore for another reason too. It was here that Rev. Benjamin Chavis Jr. an organizer of the protest who would go on to lead the NAACP popularized the term environmental racism.

Warren County was so significant that the following year it pushed the federal government to investigate the link between landfill locations and the race and economic status of the people living near them. A survey of four hazardous waste landfills in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Region IV—including the brand new one in Warren County—found that three were located in majority-Black communities. In all four places African Americans accounted for 90 percent to 100 percent of those living below the poverty line.

On April 17 1987 the United Church of Christ’s Commission for Racial Justice published “Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States.” The study led by Charles Lee found that three out of five Black and Hispanic individuals “lived in communities with uncontrolled toxic waste sites” meaning they posed a threat to human health and the environment. The same was true for one-half of Asians Pacific Islanders and American Indians.

“Toxic Wastes” also looked at the populations surrounding commercial hazardous waste facilities. While poverty played a significant role in determining who lived nearby the most predictive variable was race. By unearthing these facts “Toxic Wastes” became the central tome of the environmental justice movement.

Aaron Mair who directs a wilderness campaign for the Adirondack Council a New York State-based ecological organization personally sees this study as the start of the EJ movement.

“Prior to that ‘87 study the dots were not connected” Mair said. “[Activists] suspected there may have been a pattern but most action within the Black community prior to 1987 were individualized localized communities that were not part of a connected national movement.”

Miller-Travis helped create maps for the project as a research assistant a job she said she got by repeatedly pestering Chavis who had become the leader of the Commission for Racial Justice. “What we did was capture a conversation that had been underway for a really really really long time” she said.

A series of incidents pushing the movement even further soon followed. In January 1990 professors Bunyan Bryant and Paul Mohai of the University of Michigan organized the first academic conference on environmental justice. The EPA would later credit the conference and “Toxic Wastes” with being the two primary things that brought environmental justice to its attention.

In March 1990 more than 100 activists addressed a letter to the “Group of Ten” the most prominent environmental groups in the nation. It decried their lack of diversity and close ties with major corporate polluters and blamed them along with government and industry for despoiling minority communities.

Soon after the movement stepped closer toward full recognition with the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit. On Oct. 24 1991 700 environmental activists gathered in Washington D.C. Lee the lead author of “Toxic Wastes” was the primary organizer. On the fourth and final day they agreed on 17 principles of environmental justice which still guide the movement. Miller-Travis who helped craft those principles said the term environmental justice exploded in use afterward.

In November 1992 the EPA established what is now the agency’s Office of Environmental Justice based on recommendations from an investigation into accusations of environmental racism.

In 1993 as the movement gained momentum the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council an independent advisory group to the EPA was created.

Then in 1994 in what seemed unthinkable at the movement’s outset President Clinton issued his executive order on environmental justice. It created a working group of 17 federal agencies and White House offices calling on them to incorporate environmental justice into their decision-making. Many dignitaries of the EJ movement were present for the signing including Miller-Travis.

The order was a milestone and it brought enormous exposure to the movement. But it would go largely ignored by the federal government.

“I think what happened in the Clinton administration is that they issued that executive order and then they [exhaled] deeply and they moved on” Miller-Travis said.

The Movement Matures

A year or so before Clinton’s order Aaron Mair was well into his battle to shut down a waste-to-energy incinerator less than a mile away from his home in Arbor Hill a mostly Black neighborhood in Albany New York. Mair said he began his campaign after two of his three daughters developed asthma.

After the Sierra Club’s New York State chapter turned down his in-person request for help at a meeting in midtown Manhattan Mair vowed to return and join the organization “specifically with the intention of making sure it never disrespected a community of color again.”

The incinerator was shut down in January 1994 and Mair’s local community group reached a settlement with New York State for $1.4 million in 1998. He joined the Sierra Club the following year rose through its ranks and served as its first Black president from 2015 to 2017.

Around the same time as Mair’s ascension similar efforts to diversify the makeup of other large environmental groups were underway although overall minority representation remains low to this day. Academia began embracing environmental justice too particularly at historically Black colleges and universities.

But wherever this new crop of activists found themselves they would have no shortage of environmental justice causes to tackle.

In 1996 the Japanese company Shintech proposed building a $700 million polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plant in Convent Louisiana. The community sits in the middle of “Cancer Alley”—an 85-mile stretch along the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge which hosts more than 140 oil chemical and plastic facilities. After two years of concerted activism Shintech took its business elsewhere.

Later in 2005 Hurricane Katrina devastated the majority-Black city of New Orleans when its levees failed demonstrating the costs of government inaction like no other event in recent history. The nation recoiled at the botched response from the Bush administration represented emblematically by the images of people stranded on rooftops in the city’s Lower Ninth Ward.

Over the decade to come a drumbeat of environmental disaster disproportionately impacted communities of color across America challenging the movement like never before.

In 2010 the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico ruined coastal communities. Many of them were made up of Asian Black and Native American people who regularly consumed fish and relied on the maritime industry. Landfills in communities of color also received the lion’s share of waste from the disaster according to an analysis by Robert Bullard a professor at Texas Southern University in Houston and an early environmental justice activist.

From 2014 to 2015 nearly 100000 people mostly Black were exposed to lead-contaminated water in Flint Michigan when the city changed its water source to save money.

And in 2016 thousands gathered near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline which would pass beneath the Missouri River the tribe’s primary water source and cut through sacred spaces. Previous plans to route it through Bismarck North Dakota were scrapped because it posed a hazard to municipal drinking water.

Throughout events like these and far more with less notoriety the EPA’s Office of Civil Rights (OCR) and more recently its External Civil Rights Compliance Office (ECRCO) has had a difficult time keeping up. Prior to the Biden administration these offices issued only two preliminary findings of racial discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. One was resolved in 2011 and the other on Jan. 19 2017 President Barack Obama’s last full day in office.

After accepting a case for investigation the offices were supposed to make their findings within 180 days. In these two instances it took nine years and 22 years respectively.

“Folks who live in communities that are impacted by environmental threats or lack of enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations have for decades made the claim that one of the reasons that there is not vigorous and equal enforcement of the law is because they’re people of color” Miller-Travis said.

ECRCO was created in late 2016 to take over civil rights enforcement duties from OCR. It made its 2017 findings using a broad mandate established under Title VI:

“No person in the United States shall on the ground of race color or national origin be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”

A similar legal mandate was enacted on Jan. 1 1970 when President Richard Nixon signed the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). It required federal agencies to consider beforehand what effects their actions would have on the environment and human health. Eleven months later the Nixon administration created the EPA.

Just days after Obama left the White House the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation a nonprofit policy research organization issued its own findings on ECRCO.

“The EPA reacts to critical reports by rejecting or dismissing a spate of cases before settling back into a familiar pattern of substantive inaction on Title VI complaints” the foundation concluded. Its report was just one in a series of damning accounts of the office’s inefficiency.

As President Donald Trump settled into office he tried to further weaken Title VI enforcement. His first budget proposal sought to reduce funding to the EPA by 31 percent which included bulldozing the Office of Environmental Justice and shifting its duties elsewhere.

Mustafa Ali who was then an assistant associate administrator at the EPA and a founding member of its Office of Environmental Justice resigned in protest after 24 years at the agency.

“When I hear we are considering making cuts to grant programs like the EJ small grants … I wonder if our new leadership has had the opportunity to converse with those who need our help the most” Ali wrote.

The budget proposal was ultimately rejected by Congress as were similar plans during Trump’s years in office. Still the message to the EPA was resounding. And throughout his presidency EPA administrators approved numerous projects and rollbacks with direct implications for the EJ agenda.

His administration pushed forward construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline; removed certain clean water protections; slowed the rate of Superfund cleanups and decreased investment in the program; and relaxed NEPA regulations which no longer required projects to assess their cumulative impacts.

Trump’s term also saw fewer overall EPA enforcement actions on average than his last two predecessors. During his first 18 months in office nearly 1600 EPA employees reportedly left while fewer than 400 were brought on.

Biden’s reversal began at the start of his second week in office with the president’s executive order on tackling the climate crisis.

Defining ‘Environmental Justice’

Before the words “environmental justice” were included 24 times in Biden’s executive order they were spoken during neighborhood meetings printed in community pamphlets written on picket signs and chanted at protests.

But they meant different things to different people.

The EPA defines environmental justice as the “fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race color culture national origin income and educational levels with respect to the development implementation and enforcement of protective environmental laws regulations and policies.”

Miller-Travis never thought that went far enough. “And that it’s lasted this long without ever being revisited I think is a mistake” she said.

She and other activists say that minority communities should not have to inordinately shoulder the burdens of environmental hazards and that they should enjoy the same benefits of environmental law enforcement clean energy and the mitigation of climate disasters like floods droughts and fires.

By pursuing this standard they have pushed the bounds of environmentalism from those typically associated with preservation and conservation of nature to something far more holistic.

“The environment is where you live it’s where you work it’s where you go to school it’s where you recreate it’s where you worship” said Miller-Travis who co-founded WE ACT for Environmental Justice a Harlem-based nonprofit in 1988. “The environment is not something you have to go see in the wilderness. It’s not something you have to go see [at] the water’s edge or in the atmosphere. The environment is everything.”

The movement has also pushed back on claims that environmental exposures played little or no role in the elevated rates of disease and death found in communities of color and that they were better explained by lifestyle and diet.

“I cannot tell you how long we argued that with EPA with regulators with the private sector” said Miller-Travis whose partner at WE ACT Peggy Shepard is co-chair of WHEJAC.

Earlier this year a WHEJAC subgroup reworked the EPA’s definition of environmental justice. The most significant change was the rewording of “fair treatment” to “just treatment”—from equity the even distribution of environmental amenities and harms to justice which ensures the conditions necessary for communities to thrive:

The term “environmental justice” means the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race color national origin or income or ability with respect to the development implementation enforcement and evaluation of laws regulations programs policies practices and activities that affect human health and the environment.

As outlined by WHEJAC those conditions include freedom from disproportionate harm to human health or the environment and from any structural barriers standing in the way of creating vibrant communities. Such treatment also grants the freedom to meaningfully participate in and equitably access decision-making processes resources and benefits. Furthermore it means enjoying full protection from human health and environmental hazards even as they affect cultural practices heritage burial sites and sacred spaces.

Biden referred throughout his executive order to “disadvantaged communities” a term mostly synonymous with WHEJAC’s reference to communities that are “overburdened and underserved” which it proposed defining as places with food insecurity high rates of health disparities or poorly maintained housing among several other harms.

WHEJAC also crafted this definition of an “environmental justice community”:

The term “environmental justice community” means a geographic location with significant representation of persons of color low-income persons indigenous persons or members of Tribal nations where such persons experience or are at risk of experiencing higher or more adverse human health or environmental outcomes.

A community’s problem—perhaps a landfill an incinerator or the provision that allows those facilities within a community—might be half a century old. Or it could be up for a vote of approval before a city council in 24 hours.

But wherever these conflicts take place whether in rural farming towns or in busy metropolises environmental justice activists believe that communities ultimately must decide for themselves what a just environment looks like. Sometimes history has shown the formerly meek have stood before giants and won.

Inside the Biden White House

In 2016 LaTricea Adams was frustrated at the lack of government accountability after Flint Michigan’s new water source exposed nearly 100000 people to lead. So she founded Black Millennials for Flint an organization dedicated to reducing lead exposure in Black and Latino communities around the country.

Now she sits on the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council which Biden’s executive order created to represent the movement’s aims within the elaborate environmental justice apparatus of the executive branch.

WHEJAC reports to the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality headed by its first African-American chair Brenda Mallory former director of regulatory policy at the Southern Environmental Law Center. Mallory also chairs the White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council which includes every cabinet department and agency each of which has appointed its own environmental justice officer.

Among those issuing the July 20 interim guidance on the Justice40 initiative were Mallory and Gina McCarthy who is Biden’s national climate advisor and the former head of the EPA.

The 21 priority programs identified in the guidance to begin enhancing benefits for disadvantaged communities include six within the EPA that involve cleanup of hazardous waste Superfund sites brownfields lead in drinking water diesel remissions and two state water revolving funds. The list also targets programs for flood mitigation in the Department of Homeland Security solar technologies in the Department of Energy abandoned mines in the Department of the Interior lead paint remediation in the Department of Housing and Urban Development and rural energy in the Department of Agriculture.

The guidance lists seven investment categories that will be used to gauge progress under Justice40—climate change clean energy clean transportation affordable housing job training reduction of legacy pollution and clean water infrastructure. And it includes another 13 factors that define “disadvantaged communities” among them low income high unemployment racial and ethnic segregation and “jobs lost through the energy transition” a clear nod to coal country.

The guidance got its first public airing at the July 21 hearing of the House Oversight and Reform Committee on the connection between Biden’s American Jobs Plan and Justice40 and Republicans came out swinging.

Rep. Jake LaTurner of Kansas pushed back on clean energy investments. “These solutions would eliminate job opportunities across our nation’s economy particularly in our energy transportation and agricultural sectors” he said.

The Republicans assailed the Democrats’ contention that environmental justice communities would gain from new spending aimed at climate change.

“If Americans want to address the needs of economically disadvantaged communities they should be looking for solutions to encourage investment from the private sector” said Rep. Comer the ranking Republican.

Unmoved by the inclusion of coal communities in the Justice40 guidance Comer said “I fear that a premature move away from fossil fuels particularly from poorer areas means that they will continue to have little access to the type of affordable reliable energy that enables economic growth and allows for the provision of clean water and sanitation widespread vaccination and preventative child health services.”

But even if no jobs legislation moves through Congress Justice40 can still produce benefits for disadvantaged communities activists said. “Agencies have money in programs that are operating. And the issue is are they operating with equity and justice? And that is not necessarily a congressional law or policy that needs to be passed” said Shepard Miller-Travis’ WE ACT co-founder and the WHEJAC co-chair.

Further guidance will be released when the Council on Environmental Quality working with the U.S. Digital Service in the White House releases the geospatial Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool an early version of which was produced by WHEJAC members. The screening tool is intended to ensure that Justice40 targets communities accurately by making available a bevy of metrics to determine which places are most in need.

That data would include exposure burdens (pesticides and drinking water contamination) proximity to potential hazards (Superfund sites and incinerators) and sensitive populations (maternal death rates and opioid addiction).

Republicans on the Oversight and Reform Committee remained unimpressed. “Rather than justice for the environment why aren’t we talking about justice for people living in violent cities?” asked Rep. Jody Hice of Georgia making reference to a rise in homicides over the past year.

The Republican opposition to environmental justice initiatives makes passage of a bill called the Environmental Justice for All Act highly unlikely this session. The legislation introduced in both House and Senate would require early input by environmental justice communities in the siting of potentially polluting facilities and require federal regulators to consider the facilities’ impact when combined with other environmental hazards. The bill would also make it easier for citizens to sue under the Civil Rights Act.

As the legislation awaits a vote a WHEJAC subgroup has revised Clinton’s 1994 executive order the wellspring of so much of the environmental justice work undertaken at the federal level over the past quarter-century. The proposed revision is two and a half times longer than the original and includes a reworking of the EPA’s definition of environmental justice. It also adds several direct references to citizens’ rights under Title VI and NEPA.

An expanded executive order won’t have the power of legislation but it would make for a substantial addition to the foundation Clinton made in 1994.

After his order shone a light on environmental justice Miller-Travis sensed there wasn’t much planning or many resources devoted to accomplishing its goals. Later she was heartened when the Obama administration recommitted to the issue.

But she said she has been completely taken aback by the attention to detail Biden’s administration has given to environmental justice and she noted a sense of urgency as well.

“We don’t know what’s gonna happen in the midterm elections” Miller-Travis recently said from her home outside of Washington. “So let’s go to the mat with what we have right now.”

Some homeowners are trashing their garbage pickup contracts with GFL Environmental amidst multiple missed or delayed waste collections over the past few months.

In Green Oak Township the entire Greenock Hills subdivision — more than 140 homes — is dumping GFL after the company failed to pick up their yard waste.

“We had been with GFL for years” Erin Skyring who has lived in the sub for five years said. “About eight weeks ago they did not pick up the yard waste… There was a lot of yard waste sitting out for multiple days and everyone was getting a different story.”

Skyring said the situation escalated and then the company stopped picking up yard waste altogether and at the beginning of June there was pieces of trash strewn all over the street. She called the trash debacle “the biggest thing in Greenock Hills ever.”

Joseph Munem GFL Environmental USA director of government affairs wrote in an emailed statement that the waste collection industry has been hit particularly hard by the current labor shortage and said ""the company understands and shares in the frustrations caused by delays.""

The problem is compounded he explained as the entire trucking industry experiences a shortage of parts needed to repair and maintain vehicles due to worldwide supply line disruptions. This interruption has affected GFL's fleet reducing the number of trucks available for use.

These issues are impacting not only homeowners or associations who have individual contracts with waste collection service providers but also entities who have community-wide contracts with a single provider including Livonia South Lyon and Novi.

Livonia in the midst of an 8-year contract with GFL has been receiving numerous complaints from residents during the past two months regarding delays in the company's collection of solid waste recycling and yard waste. Those complaints were passed on to GFL regularly but this week Mayor Maureen Brosnan took it a step further and met with GFL to provide a map of all reported delays in the city.

“We certainly understand our residents’ frustrations with these unprecedented delays in service"" Brosnan wrote in an email asking for continued patience in what she hopes and believes will be a short-term problem. ""At the same time we also know the hiring issues GFL is facing – we’re facing them here in the city also.”

Brosnan said GFL shared ""aggressive strategies they are using to address labor shortages"" and the city also agreed to a new strategy shortening truck travel to GFL's yard waste site.

As an alternative a post on the city's Facebook page reminded Livonia residents that they may take their own yard waste to a refuse disposal site Rat 32500 Glendale open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays.

South Lyon City Manager Paul Zelenak said residents have been experiencing collection delays from GFL for the past few weeks but it’s difficult to measure how many have experienced the problem or how many complaints have been received.

“Everything is still being picked up it may just be a day late” he said. “It might be a slight inconvenience that is the biggest thing but it's not piling up week after week. We are trying to be understanding with employers who are providing services to us.”

GFL’s contract with the city which expires in a year currently costs each resident $37 per quarter equivalent to $148 per year.

In an attempt to resolve issues Munem said GFL had implemented “operational changes” including offering incentives to attract and retain employees.

He added that while customers may continue to experience a one-day delay this week “we hope for a return to normal service levels by next week.”

Munem added that subscription customers have been issued credits for delayed service and call center operations have been enhanced to reduce call wait times although recent calls to numbers on the GFL website resulted in waits of at least 30-45 minutes without an answer.

In Novi where the city just started an eight-year contract with GFL Assistant City Manager Victor Cardenas said there have been 141 complaints on garbage pick-ups 61 regarding yard waste pick-up and 21 missed recycling pick-ups between July 1-27. He attributes this to new contractor hiccups and also noted there has been larger than normal volume due to storms.

“We’re happy with the new contractor and content with how they are working through issues we present they seem quick to resolve them” Cardenas said. “Everyone can relate to the first month on the job it’s a learning process and as in August and into September and the fall the number (of complaints) will drop dramatically.”

Greenock Hills homeowners long-time GFL customers weren’t waiting any longer.

Chuck Mason the president of the Greenock Hills Homeowners Association sent a letter to all the residents informing them of the HOA Board’s decision to switch vendors “After being very patient with GFL and trying valiantly to work our way out of the current trash/recycling/yard waste situation.”

They went with Dougie’s Disposal the only waste collection company that responded to their inquiries out of four that were contacted.

For hundreds of residents in low-lying areas near the Caroni River basin Saturday will be a day to hose down the slush spray disinfectant and remove items destroyed by the water which began to seep into their homes early on Friday.

Torrential persistent showers across the entire country on Thursday morning dumped significant volumes of rain which overspilled the the country's largest river and several of its tributaries.

Luckily water began to recede with two low tides on Friday and the rain gods heard the cries of the residents many of whom were devastated by the horrific floods of 2018 which destroyed all of their household items.

Some residents had to be temporarily evacuated from their homes and others transported on high vans to get home. Many villagers parked their cars on the main road to prevent flood damage.

Family pets and livestock were also secured on higher ground while stray pothounds waded in the dirty water.

Other parts of the country such as Sangre Grande Las Lomas Manuel Congo Debe Penal Woodland Barrackpore and South Oropouche were also inundated by floods as they have been whenever there is torrential rain which also forced the closure of some vaccination sites.

The flooding said to be the result of housing development slash-and-burn farming illegal quarrying unapproved development failure to replant trees and degrading of the hills in Maraval and Diego Martin also left a deluge of debris in its wake earlier this week.

The Meteorological Service issued a warning that many watercourses in Trinidad were on the brink of breaching their banks as of midnight on Thursday and later extended the warning until 4 pm on Saturday.

In a release it said up to 3.5 inches of rain fell in some parts of the country between Wednesday and Thursday and warned that with high tide flooding was possible in low-lying areas.

Mala Ramkissoon one of the long-time residents of El Carmen Village just east of St Helena junction said she and her family were awake from just after midnight when they began to notice water rising around their one-storey home.

Ramkissoon said her family was alerted shortly after midnight that the river had overspilled its banks and water was coming from east of El Carmen towards their home.

""We had to wake all night because we did not know what to expect. We wake whole night monitoring the water to see what was happening.

""Then the water start. When we got up about 5.30 this morning water started to come all through the garage and the back so we started to raise everything like the washing machine fridge. We still monitoring to see how high it will come"" she said during an interview on Friday morning.

""We had an experience worse than this in 2018. Oh my God that one was the worst. That one we had to actually had to run from the house and leave everything. We end up losing every single thing. As God is my witness I wouldn't like to go through that again.

""Because of that that is why we had to wake all night. The fright from that time till now it will never leave. So every time we have a flood we will always feel this way.""

Her neighbour Ramesh Lalsingh said he also had a sleepless night peering through his windows as the water levels rose.

Like the Ramkissoons he took precautionary measures to secure his appliances and mounted them on top of several clay blocks at the back of his home.

They both believe a regular drainage programme to clean the surrounding rivers canals and ravines could prevent future floods in the district.

Farmer Harry Boodram says he is prepared to lose his entire crop of patchoi chadon beni and melongene growing at the back of his home in El Carmen. He said he could not apply for any compensation as he did not have a farmer's permit.

In 2018 he lost everything and was left on the roof of his home for hours before help came. He doesn't know if he can rebuild again.

Councillors from the Tunapuna/Piarco Regional Corporation Richard Rampersad Samuel Sankar and Derek La Guerre who represent communities affected by the flood were on hand to help but there was little they could do until the flood subsided.

They said with the assistance of the Ministry of Works and Transport measures were taken to clear watercourses but the volume of rain was just too much.

By late evening as the water went down traffic snaked its way from Washington junction in Caroni to Kelly Village with many people slowing to look at the still-flooded fields.",,,,,,,,,

California grows more than 90% of Americans' canned tomatoes and a third of the world's. Ongoing drought in the state has hurt the planting and harvesting of many summer crops but water-hungry ""processing tomatoes"" are caught up in a particularly treacherous swirl of problems that experts say will spur prices to surge far more than they already have.

The drought threatens to imperil some of Americans' favorite ingredients. Pizza sauce marinara tomato paste stewed tomatoes and ketchup all hang in the balance. And this comes not long after completely unrelated shortage of pizza sauce and individual ketchup packets during the height of the food-delivery-crazed pandemic.

This also comes on top of already steep increases in the price of fruits and vegetables which have been rising since the coronavirus pandemic was declared last year.

For tomatoes higher prices could start taking hold soon if not already said Wells Fargo's chief agricultural economist Michael Swanson.

""If you're a producer or a canner and see these problems coming why would you not raise prices now in anticipation?"" he said adding that consumers don't see the price tag for a lot of the processed tomatoes consumed away from home. ""It's embedded in the menu board -- but it is one more reason prices at Chipotle and Pizza Hut will go up.""

In a normal year Aaron Barcellos a farmer in Firebaugh Calif. grows 2200 acres of processing tomatoes. This year he's decided to drop to 900 acres on his farm which is on the border of Merced and Fresno counties. He's left the remaining acres unplanted choosing to focus all of his precious water on almonds pistachios and olives grown on trellises -- crops that command higher prices and represent already-significant sunken costs.

""We get 8 inches of rain in a normal year. Last year we got 4½ inches"" he said. ""We got zero percent of our water allocation which forced us to buy a lot of expensive water and it doesn't make sense to put it on tomatoes.""

He said many growers have made the decision to use their limited water on permanent crops -- trees and things like grape vines -- choosing to forgo planting annuals like tomatoes onions and garlic or even letting crops already planted wither in the desertlike conditions.

This year's shortage of processing tomatoes has been a long time in the making. Farmers already had been planting fewer tomatoes. From 2015-19 fewer countries were importing American tomatoes partly because the dollar was strong which made U.S. canned tomato products more expensive. This created an oversupply of California tomatoes said Rob Neenan chief executive of the California League of Food Producers.

Processors cut back their orders and farmers planted fewer acres. At the same time partly because of a trade war a global shortage of steel sheets used to make cans for food production caused can prices to soar. Major processing plants in Williams Lemoore and Stockton Calif. closed citing higher production expenses leaving fewer places for growers to sell. Inventory at the beginning of 2020 was low and supplies had tightened up worldwide.

And then the pandemic hit. Cue the tomato hoarding.

Frank Muller a multigenerational tomato grower and president of M Three Ranches in Woodland Calif. in Yolo County euphemistically describes the market last year as ""disrupted.""

Early in the pandemic gallon cans of tomatoes sat unwanted on restaurant distributor shelves hurting those who sold to the restaurant industry and other food-service sectors -- this included caterers event arenas and corporate cafeterias that all closed in the spring of 2020. Meanwhile retail sales at grocery stores -- from 5-ounce cans of paste to 28-ounce cans of diced -- soared.

""If you were just selling to food service they didn't want all those tomatoes last year when restaurants closed. But if you were in retail you were in hog heaven"" he said going on to describe the uptick in pandemic pizza delivery which used up all of those gallon cans followed by a ketchup shortage when curbside pickups and food delivery services grabbed all of the little packets.

On top of the chaos of the supply problem there's still the threat of the coronavirus. Thousands of farmworkers throughout California have gotten sick on the job. Outbreaks still occur despite robust vaccination pushes.

Muller said there were few infections among his farmworkers because his tomatoes are mechanically picked but he's worried about worker shortages.

""We made it through last year but here we are and the workforce is still not returning because of enhanced unemployment benefits and that has affected seasonal processing plants"" Muller said.

All these problems are leading to fewer tomatoes. Processors reined in their estimate of how many tons of tomatoes they would contract for this year dropping it by more than a million tons and now even that looks overly hopeful. Muller said this is the first year processors didn't get all the tomato tonnage they wanted from farmers. ""This year will be some of the lowest inventory levels that we've ever seen"" he said.

Prices were already on the rise. In April processing tomatoes worldwide was 7% more expensive than during three previous seasons according to the World Processing Tomato Council. And before this summer's heat wave struck the California Tomato Growers Association had negotiated a price on behalf of farmers with the tomato processors that is 5.6% higher than last growing season because as Muller says farmers' expenses are rising. ""Supplies fuel drip tape anything with steel you name it it's going up.""

""Tomato processors have very expensive facilities that can only do one thing. If they don't want to be out of business they will have to bid up tomatoes rather than leave facilities idle"" said Swanson the agricultural economist.

Those price increases are expected to be passed along to the big companies that contract with processors agricultural experts say. Companies that have deep ties to tomatoes have yet to signal price increases. Kraft Heinz declined to comment about pricing for this article as did Campbell Soup which is a grower as well as a processor and uses about 2 billion pounds of tomatoes annually for its iconic soup V8 beverages and Prego and Pace sauces.

But a lot of these business decisions were made before the recent blistering record heat wave. Fresno County the top producer of tomatoes saw a long stretch of triple-digit temperatures. Yolo Kings Merced and San Joaquin are the next largest in terms of tomato production and all five are in the ""exceptional drought"" category the highest level on the U.S. drought map. Severe drought conditions have enveloped nearly all of California's landmass with the state's rain and snowfall well below average and its network of reservoirs holding much less water than usual.

Muller said in a typical year he has allocated 3 or 4 feet of water for every acre of farmland that needs irrigation. This year he got a smidgen of 1 foot just 3.6 inches of water per acre. Much less rain than usual as well as much less irrigation water than usual means growers must turn to groundwater which is more expensive to save their crops.

""In Yolo County we have relatively stable groundwater and replenishment of the aquifer. It's like having money in the bank so we're pumping water out of the ground like a withdrawal"" he said. ""We're just keeping our fingers crossed that the water table will maintain itself. That's caused a whole new level of concern.""

Greg Pruett chief executive of Ingomar Packing Co. in Los Banos a partnership of four growers says the situation is going to be significantly worse next year because while there were reasonable reservoir levels going into this growing season that will be entirely depleted by growers turning to groundwater.

Last month California's State Water Resources Control Board released an order that would cut farmers off from turning to rivers and streams in the Sacramento and San Joaquin river watersheds removing yet another source of water in an extreme drought year.

""Growers will have the worst water situation ever by the end of this growing season"" Pruett said. ""The cost increases this year -- in water cans all the other ingredients labor transportation -- all those things add up to major cost inflation. And that pales in comparison to what's going to happen next year.""

Bottom line he says: If the drought continues and the water table dips significantly many growers may not plant tomatoes next year.

Cerny had to select a drive that could match or outpace the PS5’s own 5.5 GB/s-capable SSD so it seems he selected a 7000 MB/s-capable drive from Western Digital.

4 Reviews

There has been a long wait for PS5 owners in regard to an official list of internal SSDs that are compatible with the console. While some details about the potential SSD selection have already been shared it seems Mark Cerny himself had his eye on a Western Digital drive that wasn’t included on a recent list of alleged compatible NVMe SSDs. The PS5’s lead architect apparently splashed out on the WD Black SN850 (stylized as WD_BLACK SN850) with heatsink.

Cerny posted about his purchase decision on Twitter gleefully sharing this comment with followers: “Couple of awesome options for 7000 MB/s ended up putting my $$ down on this one. Going to be SWEEET!!!”. Obviously he had been tempted by another model from another brand (Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus or Samsung 980 Pro perhaps?) but it was the WD Black SN850 that finally got the purchase seal of approval for the executive’s personal PS5.

The WD Black SN850 series starts with a 500 GB option (4100 MB/s write + 7000 MB/s read) and continues through the range with 1 TB (5300 MB/s write + 7000 MB/s read) up to a 2 TB SKU (5100 MB/s write + 7000 MB/s read). The PCIe Gen 4 M.2 drive costs from US$149.99 for the 500 GB unit without heatsink and goes up to US$549.99 for the 2 TB drive with heatsink.

These are the prices from the official Western Digital store but there are offers to be had with other retailers for those willing to look harder. No doubt PS5 owners will soon be snapping up WD Black SN850 drives in their droves thanks to Cerny’s personal choice.

PS5 finally enabled SSD storage expansion this week via an update rolled out to beta users. So far two manufacturers have confirmed drives compatible with Sony’s long list of requirements: Seagate and Western Digital.

In a message published on Twitter Cerny – who designed the PS5 hardware along with PS4 and Vita – revealed that he’s opted for the latter brand and purchased a WD_BLACK SN850 with Heatsink.

Manufacturer Western Digital first confirmed to VGC that its premium SSD was compatible with PlayStation 5 earlier this week. The SN850 retails for $139.99 / £140.99 for 500GB $249.99 / £218.99 for 1TB and $429.99 / £452.99 for 2TB.

Slightly cheaper versions are available without heatsinks but Sony recommends opting for SSDs with the latter included.

Cerny appeared to also give his blessing to the FireCuda 530 SSD made by Seagate on Sunday. On Twitter the engineer liked a tweet asking if the rival drive was also a good option for expanding PlayStation 5’s internal storage.

Seagate was the first storage manufacturer to declare one of its SSDs to be compatible with the PS5. Its FireCuda 530 with a heatsink attached will cost $169.99 for 500GB $274.99 for 1TB $569.99 for 2TB and $1049.99 for 4TB.

Sony released the full set of requirements for compatible SSDs this week but stressed that even some SSDs that meet the requirements may still not work. As such the onus has been placed on storage manufacturers to confirm which of their SSDs are compatible.

Storage expansion has been one of the most requested features since PS5 launched in November last year but its rollout has been hampered by the need for off-the-shelf drives to match the high specifications of PS5’s own high-bandwidth SSD.

While players can currently attach an external drive to the PlayStation 5 via USB these aren’t capable of playing PS5 games. They can only be used for playing PS4 games and can also store PS5 games currently not in use so they can be copied to the console’s main SSD storage when they’re ready to be played.

In order to extend the main SSD storage for playing PS5 games players will need to buy a high-speed M.2 SSD that meets Sony’s requirements and attach it to the console’s internal SSD mount which is currently inactive for everyone except beta users.

The only current solution for expanding the Xbox Series X/S SSD storage is Seagate’s bespoke Storage Expansion Card which launched at $219 for 1TB.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcmR3YXJlem9uZS5jb20uc2cvdGVjaC1uZXdzLXdkLW5hcy1kcml2ZXMtc2VjdXJpdHktZmxhdy1teS1jbG91ZC1vcy0zLXdkLWV4LXNlcmllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WD NAS drives: Another security flaw but here's what you can do about it,"WD NAS drives: Another security flaw but here's what you can do about it

Remember the zero-day exploits for WD My Book Live and My Book Live Duo products where users might find all their data wiped?

Unfortunately WD and its users' woes don't just end there. There are more WD NAS users affected according to security researchers who found vulnerability present in devices still running My Cloud OS 3. This affects more NAS drives beyond those two models flagged out explicitly for the earlier exploit and WD has advised users to upgrade to newer NAS units.

The researchers pinned the issue down to a remote execution code flaw that's present in all WD NAS drives running MyCloud OS 3. This allows a malicious actor to update your NAS device's firmware with a modified firmware which grants them the ability to execute commands on the NAS for ill intents. Because they can update the firmware there's also a chance these hackers could accidentally brick your NAS device through this process.



What are your options?

In short if you're not using a WD NAS running the newer My Cloud OS 5 your device is vulnerable to potential attacks that may harm you or others. The frustrating part of all this is that even WD's SMB-class EX series is affected unless you have the latest editions.

Short of buying a modern WD NAS that supports My Cloud OS 5 there are a few settings you can toggle off to circumvent the problems faced by older WD NAS drives.

Since the issues string from remote access restricting this is high on the list if you would like to keep utilising your current WD NAS drives.

Disable the ""Dashboard Cloud Access"" within your NAS admin interface. This turns off remote dashboard access to the device which is the primary entry point of abuse.





You can also go a step further to disable ""Cloud Access"" within your NAS admin interface also found in the same location as the Dashboard Cloud Access. While this isn't mentioned by online reports it's just good hygiene to keep your NAS for LAN-only usage especially when there's a remote access vulnerability and WD isn't going to help update the OS on their older devices.

If you can't update to My Cloud OS 5 it's highly likely that you're running an old WD NAS and you can disable ""Auto Update"" under ""Firmware Update"" section of the admin panel.

BOE members and administrators also offered congratulations to some of their hard-working dedicated staff who were retiring.

Buckhannon Academy Elementary School students Flynn Fleck Brock Williams and Braylee Squires received Upshur Stars during the meeting to mark their hard work and academic excellence during the last year especially in mathematics. BAES Principal Susanne Britton said the students are very wonderful high-spirited hard-working children.

“We wish that all of our students would put forth the effort these students do” Britton said. “They are very bright and hard-working and we appreciate them.”

Next to be recognized were Upshur County Schools staff members who have retired. Kayla Yocum technology systems/digital communication specialist said the retirees were being recognized for their dedication not only to the students of Upshur County but also to the staff and community as well. Those recognized include Union Elementary School custodian Tim Cogar bus operator Bennie Nazelrod bus operator Brenda McCourt and French Creek Elementary School secretary Debbie Smith.

After presenting the Upshur Stars more good news was announced for Upshur County Schools. Jessica Perkins and Kenna Leonard representatives from the Foundation for better schools in Upshur County Inc. presented a check for $5000 to Upshur County Transportation Director Jodie Akers and Upshur County Superintendent of Schools Dr. Sara Lewis Stankus. The donation from the foundation and Weyerhaeuser will be used to purchase ‘Buster the Bus.’

Representatives for The Foundation for Better Schools in Upshur County Inc. Vanessa Perkins and Kenna Leonard present a check to Upshur County Transportation Director Jodie Akers and Upshur County Superintendent of Schools Dr. Sara Lewis Stankus to help purchase ‘Buster the Bus’ which will help students learn about bus safety. Funds for the project were also make possible by Weyerhaeuser.

Perkins said the Foundation for Better Schools in Upshur County Inc. was formed for the betterment of Upshur County School students and staff.

“When Transportation Director Jodie Akers approached the foundation for funding for ‘Buster the Bus’ our foundation was elated and excited to be a part of an innovative way to educate the importance of bus safety” Perkins said. “Buster the Bus travels across the Nation teaching students the importance of bus safety and promotes safety awareness. It is an interactive remote operated bus with lights. It even squirts water at the students and engages students in the importance of bus safety.”

In a release from the Upshur County School System Buster the Bus is described as a three-foot-tall cartoonish replica of a full-size yellow school bus that makes learning bus safety fun. It will share safety lessons including how to cross safely staying out of the danger zone riding the bus safely how to safely wait for the bus how to cross in front of the school bus how to climb the steps how to ride school busses to and from school and how to evacuate the school bus.

During the business portion of Tuesday’s BOE meeting Assistant Superintendent Dr. Debra Harrison spoke about Policy 4002 which deals with students transfers or the transfer of students out of their attendance areas. Harrison said the policy adjustments were mandated by the passage of Senate Bill 375 during the 2021 Legislative Session.

“Basically it outlines open enrollment and provides policies [through] which an open enrollment can be denied and also the process for appealing the denial” Harrison said.

Upshur County BOE members voted unanimously to approve Policy 4002.

The corroded skeletons are all that remain of hundreds of abandoned oil wells that were drilled long before her family owned the land. The wells unable to produce any useful amounts of oil or gas were plugged with cement decades ago and forgotten.

But something eerie is going on beneath the land where Watt once played among the mesquite trees jackrabbits and javelina and first drove the dirt roads at 10 years old. One by one the wells seem to be unplugging themselves. They're leaking dangerous chemicals that are seeping into groundwater beneath her ranch.

Now 35 Watt believes the problems on her ranch which sprawls across the oil-rich fields of the Permian Basin are getting worse. In April she found crude oil bubbling from an abandoned well. In June an oil company worker called to alert her that another well was seeping pools of salty produced water a byproduct of oil and gas extraction containing toxic chemicals.

""I'm watching this well literally just spew brine water into my water table and then I have to go home at night and I'm sweaty and tired and smelly and I get in the shower and I turn on the shower and I look at it and I think is this shower going to kill me?"" Watt said.

A Growing Threat

The crisis unfolding on Watt's 75000-acre ranch offers a window on a growing problem for the oil industry and the communities and governments that are often left to clean up the mess. According to the Environmental Protection Agency 3.2 million abandoned oil and gas wells exist in the United States. About a third of them were plugged with cement which is considered the proper way to prevent harmful chemical leaks. But most haven't been plugged at all.

Many of the wells are releasing methane a greenhouse gas containing about 86 times the climate-warming power of carbon dioxide over two decades. Some are leaking chemicals such as benzene a known carcinogen into fields and groundwater.

Regulators don't know where hundreds of thousands of abandoned wells are because many of them were drilled before modern record-keeping and plugging rules were established. They are a silent menace threatening to explode or contaminate drinking water and leaking atmosphere-warming fumes each day that they're unplugged. Without records of their whereabouts it's impossible to grasp the magnitude of the pollution or health problems they may be causing.

The problem isn't confined to Texas. In recent years abandoned wells have been found under brush deep in forests and beneath driveways in suburbia. On the Navajo Nation a hiker stumbled across wells oozing brown and black fluid that smelled like motor oil. In Colorado a basement exploded killing a man and his brother-in-law who were repairing a water heater after an abandoned flowline had leaked methane into the house.

A Wyoming school shut down for more than a year after students and teachers complained of headaches for weeks. Air quality tests revealed high levels of benzene and carbon dioxide most likely from a nearby abandoned oil well. A garage in Pennsylvania exploded -- a consequence the state suspects of abandoned gas wells.

Experts believe the problem is getting worse. Even before the viral pandemic producers were declaring bankruptcy and abandoning oil fields after spending more on fracking operations than they ultimately could afford. Then the coronavirus halted travel obliterating demand for fuel and leaving less money to properly plug wells.

President Joe Biden who has built much of his domestic policy around a transition to cleaner energy sources wants to spend billions to put unemployed wildcatters to work plugging the wells. But Congress is unlikely to allocate enough money to seriously confront the issue.

""If all of a sudden we could switch to all green renewable energy that's great but these wells don't disappear; they're still going to be there"" said Mary Kang an assistant professor of civil engineering at McGill University in Montreal who was among the first scientists to call attention to the danger of abandoned wells.

Traces of Benzene

After the discoveries on Watt's ranch traces of benzene showed up in the well that supplies her cattle's drinking water. Chevron which owned at least two of the oil wells that recently came unplugged began trucking in drinking water while its crews tried to fix the leaks. But Watt worried that her animals might have consumed contaminated water. So she had her 600 head of cattle hauled off to another part of her ranch.

""At this point"" she said ""I cannot sell my cattle at market in good conscience because I have no idea what is in them.""

Though Chevron officials maintained that the cattle could safely return Watt disagreed.

She's haunted by a memory of crude oil bubbling up in a toilet bowl at her family's ranch when she was a teenager. Horrified they turned off the well that supplied their water and switched to another well. They never found the source of the leak.

Representatives for Chevron said the company is committed to re-plugging the two wells that recently sprang leaks.

But Watt fears that dozens of other plugged and abandoned wells on her ranch might be deteriorating and Chevron has no plans to check its other wells for problems. If Watt should inform Chevron of another leaking well ""if we have to take responsibility we will and we'll do the right thing by the landowner"" said Catie Mathews a company spokeswoman.

Hailing from a long line of cattle ranchers Watt never thought she'd be fighting this fight. After high school she graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and worked in intelligence for the Marines. Even after she obtained an MBA from Harvard she returned to the ranch.

She packs a gun but only on her own land. Though she's passionate about protecting it she doesn't want to be called an ""environmentalist"" -- that's a dirty word out here. But she has to save her ranch.

""The story of my family"" Watt said ""is a story of land if nothing else.""

Layers of Confusion

Dispiriting as her situation is Watt is luckier than some. She knows Chevron bears responsibility for two wells that recently sprang leaks on her property. But not every well has a clear responsible party. Some abandoned ones are so old and records so scarce that landowners or states are left to clean up the damage.

Molly Rooke who co-owns a family ranch near Corpus Christi Texas faced that predicament in 2019 when an orphaned well blew out on her property spewing chemicals. The 15000-acre ranch contained dozens of orphaned wells with exposed pipes not much taller than her own frame. Some pipes stuck out of the ground. Others were hidden in brush.

""We have problems finding the well head and that's above the ground"" Rooke said. ""Then you have all these pipes underground and there's no record of where those go.""

Her only records of these wells that were drilled in the 1920s were scattered old photos and papers. She tried to contact companies that used to pump oil from the wells. No luck. One well had already leaked into a nearby river.

Rooke's father tried for years to get the state to plug them. When he died she took over the fight. Rooke and the consumer rights group Public Citizen sued the Texas Railroad Commission over its decision during the pandemic to suspend rules requiring operators to plug abandoned wells within a year. After her lawsuit sparked attention the state sealed her wells.

""All the wells were so old they were ticking time bombs"" Rooke said.

Searching for Lost Wells

The first successful commercial oil well in the U.S. was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859. But few detailed records survived that early oil boom which lasted several decades. Not until a century later would the industry develop modern plugging standards which require filling abandoned wells with cement to prevent leaks.

These days some abandoned wells have metal casings intact. But others were stripped of metal during World War II making them hard to find. Still others were constructed from wood that rotted away and left only a hole in the ground.

Pennsylvania has located roughly 8700 orphaned wells mostly unplugged and in rural areas. Yet the problem is far larger. Based on historical photos and surveys Pennsylvania estimates that between 100000 and 560000 additional unplugged wells remain scattered around the state.

""We're not plugging fast enough to keep up with the wells we're discovering"" said Seth Pelepko an environmental program manager in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. ""Our list is not getting smaller. It's getting larger.""

Some states have taken to hiring well hunters who specialize in finding abandoned wells. They use metal detectors -- first in helicopter surveys then on the ground -- to seek steel well casings. But metal detectors can't detect wells cased in wood.

So they fly drones with laser imaging to seek depressions in the ground.

On her Texas ranch Watt uses some of the same techniques to seek problematic aging wells. She has driven her land looking for signs of trouble.

Sometimes she finds a dark patch of earth using a drone. She calls one of the biggest the ""elephant graveyard"" after a wasteland in the movie ""The Lion King.""

Rather than animal bones her graveyard contains blackened mesquite trees.

The sand there is dark and reeks of oil. But Watt's worry is the water below. Without it she and her longtime ranch foreman Marty White and his wife -- and their cattle -- can't live here. Water is the lifeblood of this place and all of West Texas.

""I told him 'I'll take care of you'"" Watt said of White. "" 'You're going to have to trust me and I don't know what it looks like but I'll take care of you.'""

Leaking Chemicals and Money

In addition to polluting groundwater the wells are accelerating global warming. Unplugged abandoned wells in the U.S. leaked 5000 times more methane than plugged wells did according to a 2015 study cited by the EPA. Unplugged wells leak 280000 metric tons of methane into the atmosphere each year according to an estimate by EPA though experts have estimated far higher totals.

That amount of methane packs roughly the same climate-warming power as the carbon dioxide emitted by all the power plants in Massachusetts in a year according to Daniel Raimi a fellow at Resources for the Future a research group.

Many states require companies to plug wells that are out of production and to post bonds in case they go belly-up. But the amounts are typically far lower than what's required to plug the wells leaving states or the federal government with hefty bills.

At the end of June Texas reported 7268 orphaned wells up 17% since 2019. An additional 146859 were considered ""inactive"": They were no longer producing oil but the owners hadn't yet been required to plug them. Many inactive wells may actually be orphaned wells said David Wieland regional organizer with the Western Organization of Resource Councils a network of grassroots groups focused on land stewardship. Some producers will let a well sit idle for a year or two he said and then produce just enough oil to avoid being required to plug it.

""That sort of hidden inventory is likely true in almost any state"" Wieland said.

Some states like Texas use fees collected from the oil and gas industry for cleanups. In 2018 alone oil-producing states spent $45 million plugging orphaned wells and $7.9 million restoring surrounding land according to the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission.

Cleaning Up the Mess

As the financial and environmental tolls of abandoned wells grow policymakers are searching for solutions. In his initial infrastructure proposal Biden suggested spending $16 billion to put people to work plugging old oil and gas wells and coal mines. Yet even that wouldn't be nearly enough to solve the problem.

Raimi of Resources for the Future estimates that a federal program to plug 62000 wells over a decade could create 15000 to 33000 year-long jobs. At a per-well cost of $76000 it would take roughly $160 billion to plug all the wells and reclaim the surrounding land whether it's companies or governments who pay the price.

Wyoming and North Dakota channeled millions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief funds into employing workers to plug abandoned oil and gas wells over the past year.

Watt's family never owned the mineral rights to the land and thus never profited from these wells many of which were drilled in the 1950s and were plugged in the four decades that followed.

She isn't looking for a drawn-out legal battle with Chevron or any other oil company with wells on her land. She simply wants assurance that the water is safe for her cattle and the people in her life to drink. She wants the land to be restored.

And she doesn't know if that's possible.

""I do not want to sue"" Watt said. ""All I want is everything cleaned up.""

Knowing that benzene has seeped into some of her water she has a nagging suspicion that the rare cancer that killed her mother might have been related to wells leaking toxic chemicals on her ranch. She will likely never know for sure.

More than anything she wants justice for the land her cattle -- and the legacy her family bequeathed to her. This is where she spread the ashes of her parents.

""My greatest fear when I lay down every night even before this well became unplugged is what if I do something to screw up the history of this ranch that's still being written?"" Watt asked.

""What if that history ends with me?""

Among its awards ESPN gave the 19400-seat $250 million stadium its 2019 Best MLS Stadium Experience Award and the stadium was named Best New Venue by SportsTravel. It was also nominated for Stadium of the Year by the Sports Business Journal.

The momentum halted when the pandemic shutdown hit in March 2020 and stadium and team officials had to regroup. The reality: They had to fulfill sponsorship deals with an empty stadium.

""Nobody realized how COVID was going to impact every team"" said Chris Wright chief executive of Minnesota United. ""We didn't realize at the time we would have zero fans in our new stadium.""

Now that a full audience is back Minnesota United is competing with the luster of a new stadium and in a marketing world that changed in the year of the pandemic.

Many professional teams including Minnesota's other pro sports franchises had hard discussions with sponsors during the year without fans and had to come up with creative solutions — some of which will change sports marketing for the future.

The Loons Minnesota United's nickname had a total attendance of 335291 fans at Allianz Field in 2019 equating to an average of being over capacity for each home game. The new stadium helped Minnesota United grow its corporate partnership base to 74 companies Wright said.

""Many conversations we began to have at the end of 2019 going into 2020 they progressed but obviously everybody in the advertising and sponsorship world was somewhat nervous about the deliverables that you have as a franchise given the COVID-19 situation that we're all working through"" Wright said. "" It was very very difficult.""

The deals that emerged showcased brands in new ways on television and the Loons' digital channels and apps. The pandemic also changed how brands partnered with the soccer team on community-facing activations like food drives blood drives and fundraisers.

When the games stopped

Julia Gutz Moller assistant vice president of sponsorships for stadium naming rights holder Allianz Life recalls the limbo when games stopped in 2020 and the feeling of losing branding power at Allianz. By July Major League Soccer decided to finish the season without fans in a tournament at Disney Wide World of Sports complex in Orlando.

Allianz worked with Minnesota United on branding opportunities in Orlando in addition to positioning digital exposure on the team's online channels Gutz Moller said.

Back in Minnesota Allianz identified other ways to use the stadium.

""Our relationship with the Midway community goes deeper than the stadium"" she said.

By summer the neighborhood had been hit by civil unrest following the police killing of George Floyd on top of the economic realities of the pandemic including unemployment especially among restaurant and leisure industry workers.

Allianz partnered with the pro soccer team and Keystone Community Services for a free event series at Allianz Field called Farmers Market in a Box. Through the partnership Allianz and Minnesota United distributed nearly 200000 pounds of food to over 3000 households Gutz Moller said.

""We were worried and feared that awareness would decrease and would go down with a shortened season and no fans and we found it stayed the same"" Gutz Moller said. ""In some places we saw some increases.""

In 2019 Allianz hosted foosball tables at the stadium. This year the foosball was relaunched in a digital format with a sweepstakes component. Allianz still anticipates setting up tables at some games this year but the digital component will stick for a while Gutz Moller said.

Creative solutions emerge

Chicago-based marketing firm IEG pegs the value of U.S. sports and entertainment sponsorships at $26 billion prior to the virus outbreak of which 54% was lost during the pandemic. That lost value equates to over half of paid rights fees.

The teams found each sponsor had different concerns said Ryan Tanke chief operating officer of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota Lynx.

""Every one of those conversations was unique and it needed to be treated as an individual conversation"" he said. ""There was no blanket approach. It had to be customized for each company.""

While each team dealt with its own financial challenges during the year their corporate partners were facing similar issues making some of those conversations more difficult than others.

""You don't want to assume everybody did well in 2020"" Tanke said. ""Some got hit hard. We did a lot of listening.""

For the Minnesota Twins the overarching strategy was to make sure corporate partners were satisfied said Laura Day chief business officer for the Twins which after 636 days opened Target Field to full capacity on July 5.

For some of their partners the Twins put a hold on their contract for the 2020 season she said.

""We maintained conversation and communication but in some cases we kicked everything to 2021 and said 'We're not going to expect you to step up and reach deep and pay us for something that we're not clear and certain we can deliver upon'"" she said.

About 120000 sponsorship agreements across the U.S. were affected by the pandemic according to IEG and 5000 brands were faced with decisions on how to recoup lost value. The firm estimates the sponsorship industry will need to make up $14 billion in lost value due to the pandemic.

Many pro teams were able to shift advertising placement in their buildings or create virtual advertisements to retain some value of their corporate partners' investment.

In summer 2020 the Minnesota Vikings like other National Football League teams began putting branded seat covers in the lower bowl. The team has 75 to 85 corporate partnerships which vary in form so conversations over how to proceed were complicated said John Penhollow the team's chief revenue officer.

""What we had to do was come up with what would be a set of ideas that could deliver the exposure they might have knowing nobody is physically in the building with us"" Penhollow said.

For example the Vikings asked the NFL for permission to air some of the team's historic games and ads that would have run during canceled preseason games aired during those historic replays.

During regular games U.S. Bank had signage on tarps and under the main scoreboard so the brand was visible for TV audiences said Christopher Lee the bank's senior vice president in charge of the Vikings stadium partnership. The bank also partnered with the team on a season ticket holder mailing promotion giving fans a kit that included things like game day recipes puzzles and other giveaway items.

""Our way of saying 'You can't come here so let us come to you'"" Lee said.

The Twins also had branded tarps over seats said Mike Clough the Twins senior vice president of ticket sales and brand partnerships. Major League Baseball also allowed teams to place logos on the back of pitching mounds in 2020 and the Twins added digital insertions behind home plate and center field for television audiences.

The National Hockey League's Minnesota Wild was able to place branded stickers on players' helmets which became a way for Xcel Energy — which has naming rights to the arena — to retain some of the value of the marketing deal said Mitch Helgerson the Wild's senior vice president of marketing. The NHL also allowed virtual signage around the glass for TV and streaming and also between the circles on the ice.

Going digital

Like other industries sports marketing was trending toward digital activations before the pandemic. But the fan restrictions accelerated the shift Helgerson said.

The Wild created two digital series a behind-the-scenes look at the franchise called ""Beyond Our Ice"" and a magazine format show called ""Wild Amplified."" Sponsors were featured during both.

Similarly the Timberwolves created ""Track the Pack"" an online series following players and coaches behind the scenes that amplified partnerships. The series led to a spinoff show called ""Voices"" which created a social opportunity to be part of conversation around social injustice following Floyd's death.

Moving forward the Twins see more digital opportunities Clough said. Those could be executed for example through the team's food and beverage mobile ordering platform.

Teams have become increasingly better at generating digital content to meet fans ""where they're at"" said Clint Warren a sports management lecturer at the University of Minnesota. That content simultaneously creates digital inventory that can be monetized.

Postpandemic sponsorship deals

Full stadiums make for better television experiences improving television ratings Warren said and a return to full capacity for area teams could also affect brand partnerships.

The Wild is ""bullish"" on the opportunities that come with fans returning to arenas and stadiums Helgerson said.

""We're always trying to find new partners"" he said. ""The pandemic created new opportunities to connect brands with wider audiences.""",,,

Loyal customers could benefit from the FCA’s ban on price walking for car and home insurance.

Price walking refers to the practice whereby new business customers are offered a more competitive premium than existing policyholders renewing a similar cover with the same insurer.

The regulator believes that price walking is anti-competitive. Instead providers will be required to offer existing customers the same terms at renewal as they would receive as a new customer.

From 1 January 2022 the FCA will require that firms “must not set a renewal price that is higher than the equivalent new business price”.

Uncertainty

Prices for new customers are expected to rise when the new rules come into force.

However Willis Towers Watson reported last week that comprehensive car insurance premiums have fallen by 12% (£17) since the second quarter of 2020 with UK motorists now paying £552 on average annually.

Premiums are now the cheapest they have been since early 2016 after falling by £16 (3%) in the second quarter of 2021.

Some insurers may seize the opportunity to grab market share by pushing through smaller rises for new business compared to their competitors.

Home insurance premiums have also dropped in the UK by 1.2% on average in part due to the government imposing lockdown restrictions to mitigate the spread of the Covid-19 virus - as a result both theft and water damage claims experienced a reduction according to Consumer Intelligence.

“There’s been a huge amount of noise from insurers and brokers about what will happen but ultimately we don’t know for sure” said Adam Powell chief operating officer at Policy Expert speaking to the Financial Times.

In July the Central Bank of Ireland made its own set of proposals to abolish price walking. However under its suggested rules discounts for new customers will still be allowed if “clearly disclosed” but the price offered in the second year renewal must match that offered during the first.

Last updated on: August 1 2021 08:41h.

The oldest licensed casino in Nevada turns 90 on Sunday. The Railroad Pass Hotel Casino and Travel Center south of Las Vegas will celebrate that anniversary on Aug. 10 with a birthday party at the resort on the southern outskirts of Henderson.

On March 19 1931 Gov. Fred Balzar signed Assembly Bill 98 legalizing gambling in Nevada. A few months later on Aug. 1 the Railroad Pass opened. It received the fourth gambling license in Nevada. The state never issued the first two licenses. The third license recipient later closed the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Joe DeSimone a Henderson real estate developer bought the historic property from MGM Resorts in 2015.

In addition DeSimone recently bought the former Eldorado Casino in Henderson’s historic Water Street District and spent $7 million renovating and rebranding it. The Water Street property is called The Pass.

Railroad Pass Improvements

At the Railroad Pass DeSimone has spent millions on improvements over the years including adding a Chevron gas station and travel center to attract truckers the newspaper reported.

The resort is 2367 feet above sea level on the Union Pacific route to nearby Boulder City and Hoover Dam according to a Nevada Handbook entry by Deke Castleman. The hotel-casino is on the main route for visitors driving up from Arizona. Gambling isn’t legal in Boulder City but the Railroad Pass is only four miles from the town.

DeSimone is upgrading the Railroad Pass with the construction of a $15 million hotel tower. The tower will add 127 guest rooms to the current 120 rooms at the resort the newspaper reported. The tower will be a Holiday Inn Express allowing guests to use Holiday Inn rewards points. Construction began this month.

The historic property also contains an original safe used for employee payroll. The safe has apparently not been opened since 1975 according to the newspaper. DeSimone doesn’t have the passcode to open the safe and doesn’t know what’s in it.

Las Vegas Makeover

While the Railroad Pass builds upon its historic past other well-known Southern Nevada casinos have been demolished and replaced by resorts with thousands of rooms.

On the Las Vegas Strip longtime hotel-casinos such as the Desert Inn Dunes and Sands were imploded during a megaresort era that gained traction with the 1989 opening of the Mirage Hotel and Casino. Developer Steve Wynn built the Mirage on the west side of the Strip where the Castaways once stood.

Last month the $4.3 billion Resorts World Las Vegas opened on the west side of the Strip where the Mob-connected Stardust was located.

The Stardust was the center of New York journalist Nicholas Pileggi 1990s true crime book Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas. Pileggi and director Martin Scorsese wrote the screenplay for the 1995 movie Casino based on the book. In the movie the Stardust was called the Tangiers for legal reasons.

Pileggi told Casino.org “old Vegas” had an intimate quality sometimes lacking today. However the newer resorts have their own appeal he said.

“It’s Disneyland” Pileggi said. “The climate is good. These hotel-casinos are spectacular. It’s just unbelievable.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYmlsbGllLWVpbGlzaC1qdXN0aW4tYmllYmVyLWRhdGUuaHRtbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Billie Eilish and Justin Bieber Ever Date?,"Billie Eilish and Justin Bieber have openly spoken about their close friendship but were they ever more than that?

Ever since Billie Eilish and Justin Bieber met for the first time the two singers have supported each other and spoken fondly of their close friendship. Eilish and Bieber both started their careers at 13 years old so they’ve often commented on how much they relate to each other. Has their relationship ever been anything more than friends? Here’s more on the bond between Eilish and Bieber.

Billie Eilish had a huge crush on Justin Bieber when she was younger

It’s no secret that Eilish was a major Belieber when she was younger. In her 2021 documentary The World’s a Little Blurry the singer detailed the early days of her crush noting that it began when she was around 12 years old.

“I literally remember sobbing into a pillow because I thought ‘I’m never gonna feel this way about anyone'” she said in the film noting her fear that her future partner would have to compete with Bieber.

Eilish’s mother Maggie Baird once revealed during her me & dad radio podcast that she and husband Patrick O’Connell even considered sending Eilish to therapy for her crush as Vanity Fair reported. Baird said Eilish was “sobbing” when she listened to Bieber’s “As Long As You Love Me” and spoke about the music video frequently.

“I just want to say we did consider taking you to therapy because you were in so much pain over Justin Bieber” Baird said to her daughter.

However Eilish explained to Baird that she wasn’t necessarily crying over Bieber; she just cried often between the ages of 13 and 15.

“There was a period where I cried every single day of my life when I was like 13 14 15” Eilish revealed. “Every single day I cried. And 17 18 I cried barely at all. I’m proud to say I barely cry anymore and it’s one thing I’ve overcome. This is a big deal.”

Did Billie Eilish have a relationship with Justin Bieber?

In April 2019 Eilish’s dream of meeting Bieber finally came true at Coachella. Bieber surprised the “Ocean Eyes” singer by appearing beside her in the VIP section to watch Ariana Grande‘s headlining set. Although she was in shock at first the two finally hugged and their friendship began. Just a few months after their meeting Eilish and Bieber released the “Bad Guy” remix.

Bieber married model Hailey Bieber née Baldwin in 2018 before he and Eilish met so the two singers never dated. However Bieber has made it clear that Eilish means as much to him as he does to her. In The World’s a Little Blurry Eilish revealed a touching message Bieber sent her after their first meeting.

“It’s moments like tonight when I’m reminded what I mean to people. Your love for me touched my heart. You are so special not for what you can do but for who you are. Remember that…You are an idol to so many. I’m excited to watch you flourish. You are beyond special” the message read in part as Entertainment Tonight reported. “Thank you for tonight. It meant just as much to me as it meant to you.”

During a 2020 interview with Apple Music 1’s Zane Lowe Bieber teared up while speaking about how protective he felt of Eilish.

“I just wanted to be a good example. It was hard for me being that young and being in the industry and not knowing where to turn and everyone telling me they loved me and … you know … just turn their back on you in a second” he said. “So if she ever needs me I’m gonna be here for her. But yeah just protecting those moments because people take for granted encounters and I just want to protect her. And I don’t want her to go through anything I went through.”

According to Eilish she and Bieber have remained close as she navigates fame. During a July 2021 appearance on SiriusXM Hits 1’s Morning Mash Up Eilish said Bieber often reaches out to support her.

“He’s a good friend of mine. He you know has been so helpful for me in terms of just like dealing with fame” Eilish revealed. “And he’ll call me sometimes and just say stuff that makes me just feel heard and like there’s somebody else that goes through the same stuff. So it’s really nice to have him.”",,,,,,

The east half of Elyria Swansea has been a mess this weekend.

Dozens of intersections are closed off as Xcel Energy workers dig into asphalt to replace thousands of feet of gas lines in the neighborhood. Residents have been without gas service since Wednesday when the company shut off service due to a pipe issue that caused the gas line to be flooded.

""It's been hard. We've got to boil our own water just to shower with warm water"" Jose Ramirez who is 15 told us on Saturday.

He was waiting in line at a taco truck that Xcel arranged to give out free food at Lorraine Granado Community Park. Hollie Velasquez Horvath a spokesperson for the utility said as many as 400 people who couldn't cook at home have come out for a hot meal each day. She told us 700 customers were affected since Wednesday though some service has been restored.

""We had the water pipeline and the gas pipeline rubbing together and it caused corrosion and water then started coming into the gas pipeline which is very dangerous"" she said on Saturday.

That meant the company needed to cut service for everyone.

""It took us a few days to figure out where the water source came from and then to purge everything out and now we're in the midst of repairs"" she said. They decided to go big on those repairs which means customers have to wait a little longer: ""What we've done is take advantage of the situation a little bit and repaired some of the other old aging pipes in the neighborhood so that we've got a really good clean system that will be reliable and resilient for our customers.""

Velasquez Horvath added everyone should have gas restored by Sunday night.

The outage arrived as the neighborhood dealt with all kinds of external pressures.

Construction crews are nothing new in Elyria Swansea. Just a few blocks from Xcel's crews workers Saturday continued to work on the I-70 expansion project which has rattled the neighborhood for years. The National Western Stock Show campus is also going through a huge redevelopment on the neighborhood's western edge and officials are trying to convince voters right now to spend hundreds of millions to complete their vision.

This week the numerous road closures and detours added another element of chaos to neighborhood streets.

Yadira Sanchez whose home still didn't have gas on Saturday said she could smell and taste gas in the air a few days ago. She told us about a recent conversation with a distraught neighbor.

""She was screaming and crying"" she said. She recalled her friend's words: ""This is BS! Something has to be done! Our lives are already impacted because of the construction. We have reroutes everywhere and now I can't even shower to go to work?""

At the park where people were in line to pick up free tacos Xcel staffers handed out fact sheets to help people navigate the difficult moment. Among the offerings were vouchers for showers at the Downtown Denver YMCA and a rec center in Commerce City.

""I was like oh yeah great. Let's go pay parking to take a shower"" she scoffed.

Sanchez was still wrapping her head around everything when we spoke. She said the outage plus everything else going on here gave her anxiety about the neighborhood's future. Especially since housing prices have grown here as they have all over the city she worries she might soon be pushed out of Denver altogether.

""I am going to be homeless"" she said. ""This is going to continue to escalate to the point that my family and I we're not going to have a home.""

Other residents took the outage with less panic. Ramirez for instance said he didn't mind boiling water to shower so much.

Marcus Chaney who was also waiting for free tacos said the last few days have been ""pretty rough"" but his biggest complaint was that he couldn't get anyone at Xcel to give him directions to the park. It's listed with a different name on Google Maps and the Xcel customer service rep he who took his call was based in Wisconsin and couldn't offer much help.

Christina Palacios grew up in Elyria Swansea and said the neighborhood has improved in her 27 years living here. The outage hasn't been too big a deal for now she recently impulse-bought an air fryer which took care of hot meals. But she was waiting for hot water to return so she could finally give her four-year-old a bath.

Still Palacios said she knows her neighbors have been struggling with noise and rumblings from I-70 construction and the work trucks that routinely lumber down the streets. Every now and then CDOT's crews hit a power line and knock out electricity for everyone who lives nearby.

If Xcel delivers on their timeline and gets gas running again by Sunday she'll be OK.

""It would be a bigger deal if it would go on (for longer)"" she said. ""That's when I would feel it.""

That was the first day college football senior recruits could sign their National Letters of Intent. Coaches administrators and media members huddled around fax machines waiting for the letters to come in as each team's fan base eagerly awaited the list of signees and the recruiting rankings from the experts.

But with the rise of social media the athletes themselves have begun to disseminate information — from offers to visits to commitments. The info comes in hourly daily all year round. The prominence of Signing Day (there are now multiple college football signing days in fact) has waned.

College hockey has never really had a day on the calendar with such prominence in the recruiting world.

But that may change beginning Sunday.

Due to a relatively new change in recruiting rules Aug. 1 is the first day juniors in high school are allowed to field official scholarship offers and verbally commit to programs. The change was aimed at getting rid of the young recruiting trend. Programs were routinely offering players as young as 14.

That doesn't mean we will see every prep junior commit on Aug. 1 but most coaches are expecting to see a small wave beginning Sunday for the Class of 2023. Coaches have been allowed to speak with the juniors since Jan. 1 and have been developing rapports.

It's worth noting that any commitments by juniors will be non-binding verbal commitments. Until they sign National Letters of Intent — they won't have a chance to do that until their senior year — they can still be contacted and offered by any team.

NCAA coaches are not allowed to comment on recruits until they sign National Letters of Intent.

Using Chris Heisenberg's recruiting site as a guide along with historical knowledge of the top recruiting areas for NCHC teams here are 15 names to watch when the Class of 2023 recruiting period opens Sunday:

Prospects to watch

1. Adam Fantilli forward Nobleton Ont.: Fantilli is the potential No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NHL Draft. He had an impressive first season with the Chicago Steel in 2020-21 scoring 18 goals and 36 points as one of the youngest players in the league. Fantilli scored eight goals in eight playoff games leading the Steel to the Clark Cup as USHL champions. Fantilli visited UND in March 2020 on the day college hockey season was wiped out due to the coronavirus pandemic. He was able to start his recruiting earlier than his classmates because he's accelerating his education. Fantilli also has visited Michigan where his brother Luca is committed.

2. Gavin Brindley forward Estero Fla.: Without a rare talent like Fantilli in the league Brindley would have been the talk of the 16-year-old crew in the USHL last season. He was impressive scoring nine goals and 22 points for Tri-City.

3. Carson Rehkopf forward Utopia Ont.: Not many first-round picks in the Ontario Hockey League Draft wind up playing college hockey but the 6-foot-3 Rehkopf is keeping that door open. He signed a tender to play for Muskegon in the USHL.

4. Jake Livanavage defenseman Gilbert Ariz.: Livanavage had an impressive rookie season carving out a regular role on the blue line for the USHL's most dominant team the Chicago Steel as a 16-year-old. Livanavage is the half brother of Arizona State star Johnny Walker.

5. Jayden Perron forward Winnipeg: Only five players have ever signed tenders with the Steel. Two are UMass-bound defenseman Ryan Ufko (a fourth-round pick of the Nashville Predators) and now-BU forward Robert Mastrosimone (a second-round pick of the Detroit Red Wings). The other three are Fantilli Livanavage and Perron. Perron is only 5-foot-8 but has big-time skill. He played for the Sioux Falls (S.D.) Power program last season.

6. Andrew Strathmann defenseman Beach Park Ill.: The Tri-City Storm signed Strathmann to a tender and both general manager Jason Koehler and head coach Anthony Noreen said they believe Strathmann is one of the best defensemen in the 2005 birth class.

7. Gracyn Sawchyn forward Chaska Minn.: Usually at this time of year nearly the entire U.S. Under-17 Team is college committed. Right now only two are committed meaning there will be a big push for recruiters to nab players from the Michigan-based National Team Development Program. Perhaps the most intriguing uncommitted player from the U17s is Sawchyn who had a big year at Shattuck-St. Mary's last season.

8. Sam Rinzel defenseman Chaska Minn.: Another impressive player from Chaska is Rinzel a 6-foot-4 right-handed shot defenseman who averaged more than a point per game at the high-school level last season.

9. William Whitelaw forward Rosemount Minn.: Whitelaw who played at Shattuck-St. Mary's last season was the No. 1 overall pick in the USHL Phase I Draft this year.

10. Quinn Finley forward Suamico Wis.: Finley the No. 1 overall pick in the USHL Phase I Draft last year suited up in 39 games for the Chicago Steel last season.

11. Zam Plante forward Hermantown Minn.: Plante had a dominant season with Hermantown High tallying 61 points in 20 games. Minnesota Duluth may have an inside track with Plante. His father Derek is the team's associate head coach.

12. Grayden Slipec forward Surrey B.C.: Slipec has committed to play for his hometown Surrey Eagles in the British Columbia Hockey League this season. Surrey coach Cam Keith said Slipec is already an NHL prospect and has potential to be the best local player ever to play for the Eagles.

13. Jimmy Clark forward Edina Minn.: Clark had 15 goals in 20 games for Edina High last season and was able to play a few games with the U.S. Under-17 Team.

14. Jayson Shaugabay forward Warroad Minn.: The top junior prospect from this area at the moment is Shaugabay who was recently selected to play for Team USA at the Five Nations Tournament in Switzerland. Shaugabay's cousin Adam played football at UND.

15. Matt Mania defenseman Olmsted Township Ohio: Cary Eades hasn't often signed players to tenders during his USHL time but Eades signed two this year for the Fargo Force: Mania and forward Tanner Walos of Hartland Wis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJubmJsb29tYmVyZy5jYS9oeWRyb2dlbi1nb2VzLW51Y2xlYXItYXMtdS1rLXJlYWN0b3ItcGl2b3RzLXRvd2FyZC1yZW5ld2FibGVzLTEuMTYzNTQzMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hydrogen Goes Nuclear as U.K. Reactor Pivots Toward Renewables,"(Bloomberg) -- The $28 billion Sizewell C nuclear station is touted as an anchor for Britain reaching net-zero emissions yet its reactors will compete with wind farms over the North Sea horizon. On gusty days where will the plant’s excess power go? Toward making hydrogen.

Nuclear developers in Europe North America and Russia are looking at the clean gas as an outlet for their low-carbon power to maximize revenue from one of the most expensive energy assets on the planet. They also want to capitalize on the $70 billion-plus pledged by governments to help develop the industry as a way to reach climate goals.

Electricite de France SA wants to make hydrogen at the proposed 20 billion-pound Sizewell C plant on the southeast coast marking the first time these technologies would be combined on a commercial scale in Europe. With enough supply clean hydrogen could meet a quarter of the world’s energy needs by 2050 and annual sales have potential to reach 630 billion euros ($744 billion).

“The amount of clean hydrogen that we’re going to need to really decarbonize our economic sectors is just immense” said Elina Teplinsky a Washington-based partner at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP who focuses on nuclear projects and deals. “We need all of the hydrogen production sources that are available -- we’re going to need nuclear.”

Electricity grids want more renewable-power sources as nations commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the point where their economies are carbon-neutral. Operators are preparing to run networks on 100% renewables at some times of the day meaning nuclear natural gas and coal sources won’t be needed. And that means less revenue for those plant owners.

On the days when wind solar and hydropower produce enough the low-carbon electricity generated by Sizewell C would be diverted to an electrolyzer producing clean hydrogen. The waste heat produced by the atomic plant also can be used to make the process 10% more efficient according to EDF. If the company secures planning permission and the necessary financing the facility likely will come online in the early 2030s.

“It’s not nuclear versus wind versus solar - we need to use everything and cooperate to make the most of the technologies” Julia Pyke Sizewell C’s financing director said in an interview. “Ideally you’d have the electrolyzer supplied both by nuclear and by wind.”

The U.K.’s long-awaited hydrogen strategy is expected to be technology neutral leaving the door open for reactors. That blueprint could be released in coming days.

EDF’s plans were imperiled amid reports Britain wants to oust China’s state-owned nuclear energy company from all future power projects. The Chinese have a 20% stake in Sizewell C but the U.K. government says the project will move forward with alternative financing.

Hydrogen produced using nuclear fuel is dubbed “pink hydrogen” within the industry. The U.K. grid operator National Grid Plc modeled production of the fuel in its long-term report this year for the first time. As much as 28 terawatt-hours of electricity from reactors could be siphoned off to make the clean gas by 2050 – the equivalent of about 14% of the nation’s production.

Trial runs to pair these technologies also are being held in North America. The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded $26.2 million to two projects run by Xcel Energy Inc. and FuelCell Energy Inc. to help nuclear plants switch between electricity generation and hydrogen production when necessary.

Bloom Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory are testing an electrolyzer run on nuclear-generated electricity.

“This expands the markets for nuclear power plants” said Tyler Westover project lead at the laboratory.

Canada gets almost 15% of its electricity from nuclear stations and is looking to expand production using small modular reactors. In its hydrogen strategy published in December the government outlined a role for nuclear electricity to produce hydrogen at off-peak times. Bruce Power LP is studying the economics and opportunities for the two technologies.

Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 could require as much as $173 trillion in investments globally according to BloombergNEF. By then Britain’s energy market will have transformed: renewable capacity is expected to triple while electricity demand doubles. The U.K.’s Nuclear Industry Association estimates that a third of the nation’s hydrogen could come from atomic energy.

But there are questions about the economics of this marriage and whether it’s the most efficient use of investor money. Hydrogen and nuclear are capital-intensive industries by themselves and combining the two will only increase project costs said Rob Gross professor at Imperial College London and director of researcher UKERC.

“The proposition would take a very expensive thing – a nuclear power station – and add on another expensive thing – hydrogen production” he said.

While the two are highly combustible the nuclear fuel is nowhere near the hydrogen being produced.

Germany the continent’s biggest economy turned its back on the technology after the 2011 disaster at Japan’s Fukushima plant a stand that’s made cutting emissions more difficult. Belgium and Spain also plan to exit atomic energy.

With ample supply Russia could be the first to deliver nuclear-produced hydrogen.

EDF signed a cooperation agreement in April with Rosatom Corp. which operates 38 nuclear units at 11 sites. Rosatom says developing hydrogen production is a priority and it plans to export the fuel to Europe. The same type of smaller reactor -- purpose-built to produce hydrogen -- is being considered by both the U.K. government and Rosatom.

The U.K. has set a target for 5 gigawatts of hydrogen production by 2030 envisioning its use in road transportation home heating and ship propulsion. EDF currently runs 27 plants in the U.K. and France and is building two more. Sizewell C would be its 30th.

“The nuclear industry does need to broaden its ambition and recognize the value of these opportunities” said Kirsty Gogan managing director of consultant Lucid Catalyst in London and member of a government nuclear advisory board. “We have started to see this happening.”

KFC believes it has the winner in a quarter-pound all-white meat double-breaded Extra Crispy chicken breast filet served on a toasted brioche bun; crispier thicker pickles; and mayo or spicy sauce. Each sandwich is made when ordered so it is served piping hot the company said. The new KFC Chicken Sandwich is available in select markets and will be available in all 4000 KFC restaurants in the United States by the end of February.

“We tested the new KFC Chicken Sandwich in Orlando last spring and we nearly doubled our sales expectations so we knew that we had a winner” said Andrea Zahumensky chief marketing officer for KFC US a subsidiary of Yum! Brands Inc. “Many customers hadn’t considered KFC as a part of the chicken sandwich conversation but anyone who tastes this sandwich will know without a doubt that we’re playing to win.”

The new KFC Chicken Sandwich is part of the brand's food innovation strategy. The company said the KFC food innovation team developed the sandwich to complement the brand’s fried chicken. The team “…tested pickles with eight variations of thickness and collaborated with six different bakeries on more than ten recipes in order to find the right bun to hug the new the quarter-pound all white meat double-breaded Extra Crispy chicken breast filet in just the right way.”

Customers may order the KFC Chicken Sandwich à la carte for $3.99 or as part of a combo meal which includes KFC Secret Recipe Fries and a medium-size drink for $6.99.

KFC'S new chicken sandwich is the latest launch in the ongoing chicken sandwich wars waged between Popeyes and Chick-fil-A in August 2019. In May 2020 Golden Chick threw its hat in the ring. In June 2020 Checkers and Rally’s restaurants Sonic and Lee’s Famous Recipe Chicken introduced their own iterations. In October 2020 Wendy’s Church’s Chicken and Zaxby’s debuted chicken sandwiches. Most recently McDonald's announced a trio of new chicken sandwiches set to appear on menus at the end of February.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWNkb25hbGRzLXN0YXJidWNrcy1hbmQtdGFjby1iZWxsLWNyZWRpdC1kcml2ZS10aHJ1LXdpdGgtc3VjY2Vzcy0yMDIxLTfSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL21jZG9uYWxkcy1zdGFyYnVja3MtYW5kLXRhY28tYmVsbC1jcmVkaXQtZHJpdmUtdGhydS13aXRoLXN1Y2Nlc3MtMjAyMS03P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Starbucks and Taco Bell credit drive-thru with success,"Fast-food chains are continuing to emphasize drive-thru improvements.

Restaurant dining rooms are reopening in most of the US but Americans are still drive-thru devotees.

Major fast-food brands reported quarterly earnings this week and executives made it clear that drive-thrus are still huge for business.

Yum Brands Chief Financial Officer Chris Turner emphasized Taco Bell's drive-thru success over the last quarter to investors in an earnings call. ""The drive-thru experience is an increasingly critical competitive advantage for our brands"" he said noting that drive-thru times improved by six seconds year over year even as the chain served four million more cars.

Taco Bell has increasingly prioritized drive-thrus over the last 18 months and made some major changes to improve the drive-thru experience. To some customers' dismay last year the chain cut over a dozen items including potatoes and and Nachos Supreme to shorten wait times. The cuts paid off — in the third quarter of 2020 Taco Bell served 30 million more customers than in all of 2019 and each order was completed 17 seconds faster.

Starbucks similarly credits its drive-thrus with the chain's strong recovery as pandemic restrictions eased. ""We continue to see strong sales recovery in the rural and suburban areas of the business and in particular drive-thru"" Group President North America and COO John Culver told investors.

Culver said that Starbucks is focusing on decreasing drive-thru wait times for customers. The chain has been testing new strategies for keeping drive-thru wait times down even as customizations remain popular and average ticket size is elevated. Baristas can take orders through digital drive-thru screens which the company previously said are installed at about 3800 stores. Finally Starbucks is also renovating 150 US drive-thrus that are space-constrained to make them more efficient Culver said.

McDonald's also emphasized the importance of drive-thrus in an earnings call. CEO Chris Kempczinski began the call by talking about the ""iconic"" McDonald's experience and referencing how the chain pioneered drive-thrus in the early 1970s. He touted McDonald's improved drive-thru times which have shortened by 30 seconds in the last several years with a slight three-second setback this year. He says times are still improving though hurt by the labor shortage.

Like its competitors McDonald's is also investing in drive-thrus to make them even fast and more efficient. McDonald's corporate has been pushing franchisees to upgrade drive-thrus since 2019 after years of increasingly long wait times. Since then many of the chain's 14000 US drive-thrus now have double lanes which are key to reducing bottlenecks. McDonald's is also still working with AI technology in drive-thrus from the startup it bought in 2019 Aprente. Kempczinski said that the technology is in ten drive-thrus right now.

The future of indoor dining is uncertain right now as the Delta variant of COVID-19 spreads and some municipalities reinstate mask mandates even for vaccinated customers. Drive-thrus allowed fast-food chains to thrive in 2020 and these companies are continuing to invest in the drive-thru.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.’s (NYSE: CMG) stock in late July reached an all-time high as quarterly sales approached $2 billion for the first time under CEO and Chairman Brian Niccol.



More’s in store: Niccol thinks the restaurant chain can eventually grow to 6000 locations in North America with the average location generating more than $3 million annually or roughly $18 billion in annual sales for the Newport Beach-based chain.



Chipotle’s recipe for growth is easy to remember: open successful restaurants leverage digital and bolster the brand.



Niccol to that end recently told analysts late last month digital is helping make Chipotle a “food-focused digital lifestyle brand.”



It’s a mouthful but the concept lends to Chipotle’s focus under Niccol.



The chain’s done a lot to build its brand around the conversation in sustainable farming playing up how fresh its ingredients are and how it wants to support the next generation of farmers.



A bigger push around digital has made tech the conduit to gain social currency and relevance. Examples include Pepper the chatbot in the Chipotle app for frequently asked questions a digital-only kitchen in New York to expedite orders Chipotlanes to also service digital orders faster piloting TikTok for hiring and creating a video game for its now 23 million loyalty program members.

Shares Up 450%



The brand building marks another achievement for Niccol who has taken the company’s stock to more than $1800 a piece as of last week for a market cap of $52 billion. Chipotle is OC’s second-most valuable public company behind the nearly $70 billion-valued Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (NYSE: EW).



Chipotle’s stock has seen a run up of more than 450% since Niccol took the top spot in March 2018 after previously heading Irvine-based Taco Bell Corp. as CEO.



By comparison multi-unit restaurant operator Yum Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) of Louisville Ky.—parent to Taco Bell The Habit Burger Grill KFC and Pizza Hut—trades at around $130 per share with a market cap of $39 billion.



Most analysts covering Chipotle’s stock maintain a hold rating including Deutsche Bank’s Brian Mullan who characterized the company as “solid all around” in a research note last month. Mullan increased his price target to $1630 from $1495 and maintained a hold rating.



BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Strelzik noted Chipotle “is emerging from the pandemic stronger” as he reaffirmed the market perform rating on the chain’s stock and raised Chipotle’s price target to $1750.



“Loyalty remains in its early innings and enhancements to digital technology and CRM [customer retention management] capabilities should allow [Chipotle] to increasingly leverage its loyalty member base” Strelzik wrote in his research note also pointing to the runway for dine-in sales to continue to improve and menu innovation such as a brisket offering that could roll out later this year.

Digital Nearing $1B



Even as Chipotle restaurants bounced back in the recently ended quarter recovering 70% of pre-pandemic sales digital still held its own with about 80% of that channel’s revenue recovered.



“This highlights our digital experience’s sticky because it is everything customers love about Chipotle with added convenience” Niccol told analysts in July. “And due to the pandemic many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative and often incremental occasions.”



In other words the channel’s surge last year wasn’t just a short-term factor to ward off the impact of COVID on both the company and the consumer end.



Digital saw a 10.5% lift in the second quarter from the year-ago period to total $916.5 million in the quarter. That accounted for nearly half of the quarter’s $1.9 billion in total revenue up 38.7% year-over-year.



Chipotle’s got the pull to make good on gaining more ground.



Its restaurant footprint totals more than 2850 locations with a target to open more than 200 new ones this year. Chipotle’s workforce is now over 100000 with a stated goal for its July 15 career day to hire another 15000.



A spokesperson for the chain said thousands have been hired as a result of the recent career day with the company still working through rescheduled interviews. The company’s pilot using TikTok has seen a “steady flow of video submissions” for restaurant jobs the spokesperson said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuaW4vcmV0YWlsL25ld3MvbWVldC10aGUtdHlwaWNhbC10YXJnZXQtc2hvcHBlci1hLW1pbGxlbm5pYWwtc3VidXJiYW4tbW9tLXdpdGgtYS1ob3VzZWhvbGQtaW5jb21lLW9mLTgwMDAwL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg0OTIyMTUwLmNtc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the typical Target shopper a millennial suburban mom with a household income of $80000,"Target has more than 1897 stores in the US and makes over $92 billion in annual sales.

has more than 1897 stores in the US and makes over $92 billion in annual sales. The Minneapolis-based retailer has the second-highest customer loyalty coming in behind Walmart.

Target is the seventh-largest retailer in the world pulling in more than $106 billion in sales in 2022. The chain operates across the US with 1897 stores spanning all 50 states and it employs 450000 people.

Nearly eight out of 10 US shoppers are Target customers according to data from the analytics firm Numerator prepared for Insider.

Numerator found that Target's typical shopper is a white suburban mother between 35 and 44 years old. She typically has some college or a 4-year degree with a household income of $80000.

The typical customer visits Target every other Saturday or so — about 23 trips per year — and picks up seven products for a total cost of about $50 per trip Numerator found.

Target enjoys higher than average customer loyalty when compared with other major retailers coming in second place behind Walmart. The brand also adds a new customer for each one that it loses.

In its annual report Target says sales are roughly similar across four of its five product categories: apparel and accessories food and beverage ""hardlines"" (like appliances or sporting goods) home furnishings and décor while sales of beauty and household essentials account for a quarter of its revenue.

Earning an education across the globe is challenging in plenty of ways. From being far away from family and friends to adjusting to language and cultural differences international students have enough to think about in a normal year. But with a pandemic in the mix obstacles that once seemed difficult became major concerns for many who chose to study at Western Michigan University from abroad.

Thankfully many international students were able to meet basic needs through the support of WMU and the Kalamazoo community. Ajjay Amulraaj was one such student. Having recently completed his MBA in Kalamazoo through Western’s partnership with Christ University in India he says graduation may not have been possible without assistance from the community.

“The pandemic was the time I made my emotional connection with Kalamazoo” Ajjay says. “It was one of the most difficult times in the entire world and was even more difficult for international students.”

With travel restrictions in place and no ability to earn an income Ajjay feared that he wouldn’t be able to pay for his rent utilities and groceries nor could he return home. “But Kalamazoo has always been a welcoming city” he says “and WMU and community members jointly helped international students to a great extent.”

Through donation programs organized by faculty staff students and local residents more than 400 international students—including Ajjay—were able to stay in Kalamazoo and complete their courses. Now he wants to pay that kindness forward.

Ajjay recently took a position as senior analyst R&D IT with Zoetis a global animal healthcare company based in Kalamazoo. He hopes to contribute to the local community by living and working in the city and reciprocating the generosity that was shown to him during such a difficult time. “I love the people in Kalamazoo and I would love to continue to grow and work at Zoetis” he says.

Despite all of the challenges of the past year Ajjay says his MBA experience through WMU and Christ University has been incredibly rewarding. “The best part about this program is that you get to learn from professors from different nationalities which truly opens you up” he says.

“My concentration was in computer information systems and many of the courses incorporated tools and technologies that are very relevant to the current world. Also the flexibility has been a great advantage. The MBA helped me improve the skills required for both technical and managerial roles becoming a more competent professional who can wear many hats.”

Ajjay adds that people like Dr. Tim Palmer interim chair and professor of management his professors at the Haworth College of Business and his coworkers at Zoetis are “amazing.” He says “The best thing about Kalamazoo is the people. The individuals I have interacted with have always been warm and understanding and never made me feel different. I always felt like I was one of them and they helped me stay positive during difficult times. This truly feels like a home away from home.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
