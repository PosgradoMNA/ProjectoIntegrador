Industrial scientists from 3M Abb­Vie AstraZeneca Bristol Myers Squibb Merck & Co. Novartis and Pfizer are being recognized with the American Chemical Society’s 2021 Heroes of Chemistry Awards. These researchers’ contributions have led to advancements in treatments for bloodstream infections cancer diabetes and heart failure.

The Heroes of Chemistry Awards are ACS’s highest honor for industrial chemical scientists who make up a significant proportion of ACS’s membership. The program started in 1996 is sponsored by the ACS Board Committee on Corporation Associates and celebrates industrial advances that have benefited humankind.

Here’s a look at the commercial products being honored this year:

3M: Tegaderm CHG Chlorhexidine Gluconate I.V. Securement Dressing

Credit: 3M

Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are fatal to more than a quarter of patients who contract one. Over 40000 cases of CRBSIs are reported per year. Contact with the catheter insertion site—for example when a clinician lifts the tape and gauze to look for signs of infection—can expose the site to bacteria and increase the risk.

3M’s Tegaderm CHG Chlorhexidine Gluconate I.V. Securement Dressing is a highly breathable transparent dressing that contains a gel pad of the antimicrobial chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG). The dressing is placed over the insertion site for central venous catheters. Clinicians can see through the dressing minimizing contact with the insertion site. The dressing is clinically proven to reduce CRBSIs.

“When we got the evidence that we could significantly reduce bloodstream infections that was just the top of my career” says Bob Asmus a retired corporate scientist from 3M and one of the award winners. Asmus led the development of Tegaderm CHG which launched in 2008.

CHG is clear which made it the antimicrobial of choice for this dressing Asmus explains. But CHG photodegrades is thermally unstable and is prone to forming insoluble salts with certain anions. The Tegaderm CHG team successfully protected the CHG from these factors while ensuring the antimicrobial could still diffuse from the gel pad to the insertion site.

In 2018 3M introduced a new product Tegaderm Antimicrobial I.V. Advanced Securement Dressing a lower-cost dressing intended for use with peripherally inserted IV catheters. Incorporating the antimicrobial directly into the adhesive as opposed to in a gel pad simplified manufacturing explains Ying Zhang a senior product development specialist in 3M’s medical solutions division and one of the award winners.

3M is now exploring the next generation of transparent securement dressings.

AbbVie: Venclexta/Venclyxto

Cancer cells are able to short-circuit a form of programmed cell death known as apoptosis and this ability gives them a survival advantage. Understanding resistance to apoptosis is a critical area in cancer research. Several hematologic cancers depend on B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) proteins to inhibit apoptosis.

AbbVie’s venetoclax marketed as Venclexta in the US and Venclyxto outside the US selectively inhibits BCL-2 proteins. The drug gives patients a new option to treat certain blood cancers.

Venclexta “took an entirely new approach to treating cancer by inducing programmed cell death specifically in cancer cells whereas most other chemo­therapies just kill fast-growing cells” including normal blood cells explains Steve Elmore vice president for drug discovery science and technology at Abb­Vie and one of the award winners.

Elmore led the team that discovered venetoclax which took more than a decade of lab work. Venetoclax was the first marketed drug specifically designed to inhibit a protein-protein interaction.

Elmore says it gives him a sense of purpose and satisfaction to know that “our science and the stuff we did in the lab is helping people reclaim their lives.” He believes there are other opportunities for new drugs to act on different pathways of programmed cell death. “I think [Venclexta] is just the tip of the iceberg” he says.

AstraZeneca/Bristol Myers Squibb: Farxiga

Hyperglycemia or high blood glucose is a manifestation of type 2 diabetes and over time can lead to serious health problems. The drug Farxiga (dapagliflozin) can help treat type 2 diabetes by inhibiting excess glucose from being reabsorbed from the kidneys into the blood instead causing the glucose to be excreted into the urine.

Along with glucose Farxiga also causes some excretion of water and sodium. As a result the drug promotes a modest lowering of body weight and blood pressure. While the exact mechanisms are still being worked out the combination of these effects has shown benefits for cardiovascular disease and kidney disease in addition to its original indication as a diabetes treatment.

The compound was discovered by a team at Bristol Myers Squibb led by award winner Bill Washburn and developed as part of a clinical-stage partnership between Bristol Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca.

Farxiga represented a new class of sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. The shift from an O-linked glucoside to a C-linked glucoside gave the compound more stability in the body and enabled the successful clinical development of SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetes and protection against morbidity from heart failure and chronic kidney disease.

Bruce Ellsworth executive director and head of fibrotic disease discovery chemistry at Bristol Myers Squibb and another award winner says it’s a thrill “that this training in organic chemistry could really lead to something that actually benefits human health.”

“It’s very rewarding and very gratifying to see” says award-winner Nayyar Iqbal vice president for clinical metabolism at AstraZeneca. “Our baby is now mature and grown up.”

Merck & Co.: Keytruda

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Keytruda a humanized monoclonal antibody treatment is a checkpoint inhibitor that binds to and blocks a protein called PD-1 thus helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.

Keytruda represents new hope in the treatment of various cancers. “People are seeing a meaningful benefit in many cancer indications” says Parimal Desai vice president of engineering in Merck & Co.’s manufacturing division and one of the award winners.

Keytruda was initially approved to treat metastatic melanoma but today is approved for more than 30 indications across 16 different tumor types. Tumors that express PD-1 can generally be classified for Keytruda treatment.

When it saw the promise of Keytruda “Merck moved heaven and earth” Desai says. “The whole company got aligned.” Desai led a team of more than 1000 scientists and engineers to expedite chemistry manufacturing and control (CMC) development. The company compressed CMC development timelines and expanded production volumes to keep pace with positive data from clinical trials. The US Food and Drug Administration granted the drug accelerated approval in 2014.

Desai expects that anti-PD-1 inhibitors either alone or in combination with other drugs will change the practice of cancer treatment. “Doctors are feeling for the first time that we have control over a terminal disease” he says.

Novartis: Entresto

People over 40 years old have a 20% lifetime risk of developing heart failure which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body.

Novartis’s Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) has been approved to reduce the risk of death and hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction meaning the heart’s left ventricle does not pump sufficiently. It has also been approved in certain countries to treat chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Entresto is a combination angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor. Valsartan blocks angio­tensin II receptor type 1 which causes blood vessels to dilate and reduces extracellular fluid (ECF) volume. Sacubitril is a prodrug that is activated to sacubitrilat; this metabolite inhibits the enzyme neprilysin thereby increasing the levels of certain peptides that cause blood vessels to dilate and ECF volume to lower as a result of sodium excretion.

The American College of Cardiology now recommends Entresto as the frontline therapy ahead of the previous standard of care which was based on ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.

Pfizer: Lorbrena

Credit: Pfizer

For patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer treatments can fail as a result of resistance mutations or brain metastases. Drugs that cross the blood-brain barrier to treat such metastases can be risky because of the potential for side effects.

Lorbrena is an ALK inhibitor that was developed to treat all known drug-resistance mutations plus brain metastases. It was designed to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. “It was risky but it was a risk we wanted to take” says Ted W. Johnson a research fellow with Pfizer and one of the award winners.

The Pfizer team used structure-based drug design which allows researchers to target a specific mutation that’s driving a tumor. This approach meant the compound was safer and gave a higher likelihood it would be efficacious in the clinic.

“As someone in research most of the programs I work on never make it to Phase 1 clinical trials” Johnson says. He was the co–project lead for the Lorbrena program and is the coinventor of Lorbrena.

Lorbrena is an oral therapy and has less severe side effects than traditional chemo​therapy. It was approved as a frontline therapy earlier this year. Johnson believes Lorbrena has opened the door to more such targeted therapies.

Muller won the 1m springboard Final yesterday and today she confirmed to be the best also from the 3m distance. She took the lead after the second dive (Reverse 2.5 somersaults) and did not leave her opponents any chance despite some imperfection in her last dive (405B - Inward 2.5 somersault). Her final score was 438.90 points 1.6 points ahead Russia's Elizaveta Kuzina who got silver. Chiara Pellacani of Italy is bronze medallist with 425.00.

Jette Muller the winner: ”I am really happy with my performance and I hope I will stand here after synchro final too. 1 meter was easy because I could do there more twists. It is easier to control your dive. Today the most difficult dive for me was the Inward 2.5 somersaults. I want to say that this pool brings me luck. Before that I was in Kуiv three times. Actually it is my second home. ”

Elizaveta Kuzina silver medallist:” ""This is my first award at the World Cup although I could have performed better I missed the last dive. It was hard to dive in the morning but in the evening I dived and everything was fine. So overall I'm happy. I like everything here very good conditions: food accommodation the pool itself - all at the highest level. ""

Chiara Pellacani bronze medallist: ”A medal is always a medal. I am satisfied with this result although I could have dived better. I must say I had very strong rivals. ”

Three of the 12 participants of Girls 3 m springboard final took part in the same final at the previous Junior World Diving Championship 2018 in Kyiv. The closest to the medal then was Yuliana Klueva (Russia) who took 4th place. Today she repeated her result. Steffanie Madrigal of Colombia Emilia Nilsson Garip of Sweden and Ukrainian Anna Arnautova ranked 5 to 7 scoring within 6 points interval.

Boys 1m Springboard

New champions got crowned in the Boys B 1m springboard. In the absence of athletes from China and the United States who led the last Junior World Diving Championships 2018 representatives of European countries and South America fought for places on the podium.

Jonathan Gisbert Schauer became world champion again after have claimed a Gold Medal in the A/B Boys 3m Synchro yesterday with his teammate Espen Prenzyna. Today he was competing from the 1m springboard to win his first individual title. He finished at his best performing a day-high in the last round of dives: 67.20 points for a Forward 2.5 Somersaults 1 Twist. The final score was 416.70.

He said after the race “I am speechless because it is my first Junior World Championship. Two finals and two golds! I even can not imagine that I will be the two-time world champion. The most difficult dive was 5152 B because I have learned it just 2 weeks ago. Since I was 5 years old I have been doing diving and now I am very happy to see the result.”

Colombian Tomas Tamayo Meneses won silver on 413.15 points. The Colombian was first before the last round of dives but he didn't manage to finish at his top.

Tomas Tamayo Meneses silver medallist: “Competitions were very difficult very strong opponents. I coped with my goal and represented my country with dignity and this one was an honor for me. I have been diving for over 5 years and I am delighted with this success.”

Matej Neveskanin Croatia made himself a wonderful gift for his 15th birthday - a bronze medal at the junior world championship. (403.05 points).

Matej Neveskanin bronze medallist: “This is the best gift I have ever imagined for my birthday! The open dive 303 B was the most difficult for me. And then everything went like clockwork. I also felt the support of my team. The guys cheered for me in the tribunes I heard that. Thank them for that they are the best! ”

Russian Sergei Trifonov was very close to the podium he lacked 1. 2 points to bronze. Ukrainian Vladyslav Klimko finished the competition in 5th place. Russian Nikita Zhukov showcased a steady list with strong dives of 3.0 – 3.1 C and 3.0 D

Organizing your cables can take your setup from amateur mess to full-blown professional sleek. A neat and tidy space will help you focus and increase productivity. That's why we comprised a collection of everything you need to become a cable management pro.

Getting things organized

A combination of the above items will really take your cable management skills up a notch. Using accessories such as the J-Channel Cable Raceway will automatically make your space look more organized as the wires running along the floors and walls can be instantly covered.

If you would like to go a step further with your cable management you may want to organize your wires through the use of clips like the GWHOLE Cable Clips and sleeves like the Envel Cable Management Sleeves. Labelling your wires ensures that you know exactly where they are all going and what they are all connected to. Using sleeves reduces the appearance of messy cords and allows you to hide multiple cables under one accessory.

Another great organizational tool is the use of power strips like the Orico 10 Outlet Power Strip as it can centralize where your wires are going. You can then hide these by using 3M Double-Sided Tape which is a strong a strong adhesive and attaching them underneath your desk. Taking a series of these small steps will bring you that much closer to becoming a cable management expert.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvb25lLW1pbGUtc3RyZXRjaC1pbi1vYWtkYWxlLWdldHMtcmVhZHktZm9yLTEtMy1iaWxsaW9uLWdyb3d0aC1zcHVydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One-mile stretch in Oakdale gets ready for $1.3 billion growth spurt,"To place an obituary please include the information from the obituary checklist below in an email to obits@pioneerpress.com.

Abbott,"SCARBOROUGH – Jesse Franklin Hakes Abbott 65 passed away peacefully at home on Nov. 21 2021. He was born in Louisville K.Y. on April 10 1956. Jesse attended Louisville Country Day and went on to graduate from Milton Academy and Connecticut College. After college Jesse took the opportunity to travel with his grandmother to Europe and what started out as a three-month trip ended up being three years of travel around the world which greatly shaped who he would be in the future.﻿Growing up in Louisville Jesse would make the long trip to Maine each summer to the small coastal community of Prouts Neck where both good friends and his love for the ocean were acquired. Sailing in Saco Bay became a passion for him and something he would enjoy for the rest of his life. Maine was a special place for Jesse and after returning from his adventures he made the move to the Portland area in 1983 to a place where in his words “I could sail and ski!”.﻿Jesse started in residential real estate shortly after moving to Maine where he met his wife Jennifer while taking pictures of a listing. They were married in 1987 and their son Bradley was born in 1989. Living at Higgins Beach skiing at Sugarloaf while continuing to enjoy sailing and golf at Prouts enabled Jesse to realize his goals in moving to Maine. However he never lost his desire to travel which produced fishing trips to Patagonia among many other places and visiting his friends Patty and Audie on his favorite Hawaiian island Kauai. ﻿Jesse started his professional career in Louisville as part owner of a woodworking company his first of many entrepreneurial endeavors. After transitioning from residential to commercial real estate in 1994 he started an electronic security company Advance Technology Inc. which combined his knowledge of construction real estate and his interest in helping people protect their investments. ATI grew and flourished until it was sold in 2018 and Jesse put his energy into the commercial real estate development company 43North which he and his son Bradley started in 2015. He was so proud of Bradley for his innate aptitude on redeveloping antiquated buildings into modern productive spaces. Jesse and Bradley spent over a year on their last project together renovating a warehouse building in Sanford before leasing it to a major local company.﻿In 2006 Jesse found his lifelong passion after purchasing a 200-acre farm in Romehich once belonged to Jen’s grandparents. Lake Shore Farm fulfilled his vision for a way to live off and work the land developing an old maple grove to produce syrup harvesting timber off the property to build outbuildings creating ski and bike trails revitalizing the ancient apple orchard and growing vegetables. The fact that it was on a lake made the property perfect for both summer and winter recreation. Another test of Jesse’s goal of becoming a Mainer.﻿Jesse took great enjoyment from mentoring people be it friends or family colleagues in the security industry or just about anyone who visited the farm. He enjoyed teaching them how to drive a tractor move earth pick apples or make maple syrup so that he could share his vast knowledge of all things farming and life. He especially enjoyed sitting with people talking business and sharing his thoughts about how they could find success with their own dreams. Jesse was always there for the people he loved to help and support them however he could.﻿Jesse is predeceased by his mother Caroline Moore and stepfather Condict his half-sister Aline Ybarra and a close cousin Mary Rodes Lannert.He is survived by his wife Jennifer of Scarborough his son Bradley and daughter-in-law Taylor of Portland. His sister Carrie Moore and husband Jim of New York their children Emily (Jack) Catie (Sam) and Claire. His brother John of Florida his stepsister Martha Bauer (Larry) and their son Silas (Andie) of Mass his stepbrother Michael Moore (Robbie) of Minn and children Dan (Maris) Lucy and Maggie (Matt). He also leaves extended family Jeff Bradley (Jessie) of Vermont and children Meridith (Max) and Eliza (Laura) and Chris Bradley (Matti) and children Haven and Maggie of Belgrade. Jesse will be greatly missed by longtime friends from childhood Franklin Starks (Hollis) of Louisville K.Y. and Bucky Buckley (Linda) of Maine as well as his very close college buddies Steve James (Betsy) of Boston Mass. and Doug Haynes (Susan) of York. Lastly the Princess Rosie Jesse and Jen’s rescue dog will really miss him!﻿The family would like to thank Dr. Devon Evans at New England Cancer Specialists and Compassus Hospice especially Benzy and Caroline.﻿Memorial services are planned for the spring in Louisville K.Y. and Lake Shore Farm. Arrangements are under the direction of the Conroy-Tully Walker Funeral Homes.

""That is exactly why Texas actually is leading the way becoming the home for semiconductors that go into everything that people use"" he added.

""It’s not just your iPhone or your laptop or whatever the case may be"" he went on to say. ""It’s also in all of these vehicles where you have manufacturing going on.""

As Abbott had stated on Sunday the semiconductor chip shortage was sparked by some regulations implemented – and decisions made – during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The shortage affected the auto sector heavily throughout the year. General Motors announced that it had to reduce some truck production in North America due to the global chip shortage. Ford has also pulled back production at several factories.

FORD GLOBAL FOUNDRIES TEAM UP ON CHIP SHORTAGE: ‘JUST THE BEGINNING’

Abbott and Samsung Electronics Co. announced late last month that the South Korean tech behemoth will build a $17 billion semiconductor factory in Taylor Texas.

The governor touted the move during a news conference as ""the largest foreign direct investment in the state of Texas ever.""

Samsung Electronics Device Solutions Division Vice Chairman and CEO Dr. Kinam Kim said Samsung expects to create more than 2000 high-tech jobs directly with the plant in Taylor and thousands more related to the plant once it is fully operational.

The chip-making factory coming to Taylor will also be the largest investment made by Samsung in the U.S. the company said in a news release bringing the firm's ""total investment in the U.S. to more than $47 billion since beginning operations in the country in 1978.""

Tesla also revealed last week it is now a Texas company according to paperwork filed with the SEC on Wednesday.

The automaker announced that its corporate headquarters is now located at its Gigafactory in Austin.

Elon Musk announced plans to relocate Tesla's headquarters from California during October's shareholder meeting following a year of friction with the state's government over COVID rules and a tweet from California state Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez that said ""F--k Elon Musk""

Musk also said the company was reaching the limits of expansion at its original Fremont California factory and that the expansive Texas facility offered more opportunity for growth.

Abbott told host Maria Bartiromo that in the first 11 months of 2021 ""there have been 70 businesses and corporations that have relocated their headquarters to the state of Texas.""

""If you look on average that means there’s a new headquarters in Texas every five days"" he continued noting that Tesla was one of those companies.

Abbott also pointed to Samsung’s investment in Taylor.

""That is in addition to the announcement the week before where Texas Instruments announced a $30 billion investment for semiconductors"" the governor added.

""Those semiconductors will help in the supply chain process.""

Abbott said the economy in Texas is ""growing and thriving"" stressing that businesses are moving to the state ""because Texas is the land of economic opportunity and innovation.""

Part of the reason ""so many businesses"" are moving to Texas he said is there are ""no mandates infringing upon individual liberty.""

""Texas has been very aggressive about legally challenging all of these mandates that the Biden administration has put in place concerning COVID"" he told Bartiromo.

""And whether it be vaccine mandates or mask mandates — whatever the case may be — we’ve been winning them all in the courts.""

""The only mandate that applies is my executive order saying that nobody in the state of Texas can be mandated to take a vaccine shot"" Abbott said noting that a COVID vaccine is ""available for anybody who wants it but there can be no mandates infringing upon individual liberty.""

A senior judge dismissed the case against one of two former Seymour police officers accused of ghost employment official misconduct and theft in 2020 on Wednesday in Jackson Circuit Court.

The dismissal of the case against Carl Lamb by Senior Judge Chris D. Monroe apparently occurred as a result of Criminal Rule 4 according to a news release from Jackson County Prosecutor Jeffrey Chalfant.

Abbott

That rule requires that a criminal case being brought to trial within a year of a person’s arrest he said. Chalfant recused himself from both cases because of a conflict of interest.

Lamb who was a captain at the time and then Seymour Police Chief Bill Abbott were both arrested on the three Level 6 felony charges on Feb. 12 2020.

The two had been placed on paid administrative leave in October 2019 when an investigation was initiated by the Indiana State Police after that agency received an anonymous tip about potential wrongdoing within the department.

Chalfant said Friday morning that the obligation to bring a case to trial is on the prosecutor.

In these two cases Jackson Circuit Court Judge Richard W. Poynter initially appointed attorney C. Michael Steiner as the special prosecutor. After Steiner filed the cases in Jackson Circuit Court Poynter also recused himself from both cases.

That’s when Monroe took over the cases.

“Once a special prosecutor is appointed I have an absolute conflict and I cannot become involved in any way in a case” Chalfant said adding that no one in his office could handle the case either.

He said Steiner later withdrew from the cases leading Monroe to appoint Sonia Leerkamp of Ninevah as special prosecutor in July 2020. Lamb was represented by North Vernon attorney Mark Dove.

Chalfant said the dismissal of cases for Criminal Rule 4 is rare.

“My office files thousands of cases each year and my staff and I work very hard to bring all of those cases to conclusion within the one-year requirement” he said. “Frequently defendants seek and are given continuances. These defense continuances are by far the most common reason that cases take more than one year to resolve and defense continuances extend the one-year time period.”

The one-year time period to bring a case to trial also may be extended for various reasons. For example the Indiana Supreme Court ordered extensions in all criminal matters for 210 days due to the COVID-19 pandemic Chalfant said.

The case against Abbott remains active although no hearings or the trial is scheduled at this time.

Abbott’s attorney Brad Johnson filed a motion Oct. 5 to discharge the case. On Nov. 11 Monroe ruled that the court had been advised the parties were entering into a deferred prosecution agreement and that therefore meant there was no need for him to act on the motion to discharge.

Abbott began his career as a patrolman in 1989 and served as police chief from 2008 until his retirement in September 2019. Lamb joined the force in 1987 as a patrolman and retired Feb. 14 2020."

Industrial scientists from 3M Abb­Vie AstraZeneca Bristol Myers Squibb Merck & Co. Novartis and Pfizer are being recognized with the American Chemical Society’s 2021 Heroes of Chemistry Awards. These researchers’ contributions have led to advancements in treatments for bloodstream infections cancer diabetes and heart failure.

The Heroes of Chemistry Awards are ACS’s highest honor for industrial chemical scientists who make up a significant proportion of ACS’s membership. The program started in 1996 is sponsored by the ACS Board Committee on Corporation Associates and celebrates industrial advances that have benefited humankind.

Here’s a look at the commercial products being honored this year:

3M: Tegaderm CHG Chlorhexidine Gluconate I.V. Securement Dressing

Credit: 3M

Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are fatal to more than a quarter of patients who contract one. Over 40000 cases of CRBSIs are reported per year. Contact with the catheter insertion site—for example when a clinician lifts the tape and gauze to look for signs of infection—can expose the site to bacteria and increase the risk.

3M’s Tegaderm CHG Chlorhexidine Gluconate I.V. Securement Dressing is a highly breathable transparent dressing that contains a gel pad of the antimicrobial chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG). The dressing is placed over the insertion site for central venous catheters. Clinicians can see through the dressing minimizing contact with the insertion site. The dressing is clinically proven to reduce CRBSIs.

“When we got the evidence that we could significantly reduce bloodstream infections that was just the top of my career” says Bob Asmus a retired corporate scientist from 3M and one of the award winners. Asmus led the development of Tegaderm CHG which launched in 2008.

CHG is clear which made it the antimicrobial of choice for this dressing Asmus explains. But CHG photodegrades is thermally unstable and is prone to forming insoluble salts with certain anions. The Tegaderm CHG team successfully protected the CHG from these factors while ensuring the antimicrobial could still diffuse from the gel pad to the insertion site.

In 2018 3M introduced a new product Tegaderm Antimicrobial I.V. Advanced Securement Dressing a lower-cost dressing intended for use with peripherally inserted IV catheters. Incorporating the antimicrobial directly into the adhesive as opposed to in a gel pad simplified manufacturing explains Ying Zhang a senior product development specialist in 3M’s medical solutions division and one of the award winners.

3M is now exploring the next generation of transparent securement dressings.

AbbVie: Venclexta/Venclyxto

Cancer cells are able to short-circuit a form of programmed cell death known as apoptosis and this ability gives them a survival advantage. Understanding resistance to apoptosis is a critical area in cancer research. Several hematologic cancers depend on B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) proteins to inhibit apoptosis.

AbbVie’s venetoclax marketed as Venclexta in the US and Venclyxto outside the US selectively inhibits BCL-2 proteins. The drug gives patients a new option to treat certain blood cancers.

Venclexta “took an entirely new approach to treating cancer by inducing programmed cell death specifically in cancer cells whereas most other chemo­therapies just kill fast-growing cells” including normal blood cells explains Steve Elmore vice president for drug discovery science and technology at Abb­Vie and one of the award winners.

Elmore led the team that discovered venetoclax which took more than a decade of lab work. Venetoclax was the first marketed drug specifically designed to inhibit a protein-protein interaction.

Elmore says it gives him a sense of purpose and satisfaction to know that “our science and the stuff we did in the lab is helping people reclaim their lives.” He believes there are other opportunities for new drugs to act on different pathways of programmed cell death. “I think [Venclexta] is just the tip of the iceberg” he says.

AstraZeneca/Bristol Myers Squibb: Farxiga

Hyperglycemia or high blood glucose is a manifestation of type 2 diabetes and over time can lead to serious health problems. The drug Farxiga (dapagliflozin) can help treat type 2 diabetes by inhibiting excess glucose from being reabsorbed from the kidneys into the blood instead causing the glucose to be excreted into the urine.

Along with glucose Farxiga also causes some excretion of water and sodium. As a result the drug promotes a modest lowering of body weight and blood pressure. While the exact mechanisms are still being worked out the combination of these effects has shown benefits for cardiovascular disease and kidney disease in addition to its original indication as a diabetes treatment.

The compound was discovered by a team at Bristol Myers Squibb led by award winner Bill Washburn and developed as part of a clinical-stage partnership between Bristol Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca.

Farxiga represented a new class of sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. The shift from an O-linked glucoside to a C-linked glucoside gave the compound more stability in the body and enabled the successful clinical development of SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetes and protection against morbidity from heart failure and chronic kidney disease.

Bruce Ellsworth executive director and head of fibrotic disease discovery chemistry at Bristol Myers Squibb and another award winner says it’s a thrill “that this training in organic chemistry could really lead to something that actually benefits human health.”

“It’s very rewarding and very gratifying to see” says award-winner Nayyar Iqbal vice president for clinical metabolism at AstraZeneca. “Our baby is now mature and grown up.”

Merck & Co.: Keytruda

Credit: Merck & Co.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Keytruda a humanized monoclonal antibody treatment is a checkpoint inhibitor that binds to and blocks a protein called PD-1 thus helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.

Keytruda represents new hope in the treatment of various cancers. “People are seeing a meaningful benefit in many cancer indications” says Parimal Desai vice president of engineering in Merck & Co.’s manufacturing division and one of the award winners.

Keytruda was initially approved to treat metastatic melanoma but today is approved for more than 30 indications across 16 different tumor types. Tumors that express PD-1 can generally be classified for Keytruda treatment.

When it saw the promise of Keytruda “Merck moved heaven and earth” Desai says. “The whole company got aligned.” Desai led a team of more than 1000 scientists and engineers to expedite chemistry manufacturing and control (CMC) development. The company compressed CMC development timelines and expanded production volumes to keep pace with positive data from clinical trials. The US Food and Drug Administration granted the drug accelerated approval in 2014.

Desai expects that anti-PD-1 inhibitors either alone or in combination with other drugs will change the practice of cancer treatment. “Doctors are feeling for the first time that we have control over a terminal disease” he says.

Novartis: Entresto

People over 40 years old have a 20% lifetime risk of developing heart failure which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body.

Novartis’s Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) has been approved to reduce the risk of death and hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction meaning the heart’s left ventricle does not pump sufficiently. It has also been approved in certain countries to treat chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Entresto is a combination angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor. Valsartan blocks angio­tensin II receptor type 1 which causes blood vessels to dilate and reduces extracellular fluid (ECF) volume. Sacubitril is a prodrug that is activated to sacubitrilat; this metabolite inhibits the enzyme neprilysin thereby increasing the levels of certain peptides that cause blood vessels to dilate and ECF volume to lower as a result of sodium excretion.

The American College of Cardiology now recommends Entresto as the frontline therapy ahead of the previous standard of care which was based on ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.

Pfizer: Lorbrena

Credit: Pfizer

For patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer treatments can fail as a result of resistance mutations or brain metastases. Drugs that cross the blood-brain barrier to treat such metastases can be risky because of the potential for side effects.

Lorbrena is an ALK inhibitor that was developed to treat all known drug-resistance mutations plus brain metastases. It was designed to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. “It was risky but it was a risk we wanted to take” says Ted W. Johnson a research fellow with Pfizer and one of the award winners.

The Pfizer team used structure-based drug design which allows researchers to target a specific mutation that’s driving a tumor. This approach meant the compound was safer and gave a higher likelihood it would be efficacious in the clinic.

“As someone in research most of the programs I work on never make it to Phase 1 clinical trials” Johnson says. He was the co–project lead for the Lorbrena program and is the coinventor of Lorbrena.

Lorbrena is an oral therapy and has less severe side effects than traditional chemo​therapy. It was approved as a frontline therapy earlier this year. Johnson believes Lorbrena has opened the door to more such targeted therapies.

I buy my gifts by November especially on Black Friday to take advantage of the deals. I like Amazon; I can compare prices and save my list all year round.

This year I bought a lot of stuff (I can explain). On checking out I noticed Amazon gave me three options to pay:

Use a card 5% cashback. Pay in equal installments with no interest charged for 12 months. Pay in equal installments with no interest charged for 18 months.

Yes no interest. No APR just the total divided by months. If your bill is $500 you pay $28 for eighteen months. I picked the eighteen-month option and the monthly bill was so small I added a few more items because my budget could have that level of monthly payments (don’t do this at home).

I wondered why Amazon was being so nice? Why are they offering me the opportunity to buy on their site and forgo earning interest on my purchases if I use their credit card?

So I decided to research the world of Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL).

Buy Now Pay Later

Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) are interest-free installment loans offered to small short-term purchases. Think of this as paying in installments for a dress but instead of laying away until you make total payments you take the dress but pay later. The difference with BNPL and other credit purchases is that outstanding payments are not charged any interest.

BNPL offers a simple easy-to-understand and convenient way to budget by matching monthly income to monthly expenses for the consumer. It is also a low-cost method of acquiring assets. A report by Accenture on the BNPL industry says users of BNPL services choose not to own credit cards because they want to avoid interest fees and debt. The Accenture report says “spending on BNPL in the US has increased up by 230% since the start of 2020.” Figure 1 shows that BNPL is best suited to smaller purchases.

Figure 1. Potential Cost to Customers for Different Credit Types

The key benefit of BNPL to consumers

BNPL’s benefit is its consumption smoothing effect. A TV for 100000 is a significant purchase in any currency; however paying N8333 a month for a year for the same TV is easily digestible and drives more purchases. Just as I bought more items because my monthly bill was below my spending target Accenture confirms that “basket sizes” were 17% higher in value when BNPL was used.

Nigeria’s low consumer spending power

Nigeria’s minimum wage set in 2019 is about N30000 about $72 a month using official exchange rates. From this wage the average Nigerian family according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report titled “Consumer Expenditure Pattern report for 2019” spends 57% of their income on food.

Food inflation has reduced the purchasing power of consumers in Nigeria. On Jumia the online retailer a 50kg bag of rice retailed from N27000 to N33000. This cost equates to the monthly minimum wage in Nigeria. The manufacturers have attempted to solve the declining purchasing power of the Nigerian consumer by reducing the quantity per pack of their products. Thus the markets have an abundance of single-use sachets with smaller amounts on offer.

On the Jumia website you can buy a 10kg bag of rice with groundnut oil and seasoning for about N18000. It is cheaper to buy the 50kg bag but many Nigeria cannot afford the 50kg bag. So in this case “being poor becomes more expensive.” BNPL can help solve this problem.

How BNPL fixes the problem

BNPL while creating $590 million in cost savings has enabled merchants to gain $8.2 billion in new revenues according to the Accenture report. When merchants offer BNPL to shoppers they buy more. The Accenture report profiles Afterpay a BNPL vendor. It states that the average merchants obtained 13% more new customers when BNPL was offered.

BNPL can be a win for consumers. A Nigerian consumer can buy the 50kg bag of rice and spread payments over 12 months at N2500 a month. Paying in installments eliminates the need to save up in bulk and allows an interest-free repayment plan matched to monthly income. This repayment plan increases the number of households that can buy 50k bags of rice increasing revenues to merchants and farmers. Many families contribute to buying a cow and sharing the meat because one family cannot bear a cow’s cash cost. With BNPL one household can purchase the same cow without the need for a sizeable immediate cash outlay.

BNPL vs Credit Cards

Merchants have long adopted plastic via debit and credit cards to boost revenues by offering consumers more choice at Point of Payment. BNPL extends this choice but the business model directly challenges the concept of traditional consumer finance especially credit cards. For example I choose to pay my Amazon bill with the Affirm option (Affirm is a BNPL vendor that signed a deal to offer that service to Amazon clients). The Amazon credit card that I use offers a 5% cashback plus a 30 day no APR charge. Still Affirm was offering 18 months with absolutely no charge apart from my monthly bill. Like I alluded to I increased my purchases because of the offer. If I were going to pay a fee or Annual Percentage Rate (APR) on my purchase psychologically I would have avoided making more purchases.

The Accenture report tracks the adoption of BNPL in America. In figure 2 we see a plot of adoption by US consumers from January 2020. BNPL has a massive 230% adoption rate with only 43% by traditional credit card. Consumers save an equivalent of $6 per order using Afterpay translating to $459 million in savings to Afterpay alone. Users of BNPL are also twice as likely to make repayments as credit card users.

Figure 2: Adoption of BNPL In America

The Nigerian BNPL ecosystem

Nigeria has BNPL vendors including Easybuy Credpal CDCareNG Altmall CreditClan and Carbon Zero. I have not used them but it shows that BNPL has created a foothold in the Nigerian market.

The Nigerian BNPL has successfully customized its offering. CreditClan for instance is building a niche in education BNPL allowing payments of schools fees to be done monthly. Femi Bejide the founder says they are also offering monthly rental payment plans under their BNPL plans. In terms of growth even with systematic headwinds they have grown Quarter on Quarter at more than 100%.

A critical consideration for Nigerian consumers is the price differential. At the same time merchants have the risk of default as their essential top-of-mind worry. Overall Femi believes BNPL is a $2 trillion market space and that the Nigerian BNPL companies are hardly scratching the surface of the potential market.

Is BNPL a threat to traditional banking in Nigeria? Specifically consumer finance? In my opinion I say yes because of the ease of adoption. CreditClan for instance can approve a loan in 3 minutes according to its founder. The ease of getting credit and paying off is essential in Nigeria when according to available data from the Enhancing Financial Inclusion and Access (EFINA) less than 5% of Nigerians have accessed a loan from a formal banking institution.

How to use BNPL

Tie BNPL purchases to your budget. If you spread payments your cash balance will go up as you are not making immediate payments. That cash is technically not yours but you can save it in a safe investment like a bank deposit don’t spend it. BNPL is simply the reversal of tradition and you usually save than spend; now you are spending and saving. Match spending to a budget.

It is tempting to look at BNPL as an emergency fund to cover unforeseen but very critical expenses don’t do it. The zero interest charge only applies to the covered duration.

I would deploy BNPL to purchases that can be paid off within the duration selected. The advantages of BNPL only kick in if the consumer can pay off the outstanding within the repayment date.",,,,,,,,,,,,

ADOBE Inc. and DocuSign saw a drastic plummet in market performance Friday seeing shares fall to below pre-pandemic values.

DocuSign fell by a horrific 42.22 percent while Adobe which offers similar software soultions for remote e-signature collection saw an 8.24 percent drop.

1 DocuSign and Adobe plummeted in value on Friday

MarketWatch reports that the massive selloff stems from comments DocuSign's Chief Executive Dan Springer made on Thursday.

Springer predicted that while the company saw ""accelerated growth"" throughout the last two years thanks to the pandemic that customers were returning to ""normalized buying patterns"" and would continue to do so.

He was referring to global efforts to reopen offices and end work-from-home campaigns which were successful in part thanks to asynchronous document manage software like DocuSign.

That comment preceded the massive stock selloff.

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives told MarketWatch that the DocuSign selloff and subsequent Adobe plummet were a ""knee-jerk reaction.""

Adobe's value reportedly fell below $300billion.

A number of leading cryptocurrencies also suffered a huge slump in their value in the first 24 hours of the weekend.

Bitcoin lost more than 17 percent of its value from early Friday morning after its price plummeted from about $57000 to $47000.

The price of Ether also dived to a low near $3500 Saturday though it has crept up in fits and starts since.

Shiba Inu has also been losing ground down 14.3 percent in the last 24 hours and rallying to regain ground on Saturday.

The crisis is thought to be driven by mounting fears that global governments could crack down on crypto regulation.

The US Federal Reserve said it could speed up the end of its bond-buying or quantitative easing program.

This forms part of its efforts to tackle rising inflation.

But it could be a bad sign for cryptocurrencies as quantitative easing usually pushes down interest rates on bonds which has historically led to investors flocking to riskier assets with higher returns.

Bonuses and accolades were bestowed upon executives who could create the leanest operation. Perfection was planned in every supply chain and low-cost labor and logistics were linchpins. Organizations trusted that supply chains would work and discounted significant risks as they blindly focused on the lowest price. The automotive industry may be the finest example of focused lean manufacturing adoption. And now according to Seraph calculations based on multiple data sources it is facing a combined revenue loss of $850 billion due to semiconductor shortages alone.

It started in 2020. Low-cost countries fell into disarray as the pandemic took hold and many still have yet to recover. With the stops and starts across regions it has become increasingly challenging to refill supply pipelines. Shipping containers from China now cost more than $20000 and delays are rampant as ship port and trucking constraints impact the supply chain. Automobiles paper towels and even children’s toys are in short supply. Shelves are often out of stock highlighting the stark realities of the broken supply chain strategies companies have been using. As fall and winter settle in look for an increased prevalence of more production stops and supply shortages.

We all should have known better. No room for error existed even as “black swan” events became common and expected. Supply chains need to be re-engineered across all industries to make them more resilient and enable companies to survive.

Even with the heroic effort being made by many companies supply chain disruptions will continue throughout 2023 and likely far beyond. There are actions that companies can take now to re-gain control of their supply chains and mitigate the impact in the future. Reimagining and then re-engineering the entire supply chain will take massive capital investment political will and a sense of urgency.

Here are five immediate actions that supply chain teams should take to enable their organizations to survive:

Engage the management team and board of directors. Supply chains have never been a board-level issue but the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has the potential to make supply chain failures business killers. As supply chain professionals it is your obligation to make sure that the risk associated with supply disruptions is understood by your board and management team. All companies that have real products need to have a board sub-committee focused on supply chain to engage the government look at the capital investment that may be required and remove roadblocks to take rapid action outside of normal budget cycles.

Conduct an immediate honest and quantified “tactical” risk assessment of your supply chain with board oversight. In the past sourcing was done to find the lowest cost or the lowest landed cost. Risks have rarely been considered in sourcing models; there was simply an assumption that material would always arrive in the quantity and quality that was required. Suppliers were expected to manage their Tier “N” but organizations were not structured to do this and that has put most companies into a reactionary mode when product is not going to arrive. Those who have been most successful have found supply chain monitoring tools that enable transparency and serve as an early warning system.

Understand how your systems handle backlog through EDI remove the noise from the system and communicate directly with suppliers. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are designed to work in a perfect world. Occasional exceptions can be highlighted and managed by a small team but the backlog is extreme and supply chain professionals are unavailable to intervene. These ERP systems that enabled “lean operations” are beginning to kill manufacturing operations. There is an immediate need for all companies to go through their ERP system purge the massive backlogs that likely exist and prioritize electronic data interchange (EDI) releases so that the parts needed for immediate production are clear and suppliers can forecast true demand out to their supply base. Beyond the system work supply chain teams must staff up as calling and talking to suppliers is essential. Those teams that build good relationships will have the best performance from their supply chain moving forward.

Make plans to regionalize all components that can be moved. Lowest cost has proven to be highest risk and organizations need to accept that inflation is here. Moving component supply back into the region where production takes place or product is consumed is becoming a strategic imperative. Models show that we will be dealing with significant supply chain disruption through the end of 2023 and likely far beyond. Engaging the board with quantifiable data including risk adjustments will enable a competitive advantage when supply chains are regionalized. This is not a fast or inexpensive step but is one that all organizations have an obligation to study and act on where feasible.

Secure space to hold inventory and develop a risk driven inventory model. Allocating capital and holding inventory is no longer a bad thing; it is now essential. Making a calculation to continue supply of critical materials needs to be done immediately. Warehousing material minimizing engineering changes and understanding supply chain fragility will be important to keep the shop floor running. Warehouse space is already in short supply so finding and securing unconventional space such as abandoned retail stores will be essential in many areas. Moving quickly here with clear risk-driven inventory levels will cushion the stops and starts that will continue to cascade through regions over time. Simply because a region is open now does not mean it will be in three months’ time. Understanding the shipping and production impacts of COVID-19 on the regions where your suppliers exist should support your inventory planning and warehouse-based requirements. Inventory is no longer a four-letter word; it is one of the key factors that will enable your organization to survive the COVID-19 business cycle.

There are many other strategic actions that can be taken to protect your supply chain. Getting these basics in place and engaging the broader organization should be top priority in the coming weeks and months. The current stop/start cycle of COVID-19 is going to last far longer than most want to admit. Plan on this being the catalyst to drive a complete reengineering of your supply chain but start with some basic tactical actions to enable your company to survive in the interim.

Part of the reason for this is that an electronic signature eliminates the need for in-person presence and allows the remote signing of documents.

While using a macOS or Windows computer is one way to sign PDF documents electronically if you need to do it more often—and while you’re on the go—you’d want to do it on a mobile device.

So in this guide we’ll demonstrate the different ways to sign PDF documents on Android and iOS/iPadOS devices.

How to Electronically Sign PDF Documents on iPhone or iPad

One of the easiest ways to sign a PDF document on an iPhone or iPad is to use the Files app. Files is Apple’s default file management app for devices running iOS and iPadOS that lets you access all your files from local and cloud storage services all in one place.

Since it comes pre-installed on iOS and iPadOS you can follow the steps below right away to sign your PDF documents on your iPad or iPhone electronically:

Open the Files app on your iPhone or iPad. Head over to the folder that contains the PDF file you want to sign. Tap on the PDF to open it using File’s built-in PDF reader/editor. Once the PDF is open tap on the markup tool (pen) icon in the top-right corner to bring up markup features. Fill out any form fields as required.

Hit the plus (+) button and select Signature from the menu.

If you’ve never created a signature the app will present you with a blank screen. Use your fingers to draw out your signature on this screen.

When you’re done click Done.

As soon as you do that Files will save your signature and add it to your document. You can then click and drag it to move it to the signature field on the form or PDF. Similarly you can also resize the signature by dragging the box around it outward or inward.

Besides you have the option to change the signature color as well. For this click on the color picker icon and select a color from the color palette.

Finally when you’re satisfied with your signature hit Done on the top-left to save the signed PDF document.

Other iPhone and iPad Apps to Sign PDF Documents

How to Sign a PDF Document on Android

Unlike an iPhone or iPad the default file manager that comes pre-installed with most Android skins doesn’t offer a built-in PDF signing feature. And therefore if you need to sign a PDF form or document on your Android phone or tablet you need to use a third-party PDF editor.

For the purpose of this guide we’ll use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC which is a free app—for the most part—that lets you sign PDFs for free. So head over to the link below to download Adobe Reader on your Android from the Play Store.

Download: Adobe Acrobat Reader DC

With the app installed on your phone or tablet use the steps below to sign your PDF documents using the Acrobat Acrobat Reader:

Open the file manager of your choice on your Android phone or tablet and head over to the folder with the PDF file you want to sign. Click on the PDF and when prompted to choose an app to open it select Adobe Acrobat. If you don’t get this option simply open Adobe Acrobat DC and you should see all the PDFs on your device. With the PDF open click on the pen icon at the bottom of the screen and select Fill & Sign from the menu.

Tap the signature icon on the bottom-right corner of the toolbar.

Now depending on whether you want to create a signature or just your initials tap on either Create Signature or Create Initials.

Irrespective of what option you choose you’ll be taken to a new screen where you’ll need to draw your signature or initials. Adobe Reader will give you the following three options to do this: Draw: It lets you draw out your signature/initials. You can choose from a selection of signature styles.



It lets you draw out your signature/initials. You can choose from a selection of signature styles. Image: It lets you upload the signature image from your device.

It lets you upload the signature image from your device. Camera: It lets you take a snapshot of your physical signature or initials. Once you’ve created your signature or initials click on the Done button.

Adobe Reader will now save your signature/initials and ask you to tap on an area in the document to add them. With your signature added you can then move it around or use the arrow to increase or decrease its size.

When you’re happy with your signature tap the tick button on the top-left to save the document.

Other Android Apps to Sign PDF Documents

Sign PDF Online for Free – Non-app Solutions

Besides using dedicated PDF eSign apps on your iPhone or Android phones you can also use free (or paid) online PDF tools for signing PDFs electronically. Below are some of the best online PDF tools to sign a PDF:

One of the biggest advantages of these tools is that they work irrespective of your mobile device and its operating system and you don’t need to install them on your machine to use them.

While this adds convenience you must be wary of using these tools as using them requires you to upload your PDF. So if it’s some sensitive piece of document that you want to sign you must avoid using online tools and stick to the offline ones instead.

Easily Sign PDF Documents on the Go

If your work involves working with lots of PDF documents in a day knowing how to sign them from anywhere can prove to be really helpful. And using this guide you should be able to easily sign PDFs electronically while you’re on the go no matter what mobile device you’re using.

Although you’ll also find a bunch of other PDF editing apps on the App Store and Play Store we feel the apps we’ve mentioned in this guide should suffice most of your document signing requirements.

The matchup between two programs widely regarded as the best high school boys basketball teams in the country came down to the closing seconds on Friday.

No. 2 IMG Academy took down No. 1 Montverde on a second-chance layup from Baylor commit Keyonte George that came with less than 10 seconds remaining in the game. The IMG Academy Ascenders took down the Montverde Eagles 65-64 in an early-season battle between the two juggernauts loaded with collegiate talent.

But despite IMG being ranked lower don’t tell George that this result was unexpected. After the game he had a message for Sports Illustrated’s Jason Jordan:

“It’s not an upset.”

George finished with 14 points and five rebounds. His final score the biggest of the night can be found around the 1:33:40 mark of the game recording:

That wasn’t George’s only big shot. He ended the first quarter with an impressive drive and finish.

Highly ranked players around the five-star shooting guard also showed out in this battle. Five-star power forward Jarace Walker a Houston commit lead IMG with 20 points and added seven rebounds and five blocks.

Five-star small forward Dariq Whitehead who is committed to Duke led Montverde with 31 points 10-for-19 shooting and five 3-pointers.

That was just one of the highly anticipated games in the NIBC series. On Saturday IMG Academy plays Oak Hill Academy (Mouth of Wilson Va.) while Montverde will play Sunrise Christian Academy (Bel Aire Kan.)

Montverde’s match will be another big test — after all Sunrise Christian defeated IMG Academy on Thursday.

Why haven’t we written about it before? Well it’s definitely a luxury appliance and it’s not something the average guy is going to add to his closet.

But with Christmas right around the corner we figure someone out there is looking for a big gift for the impossible-to-shop-for man in their life. What do you buy the impeccably well-dressed gentleman who prefers to pick out his own clothes accessories and top-shelf whiskey? We recommend the Samsung Airdresser which would be a godsend for any fashionista or clotheshorse in your life.

Okay so what is it? The Samsung Airdresser is an at-home dry cleaning cabinet.

You simply load it up with your dry-clean-only suits dress shirts and accessories close the door and the Airdresser goes to work sanitizing deodorizing de-wrinkling and otherwise cleaning your garments. And of course this smart appliance is also Wi-Fi connected. For anyone with a walk-in closet it’s the ultimate luxury flex.

Think about it this way: you could actually save money if you’re already dropping hundreds of dollars at the local dry cleaners every few months.

The Samsung Airdresser: How It Works

While it might sound like a complicated piece of machinery (and it is) it’s actually pretty easy to use and install.

Per Samsung “Simply plug your AirDresser into a standard 120V outlet and you’re all set. No separate water line or professional installation necessary — the refillable water reservoir and filtered water are all you need.”

Meanwhile the “built-in deodorizing filter eliminates 99% of common odors in fabrics like house pet smells smoke perspiration unpleasant food and other musty odors.”

So the next time you need to spruce up a suit ahead of a big fundraiser or wedding the Airdresser has you covered.

You can even buy the Airdresser with a mirror finish which means it will function as a full-length standing mirror.

A premature baby born 18 weeks early in Texas was discharged from the hospital just in time to come home to her family for the holidays.

Jimena ""JC"" Macias weighed 1 lb. 9 oz. and measured 11 inches long when she was born on April 29 per KHOU 11. At the time JC's mom Juana Gallegos began to feel sick and later went into labor when she was just 22 weeks pregnant.

Gallegos said doctors told her ""they weren't going to be able to resuscitate her or be able to do anything for her if she was born there at that time that early."" To give her daughter the best possible chance Gallegos went to Memorial Hermann The Woodlands Medical Center in Shenandoah Texas.

At Memorial Hermann which features a level III neonatal intensive care unit Gallegos gave birth to JC who was put on a ventilator and given nutrition through an IV.

Baby ""JC"" was born 18 weeks early. The micro preemie weighed 1 lb 9 oz. at birth. She spent 112 days in the NICU.



She went home from the hospital in time to spend Thanksgiving with family.



Doctors call this sweet baby a miracle.

Following 112 days in the NICU JC was officially cleared to go home with her family KHOU 11 reports.

Gallegos who enjoyed Thanksgiving this year with JC at home told the news outlet that she was unsure if her daughter would be discharged in time for the holiday. ""On day one day two day 30 … I didn't think it would be possible to spend the holidays together"" she said. ""God had other plans.""

JC's father Eduardo Macias also told KHOU 11 that he and Gallegos are thankful for their newborn saying ""We see it in a different point of view as grateful because we wouldn't experience that if she wasn't here.""

While JC is no longer in the NICU she is still undergoing physical therapy though doctors say the baby is right on track for all of her milestones.

Premature babies are categorized as any baby born more than three weeks before their estimated due date according to the Mayo Clinic. Premature babies like JC can have ""complicated medical problems"" and often ""need a longer hospital stay in a special nursery unit at the hospital.""

Dr. Rebecca Ballard a neonatologist with the Memorial Hermann/Pediatrix Medical Group of Texas told KHOU 11 that JC is a ""miraculous"" case.

""While I wish this story would happen with every baby born this early it's not possible"" Ballard said. ""Not to think her story represents every baby but it makes it so much more miraculous that it happened.""",,,

Inside is a stack of metal plates that resemble a club sandwich – only the filling is a black polymer membrane coated with proprietary metal catalyst. “We call the membrane the black leaf” he says.

Flanders is the co-founder and CEO of Twelve a startup founded in 2015 which received a $57m funding boost in July. It aims to take air – or to be more precise the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in it – and transform it into something useful as plants also do eliminating damaging emissions in the process. Taking the unwanted gas wreaking havoc on our climate and using only water and renewable electricity Twelve’s metal box houses a new kind of electrolyser that transforms the CO 2 into synthesis gas (syngas) a mix of carbon monoxide and hydrogen that can be made into a range of familiar products usually made from fossil fuels. Oxygen is the only by-product. This August the pilot scale equipment made the syngas that went into what Flanders claims is the world’s first carbon neutral fossil-free jet fuel produced by electrolysing CO 2 . “This is a new way of moving carbon through our economy without pulling it out of the ground” he says.

Twelve is one of many companies beginning to make stuff out of CO 2  captured either from industrial emissions or directly from the air. High-end goods such as vodka diamonds and activewear industrial materials such as concrete plastic foam and carbon fibre and even food are all beginning to be created using CO 2 . In addition to jet fuel which is a partnership with the US air force Twelve has been using its syngas to explore making parts of car interiors with Mercedes-Benz laundry detergent ingredients with Tide and sunglasses lenses with Pangaia. Online marketplaces such as Expedition Air and SkyBaron are even springing up to sell consumer goods made with CO 2 emissions.

The beauty of carbon is you can make so many different things Volker Sick mechanical engineer

“We are at the very early end of a new carbon tech industry” says Pat Sapinsley of the Urban Future Lab at New York University who oversees a new accelerator programme to help fledgling startups get a foothold. While the industry is still only emerging – most activity is only at bench or pilot scale – it is estimated by the Lab there are now about 350 startups hoping to deliver so-called carbon-to-value. Venture capital investment has sharply risen. This year over $550m had flowed in by the end of September according to research and consulting firm Cleantech Group; that’s more than in the previous five years put together.

The sector could have the potential to reduce the world’s CO 2 emissions by more than 10% according to analysis by the University of Michigan’s Global CO 2 Initiative which aims to help the sector emerge (fuels and building materials such as concrete and aggregates are considered to hold the biggest CO 2 mitigation – and market – potential). That contribution advocates argue firmly makes carbon utilisation part of the suite of technologies we are going to need to reach the net zero commitments governments and corporations have been making and which it is becoming clear can’t be met by renewable electricity alone. “I don’t see a path to net zero without these kinds of technologies” says Richard Youngman CEO of Cleantech Group.

Premium running shoe brand On – which went public this September – realised that if it was going to reach its aggressive net zero targets it would need to rethink its materials. Its vision is now that half of all its shoe bottom foam will be made not from petrochemicals but captured carbon. Last month it announced plans to team up with US-based startup LanzaTech – an early pioneer of the sector which uses a patented fermentation process to make ethanol out of waste carbon monoxide collected from factories which would otherwise be burnt to emit CO 2 – and chemical manufacturer Borealis which makes the foam by polymerising ethylene (to which ethanol can be converted). On is hoping to unveil its first pair of shoes made wholly from captured carbon sometime next year (it has separate arrangements to make the shoe uppers). That first pair will cost about $1m to make says Caspar Coppetti On’s co-founder and executive co-chairman. It’s a lab endeavour to prove viability – but eventually when it scales he doesn’t expect the shoes to cost much more than a regular pair.

It’s not that CO 2 isn’t already used industrially (think carbonated beverages). But those uses either put the gas unchanged back into the atmosphere or in the case of enhanced oil recovery where injected CO 2 pushes out oil and then remains underground still perpetuates the extraction of new fossil fuels. What’s different here is that waste CO 2 is chemically transformed to make new products. Some such as building materials eliminate emissions by locking the carbon away permanently; others such as jet fuel prevent new emissions by recycling already emitted carbon. Often grouped with utilisation is CO 2 sequestration which promises to store large amounts of captured CO 2 permanently underground but the two are quite different as advocates point out. “It’s almost a sin to throw away a valuable resource” says Volker Sick a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan who directs the Global CO 2 Initiative. “The beauty of carbon is you can make so many different things.”

New York-based startup Air Company launched in 2017 is selling CO 2 -made vodka and perfume and produced hand sanitiser during the pandemic. Like Twelve it starts with CO 2  water and renewable energy but combines them in its reactor to make alcohols such as ethanol. A litre of vodka removes a pound of CO 2  and it may soon even use CO 2 captured from the heating systems of Manhattan office buildings (in a collaboration with capture startup CarbonQuest).

View image in fullscreen A watch sold by Expedition Air which is made with Carbon Upcycling’s CO2-enhanced concrete.

But like Twelve Air Company has jet fuel in its sights – which can also be produced from ethanol. It is a crowded field – others pressing ahead with CO 2 -made jet fuel include LanzaJet a spinoff from ethanol maker LanzaTech and SynHelion which uses solar energy to transform CO 2 to syngas.

Typically it is small amounts – think litres per hour – of jet fuel being made at this stage says Ian Hayton a materials and chemicals analyst at Cleantech Group. But countries are beginning to introduce quotas for sustainable aviation fuels which could move things forwards. And the advantage of making it from CO 2  rather than biomass or waste vegetable oils is that it uses far less land.

Canadian company CarbonCure founded in 2012 is one of the pioneers on the building materials side. Backed by investors such as Breakthrough Energy Ventures Bill Gates’s investment firm its technology involves injecting CO 2 into concrete as it is being mixed. The injected CO 2 reacts with the wet concrete and rapidly becomes permanently stored as a mineral the same one as in limestone. CarbonCure’s business model is to license its technology to concrete manufacturers themselves. CarbonCure retrofits their systems transforming them into carbon tech companies (the CO 2 is supplied by waste emission sources in their region). It gives them a green sales advantage but really what the concrete producers like is the economic benefit says co-founder and CEO Robert Niven. It means less cement is needed to make the concrete – most are able to reduce their cement content by about 5% – and the addition of the CO 2 also strengthens the final material.

It is hard to imagine that food in the form of protein could be mass produced from CO 2  but that is exactly what another subset of carbon tech companies are working on. Some such as Solar Foods in Finland and Air Protein in California – which uses the tagline “meat made from air” – intend their products for human consumption while others such as UK- and Netherlands-based Deep Branch are focusing on animal feed ingredients. With inputs typically of CO 2  water and renewable electricity along with ammonia and nutrients their proteins are produced in bioreactors from naturally occurring microbes. The microbes grow and multiply and are then dried out to produce a protein powder with all the essential amino acids. “It is somewhere between dried meat dried soy and dried carrot” says Pasi Vainikka Solar Foods co-founder and CEO of its product Solein. Admittedly that doesn’t sound very appetising but says Vainikka the taste comes in the final product and Solein is versatile. It could replace pea and soy protein isolate in processed foods or even be used as a feed for the cultivated meat industry. Treated with heat and pressure it can be eaten like a tasty slab of steak or tofu. Two kilograms of CO 2 makes a kilogram of the product and it has been submitted to food regulators in Europe and the UK for novel food approval.

Yet the field also faces many challenges to come to fruition. First if the technology is really going to serve the climate it has to be scaled up for mass production quickly and offer price-competitive products. “There’s no point unless we can deliver on scale” says Allison Dring CEO of German startup Made of Air which is focusing on plastics replacements. Many of the companies have plans for their first commercial facilities – Twelve for example which has designed its equipment to be modular so it can easily be added to increase capacity a bit like a solar farm hopes to have its first shipping container-sized plant by next year and predicts significant commercial volume by 2023. But scaling up is capital intensive and takes time.

One specific roadblock is finding customers. The startups need bigger companies to pair up with to buy their CO 2 -made raw materials but it can be hard for them to break into established supply chains. A big focus of the startup accelerator programme run out of the Urban Futures Lab called the C2V Initiative is on making inter-industry connections but really more early movers like On are needed. CarbonCure is proud of the fact that 450 concrete plants have been retrofitted with its technology – accounting for virtually all the carbon utilisation project deployments to date says Niven – but it is only a tiny fraction of the more than 100000 concrete plants there are worldwide. “Right now what we need is partners” he says.

Another bottleneck to scale may be providing the large and low-cost quantities of CO 2 needed. While technologies are certainly established to capture CO 2 from industrial sources it is only done on a minuscule scale at present experts note. Direct air capture is less technologically developed and more expensive. And infrastructure will be needed to move the CO 2 if for example it is being captured in a different place from where it is being used.

Massive government intervention and support are required for rapid growth say advocates – be that by setting a carbon price through procurement policies in government contracts that require CO 2 -based alternatives or by infrastructure investment. “This needs to be exponential growth… and we need policies to support it” says Peter Styring an expert in carbon capture and utilisation at the University of Sheffield who directs its Centre for Carbon Dioxide Utilisation. And while recent US efforts are welcomed – the US infrastructure bill for example includes over $8bn for direct air capture and CO 2 transportation and storage – “there is space for governments to be braver” says Cleantech’s Youngman.

More detailed guidelines for carbon accounting might also be needed to aid consumer acceptance. Life cycle analyses for the products need to take the whole of the supply chain into account but companies can set the boundaries in a way that excludes some processes. “We studied concrete production and in some cases it actually was worse than just making regular concrete” says Sick. Both he and Styring are working on improving how companies might perform their assessments as part of an international effort.

And just how controversial carbon utilisation will be remains an open question. Not everyone is gung-ho. Innovation has a role to play in curbing climate change says Mike Childs head of policy at the environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth but such “wonder technologies” are “unproven” to work at the massive scale envisaged and are therefore a “huge gamble” with both people’s lives and the planet. “We know that driving down emissions at source is the best and cheapest way to limit global heating” he says adding that the technology also risks providing political and business leaders with justification to keep burning fossil fuels.

The transition away from fossil fuels is a must say the advocates of CO 2 utilisation. But if we want modern life to go on as normal without sacrifices we’ll need to find new ways of continuing to produce the goods fossil fuels have given us. This industry they argue will not only help mitigate climate change but provide the carbon-based products we will always need. “There’s a lot of ‘climate don’ts’” says Flanders. “[But] you can actually continue to use products that you like just made in a better way.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvdXMvY2Fyc29uLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtd2FyZWhvdXNlLWZpcmUtc3RlbmNoLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warehouse Fire Was Source of 'Putrid' Odor in California (Published 2021),"A foul stench that nauseated and puzzled residents of Carson Calif. for weeks has been traced to a September fire at a warehouse filled with wellness and beauty products that released chemicals into a nearby waterway an investigation by a local air pollution agency has found.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued violations on Friday to four companies affiliated with the warehouse and to Los Angeles County which is responsible for maintaining the Dominguez Channel.

The warehouse fire started on Sept. 30 and quickly burned through rubbing alcohol wipes that were stored in crates and pallets a Los Angeles County fire inspector told KTLA. Mark Pestrella director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works said in an interview on Sunday that the warehouse contained “large vats of ethanol” and “everything from hand wipes to bottles of hand sanitizer.”

The chemicals then passed into the sewage system the air quality district said and ultimately drained into the Dominguez Channel a flood-control waterway that runs more than 15 miles from Los Angeles International Airport to Los Angeles Harbor. This led to the decay of organic materials in the channel resulting in the emission of hydrogen sulfide gas that far exceeded the state’s nuisance standard the agency said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZmlyZS1zdGVuY2gtY2Fyc29uLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi_SAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9maXJlLXN0ZW5jaC1jYXJzb24tY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Large warehouse fire source of lingering stench in California town investigation finds,"An investigation into a nauseating stench that plagued Carson California for months found that a nearby fire released chemicals into a local channel creating the odor. Now Los Angeles County and four other companies are facing violations for their role in the incident the South Coast Air Quality Management District announced Friday.

On September 30 a large fire ignited at a warehouse in Carson that contained beauty and wellness products from the companies Virgin Scent Incorporated and ArtNaturals and Day to Day Imports Incorporated the investigation found. The fire lasted for multiple days.

Following the fire chemicals from the stored products including ethanol passed through the city's sewer system and into the Dominguez Channel causing elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide to be emitted into the air the investigation found. At one point the hydrogen sulfide levels in the local waterway were about 230 times higher than California's nuisance standard.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hydrogen sulfide gas is colorless has a strong odor of rotten eggs and can cause irritation to the eyes and respiratory system as well as coma convulsions dizziness headache and insomnia upon exposure. The gas is created by rotting plants and other materials in the water according to the Los Angeles County Public Works.

The two companies their parent company Prologis Incorporated Liberty Properties — the owner of the warehouse — and the county of Los Angeles are accused of causing a public nuisance that violates a section of California's Health and Safety Codes as well as a rule from the South Coast Air Quality Management District. The lingering stench cost the Los Angeles Department of Public Works an estimated $5.4 million to remedy.

Officials said they began receiving reports of foul odor in the city on October 3 and have since responded to more than 4600 complaints from residents throughout Los Angeles County.

One Carson resident said at one point the smell was so bad that they wore a face mask while inside of their own home CBS Los Angeles reported. Another said the fumes worsened their preexisting health conditions.

""I'm in remission from cancer so that makes it worse and I have asthma"" resident Hermel Rivera told CBS Los Angeles.

Thousands of impacted residents were relocated to hotels in surrounding cities due to the lingering odor and hundreds of air purifiers were distributed Carson Mayor Lula Davis-Holmes said. The mayor and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors each declared a local emergency for the stench in October.

The five notices of violations can result in civil penalties should the violators not establish measures that reduce emissions or prevent future violations regulators said.",,,,,,

The catch? It’s available for one night and one night only next spring.

And it’s likely you’ll have to log on as soon as the booking period opens on December 6 in order to score the coveted reservation. Here’s the scoop.

Villa Balbiano Is Showcased In House Of Gucci Movie

Built in the 16th century Villa Balbiano is today one of the largest private residences on Lake Como Italy according to the Airbnb listing. With beautifully landscaped gardens the villa on the lake’s western shore was showcased — albeit briefly — in the House of Gucci film starring Lady Gaga Adam Driver Jared Leto and Al Pacino.

The lavish mansion serves as the villa home of Al Pacino’s character Aldo Gucci patriarch of the family that launched a fashion empire. The grounds are the backdrop for Aldo’s birthday party scenes for just a short while — moviegoers mainly see the exterior of the lakefront villa — in the movie that has been largely panned by critics.

Still a drone-camera view of the majestic estate in the film reveals a private waterfront locale where one lucky person can live like a Hollywood star for a night. Images on Airbnb show crystal chandeliers and velvet furnishings in the bedrooms and living areas as well as bathrooms made of marble. Seventeenth-century frescoes adorn the walls and period antiques are found throughout the property.

There’s also an outdoor pool and private boathouse and pier. Whoever rents the home will have access to the first three floors which are accessible by elevator. It has 6 bedrooms 6 bathrooms and the listing notes that to experience it all in one night (check-in at 3 p.m. and check-out at 11 a.m.) the guests may not want to sleep!

How To Reserve Villa Balbiano On Airbnb

Currently all “available dates” on the Airbnb listing are marked occupied. But presumably on December 6 “at 12 p.m. ET” interested parties will be able to log on to reserve Villa Balbiano for $1131 for one night: March 30 2022.

Technically that means it goes up for reservation at noon on December 6 so if you’re eager to book get your trigger finger ready by 11:59 a.m. Eastern Time on December 6. (Unless the Airbnb listing was meant to be midnight ET on December 6 in which case you might want to consider logging on at 11:59 p.m. on December 5!)

Intrigued? Want to stay longer? Villa Balbiano is also listed on My Private Villas where you can fill out an online inquiry to learn more about this ornate villa that just might offer a once-in-a-lifetime experience in one of the most beautiful places in all of Italy.

And if one night isn ’t enough Edge Retreats the luxury vacation rental platform is renting out Villa Balbiano year-round. Guests have a chance to “be wined and dined pampered and treated like fashion royalty by a private chef housekeeper and a VIP concierge ” says Edge Retreats.

In the event you want to leave the villa to tour there are plenty of things to do at Lake Como.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy43MGFuZDczLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvenktY2FiaW4tc2hvcnQtdGVybS1yZW50YWxzLWluLW1lZGZvcmQtbGFrZXMtbm8tbG9uZ2VyLWFyZS1sZWdhbC1uZXctbGF3LWNyYWNrcy9hcnRpY2xlXzVlMGUxZGM0LTU1MGEtMTFlYy1iY2MzLWNiOGRkN2ExODlmMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Cozy cabin' short-term rentals in Medford Lakes no longer are legal.

Battery grade lithium carbonate prices have approximately quadrupled since December 31 2020 and the pace of the increase has accelerated over the past few months.

According to China Central Television this increase in lithium carbonate pricing has increased the cost to produce a battery-powered vehicle by nearly US$500. By comparison through early October Bitcoin with a 49% return was the broad asset class with the greatest year-to-date appreciation.

A passage in Fastmarkets a publication which chronicles prices and supply-demand characteristics of many commodities discussing the status of the lithium market in late November is telling: “A Chinese distributor active in southern Europe that sources lithium technical-grade carbonate said that producers he dealt with preferred to discuss short-term supply contracts rather than committing to long-term contracts on expectations that prices will continue to rise.”

The supply-demand lithium situation has prompted many lithium producers and EV manufacturers particularly China-based companies to secure future lithium production capacity. This is the case despite China’s possessing the fourth largest lithium reserves in the world (primarily in its remote Tibet and Qinghai provinces). Indeed China imports about 70% of its lithium from foreign producers. As U.S.-based EV OEMs ramp up production they will have to source all lithium from overseas producers as no lithium mines are currently operational in America.

Over the last few months Ganfeng Lithium one of the world’s leading lithium producers and battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) China’s second largest company by stock market value attempted to acquire Millennial Lithium Corp. (TSXV: ML). Millennial Lithium owns a lithium brine development project in Argentina. Another lithium company Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) ultimately outbid both Chinese companies for Millennial.

In September Ganfeng bought the 9% stake it did not own in another lithium brine project in Argentina called the Mariana project. Mariana is less than 140 kilometers south of Atacama Salar in Chile the largest producing lithium brine deposit in the world.

In October Zijin Mining Group a China-based gold copper and zinc producer decided to enter the lithium mining business when it reached a deal to buy Neo Lithium Corp. (TSXV: NLC) for around US$750 million in cash. Neo’s lithium brine project in Catamarca Argentina is one of the highest-grade projects of its kind.

In early November Do-Fluoride New Materials of China agreed to supply lithium hexafluophosphate (LiPF6) to BYD a China-based EV OEM for four years beginning in January 2022. The supply price was not disclosed.

Finally on November 29 Stellantis NV (NYSE: STLA) the parent of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot signed a five-year agreement starting in 2026 with Germany-based Vulcan Energy Resources Ltd. Vulcan which plans to utilize clean geothermal energy to produce battery-quality lithium hydroxide will supply 81000 to 99000 tonnes of that material to Stellantis. The accord is predicated on the future successful start of production at Vulcan and full product qualification.

As an aside even Albemarle Corp. (NYSE: ALB; market cap of US$31 billion) the world’s largest lithium miner does not rule out acquiring smaller lithium producers according to Eric Norris its head of lithium in an early November interview with Yahoo Finance.

Investors may want to consider two smaller lithium developers Lithium Americas Corp. and Sigma Lithium Corporation (NASDAQ: SGMA). The flagship lithium properties for both companies located in Argentina and Brazil respectively are expected to commence production in 2022.

And this is just the start. With the price of lithium expected to continue to rise more transaction of this nature are surely to arise as global producers look to secure their supply chains in an increasingly electrified world.

Three ex-Google employees filed a lawsuit this week accusing their former employer of terminating them for protesting a cloud deal that Google signed with the Trump administration's Customs and Border Patrol in 2019.

Rebecca Rivers Sophie Waldman and Paul Duke claim in the complaint that when they were hired by Google they were asked to sign a contract that included the company's catchphrase clause ""Don't Be Evil."" The plaintiffs say Google violated the agreement and are asking for compensation and other relief for suffering ""significant damage to reputation and ability to be gainfully reemployed.""

Google parent Alphabet has little reason to be concerned financially — the company has over $140 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet and a market cap of about $1.9 trillion. But a string of employee walkouts internal battles over how the company uses its artificial intelligence technology and lawsuits related to treatment of its workforce present a potentially severe strain for a company that has long prided itself on a culture of openness and inclusivity.

Last December the U.S. National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against Google alleging the company illegally terminated and surveilled employees in retaliation for their efforts to unionize. The trial has been paused for the last couple of months while judges review subpoenas and it's unclear when it will resume.

Laurie Burgess the lawyer representing the former employees who sued Google this week said the latest suit is meant in part to serve as ""a reminder that this is still alive and kicking.""

In response a Google spokesperson issued the following statement to CNBC on Saturday afternoon: ""As we confirmed in 2019 like most companies we engage dozens of outside consultants and law firms to provide us with advice on a wide range of topics including employer obligations and employee engagement. This included IRI Consultants for a short period. We disagree with the Special Master's ruling which mischaracterizes various legally privileged materials and are reviewing our options.""

This week a judge on the NLRB case Paul Bogas ordered Google to unseal more than 70 documents related to its communications with IRI Consultants which describes itself as a labor relations firm. The NLRB alleged that IRI was hired as part of Google's anti-union effort which legal documents show was dubbed ""Project Vivian.""Bogas issued a 13-page response stating that the company was ""disingenuous"" and that it tried to misrepresent the documents' classification.""My review did show that the Respondent made significant contemporaneous efforts to give this non-legal 3rd-party material the facial appearance of privileged communications"" Bogas wrote. ""Many of these documents are or involve the development of campaign materials in which IRI provides antiunion messaging and message amplification strategies and training tailored to the Respondent's workforce and the news and social media environment.""In January Google employees came together to create the Alphabet Workers Union which now includes more than 800 members. Though it currently represents less than 1% of the company's total workforce the union is proving it intends to be vocal and active. It supported Google workers employed by contracting firm Adecco who just won a fight against the firm and Google after the company backtracked on a bonus program for temp workers in data centers.""The union definitely strengthened people's resolve to standing up for the fight"" Ned McNally a temp worker at Google's data center in Council Bluffs Iowa told The New York Times last month after the victory.

The matchup between two programs widely regarded as the best high school boys basketball teams in the country came down to the closing seconds on Friday.

No. 2 IMG Academy took down No. 1 Montverde on a second-chance layup from Baylor commit Keyonte George that came with less than 10 seconds remaining in the game. The IMG Academy Ascenders took down the Montverde Eagles 65-64 in an early-season battle between the two juggernauts loaded with collegiate talent.

But despite IMG being ranked lower don’t tell George that this result was unexpected. After the game he had a message for Sports Illustrated’s Jason Jordan:

“It’s not an upset.”

George finished with 14 points and five rebounds. His final score the biggest of the night can be found around the 1:33:40 mark of the game recording:

That wasn’t George’s only big shot. He ended the first quarter with an impressive drive and finish.

Highly ranked players around the five-star shooting guard also showed out in this battle. Five-star power forward Jarace Walker a Houston commit lead IMG with 20 points and added seven rebounds and five blocks.

Five-star small forward Dariq Whitehead who is committed to Duke led Montverde with 31 points 10-for-19 shooting and five 3-pointers.

That was just one of the highly anticipated games in the NIBC series. On Saturday IMG Academy plays Oak Hill Academy (Mouth of Wilson Va.) while Montverde will play Sunrise Christian Academy (Bel Aire Kan.)

Montverde’s match will be another big test — after all Sunrise Christian defeated IMG Academy on Thursday.

MOSCOW: Boris Dobrodeev on Friday said he was stepping down as CEO of Russian internet company VK  amid a significant overhaul of the firm's shareholder structure that has seen state-owned entities assume control.State consolidation of decision-making power at Russia's second-largest internet firm which runs the country's most popular social network VKontakte  Russia's answer to Facebook  could presage greater interference in the sector by the government an internet analyst said.Moscow has clamped down on technology companies this year with fines related to banned content and Russians' user data in particular foreign social media firms a campaign critics characterise as an attempt by the Russian authorities to exert tighter control over the internet.VK said it had been notified of the planned changes in the shareholder structure of MF Technologies which holds a 4.8% stake in the company but controls 57.3% of its voting rights.On Thursday Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov's holding company USM said it had sold 45% of the 54% MF Technologies stake under its control to state-run insurer Sogaz which is part-owned by a longtime ally of President Vladimir Putin.Shareholders in Sogaz which was founded by gas giant Gazprom include banker Yuri Kovalchuk whom Putin has publicly called a personal friend. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller is board chairman at Sogaz.As of Oct. 27 Kovalchuk and his wife controlled around half of the shares in the Aquila firm which holds 32.3% of Sogaz and Gazprom and its companies have another 23.7%.A USM representative told Reuters a deal with Gazprombank over its remaining 9% stake in MF Technologies was ongoing. Gazprom owns just under 50% of Gazprombank.On Friday Gazprom Media said Gazprombank had transferred it a 45% stake in MF Technologies. Previously Gazprombank held a 36% stake acquired from Sberbank in November.Gazprom on Friday declined to comment when asked about its plans for VK.Internet analyst Pavel Klimarev wrote on his Telegram channel ZaTelekom that the changes would give Gazprom Media and consequently the Russian state more control over the media landscape.He predicted that more pressure would be exerted on Russia's independent internet companies such as Yandex as well as on the likes of Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube.The RBC daily reported citing four sources that Vladimir Kiriyenko first vice president at state-owned Rostelecom and son of Putin's first deputy chief of staff Sergei Kiriyenko was set to become VK's new CEO.Rostelecom declined to comment on the report.London-listed shares in VK jumped on Thursday's news but were 8% lower on Friday by 1530 GMT.""The change significantly increases risks for VK - uncertainty over the strategy management"" said Maria Sukhanova TMT analyst at BCS Global Markets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9vYnNlc3NlZC1zYW1zdW5nLWFpcmRyZXNzZXItbWlnaHQtanVzdC0yMTAwMTgwMzIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We're Obsessed: The Samsung Airdresser Might Just Be the Coolest Luxury Appliance in the World,"

Have you heard of the Samsung Aidresser yet? It only recently came across our radar here at SPY. Technically this appliance was first released back in 2020 with limited availability but we first heard about it during a virtual event with Samsung earlier this Fall. Ever since then we’ve been low-key obsessed with this luxury Samsung appliance which is unlike anything we’ve seen before.

Today's Top Deals

Why haven’t we written about it before? Well it’s definitely a luxury appliance and it’s not something the average guy is going to add to his closet.

But with Christmas right around the corner we figure someone out there is looking for a big gift for the impossible-to-shop-for man in their life. What do you buy the impeccably well-dressed gentleman who prefers to pick out his own clothes accessories and top-shelf whiskey? We recommend the Samsung Airdresser which would be a godsend for any fashionista or clotheshorse in your life.

Okay so what is it? The Samsung Airdresser is an at-home dry cleaning cabinet.

You simply load it up with your dry-clean-only suits dress shirts and accessories close the door and the Airdresser goes to work sanitizing deodorizing de-wrinkling and otherwise cleaning your garments. And of course this smart appliance is also Wi-Fi connected. For anyone with a walk-in closet it’s the ultimate luxury flex.

Think about it this way: you could actually save money if you’re already dropping hundreds of dollars at the local dry cleaners every few months.

The Samsung Airdresser: How It Works

While it might sound like a complicated piece of machinery (and it is) it’s actually pretty easy to use and install.

Per Samsung “Simply plug your AirDresser into a standard 120V outlet and you’re all set. No separate water line or professional installation necessary — the refillable water reservoir and filtered water are all you need.”

Meanwhile the “built-in deodorizing filter eliminates 99% of common odors in fabrics like house pet smells smoke perspiration unpleasant food and other musty odors.”

So the next time you need to spruce up a suit ahead of a big fundraiser or wedding the Airdresser has you covered.

You can even buy the Airdresser with a mirror finish which means it will function as a full-length standing mirror.

If there’s a catch it’s the cost. The regular Airdresser will set you back $1350 although it is available via Amazon. The Airdresser With Mirror Finish and Airdresser Grand which has a larger capacity are closer to $1500 and $1700 respectively though they’re currently on sale via Samsung.

Like we said it’s not the kind of purchase you really need but it’s exactly the kind of appliance you know you want. If you can afford it that also makes it the perfect Christmas gift.

Now as many retailers panic over supply chain chaos Amazon's costly early moves are helping it avoid the long wait times for available dock space and workers at the country's busiest ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.

""Los Angeles there's 79 vessels sitting out there up to 45 days waiting to come into the harbor"" ocean freight analyst Steve Ferreira told CNBC in November. ""Amazon's latest venture that I've been tracking in the last two days it waited two days in the harbor.""

By chartering private cargo vessels to carry its goods Amazon can control where its goods go avoiding the most congested ports.

""Who else would think of putting something going into an obscure port in Washington and then trucking it down to L.A.? Most people are thinking well just bring the ship into L.A. But then you're experiencing those two-week and three-weeks delay. So Amazon's really taken advantage of some of the niche strategies I believe that the market needs to employ"" Ferreira said.

Still Amazon has seen a 14% rise in out-of-stock items and an average price increase of 25% since January 2021 according to e-commerce management platform CommerceIQ.

""The consumer has been feeling price increases in everything that they're purchasing"" said Margaret Kidd Supply Chain & Logistics Technology program director at the University of Houston. ""Ultimately when there's an increase in the cost of transportation it gets passed down to the consumer.""

Amazon has been on a spending spree to control as much of the shipping process as possible. It spent more than $61 billion on shipping in 2020 up from just under $38 billion in 2019. Now Amazon is shipping 72% of its own packages up from less than 47% in 2019 according to SJ Consulting Group.

It's even taking control at the first step of the shipping journey by making its own 53-foot cargo containers in China. Containers are in short supply with long wait times and prices surging from less than $2000 before the pandemic to $20000 today.

""Amazon has produced probably 5000 to 10000 of these containers over the last two years I've been tracking it"" Ferreira said. ""When they bring these containers onto U.S. soil once they unload them guess what? They get to be used in the domestic system and the rail system. They don't have to return them to Asia like everyone else does.""

Experts say it will put one of the nation’s most pristine wetlands at risk.

A predawn phone call woke Ron Bledsoe with a jolt. It was his supervisor telling him to come in.

Bledsoe dressed and drove an hour to the power plant near Kingston Tennessee where he worked. He arrived at a shocking sight: A mountain of coal ash covering the road and a set of railroad tracks. It looked like the surface of the moon he recalled.

Hours earlier an embankment at the plant had ruptured flooding the area with gray muck. The spill was an environmental calamity and the fallout was immediate. The ash blanketed up to 400 acres killed hundreds of fish damaged more than a dozen homes and polluted nearby waterways. The clean-up took years and cost more than $1 billion.

Coal ash an umbrella term for the residue that’s left over when utilities burn coal is one of the United States’ largest kinds of industrial waste. It contains metals — such as lead mercury chromium selenium cadmium and arsenic — that never biodegrade. Studies have shown these contaminants are dangerous to humans and have linked some to cancer lung disease and birth defects.

For a time the Kingston incident catapulted coal ash into the public consciousness. But experts say it continues to pose a massive threat throughout the country.

About 400 miles southwest of Kingston a coal ash lagoon — which holds almost four times as much sludge as what spilled in Tennessee — is sitting in the Mobile–Tensaw Delta one of the most biodiverse areas of the United States with flora and fauna not known to exist anywhere else on Earth. Environmentalists community members and scientists fear the pond could someday unleash a Kingston-like catastrophe on southern Alabama and say leaving the coal ash in the delta is shortsighted and dangerous.

“We’ve got an A-bomb up the river” John Howard who lives in Mobile County and said he has been fishing in southern Alabama for decades said. “It’s just waiting to happen.”

‘Horror’ scene in Kingston

Most Americans had likely never heard of coal ash until three days before Christmas 2008 when the Kingston spill news broke.

Before the 1970s many utilities pumped their coal ash into the atmosphere attorney Lisa Evans who has focused on coal ash litigation for more than 20 years said. After Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1970 which regulated power plants’ air emissions some facilities began storing their coal ash in dirt ditches commonly known today as ash ponds or surface impoundments.

Hundreds of these sites now dot the country according to data that federal regulations require pond operators to publish and was compiled by Earthjustice a nonprofit that handles environmental lawsuits. Because coal plants produce electricity by converting large volumes of water into steam many of these waste sites are situated near river systems and flood zones. But 40 or fewer have a protective liner to contain the leftover ash and more than 200 have been shown to contaminate groundwater with toxic substances at levels that exceed federal safety standards the Earthjustice data shows.

With the Clean Air Act the nation traded one environmental problem for another Evans who works for Earthjustice said.

“One could see the billowing black smoke” Evans said. “You can’t see coal ash contaminating underlying groundwater (…) you can’t see the slow pollution of the adjacent river and the dying of the fish (…) It’s likely to be less dramatic.”

After 5.4 million cubic yards of coal ash spilled at the Kingston plant the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated the area as a Superfund site. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) which owned the plant spent more than $1 billion over six years to clean up the spill.

The aftermath “was like nothing I’ve ever seen before” Richard Moore who served as the inspector general for the TVA at the time said. “It was like a scene out of a horror movie.”

Tommy Johnson — like Bledsoe the worker who compared the Kingston spill to the moon’s surface — was at the facility that day. He spent six years working on the clean-up effort and said he believes exposure to the coal ash made him sick.

In 2018 Johnson joined more than 200 plaintiffs in suing Jacobs Engineering a TVA contractor hired to oversee the Kingston cleanup alleging Jacobs lied to workers about the ash’s toxicity. Bledsoe was also part of a suit which was filed in 2013. A jury eventually found that Jacobs failed to keep workers safe during the cleanup and that this failure could have caused the illnesses and injuries they suffered. The parties are now litigating over whether individual workers’ illnesses are a result of coal ash exposure.

“It’s (been) one ailment after another” Johnson said.

Today Johnson said he struggles to breathe and walk. Bledsoe according to court filings signed by his doctor suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease a disease that is typically caused by cigarette smoking. Bledsoe and his doctor have said he was never a smoker.

In a statement Jacobs spokesperson Heather Byrd told CNN the company “stands by its work assisting TVA with the difficult job of cleaning up the Kingston coal ash spill” adding that “the evidence will prove that the plaintiffs’ claimed conditions were not caused by exposure to coal ash at Kingston.”

TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks said in a statement that the utility has become an “industry leader in the safe secure management of coal ash.”

EPA’s ‘tipping point’

In response to the Kingston disaster the EPA set out to review the condition of more than 500 coal ash ponds across the United States.

“(Kingston) was almost a tipping point” Mathy Stanislaus who served as assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response from 2009 to 2017 said. “The reaction (at the EPA) was ‘We need to do something about this.’”

In 2015 the agency implemented its first-ever regulations on coal ash disposal forcing utilities across the country to begin closure and remediation of ponds that were unlined and contaminating groundwater above permitted levels.

The rule gives such ponds’ owners two closure options: seal the ash through a procedure known as capping-in-place or dig it up and move it to a lined landfill.

Depending on a pond’s size the EPA gave utilities between five and potentially 15 years to close them. In 2018 a federal court decision prompted the EPA to amend its rule. Today some utilities may have until 2036 to complete closure of certain ash ponds.

But environmental advocates say capping-in-place is not always an effective option especially for ponds where coal ash sits below the water table the point below which the ground is saturated with water because the cap does not prevent heavy metals from leaching into the surrounding area. They often point to a 2001 report by the Electric Power Research Institute in which researchers studied three unlined closed ponds and found that while groundwater quality improved at two it didn’t improve at the third where some ash sat below the water table.

Moreover they fear that as weather patterns become more extreme and less predictable leaving coal ash in an unlined pond is reckless because the potential for a catastrophic spill will always loom.

A nationwide challenge

There are an estimated 511 coal ash ponds in the United States according to a CNN analysis of the data compiled by Earthjustice. Nearly half — about 46% — are unlined and have been or will be closed in place. The utilities’ self-reported data shows around 160 are known to be contaminating groundwater but groundwater data gathered by the Environmental Integrity Project a nonprofit watchdog that advocates for better environmental law enforcement places that number at closer to 200. It’s unclear how many of those ponds sit below the water table or have direct contact with groundwater but around 60 sit in a flood zone.

Mapping coal ash ponds

Geologist Mark Hutson said that because the majority of the ponds are constructed along rivers — and typically in flood plains — many are likely to pollute the groundwater.

“The science points us clearly to excavation as the only way to protect public health and the environment” Michael Regan who ran North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality and now serves as EPA administrator said about ponds in that state in 2019.

In the 2015 rule the EPA declined to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste instead opting to regulate it as solid waste a category that can include everything from banana peels and candy wrappers to sewage and industrial sludge. That designation effectively allowed utilities to police themselves unless state regulators or private citizens which the law gives standing to seek enforcement through the courts intervened.

Stanislaus the former EPA assistant administrator said the agency declined to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste in part because business leaders raised concerns that doing so would hamstring their ability to recycle the substance which is frequently used in cement grout and other construction materials and because officials felt regulating coal ash as solid waste would still adequately prevent it from contaminating air and water.

That decision meant that initially states could regulate coal ash through existing water and waste programs. But it was a missed opportunity to enact stronger safeguards Dalal Aboulhosn the Sierra Club’s deputy director of policy advocacy and legal said.

“If EPA would have decided to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste we would have gotten the strictest of protections for communities” Aboulhosn said. “From cradle to grave we would be looking at coal ash as something that could harm communities and (making) sure it would be disposed of properly.”

In 2016 the federal government reclaimed some oversight when a new law authorized the EPA to review states’ programs for regulating pond closures. For states that didn’t develop their own programs the law required the EPA to develop one instead.

The EPA must still approve states’ programs but Evans said lax oversight and vague benchmarks — guidelines the agency published in 2017 say mainly that state programs must be “at least as protective as” federal regulations and should ensure public participation — have given states considerable leeway when regulating coal ash.

“The absence of (federal) requirements has left important criteria up in the air and fails to guarantee important safeguards nationally” Evans wrote in an email.

When President Joe Biden chose Regan to lead the EPA last December Evans hoped the pick would usher in more rigorous enforcement. Regan had firsthand experience with the consequences of coal ash pollution; In North Carolina he led the state’s department of environmental quality in the years following a spill.

In an interview with CNN last week Regan signaled the Biden EPA will indeed take a firmer stance on coal ash management.

While Regan did not provide specifics he said the agency is planning to announce details which he said could include additional regulatory actions soon. That announcement Regan said will give a “clearer picture of how the agency plans to move forward” nationwide.

“We’re pretty far down the road on this and we recognize the sense of urgency” Regan said.

Sources familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement is still being finalized told CNN they expect it to include decisions on a handful of applications for closure extensions at coal ash ponds across the country and notices to several facilities about compliance obligations.

In the meantime some state governments have taken it upon themselves and forced utilities to excavate their coal ash pits.

After a broken pipe unleashed more than 46000 cubic yards of coal ash from a retired power plant on the Dan River in 2014 near Eden North Carolina state officials enacted a law forcing the closure of all unlined coal ash ponds in the state ultimately requiring utilities to recycle the ash or put it in a lined landfill.

And in 2019 a Virginia law required Dominion Energy to excavate more than 27 million cubic yards of coal ash from ponds across the state.

But in other states including Alabama utilities still have the option to close ponds through cap-in-place.

‘We love our power company’

Standing behind the wheel of a motorboat in April Ben Raines a former newspaper journalist who offers tours of the Mobile–Tensaw Delta steered with the confidence of a man cruising across the Mediterranean on a yacht.

The Mobile–Tensaw Delta is part of the Mobile River Basin which drains most of Alabama’s water through the delta the Mobile Bay and into the Gulf of Mexico. It is one of the largest and most biodiverse river systems in North America; the region is home to at least 35 kinds of orchids and likely more turtle species than any other river system on Earth. At least 30 types of carnivorous plants live in the delta. Raines who has often referred to the delta as “America’s Amazon” points out one that eats insects.

Alabama’s ecosystems are particularly diverse because glaciers never covered the state during Earth’s last ice age unlike large swaths of what is now North America.

The delta is where Alabama Power’s James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant’s smokestacks tower above the treeline. Many refer to the plant named for the executive who led the utility from 1949 to 1952 as simply “Barry” or “Plant Barry.” It’s about 25 miles north of downtown Mobile sits on the Mobile River and forms a corridor of industrial facilities. At 597 acres Barry’s ash pond is nearly as large as the National Mall. A grassy berm dotted with yellow flowers lines the property’s edge and separates 21.7 million cubic yards of coal ash from the river.

“Coal ash is sitting there right on the edge of (the delta)” Raines said occasionally stopping his boat to pluck a plant from the water and marvel at it.

“If there were an accident (…) we would have lost you know one of America’s treasures and a treasure that people are only beginning to understand and explore.”

Alabama Power spent $30 million to construct Barry which opened in 1954. The plant was intended to meet the area’s rapidly expanding electricity needs. Mobile’s population exploded during World War II as the shipbuilding industry grew Mark VanLandingham a population studies professor at Tulane University said. Mobile was fairly developed by the 1950s; it had 17 movie theaters four hotels and two daily newspapers. The city which had about 174000 residents in 1956 was a manufacturing hub for pulp and paper products lumber and textiles. A guide to Mobile from 1957 boasted that the city was on its way to becoming one of the “great centers of trade and industry.”

But that didn't pan out. The city’s population peaked at roughly 200000 in 1960. As residents moved to suburbs and manufacturing began moving overseas Mobile’s population like many other post-industrial cities’ declined VanLandingham said.

As of 2019 census estimates showed the city of Mobile was home to almost 189000 people. About 18% of the city’s residents lived in poverty. That share was higher — about 21% — for Black Mobilians who made up more than half the city’s population.

With about 6000 employees Alabama Power is a major employer in the state. It provides energy to roughly 100000 customers in the city of Mobile. Its corporate parent Southern Company owns electric utilities in Georgia and Mississippi and is the third largest electric utility company in the country by market value.

In a state where storms are commonplace “the most important person who shows up at our door after a hurricane is the Alabama Power guy who has just turned our lights back on” said Casi Callaway who grew up in Mobile and spent 23 years as the executive director of Mobile Baykeeper an environmental nonprofit that aims to protect southern Alabama’s waters.

“We love our power company” she said.

Alabama Power’s choice

Alabama Power is poised to close the Barry pond through capping-in-place. Its process according to the closure plan filed with state environmental regulators last year would remove water from the pond to shrink its footprint by nearly half before filling the perimeter with soil and sealing the ash with a cover made from plastic crushed rock and artificial turf that the company has said is designed to “virtually eliminate infiltration of surface water.”

Records show the site has been contaminating groundwater for years. In its most recent groundwater monitoring report from 2020 Alabama Power revealed elevated levels of arsenic and cobalt near the Barry plant that exceeded groundwater protection standards by more than eight times and more than five times respectively. In 2018 state officials fined the company $250000 for arsenic pollution saying the company had “caused or allowed the unpermitted discharge of pollutants associated with ash pond wastewater from the Plant Barry Ash Pond to waters of the State.”

In a document filed with the state’s utility regulator last month company officials acknowledged environmental groups’ concerns about the cap-in-place method’s effectiveness toward protecting groundwater and that “the risk of an adverse outcome remains” but wrote the company believes its plans for Barry’s ash pond and about 10 other coal waste sites in the state meet federal requirements and that requiring full ash removal would “dramatically” increase costs and “adversely impact” nearby residents’ quality of life through “decades of constant truck traffic.”

“It’s about the money” Moore the former TVA inspector general who now lives near Barry in Baldwin County said. “I believe the corporate culture and the corporate mindset at most utilities is the same way: If they can do it on the cheap that's what they're going to do.”

Alabama Power has estimated that it will spend about $860 million to close the Barry ash pond by capping it in place and an additional $36 million for post-closure maintenance according to its closure plan. Jack Bonnikson a company spokesperson declined to say what the company estimated excavation would cost.

But no excavation cost would compare to cleaning up a spill Evans the environmental attorney said.

“It is infinitely cheaper to scoop ash out of a pond and truck it to a lined landfill than to excavate it out of a river and out of people’s yards” she said.

Frank Holleman a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) who has litigated against utilities over coal ash contamination for over a decade said utilities often misrepresent how much each method will cost.

“As a general rule they overstate the cost of excavation and they understate the cost of cap-in-place” Holleman said.

In addition Holleman said utilities often prefer capping-in-place to avoid the “managerial hassle” of transporting coal ash.

In written responses to CNN Bonnikson challenged Holleman’s claim. He said cost estimates often change as work on a project progresses and that the engineers and geologists who develop cost estimates are expected to adhere to professional standards.

Closing these ponds has sometimes come at a high price for utilities though often their customers are footing large shares of the bill.

Duke Energy for example has estimated it will spend $8 billion to $9 billion to comply with North Carolina’s law and excavate 31 ponds in that state in addition to four in South Carolina.

Bill Norton a spokesperson for Duke Energy couldn’t say how much of that total pertained to the North Carolina ponds. But he said it made up “the vast majority” of the multibillion-dollar estimate and that about $3.8 billion — or at least 40% — will be passed on to North Carolina retail customers.

But customers’ payments aren’t just going toward the cost of pond closures. They’re also lining shareholders’ pockets.

Because many utilities operate as natural monopolies where state regulators control prices the companies’ profits often depend on how well they control costs. In 1923 the US Supreme Court ruled that to ensure that utilities remain financially sound and can continue to provide services they should be entitled to recoup the costs of certain investments and profit from them.

Utility regulators and courts are supposed to make sure such investments are reasonable and necessary and that the costs passed onto customers are appropriate.

But Dave Rogers a deputy director at the Sierra Club said they are often politicized and customers don’t always get “a fair shake.” Jim Lazar a former senior adviser at the Regulatory Assistance Project said the result is that today’s customers end up paying for earlier generations’ mistakes.

It’s unclear how much Alabama Power stands to profit from the Barry closure. Bonnikson declined to provide a figure but a recent filing with the state’s public service commission outlined financial information related to how the company will comply with government mandates next year.

Anna Sommer a consultant at Energy Futures Group who has advised groups working toward improving Alabama’s public utility regulation process reviewed the filing for CNN and estimated that the utility would likely return around $200 million to shareholders in the coming years as a result of the Barry pond closure. Sommer’s assessment was reviewed by two ratemaking experts for CNN: Lazar and Stephen Hill an independent consultant who has provided expert testimony in ratemaking cases.

Debating Alabama Power’s plan

In an email Bonnikson said the utility’s annual filings “transparently provided estimated costs for compliance and associated rate calculations.” He declined to comment on Sommer’s estimate saying only that the utility “will not validate estimates or calculations (CNN) may have received from a third-party group.”

In March community members environmentalists and coal industry advocates gathered at a Hampton Inn in Saraland a Mobile suburb near Plant Barry for a public hearing to comment on Alabama Power’s closure plan.

Some speakers including Jonathan Hale who runs an Alabama-based mining company supported the utility’s plan. Hale said he was concerned that transporting the waste to a landfill could lead to ash spills on roads and put unnecessary wear and tear on Alabama’s highways.

Many speakers opposed Alabama Power’s plan. One woman became emotional as she recounted learning there was an unlined coal ash pond near her home. A man compared the Barry pond to a rotting tooth that needs to be taken out a cancerous skin lesion that should be removed and mold growing on drywall that needs to be gutted and replaced.

Nicholas Williams a 29-year-old sales and support representative for a small online hunting gear retailer stood at the microphone in a T-shirt and baseball cap.

“Twenty years I’ve been poking around up there looking for deer and hogs and ducks and big ol’ flatheads” Williams said. “Looking for game but also looking for the peace that a vast mass of calm waters and cypress trees brings. Looking for a sense of being and perspective that you find when you stand on top of the Indian mounds (…) and realize that you’re really very small in the grand scheme of things.”

For Williams being in the delta is a way of life. He and his wife Sarah bought a home perched on Tensaw Lake a tributary in the delta three years ago. The couple have chickens in their front yard — the rooster is named Sue after the Johnny Cash song — and a collection of birds Nicholas has killed is mounted on their living room wall. He said he worries that a spill at Barry could destroy the delta that he hopes to one day share with his children.

“I believe leaving the coal ash pond in place is taking a chance with something that should not be left to chance” he said. “We don’t have to jeopardize the Mobile–Tensaw Delta.”

While state regulators approved Alabama Power’s plans for the Barry pond in July EPA Administrator Regan told CNN last month that his agency is “actively investigating (…) the Plant Barry situation.”

“We understand the concerns about this facility in Alabama” Regan said. “The last administration’s leadership failed to act on these concerns. This administration will act to protect communities and based on my prior experience if there is coal ash in contact with groundwater that’s putting the health and safety of communities at risk and requires our attention.”

‘Nothing God can do’

When Hurricane Ida approached the Gulf Coast in late August Cade Kistler and the Mobile Baykeeper staff prepared for the worst.

At their downtown Mobile office they put trash bags over computers and moved them away from windows. They prepared their boat and test tubes to take water samples from the river and check for coal ash. Kistler Baykeeper’s interim director made sure his family had enough food in case the power at their home went out.

After the storm made landfall in Louisiana Kistler drove to Barry to look for signs of damage.

He put a chainsaw in the back of his Subaru in case he needed to cut through fallen trees. The rain was still heavy he said recalling how his car shook from the wind as he crossed Mobile Bay on the highway. Kistler who remembered feeling cautiously optimistic because Ida didn’t directly hit the area said he didn’t see any signs indicating a disaster had struck Barry.

Meanwhile Ida was carving a path of destruction across the country killing at least 80 people across eight states. By any measure it was one of the strongest tropical storms to ever hit Louisiana.

“We got off really light” Kistler said. “It really is just a matter of when a similar storm (…) hits coastal Alabama.”

When Kistler and his staff learn a hurricane has formed in the Gulf they worry about two disaster scenarios at Barry: its dam collapsing or that river water will overtop the dam sending coal ash surging into the delta.

A coal ash spill wouldn’t be southern Alabama’s first brush with environmental disaster. In 2010 an explosion on a British Petroleum (BP) oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers and set off a domino effect that caused oil and natural gas to leak into the Gulf for nearly three months.

The Gulf is still recovering from the calamity which the EPA has called the largest marine drilling-related oil spill in history. As of 2018 researchers were still detecting oil contamination in thousands of fish in the Gulf of Mexico according to one study.

“You couldn't walk on the beach” Mobile resident Madelyn King said. “There were tarballs washing up all the time.”

The BP spill hobbled leisure tourism in the region. Visitor spending in Louisiana dropped by $247 million in 2010 according to a report prepared for the state’s tourism agency by Tourism Economics a consulting firm that analyzes global travel data.

Callaway who was leading Mobile Baykeeper at the time (she left Baykeeper for a job as Mobile’s chief resilience officer in May) said southern Alabama dodged a bullet.

“The power of the Mobile River and the delta pushing water out of the bay made sure we didn't have much oil come into the bay” Callaway said. “If something happens with the coal ash pit there’s no natural protection. There’s nothing God can do to protect us from that.”

If the Barry pond were breached the volume of slurry could eclipse the amount of oil that spilled into the Gulf during the BP disaster.

“They would be dealing with that for God-knows-how-many years“ Keith Johnston an attorney for the SELC said. “It would be devastating for the city of Mobile and the bay. A lot of people rely on that bay for their livelihood.”

When an environmental disaster strikes Black and Brown communities often suffer the worst consequences Aboulhosn the Sierra Club deputy director said.

“Across the board communities that are people of color that don't have the socioeconomic levels of some predominantly White communities are the ones that are shouldering this burden” she said.

Joe Womack who grew up in Mobile runs an environmental advocacy organization in the city’s Africatown neighborhood a historic Black community that is choked by highways and industrial facilities. He said he worries Africatown where residents still talk about the ash from a nearby paper mill that would rain down on the community years ago would continue to bear the brunt of industrial pollution and its consequences.

For “folks that are at the bottom end of the totem pole” Womack said “(it’s) just like anything else: You see things happen to you more in a negative sense.”

“The thing with Barry” he said is “just more of the same.”

In his remarks to CNN last week EPA administrator Regan — the first Black man and second person of color to hold the position — called environmental justice and equity “a pillar” for the administration.

“What we’re saying is ‘We see you we hear you and we’re responding’” Regan said. “Too often whether it’s the coal ash pond or a chemical refinery or a landfill our communities are disproportionately impacted by exposure to pollution.”

The SELC and Mobile Baykeeper have called on Alabama Power to change tack and excavate the pond. The organizations argue the utility’s plan will allow groundwater contamination to continue and that the potential for a disaster will remain if the coal ash is not removed.

Bonnikson declined to say whether the utility has studied how far coal ash might travel if its dam was breached but told CNN in an email that the company’s “structural stability analysis and regular inspections demonstrate the dikes are safe and secure and continue to function as designed.”

In 2010 engineers — hired by the EPA to conduct Barry’s dam safety assessment as part of the national review launched following the Kingston spill — determined that Barry’s dam was in “satisfactory” condition but had a “significant” hazard potential because a failure could cause major damage to the environment wildlife and habitat if coal ash were released into the river.

Alabama Power has modeled potential flooding in the area with the help of third-party experts but Bonnikson declined to provide CNN with the data used to run the model. In an email he wrote that the experts’ models for “extreme river and tropical flood events (showed) no overtopping of the ash pond’s existing dike wall” and that “Even a 500-year tropical flood with an additional 5 feet of storm surge showed no impact on Plant Barry or its ash pond.”

“Since 1965 15 different tropical storms and hurricanes have passed within 50 miles of the plant site with no impact to plant operations or the ash pond” Bonnikson wrote.

Storm path data from 1980 to 2020 shows that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico aren’t necessarily becoming more frequent and an analysis of synthetic aperture radar data which can be used to track how water saturates land showed no notable flooding near Barry after heavy rainfall. A predictive analysis of flood gauge data at Barry didn’t suggest large deviations from the norm in the coming years.

There is some evidence that more storms are reaching a higher intensity although there’s some indication that the frequency of storms may be going down Michael Bell an atmospheric science professor at Colorado State University said. In 2020 for example researchers at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and NOAA looked at nearly 40 years of data and found the probability of storms reaching major hurricane status — Category 3 or higher — increased decade after decade.

Sean Powers a marine scientist and professor at the University of South Alabama said changing weather patterns are his biggest concern about the Barry ash pond.

“Everything now is based on our understanding of the risk that exists now” Powers said.

“Obviously sea level will rise” he said. “Storms will increase at least in intensity if not frequency and all of those pose serious risk for the release of that material.”

While environmentalists keep an eye out for the next Ida some scientists say a less visible and more insidious crisis is already underway.

“Eventually (a disaster) is going to happen” geologist Mark Hutson whom the SELC hired to review Alabama Power’s closure plan for the Barry pond last year said. “In the meantime there will be decades of slow release of metals into the swampy areas.”

In his report for the SELC Hutson concluded that to effectively close any coal ash storage site the waste must be permanently isolated from water including groundwater and that the Barry pond’s location — on a meandering river system’s floodplain — was an unsuitable place to permanently store waste.

“No (new) waste disposal facility” he determined “would be permitted in this physical location.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vYW1hem9uLzIwMjEvYW1hem9uLWNoYXJ0ZXJzLXByaXZhdGUtY2FyZ28tdmVzc2Vscy1ncmVhdGVyLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1jb250cm9sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Charters Vessels for Supply Chain Control,"Amazon has been looking to control more of the supply chain journey for years by making its own containers chartering private cargo ships and more — moves which are now giving the eCommerce giant a leg up in the chaos of the 2021 supply chain world CNBC reported.

Amazon is able to skip over the most congested ports via the private cargo vessels according to the report.

The company has been spending a lot of money to attain its goals including over $61 billion on shipping in 2020. That has aided it in now shipping out 72% of its own packages an increase from 47% in 2019 per data from SJ Consulting Group cited in the report.

In addition Amazon is taking control of making shipping containers which are in short supply and suffering from massive price bloat the report stated. The price is around $20000 up from $2000 before the pandemic.

Lauren Beagen Squall Strategies founder and maritime lawyer said in the report Amazon is “essentially guaranteeing that equipment is going to be available for them.”

In addition Amazon is taking another route for some higher-margin goods by leasing planes to get cargo straight from China to the U.S. with one of them able to carry 220000 pounds of cargo according to the report.

The outlook isn’t all rosy for the eCommerce giant though. Amazon has still seen a 14% rise in items out of stock. And prices have increased by 25% on average per data from CommerceIQ cited in the report.

Amazon isn’t alone in trying to avoid the chaos of the supply chains as other big companies like Walmart Costco Home Depot Ikea and Target have also been chartering their own ships to get goods unloaded faster the report stated.

Supply chain woes have led to more items than usual being out of stock during the holiday season.

Having used AWS services since 2015 the company engaged the AWS team and evaluated how Amazon AppStream 2.0 could help S&P Global Market Intelligence launch a SaaS model of its WSO software. S&P Global Market Intelligence was attracted to the evergreen model and self-managed scaling of Amazon AppStream 2.0. In 2017 it began to explore the solution using a proof of concept. “We wanted to see whether a streaming application like Amazon AppStream 2.0 would work well to serve content to our users” says Burgess. “We found that this server model was both cost effective and scalable for the business.” Once S&P Global Market Intelligence proved that it would be able to run WSO on Amazon AppStream 2.0 it began migrating from terminal server farms to a managed service model on AWS.

S&P Global Market Intelligence's WSO suite provides tools that help investment managers in the credit markets perform key functions such as compliance monitoring reporting and trade settlement. WSO Software includes customer positions trades and portfolios and provides multi asset-class credit portfolio administration solutions for investment managers. Customers can install WSO Software locally or outsource the deployment to S&P Global Market Intelligence. “We previously used terminal server farms for our outsourced model” says Thomas Burgess head of cloud solutions for WSO. “Multiple users were logged on to a single server which caused performance issues when we were operating at peak volume.” This approach also made it difficult for S&P Global Market Intelligence to deploy consistent updates and for customers to take advantage of new WSO features.

Using Amazon AppStream 2.0 S&P Global Market Intelligence scaled WSO’s infrastructure without procuring or managing hardware unlocking key benefits for its customers and business alike. By using Amazon AppStream 2.0 S&P Global Market Intelligence has reduced the time it takes to onboard customers to WSO from months to just hours. Because the company no longer needs to procure hardware to support onboarding it also reduced operating costs.

The WSO team can deploy a high volume of new application releases within a short period using Amazon AppStream 2.0 decreasing time per release from 40 hours to just 3 hours. This solution has also improved WSO’s upgrade process. “Using Amazon AppStream 2.0 we can now perform upgrades in near real time during business hours with zero downtime” says Michael Bland head of cloud engineering for WSO. “When customers are ready to use our new features they simply log out of WSO log back in and receive updates. This solution hugely improves our release process and helps us perform upgrades with no interruptions to our business or our customers.” By implementing Amazon AppStream 2.0 the WSO team has reduced its upgrade cycle from 18 months to 3 months accelerating its speed to market. By November 2021 it had completed 600 releases during that year alone.

S&P Global Market Intelligence's WSO is able to scale applications and desktops quickly using Amazon AppStream 2.0 to support any number of users around the globe. As a result the company can facilitate customers’ access to critical applications from any location including remote areas. “Having the ability to remotely access WSO through a streaming browser has been very powerful for our customers” says Burgess. “And due to our ability to release code patches and new applications quickly all our customers can access the latest functionality and regulatory updates.”

The WSO team has used Amazon AppStream 2.0 to federate end user access using single sign-on to provide applications access to its WSO users. The company gave customers Active Directory credentials that it managed on their behalf separate from their corporate directories. It then used native functionality on Amazon AppStream 2.0 to facilitate secure communications between the system and the customer’s Active Directory identity provider. “We built a pipeline that passes federated Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 messages to the customer’s identity provider” says Burgess. “We consume those messages for user authentication. This process removes the burden of us managing Active Directory users and helps our customers self-manage any onboarding processes they may have within their organizations.”

KAUFMAN COUNTY Texas — The Christmas shopping rush is on and online orders from places like Amazon are booming. That means the pressure is on delivery drivers crisscrossing our neighborhoods.

But the rush to have packages delivered so quickly has a human cost says the family of 30-year-old Johnathon Hearn of Mesquite.

“My brother's life is just now a cross on the side of the road that people pass” said Aliesha Harman.

At 1:45 a.m. on July 12 someone called 911 to report a man was walking down Interstate 20 in Terrell. Another caller reported hitting what they thought was a deer. It was Hearn.

The story of how he ended up there begins 15 hours earlier.

Shift starts

The morning of June 11 Hearn clocked in at an Amazon facility in Forney and left with a truck full of packages to deliver. Like most Amazon drivers he didn’t actually work for Amazon. His employer was a third-party delivery company called Triumph Logistics.

“From the moment that my brother got on the road that day there were red flags” Harman said.

Just after noon Hearn was pulled over in Van Texas for reckless driving. It was the first of several times he would be pulled over that day. Hearn had gone days without his PTSD medicine and was having a mental episode. Since he appeared sober he was sent on his way.

911 called

At 1:15 p.m. Hearn was still in Van where he drove his Amazon truck through a customer’s yard eventually getting stuck in the woods behind her house. The homeowner called 911.

A state trooper arrives to give Hearn a field sobriety test.

“Well your sentences are coherent. You're not stumbling. I don't smell anything” the trooper is heard saying to Hearn on body-worn camera footage. “Do you have any medical episodes where you black out do you have PTSD or something?” Hearn responds: “I do have PTSD but it's never been an issue.”

Still concerned about Hearn’s safety the trooper follows him as he drives away. Dashboard camera footage captures the van swerving. The trooper pulls Hearn over and issues him a warning for failing to drive in a single lane. He refers his license to the state’s mental health advisory board for review writing that Hearn is suffering from “PTSD and possible lack of medications.”

The trooper calls Hearn’s supervisors at Triumph Logistics to tell them that Hearn is unsafe to drive and asks that someone come pick him up. They arrive and take Hearn and his van back to the Amazon facility in Forney. They don’t send Hearn home. Instead records show they sign him in under another driver’s name. Hearn is then put back on the road to continue his route delivering packages across North and East Texas.

'They didn't care'

“I can't believe that anybody would even do that” Harman said. “They didn't care.”

Hearn’s unusual behavior continues. He fails to deliver most of his packages. Instead photos provided to WFAA show he opens some of them and fills them with trash.

WFAA obtained screenshots of internal communications with Hearn and his supervisors from that day. They show Hearn to be incomprehensible in his text messages. His supervisors reply with laughing emojis. To each other the supervisors write: “This is bizarre behavior” and “I'm wondering if the cop was right.”

At 8:25 p.m. Hearn returns to the Amazon facility. He leaves work in his personal vehicle. He drives for hours until his truck runs out of gas on Interstate 20 in Terrell. When he tries to run across the highway to a gas station he’s struck and killed.

“We were best friends” his sister said. “I miss every single thing about him every single day.”

Shelby Cocking is a former dispatcher for Triumph Logistics.

“That to me is extreme negligence that they didn't get him off the road and get him help” she said.

Cocking said Amazon’s delivery service partners known as “DSPs” like Triumph often manipulate Amazon’s system by checking in drivers who are unfit to drive under other drivers' names. The DSPs do it she said to keep their drivers on the road longer than Amazon allows increasing the number of packages delivered and increasing the amount of money the DSP gets paid.

“I've been seeing it happen more and more” Cocking told WFAA.

A former Triumph Logistics employee who asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation agreed.

“The reason why I want to speak out is because I myself was placed in a position to drive when I shouldn't have” the former employee said. “I only had one eye that was operating and they still put me behind the wheel.”

Keeping drivers on the road when they shouldn’t be is a risk to the public Cocking said. “A driver that's out on the road when they should not be could kill somebody easy” she said. “We have kids running back and forth across the street or you know playing in their neighborhoods and these guys are delivering to neighborhoods.”

John Trapani IV is the owner of Trophy Club-based Triumph Logistics and was Hearn’s boss. He declined to answer our questions.

Amazon's statement

WFAA contacted Amazon and a spokesperson issued a written statement:

“Our thoughts are with Mr. Hearn’s family and friends while they mourn the loss of their loved one. We are working with our Delivery Service Partner Triumph Logistics to fully investigate the allegations and will take any appropriate action once that’s complete.”

“We hold our DSPs to high standards and it’s important for us to continue working with partners who raise the bar for safety create a positive work experience for drivers and others they work with and deliver for Amazon customers.”

With consumer demand for home delivery increasing delivery companies are under increasing pressure to get packages delivered quickly.

In a recent Fort Worth lawsuit involving a wage dispute with another contractor Tenet Concepts an Amazon driver told a judge: “You can't take bathroom breaks while you're on the road"" to a customer’s house. “If you take a break you delay the orders we get fired.""

A national labor union group Strategic Organizing Center recently released a report analyzing government safety data from 2017 and 2020 and found that drivers delivering for Amazon were injured on the job at higher rates than those working for competitor UPS.

""If the bosses had done the right thing and taken him off the road and not put him back out there's no telling there could have been a different outcome … than having to visit a cross on the side of the road” Aliesha Harman said."

Alexei Oreskovic/Insider

Companies that spend millions of dollars on air travel are given incredible perks from airlines.

One such perk is top-tier frequent flyer status that comes with free upgrades lounge access and chauffeurs.

Amazon and Microsoft even have dedicated check-in counters at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

Loyalty has its perks especially when loyalty means spending hundreds of millions of dollars on airline tickets every year.

Business travel is a leading revenue source for airlines and the top corporate spenders are frequently given extra benefits in exchange for their continued business. Some of the perks go way beyond what even the most frequent individual traveler could ever hope to receive.

Tech companies are among the top spenders on airline travel given as Big Tech giants have offices and facilities around the world. China for example is a top destination for Silicon Valley-based firms like Apple.

United Airlines in 2018 revealed that Apple was buying 50 business class seats every day on flights to Shanghai China. Apple's business with United at the time was worth more than $150 million in revenue.

Airlines however lost a big chunk of that revenue during the pandemic as international borders started to close in January 2020. Cost-minded leisure travelers tend not to spend as much as business flyers and are less likely to pay for premium cabin travel or costly last-minute fares when vacationing.

When big business does return to the skies these are the perks that will likely await them.

Expedited access to elite status

Employees that travel enough will often earn elite status with an airline that gives them extra privileges when flying.

""The basic idea is you get to bypass a lot of the hassles"" Brett Snyder founder of the aviation blog CrankyFlyer told Insider.

Acquiring elite status requires loyalty to a particular airline to the tune of a few thousand dollars in purchased tickets and tens of thousands of miles flown. But airlines can also offer elite status memberships to corporate travelers as a ""sweetener"" in a contract even before the first flight Snyder said.

Most of the perks will come from having that elite status but airlines can still go above and beyond for top corporate clients.

Dedicated check-in lanes

For some companies spending millions of dollars on travel means never having to wait in line at certain airports. At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for example Delta Air Lines has dedicated check-in desks for Amazon and Microsoft employees.

While check-in counters are becoming obsolete given improvements to self-serve kiosks and airline mobile applications employees can use them to quickly check their bags or have airline staff assist with any flight issues.







The scheme isn't replicated at every Delta airport for Microsoft and Amazon employees but they will still likely have access to priority check-in areas. Business travelers often earn elite status on the airlines they frequent and can often use priority check-in lanes as a result especially when traveling in a premium cabin as Insider found when testing out the lowest tier of Delta's elite status.

Some US airlines have private check-in areas altogether for elite status holders and premium cabin travelers away from the main check-in desks such as Delta's Sky Priority check-in area at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Access to invite-only programs

While elite status is a common perk of frequent business travel the highest echelons of those programs are reserved for an airline's top spenders. Attaining membership in the unlisted programs is the dream of any frequent traveler and top corporate clients may be given an allotment of memberships for their top travelers.

American Airlines has ConciergeKey United Airlines has Global Services and Delta Air Lines has 360°.

""These are highly coveted programs there's a mystery to them"" Henry Harteveldt a travel analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group told Insider.

Even if a member of these programs purchases the cheapest economy ticket on a given flight they will still reap the benefits of complimentary lounge access priority check-in lanes early boarding and a host of other secretive amenities that airlines won't discuss publicly.

Airlines have different requirements for who is invited into their programs and limits on the number of memberships they can distribute each year according to Harteveldt. Companies seeking to get memberships for their flyers would have to spend a significant amount on yearly air travel with spend requirements varying from city to city.

""Delta 360° is an annual invitation-only program for our top SkyMiles Members offering an exclusive suite of benefits and services even beyond Diamond Medallion Status"" Delta writes on its website. ""An invitation into Delta 360° is based on your overall investment with Delta. If you're selected to join we'll contact you directly.""

A certain number of memberships are then given to corporate travel managers to distribute to employees Harteveldt explained with airlines being incredibly mindful of how many are allocated.

Airline lounges are exclusive hideaways that offer private and comfortable seating when waiting for a flight as well as complimentary snacks beverages and food items. Corporate customers flying internationally in business class will often have access to these lounges included in their tickets.

Airlines will also give complimentary lounge memberships to their most frequent flyers. On American for example executive platinum status holders can choose to receive an Admirals Club membership as one of their free perks.

ConciergeKey Global Services and Delta 360° members also receive complimentary lounge access for their respective airlines according to Harteveldt Upgraded Points and SFGate.

Members of the ConciergeKey Global Services and Delta 360° programs need not worry about running from one flight to another when passing through an airline hub with a tight connection. Rather they'll be escorted down to the ramp and driven to their next flight in a luxury vehicle.

American will chauffeur passengers in a luxury General Motors vehicle while United transfers its passengers in a Mercedes-Benz and Delta in a Porsche according to Upgraded Points. [not sure this blog is reputable enough to cite on its own] Cadillac was formerly American's vehicle manufacturer of choice for airside transfers until the switch was made to GM the airline confirmed to View from the Wing. [caddy is owned by GM — so need different wording here]

It's a ""surprise and delight"" perk Snyder said that isn't guaranteed for everyone with a short layover. Airlines may also be more accommodating to passengers on delayed flights by holding their connections Harteveldt said depending on the customer and corporate client.

Priority Boarding

Elite status holders are often among the first passengers to board a flight whether they're seated in a premium cabin or not. ConciergeKey members for example can board ahead of first class customers and active duty military members even if they've booked a basic economy ticket according to American's boarding priority list.

Early boarding gives flyers first pick at overhead bin space and more time to get settled before the rest of the plane boards.

Better opportunities for first class upgrades

Complimentary upgrades to first class are among the most valuable perks for an elite status holder. A single upgrade can be worth more than the price of a ticket and instantly elevate a travel experience especially on longer flights.

In many frequent flyer programs any elite status holder can request an upgrade and they'll accommodate if there is a seat available. But oftentimes there ends up being people that don't make the cut because there aren't enough seats available for all elite status holders.

Corporate travelers however have a better shot at upgrades because airlines consider a variety of factors when determining who to upgrade. The level of elite status and how much a traveler's company spends with the airline in a given year are also taken into consideration.

""Generally if you have all things being equal the person who works for a large corporate account that may have a major business relationship with an airline would likely get the nod for the upgrade ahead of the person who is an individual traveler"" Harteveldt said.

An airline also might give a certain number of upgrade coupons to a corporate client that can be used to get a premium cabin seat Harteveldt added.

Drink coupons and free snacks

Not all of what corporate clients get are grand gestures however and sometimes a free drink can make the difference. Coupons for a complimentary alcoholic beverage are sometimes included in a corporate contract according to Harteveldt and offered on certain fares geared towards business travelers.

Airlines like Delta and American also offer complimentary alcoholic beverages in their extra legroom sections which companies may be willing to purchase for their employees. Southwest Airlines' ""Business Select"" fare also comes with a free drink coupon.

Some US airlines aren't currently offering alcohol in regular economy sections until the pandemic subsides but the perk will likely return.

Some airlines also might offer complimentary meals or snacks to corporate flyers even if they're sitting in economy on domestic flights. American offers Executive Platinum status holders a complimentary snack and an alcoholic drink in economy Snyder said.

Dedicated reservation lines

Airline hold times have markedly increased as airlines sought to shed their staff during the pandemic. Travelers can find themselves waiting on hold for hours.

Elite status holders however have special phone numbers to use when calling the reservations desk with shorter hold times and corporate travelers with elite status can also use them. Some companies were so important to airlines however that special phone lines were created just for their employees.

""In the past some airlines would create basically special toll-free numbers for their largest corporate accounts where the employees would call in and get a dedicated sub-group of agents within a reservations office so that they were served faster"" Harteveldt said.

Harteveldt noted that the perk likely doesn't exist anymore and those phone lines have been merged into the dedicated lines for top frequent flyers. ""If you put somebody into the higher tiers of a frequent flyer program they're going to get expedited service anyway"" he said.

Travel agents however including those with corporate accounts still have lines to many airline reservation desks Snyder said. ""It's for the travel planners the people that are doing the work"" he said.

Free or discounted extra legroom seats

Not all companies pay to fly their employees in a premium cabin on every flight but airlines can help make the economy experience more enjoyable by offering favorable rates on extra legroom seats according to Harteveldt. Delta's ""Comfort+"" seats for example offer extra legroom as well as complimentary alcohol and premium snacks.

Some airlines also offer complimentary upgrades into extra legroom sections for their elite status holders.

Airlines also block certain regular economy seats that don't offer extra legroom but have a more preferable location in the cabin. Snyder says that corporate clients may be given advance access to those seats ahead of the public.

Waived checked bag fees

A basic perk of earning elite status is getting a complimentary checked baggage allowance which can save travelers and their companies money when a trip requires checked baggage. Companies may also be able to negotiate lower fees for checked baggage Harteveldt said.

More flexibility for corporate travelers

Many US airlines have abandoned change fees for domestic flights but tickets can still be restrictive. The nature of corporate travel however requires additional leeway that airlines are willing to give to high-spending clients.

""You get much more flexibility as a corporate [client]"" Snyder said noting that some airlines have a system for clients where points can be redeemed for perks. Common perks include things like name changes on tickets flight changes and converting non-refundable tickets into refundable tickets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvY29kZXNoYXJlLXdpdGgtaW5kaWdvLXRvLWJlLWltcGxlbWVudGVkLWJ5LW1hcmNoLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLTEyMTEyMDUwMDExN18xLmh0bWzSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbXBhbmllcy9jb2Rlc2hhcmUtd2l0aC1pbmRpZ28tdG8tYmUtaW1wbGVtZW50ZWQtYnktbWFyY2gtYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtMTIxMTIwNTAwMTE3XzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Codeshare with IndiGo to be implemented by March: American Airlines,"American Airlines is in the process of getting requisite approvals from the US government for its codeshare agreement with IndiGo airlines and the partnership is likely to implemented by March 2022 a senior official of the Texas-based carrier has stated.

American Airlines and IndiGo had in September announced that they have entered into a codeshare agreement which allows the former to sell seats -- on its distribution system -- of the Indian carrier's flights operating on 29 routes.

The Texas-based carrier resumed its New York-Delhi flight on November 12 after a gap of 10 years.

American Airlines' Managing Director (Sales) Tom Lattig has told PTI in an interview that the carrier's Seattle-Bengaluru flight would start flying from March 25 instead of January 4 as was announced before.

""We have not seen much corporate travel recovery yet. We know that route (Seattle-Bengaluru) in particular will depend heavily on corporate traffic and we have made the decision to push the date"" he mentioned.

The airline has more than 2000 agreements in place in the US with various companies he noted.

""Any of our big technology firms in North America on the west coast in particular which is where we expect to get traffic from for our Seattle-Bengaluru flight we already have those corporate agreements in place"" he mentioned.

American Airlines would be going to those companies and adding special pricing for them on its new service to India Lattig added.

Gulf carriers such as Qatar Airways and Emirates carry a significant share of traffic on the India-US routes and the India-Europe routes through their one-stop flights.

When asked how he sees the competition posed by the Gulf carriers on the India-US routes Lattig replied: ""We certainly expect to be able to take traffic on our non-stop services. To the extent the pie is going to grow -- it is going to be a bigger market -- we will certainly be able to take traffic and build traffic there.""



""I do expect we would be able to take traffic from airline that carry passengers via third countries (one-stop flights). Certainly that will be the target for us"" Lattig added.

He said there is a lot of pent up demand for travel between India and North America.

""We see that (pent up demand) in our forward bookings. We want to fly more and more flights"" he added.

When asked if the Indian government should resume scheduled international flight services Lattig said ""It's really up to the government to decide when they are going to open and how many flights they are going to allow.""



""We certainly hope to move towards open skies"" he added.

American Airlines is in the process of the getting the requisite approvals from the US government regarding their codeshare partnership with IndiGo he said.

""Once we get all the approvals we will move into the implementation phase and we expect that to be in the first quarter of 2022"" he said.

It is going to be really a great partnership for us because it is going to help us connect passengers from North America to everywhere in India and the Indian passenger to anywhere in the US he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYTMyMXhsci1qZXRzbWFydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How The Airbus A321XLR Could Change JetSMART,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYTMyMXhsci1qZXRzbWFydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmRpYS9kaWQtbm90LXZpb2xhdGUtdGVzdGluZy1ub3Jtcy1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1zYXlzLWluLXJlc3BvbnNlLXRvLWRlbGhpLWdvdnQtbm90aWNlL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg4MDk0ODQxLmNtc9IBnAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmRpYS9kaWQtbm90LXZpb2xhdGUtdGVzdGluZy1ub3Jtcy1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1zYXlzLWluLXJlc3BvbnNlLXRvLWRlbGhpLWdvdnQtbm90aWNlL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84ODA5NDg0MS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did not violate testing norms American Airlines says in response to Delhi Govt notice,"NEW DELHI: American Airlines (AA) has responded to Delhi government's show-cause notice on alleged violation of 2% testing of passengers arriving from 'not-at-risk' countries by saying that it “believes (its) flight was in compliance with the latest guidelines"".Following emergence of the Omicron variant India has ordered that all arrivals from 'at-risk' countries and 2% randomly selected passengers from 'non-at-risk' countries that includes US Canada and UAE among others will be tested on landing here.The Delhi government had issued a notice to AA on Friday on the grounds that its crew of a New York-Delhi flight did not randomly identify the required 2% passengers for on-arrival testing at IGIA.Passengers randomly selected “shall be escorted by the concerned airlines/aviation ministry to the testing area on arrival.

Updated on June 29 2022

The national average for a gallon of gas for Americans has risen to $4.86 $0.80 cents higher than it was in March.

As Americans return to work and plan summer vacations they are faced with rising gas prices. (Not to mention higher costs for electricity home heating and groceries!!)

The price at the pump and for home expenses began to rise before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. At the end of 2021 President Joe Biden announced the U.S. Department of Energy will release 50 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

Energy experts told PBS interviewers that tapping the SPR won’t drive down gas prices. The decision was little more than “a drop in the ocean” when it comes to energy policy one person said.

The decision also won’t counteract Biden administration policies that have caused rising energy costs — and that will continue to drive prices higher in the future.

Here are 25 decisions the president has made over the last year that have affected gas prices home heating costs and other energy-related burdens U.S. families and businesses face.

#1 and 2: Adopting new EPA oil and gas rules

In November 2021 the Environmental Protection Agency announced new regulations governing methane emissions from oil and gas production transmission storage and distribution that would cost more than $1 billion a year.

Last spring Biden signed a resolution that overturned Trump administration reforms to EPA oil and gas rules. This resolution will worsen energy poverty reestablish burdensome regulations and have a disproportionate impact on small businesses.

#3 #4 #5 #6 #7 and #8: Restricting or impeding energy projects

One of Biden’s first actions after taking office was to halt new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters the Biden administration has delayed decisions on these leases — a move that results in higher energy costs for the most vulnerable consumers.

The administration canceled the Keystone XL pipeline and suspended oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and New Mexico (despite opposition from the Navajo Nation). It also resurrected the “Waters of the United States” rule which would increase barriers to energy projects.

The White House is pursuing new standards for particulate matter and ozone likely tightening them to unachievable levels for much of the country and creating new barriers for energy project permits.

The president also has rescinded Endangered Species Act reforms a move that will increase red tape and allow litigation to slow down energy projects.

#9: Rejoining the Paris agreement

In April 2021 without the consent of Congress Biden rejoined the Paris agreement which will result in onerous new regulations that could raise energy costs.

#10: Appointing unaccountable energy regulators

The president has created several bodies within the White House charged with creating new policies to regulate energy. The people who run these councils are unelected and do not need Senate confirmation but they have been given broad powers to come up with new executive actions — which do not need consent from Congress — to regulate U.S. energy production.

#11: Forcing states to restrict driving

One section of the recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act supported by the White House would require every U.S. state to develop state carbon-reduction plans that must be approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation as well as be updated every four years.

These plans are aimed at reducing driving all over the country — even for people in rural areas where public transportation is limited and driving is the only option.

#12 #13 and #14: Raising the prices of cars and trucks

The Biden administration has failed to take adequate action on annual requirements and small refinery waivers for the Renewable Fuel Standard and in providing regulatory relief from this biofuel mandate due to economic hardship. His EPA has finalized a new rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. That single regulation could raise the average vehicle price by $1000.

#15: Instituting a new policy on carbon taxes in organized wholesale electricity markets

This carbon pricing policy statement issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in April 2021 is a blanket endorsement of top-down policies that have been demonstrated to be costly ineffective regressive and consistently rejected by the American people.

#16: Raising the prices of common household necessities

The EPA has issued a final rule to phase out a common inexpensive refrigerant. This policy is a de facto tax on air conditioning and refrigeration.

#17: Stifling energy innovation

In May 2021 Biden issued a sweeping executive order that mobilized federal agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce mandates on businesses insurers retirement funds and suppliers. These policies will stifle innovation critical to improving the environment and will increase costs for a wide variety of businesses.

#18: Altering regulatory cost analyses

The Biden administration has changed key inputs for economic and regulatory analysis including raising the “social cost” of greenhouse gases. These policies will mask the true consumer cost of regulatory actions.

#19 and #20: Imposing new costs on power generation

The administration attempted to resurrect an aggressive version of the Clean Power Plan for power sector mandates called the Clean Electricity Standard.

In the Fall 2021 Unified Agenda the EPA stated their intention to propose what can be considered the Clean Power Plan 2.0. This policy would impose burdensome regulations but would have little or no environmental benefit.

The EPA also has mandated that even facilities with reduced emissions must remain on the list of “major” sources subjecting these facilities to permitting burdens and higher costs.

#21: Impeding Americans exports

The administration is considering potential restrictions on the export of crude oil that would increase not decrease energy prices.

#22 and #23: Raising taxes

More than one-quarter of the administration-backed Build Back Better agenda is pulled directly from the “Green New Deal.” The Build Back Better agenda includes new taxes on natural gas and home heating. It also includes new taxes on petroleum and manufacturing.

#24: Picking energy winners and losers

The Build Back Better agenda would spend taxpayer dollars to push utilities to adopt more costly politically preferred forms of energy a move that would reduce Americans’ energy choices.

#25: Fueling the fire for future regulation

Finally through the Civilian Climate Corps Build Back Better would fund the salaries of tens of thousands of anti-energy activists who would perpetuate high energy costs by demanding new and costly federal regulations and legislation.

Unlike releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve these 25 steps are not just a “drop in the ocean.”

They have made and will continue to make a significant impact on Americans’ ability to afford the energy products that fuel their lives and livelihoods.

The coronavirus pandemic has crippled economies shut down travel and claimed hundreds of thousands of lives transforming the world in ways that would have been unthinkable a year ago. The Biden administration’s first days were inevitably dominated by discussion of how his team would tackle the crisis as the U.S. death toll continued its inexorable climb to a staggering milestone: 500000 deaths.

Here’s a look at the key figures on President Biden’s Covid-19 response team and some of their plans to try to stop the spread of the virus and regain some semblance of normalcy.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci

Chief medical adviser.

The longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Fauci said he accepted the president’s offer to be his chief medical adviser “right on the spot.” Considered the nation’s leading infectious disease expert he has been an adviser to every president since Ronald Reagan and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George W. Bush for his work fighting H.I.V./AIDS. But he became a household name only after the start of the pandemic when he emerged as a trusted authority in countless news briefings interviews and public appearances.

Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky

Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Dr. Walensky previously chief of the division of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School replaced Dr. Robert R. Redfield. She has also focused on H.I.V./AIDS in her career and has served as chair of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council at the National Institutes of Health and as an adviser to the World Health Organization. Dr. Walensky has pledged to restore public trust in the agency and to provide accurate information “even when the news is bleak or when the information may not be what those in the administration want to hear.”

Xavier Becerra

Nominee for secretary of health and human services.

Mr. Becerra was appointed as attorney general of California in 2017 when his predecessor Kamala Harris joined the Senate and he was elected to a full term in 2018. He became known as a lead attacker in the Trump resistance filing roughly 100 lawsuits against the administration on issues including climate change gun control and health care. Notably he led 20 states and the District of Columbia in a campaign to protect the Affordable Care Act. Before serving as attorney general he spent 24 years in Congress representing a Los Angeles district. If confirmed he would be the first Latino to run the mammoth department which has a budget of more than $1 trillion. He pledged at a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday to find “common cause” with his critics and is scheduled to appear on Wednesday before the Senate Finance Committee.

Dr. Vivek H. Murthy

Nominee for surgeon general.

Dr. Murthy served as surgeon general under President Barack Obama — he was one of the youngest ever — and is Mr. Biden’s nominee for the same position. He is a physician who has taught at Harvard Medical School and served as vice admiral of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. Dr. Murthy has been outspoken about linking public health and wellness. His book “Together: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World” was published last year. His confirmation hearing is scheduled to begin Thursday.

Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith

Chair of the Covid-19 Health Equity Task Force.

A physician and public health specialist at Yale University Dr. Nunez-Smith is leading a team of 12 experts advising the president on how to address the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on vulnerable communities. Dr. Nunez-Smith grew up in the U.S. Virgin Islands and came from a family of health care providers. She has spoken in interviews about how seeing her father suffer a debilitating stroke in his 40s caused by untreated high blood pressure spurred her to work in public health.

Jeffrey D. Zients

Coordinator of the administration’s Covid-19 response.

Mr. Zients an entrepreneur and consultant joined the Obama White House in 2009 and became known as a Mr. Fix-It with strong operational skills. He was tapped to untangle the messy rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s online insurance marketplace in 2013. After Mr. Obama left office Mr. Zients joined the private equity fund Cranemere as chief executive and also served on Facebook’s board.

Andy Slavitt

Senior White House pandemic adviser.

Mr. Slavitt a former health care company executive served as the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2015 to 2017. (His company was also involved in fixing the A.C.A. website before that.) Mr. Slavitt was outspoken in his defense of the Affordable Care Act during the Trump administration — and raised the alarm about the pandemic early in 2020. He’s active on Twitter writes on Medium and until recently hosted a podcast about Covid. He has said that he accepted the White House job “on a short-term basis.”

Dr. David Kessler

Chief science officer for the Covid-19 response.

Dr. Kessler a pediatrician and lawyer who was head of the Food and Drug Administration during the presidencies of George Bush and Bill Clinton will oversee the vaccine program. He will share responsibilities with Gen. Gustave F. Perna who was the chief operating officer for Operation Warp Speed the Trump administration’s program to accelerate vaccines and treatments. (The Biden administration later dropped that name.) As F.D.A. commissioner Dr. Kessler was known for battling the tobacco industry and developing nutrition fact labels on food products. Dr. Kessler is close to Dr. Fauci; the two worked together to speed the development and approval of drugs that changed the course of the AIDS epidemic in the 1990s.

Dr. Janet Woodcock

Stanley McChrystal titled “Risk: A User’s Guide.”

McChrystal was removed from his command by President Barack Obama but afterward created a thriving consulting firm and often appears on TV to talk about war and politics. His new book is intended to be a primer for corporate leaders trying to navigate the perils of doing business in America. The conceit is straightforward: Hello I am a retired four-star general who bravely led troops into battle and I can tell you everything you need to know about managing risk.

There is a lot that McChrystal might teach us because he was responsible for a series of consequential errors from which valuable lessons could be learned. Those errors include the concoction of a plan in 2009 to defeat the Taliban insurgency by flooding Afghanistan with as many as 80000 additional U.S. soldiers. This was the kind of troops-and-money strategy that succeeded mainly in killing lots of civilians and helping the Taliban return to power.

On a less catastrophic scale McChrystal actively participated in the cover-up of the friendly fire killing of NFL player-turned-soldier Pat Tillman whose 2004 death the Pentagon initially blamed on the Taliban knowing that this was untrue. McChrystal also took the ill-advised risk of allowing a Rolling Stone reporter to embed with his entourage on a trip around Europe and the resulting article which conveyed the general’s disdain for America’s elected leaders led to his early retirement in 2010.

I am not arguing that McChrystal should abstain from writing about risk or suggesting that he didn’t have wartime successes. A book that intelligently drew from both sides of his military career could be useful. But that is not the book McChrystal chose to write and for that we should be grateful because he has instead provided us with a far more important document. “Risk” is stuffed with so many displays of dishonesty ignorance and banality that it’s the ultimate self-own for a generation of generals who led America into disaster after 9/11 — and profited from it.

With his new book McChrystal turns himself into an accidental whistleblower.

Fighting the Truth

There is a basic question to ask before buying a general’s advice book: Why are we listening to this guy?

America treats its generals as revered proxies for its ordinary soldiers loving them even though the wars they’ve presided over have been catastrophic. There has been more than $14 trillion in defense spending since 9/11 more than 7000 U.S. soldiers dead in Iraq and Afghanistan and at least several hundred thousand civilians killed (which is a conservative estimate). Throughout these calamities the generals lied about what was happening telling Congress and the American public that things were going well when they knew it wasn’t true. The breathtaking scale of their deceit was revealed in classified documents that the Washington Post published in an award-winning 2019 series titled “At War With the Truth.”

Their failures have occurred outside the battlefield too.

One of the most venerated generals of recent times is James Mattis who commanded U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and went on to become President Donald Trump’s first defense secretary. Before joining the Trump administration Mattis was on the board of directors of Theranos to provide advice on “building elite teams.” He received an annual stipend of $150000 and continued to defend Theranos even after the Wall Street Journal revealed in 2015 that the company’s blood-testing machines were fraudulent. Testifying in September at the trial of the company’s founder Elizabeth Holmes Mattis avidly threw her under the bus saying that he was “disappointed at the level of transparency from Ms. Holmes.”

A different type of flameout happened to retired Gen. David Petraeus another famous commander of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan who served as Obama’s director of the CIA. Petraeus didn’t last long at Langley because he was having an affair with his biographer and shared classified information with her. The tradecraft he employed to covertly communicate with her was amateurish: They used the drafts folder in a shared Gmail account. And while in Afghanistan his military aides were excluded from helicopter trips so that his secret girlfriend could ride along. Petraeus resigned from the CIA and pleaded guilty to mishandling classified information but he’s still respected and has a lucrative partnership at KKR a private equity firm.

One more item from the annals of generals gone bad:

There’s retired Gen. Michael Flynn who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency and briefly served as Trump’s national security adviser until it was realized that he had deceived Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with a Russian diplomat. After pleading guilty to lying to the FBI Flynn became a star of the QAnon conspiracy crowd and called for America to have one religion (no prizes for guessing which one). His leap into the world of the unhinged is not unique. Retired Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc who served 10 tours in Afghanistan and led Special Operations Command Africa is a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire and has described the state’s governor also a Republican as a “Chinese communist sympathizer.”

You get the point. Putting aside the conspiracy theories corporate frauds and the sharing of classified documents with persons not authorized to receive them (your girlfriend) there is little evidence that the experience gained by generals translates into business acumen. In fact there is evidence that companies with military officers on their boards have worse outcomes than their competitors. It’s hard to imagine two cultures more different. In the military a general can order the court-martial of a subordinate for disobeying orders. In the corporate world Elon Musk is powerful but he can’t send lazy workers to prison. The skills used to organize a sales team for another round of cold calls are not what you need to lead Delta Force operators into mortal combat. And lest we forget the U.S. military has a culture of sexual assault and harassment that has resisted decades of reform efforts.

Gladwell for Dummies

McChrystal appears to have the distinction of making more money from his military service than any U.S. general of his generation.

According to a recent investigation by the Washington Post McChrystal has served as a board member or adviser to at least 10 companies since leaving the military. He was paid more than $1 million for serving on the board of just one firm Navistar International which also paid $50 million to the government to settle accusations that it fraudulently overcharged the Marine Corps for armored vehicles. McChrystal also drew $70000 for a single speech at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and $50000 for an engagement at California Polytechnic State University. Both are public institutions not known to be awash with funds.

The engine of McChrystal’s business endeavors is his eponymous McChrystal Group which has more than 50 employees and provides consulting services to corporate and government clients. While “Risk” is written in the first person McChrystal has a co-author Anna Butrico who is an associate at his firm. References to the firm are scattered throughout the book and its acknowledgments section gives credit to about a dozen employees who provided ideas and assistance. The book is prominently featured on the website of McChrystal Group.

The handful of pages about Afghanistan skate past colossal failures in which McChrystal was deeply complicit.

The book is dishonest because it ignores or distorts the risks undertaken by McChrystal that failed. This includes the Tillman episode but most crucially the disastrous war strategies in Afghanistan and Iraq. While there are boastful passages about military missions in Iraq that are portrayed as successful — special forces would “identify and engage enemy fighters with stunning speed” McChrystal claims — the abundant errors made there are basically unmentioned. More to the point the handful of pages about Afghanistan skate past colossal failures in which McChrystal was deeply complicit. Violent raids by forces under his command are described only as creating “extraordinary political controversy” because they were “antithetical to the Afghan culture.” Nowhere does McChrystal admit the actual reason for the controversy: U.S. and Afghan forces killed an unconscionable number of civilians and in some instances the violence constituted war crimes.

Much of the book is not lies just utter banality. It is a torrent of platitudes like this: “Fear of change is only natural — adaptability requires the ability willingness and I’d argue courage to dare to become something different.” Or this assemblage of clichés: “Knowing that transformation is inevitable we can ensure that we’re asking the right questions of ourselves and our teams to calibrate to our new reality in order to be successful in an increasingly digitized world.” And this insight: “Against the greatest threats winning is most often the product of teamwork.”

The book moves from one bromide to another with eighth grade-level graphics and one of its key messages is perplexing from a grammatical perspective: that “the greatest risk to us — is us.” It evokes famous events or personalities to make points that are manifestly self-evident with references to the Alamo Google Apollo 13 Aunt Jemima Martin Luther King Jr. Joseph Goebbels Blockbuster Enron Lehman Brothers “The Wizard of Oz” the Bay of Pigs Greta Thunberg Napster Gettysburg the Maginot Line Coco Chanel Hurricane Katrina and the Fosbury Flop among others. One can imagine McChrystal’s agent pitching the germ of this book as “Malcolm Gladwell for Dummies.”

Manufacturing Fame

It’s harmless you might think. What could be so terrible about a retired general making a few bucks with potted wisdom from West Point and the Sunni Triangle? We can even enjoy a cynical laugh if we wish watching a grift come to life as corporate executives make bulk purchases of “Risk” and do calisthenics at dawn with Navy SEALs hired by McChrystal Group. The gullible marks get what they deserve which is nothing. But I can’t steer my thoughts away from the sacrifices of the soldiers and civilians I met while covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think few of them are pleased or amused by the ease with which fortune and fame are showered on generals who got so many people killed and maimed. Many would regard it as an injustice.

The villain in this story isn’t really McChrystal or his book. He’s doing what Americans are encouraged to do: Swim toward available commercial opportunities and make as much money as you can without breaking the law. Maybe he doesn’t need all that extra cash — generals can receive more than $250000 in annual retirement pay after all — but how many people would turn down the partnerships and board seats that are offered to former generals?

The deeper problem I think is the adulation that McChrystal and other military leaders get from media organizations. They manufacture the fame that is so misplaced. Here for instance is a partial list of the outlets that gave fawning coverage to the rollout of “Risk”: Axios CNN PBS the Washington Post Time magazine Forbes MSNBC NPR CBS News Yahoo Finance and Foreign Policy. It seems that there was just one news outlet in the U.S. that published a critical take: The National Review with an article by military veteran Bing West that was scathingly headlined “A General Who Failed in War Assesses Risk.”"

Statement credits are typically received within a few days however it may take 90 days after an eligible prepaid hotel booking is charged to the Card Account. American Express relies on the merchant’s processing of transactions to determine the transaction date. The transaction date may differ from the date you made the purchase if for example there is a delay in the merchant submitting the transaction to us or if the merchant uses another date as the transaction date. This means that in some cases your purchase may not earn the statement credit benefit for the benefit period in which you made the purchase. For example if an eligible purchase is made on December 31st but the merchant processes the transaction such that it is identified to us as occurring on January 1st then the statement credit available in the next calendar year will be applied. Statement credits may not be received or may be reversed if the booking is cancelled or modified. If the Card Account is canceled or past due it may not qualify to receive a statement credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible you will not receive the statement credits. For example your transaction will not be eligible if it is a booking: (i) made with a property not included in the Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection programs (ii) not made through American Express Travel or (iii) not made with an eligible Card. Participating properties and their availability are subject to change. If American Express in its sole discretion determines that you have engaged in or intend to engage in any manner of abuse misuse or gaming in connection with this benefit American Express will not have an obligation to provide and may reverse any statement credits provided to you. If a charge for an eligible purchase is included in a Pay Over Time balance on your Card Account the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time balance. Instead the statement credit may be applied to your Pay In Full balance.

View the current offers here.

It was 4:52 a.m. on Nov. 4 2021 when I received two unexpected emails about my Platinum Card® from American Express. Unfortunately I didn't see the automated messages until around eight hours later when I took a lunch break from writing. That's when I discovered that a thief had cashed in 117648 of my American Express Membership Rewards points for $1000 worth of Apple gift cards.

Later when I called American Express I learned that around 35000 more of my points had been stolen as well. Those points had gone toward a Saks Fifth Avenue gift card.

I'm not sure what hurt my feelings more the theft or the fact that the thief got such a poor redemption value with my hard-earned points. (I joke. The theft was most troubling of course. But TPG does currently value American Express Membership Rewards points at 2 cents each.)

Why I was concerned

I'm pretty sure that anyone in my position would have been concerned. No one likes to have their card account hacked or find out that their points have been stolen.

But in my case there were three specific reasons why I was worried about the 150000 stolen Membership Rewards points.

First I didn't know how easy it would be to recover the stolen Membership Rewards points. As a credit expert I know that the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) protects me from unauthorized charges on my credit card account. But rewards points don't necessarily receive the same federal protection when theft is involved.

Second I've been banking points for a big family trip to Hawaii next summer. My goal is to treat my family of five plus the grandparents to a memorable vacation. So when I saw that such a large number of my Membership Rewards points were gone I had a sinking feeling in my stomach. In this dream trip scenario of mine every point counts.

Finally I recognize the value of my rewards points. You should treat the points you earn with your rewards cards with the same consideration as cash. Basically they're just another form of currency. I put a lot of effort into earning those rewards and I use them to lower my annual travel budget. This helps me save and invest extra dollars that I would have otherwise spent on travel.

How I recovered my stolen Amex Membership Rewards points

Luckily I did recover my stolen Membership Rewards points in the end.

In fact I was able to resolve my problem with a single phone call – and I didn't even have to wait on hold. The American Express Global Fraud Protection Services team made an unpleasant situation much less stressful.

Here's the step-by-step process I went through to recover my stolen points and re-secure my account within minutes.

Calling American Express

During the fraud incident one of the thieves' steps was to change my online account username and password information. This move locked me out of my account. So when I tried to log in later not only was I unable to access my account I couldn't reset the password or username without a phone call to American Express.

When I realized I couldn't log into my account I took my Amex Platinum Card out of my wallet and called the customer service number on the back. (I make a point never to call phone numbers found in emails just in case the email is fraudulent.)

Amex apparently already suspected fraud had occurred on my account and my call was instantly routed to the fraud department. If it hadn't been I would have requested a transfer.

Username and password update

To reset my information the Amex representative first verified my identity. I had to answer several questions to confirm that I was the legitimate cardholder such as providing my card number and four-digit security code.

From there the representative sent me a one-time password to access my account. When I could log in again I set up a new permanent password of my own choosing.

Cancellation of my Platinum Card from American Express

Next the Amex fraud protection team member canceled my existing card. I hadn't had any fraudulent charges on my account yet but the hacker had access to my information. So the thought was better to be safe than sorry.

With the cancellation my Platinum Card was also removed from Apple Pay on my iPhone iPad and Apple Watch. (Yes I'm clearly an Apple fan.)

On a more convenient note any service providers who had my card on file for recurring payments would still be able to process charges on the old account number. I was grateful to learn that I wouldn't have to reset the payment information on several auto drafts including the Audible membership that I set up as part of my monthly Amex digital entertainment statement credit. (I assume when the expiration date on my original account is up I'll need to update my card information for those sites.)

Issuing a new Amex Platinum Card

Due to the cancellation of my original Platinum Card account number I needed a new card to use for future purchases. Here's another area where the Amex team's stellar customer service shined through.

The representative sent me a new Platinum card via overnight express mail. My replacement card showed up on my front porch by lunchtime the next day.

The return of my Membership Rewards points

Finally it was time to address the issue that I was most worried about with the Amex representative — my missing points. Would he be able to quickly refund the stolen points to my account or was I in for a lengthy recovery process?

It turns out the process wasn't difficult at all. I was grateful because recovering stolen rewards isn't always so painless.

After politely confirming that I hadn't redeemed any Membership Rewards points the fraud protection representative requested a refund of my stolen points while we were on the phone. While he told me it might take some time to process (up to a few days if I recall correctly) Amex again exceeded my expectations. The missing points were back in my account in less than an hour.

How I'm protecting myself moving forward

I'm not sure what made my account vulnerable to theft in the first place. There are many ways that criminals can steal your personal information and use it to their benefit.

For example I've received more than one notification in the past informing me that my information had been compromised in a data breach. A recent data breach even compromised the data of frequent flyers with at least 11 different airlines including United and American Airlines.

What I do know is that it's important to take steps to avoid this type of fraud whenever possible. Here are a few precautions I took after this experience to make sure my rewards cards and other accounts are as secure as possible.

First I changed my email password. There's a chance the thief who hacked my Amex account gained access via my email address. While I'll never know if that's what happened I changed my email address password to be safe. It's a good idea to change all of your account passwords from time to time anyway in the interest of security.

Second I checked my three credit reports. When a thief steals your personal information especially if your Social Security number has been compromised there's a chance they can use it to apply for fraudulent accounts in your name. So I reviewed my credit reports with Equifax TransUnion and Experian to look for any red flags for identity theft.

Finally I froze my credit reports. In my case I verified that my three credit reports were still frozen. I personally opt to freeze my credit reports at all times only ""thawing"" them temporarily when I want to apply for a new credit card or another form of financing. By freezing my reports it takes them out of circulation. With a freeze in place new creditors cannot check my credit without my knowledge which keeps anyone from approving fraudulent applications in my name.

It's impossible to keep your credit card rewards or even your credit cards themselves 100% safe from fraudsters. Still you can follow some of the good habits above to reduce your exposure to theft.

Bottom line

If you're unlucky like I was and one day find yourself a victim of fraud the best thing you can do is react without delay. Reach out to your card issuer right away to let them know there's a problem. Your notification puts your credit card company in the position to stop additional damage and hopefully start working to rectify the situation for you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi9rZWhpbmRlLXdpbGV5LW9uLW5mdHMtYXJ0LWJhc2VsLWFuZC1oaXMtbmV3LWFtZXgtY2FyZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kehinde Wiley on NFTs Art Basel and His New Amex Card,"Photo: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for American Express

It’s tough to know where to begin when you’ve got only a few minutes with someone like Kehinde Wiley the legendary artist best known for his 2018 portrait of Barack Obama. We’re sequestered in the corner of a very dark and very loud bar at the Miami Beach Edition a packed and expensive hotel situated on the beach next to the Faena. Art Basel is always a bit of madness but this year it’s taken on a kind of fever pitch with a mess of art parties and fashion parties and NFT “activations” running from the crack of dawn until four in the morning.

Wiley has taken a quick break from the chaos for interviews and in spite of looking a bit worn out humors me with an apparent interest in my questions. He has a full fruity laugh and an expansive presence made even more vibrant with a bright-red-patterned suit he “picked up in Senegal.” Known for his naturalistic paintings of Black subjects in dense botanical settings or against majestic backdrops characteristic of old masters he’s at Basel with American Express for whom he’s designed a new version of the company’s exclusive Platinum Card. He spoke to the Cut about his collaboration early influences and his thoughts on the NFT of it all.

How has your time at Art Basel been?

Well I spent the morning looking at art so that was better. I don’t know — there are competing types of influences that get me going. Some of the work I love might be a bit surprising.

What’s a surprising influence?

I’ve been deeply influenced by the conceptual work of Bas Jan Ader. He spent most of his time in California before dying tragically in his 20s while trying to cross the Atlantic in a boat for a project he called In Search of the Miraculous. Many years later I created something based on that. I think he pulled more from the California side than the Dutch … Yeah I think he came to the States and lost his shit.

Ever seen a piece of art that stopped you in your tracks?

Very early on there was the Kerry James Marshall painting in the barbershop and the other is The Blue Boy. I would say The Blue Boy was the one — it’s like this society portrait of this kid who’s not quite an adult but not quite a child and he’s been painted as this kind of future aristocrat. The clothes are over-the-top the landscape is over-the-top. And it’s kind of a coming into power that someone from his social class is expected to perform. But I wasn’t thinking about that all those years ago. I was just thinking that it was really well-painted technically.

The Blue Boy is a work that’s doing something not unlike what you do but back then ideas around representation and social commentary weren’t in your head at all?

They weren’t — I didn’t know anything about the history about the social impact about the fact that so much of that art was part of some pretty dark forces in our world. But I was also in love with that art. I was in love with the ability of artists to take some colored paint and a hairy stick and to coax something into being.

But it still must have been a complicated journey to realize as you were reimagining these old masters and other western works have a lot of nasty implications.

There is a lot there yes. So much of what I try to do is travel the world and find complete strangers at random and pull their histories into these paintings and using that as a part of the background that they’re depicted in. I think that’s the point — that it’s not someone who’s famous or powerful it’s just someone that’s minding their own business trying to get to the train or to work and here’s this random guy asking them to pose in a painting and next thing you know they’re in a museum somewhere. There’s a kind of magic to that that I think adds meaning to the work so it’s more than just a pretty picture.

That’s basically what you did for your upcoming exhibition at the National Gallery right?

Well I found models and took them to the fjords of Norway. I had this idea in mind — just from looking at paintings — but none of us knew what we were doing; we just jumped on a plane and made it happen. I think part of it comes from looking at paintings in the naturalist school — looking at Caspar David Friedrich’s work looking at the ways in which mountains are seen as at once closer to God and also kind of highly sexualized in a way that kind of reinstates patriarchy and a sense of domination. And I thought it would be interesting to cross-wire that with a collection of people who are exploring this landscape with a sense of mystery a sense of play. People who are embraced by the landscape and alienated by it as well.

You’ve been working on this but also have this partnership with American Express. I can imagine you get thousands of invitations for corporate partnerships; I’m wondering why you chose to work with this company?

My inbox is full of a lot of stuff that doesn’t make sense. But their relationship with the Studio Museum of Harlem their desire to create engagement with artists of color with the institution that literally made my career that’s something that I can be proud of. That said there’s something highly aspirational about museums about blinged-out gold picture frames … And the language that I use this aspirational language is part of the way that Amex sits in popular culture. It’s a little bit of a trickster move for me.

Can you tell me about your card design?

Well it’s coming from actual paintings but sort of deconstructing parts of it. I wanted something that felt like you could almost live with it but that you might get the feeling that it’s creeping up on you. And I also wanted to allow each person to sort of react to it in their own way so that it’s less like Oh that’s a Kehinde Wiley painting and more like You know that reminds me of something but I can’t quite put my finger on it. Kind of an intimation rather than beating you over the head.

Before I let you go I just have one more question. Everything at Basel this year seems to be about NFTs and the metaverse. What the hell is an NFT and what do you think about them?

I’m staying away from all of that. I can’t quite wrap my mind around some of the ownership and copyright issues around them and what are you actually buying and whether there’s going to be some sort of correction later on. But it is incredibly heartening to see so many people get excited about something that seems to be just invented. I mean it seems to be this big conceptual art practice that just got invented out of nowhere. I’m sure years from now somewhere in an American studies program they’ll be talking about how the whole world became some sort of Warholian project.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vbXVzaWMvbXVzaWMtbmV3cy9saXp6by10eXJvbmUtY292ZXItZXJ5a2FoLWJhZHUtY2hyaXMtZXZhbnMtZHJha2UtMTI2NzA4MS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Lizzo Cover Erykah Badu's 'Tyrone' With Shout Outs to Chris Evans and Drake,"Lizzo took the stage in Miami Saturday for a private performance for Art Basel and the singer surprised fans in attendance with a decidedly more personal cover of Erykah Badu’s “Tyrone.”

Originally released in 1997 on Badu’s Live album Lizzo’s cover came toward the end of her 70-minute set which was part of American Express’ “UNSTAGED” concert series for Amex card members.

While Badu originally sang that she “better call Tyrone” Lizzo switched up the lyrics to “Maybe I should call Chris Evans” playing off a popular fan campaign for the singer to date the actor. “Maybe Captain America could put another bun up in my oven” Lizzo continued jokingly referencing rumors that the singer started herself over the summer that she was pregnant with the actor’s baby.

Evans wasn’t the only celeb target in Lizzo’s “Tyrone” re-working: “Or maybe I should call Drake?” she sang next before launching into a raunchy ad-lib about what exactly she would ask the rapper to do.

Lizzo has covered “Tyrone” before most recently at her September “comeback” concert in her home state of Minnesota. The Miami show on Saturday marked only the second time Lizzo has performed a full show since the pandemic began and the singer repeatedly expressed her excitement to be back on stage. “This has been one of the craziest years I’ve ever witnessed and to be present in my body right now and to be able to do this for you right now is a blessing and I’m so grateful” she said before launching into a cover of Chaka Khan’s “I’m Every Woman.”

The setlist also included some of the singer’s most popular hits like “Good As Hell” “Truth Hurts” and “Cuz I Love You” along with fan favorites like “Boys” and “Water Me.” Lizzo opened the show with her Cardi B collab “Rumors” and while Cardi was in Miami to promote her new vodka-infused whip cream “Whipshots” and for a party celebrating Playboy’s new lifestyle brand BIGBUNNY the rapper’s part was pre-recorded.

Lizzo’s performance was the last American Express UNSTAGED event of the year and while only 500 card members were invited to the exclusive Art Basel event the performance was also streamed live for fans across the country on the streaming site LIVENow. Fans can sign up for a streaming pass on LIVENow to rewatch Lizzo’s Miami concert on-demand here.

Editor’s picks

A host of other celebs were in town for this year’s Miami edition of Art Basel: as mentioned Cardi B pulled double duty over the weekend hosting a Playboy party at the resort-styled restaurant Casa Tua before throwing a launch event for “Whipshots” with a party held at The Goodtime Hotel (where guests like Offset Mary J. Blige and Timbaland swung by to show their support). The LA-based hospitality company The h.Wood Group meantime held court at Pharrell’s restaurant Swan Miami on Thursday night before taking over Sushi Fly Chicken a takeout joint-slash-secret-bar hybrid for a “Friday Night Disco” party with Sunny Vodka and GUESS Originals.

Lenny Kravitz played a private performance that reportedly brought out both Leonardo DiCaprio and the real-life “Wolf of Wall Street” Jordan Belfort; and Gucci’s party brought out a gamut of guests from Brooke Shields to Lauryn Hill and Rohan Marley’s daughter Selah Marley as they celebrated the release of Mickalene Thomas’ new Monograph published by Phaidon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9tb25leS8xNjkzNjc1NS9zaG9wLWxvY2FsbHktMjUtcG91bmRzL9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9tb25leS8xNjkzNjc1NS9zaG9wLWxvY2FsbHktMjUtcG91bmRzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shop locally this Christmas and you could bag £25 of goodies for free...,"SHOP SMALL SAVE BIG Shop locally this Christmas and you could bag £25 of goodies for free

The Sun backs spending at small stores as it boosts high streets the lifeblood of our communities. Thousands of small shops shut permanently due to Covid lockdowns.

And many shoppers are now quitting small town centres for big cities and malls this Christmas in a bid to recapture the metropolitan experience lost in lockdown.

Footfall in cities and malls will be up three times more than in smaller towns in the run-up to the big day.

Figures from employment charity Springboard show a rise of 140 per cent on last year for city centres versus 47 per cent for smaller towns.

A Springboard spokesman said: “Consumers will seek out the Christmas shopping experience they missed last year in city centres.”

Now tens of thousands of small shops are in financial trouble.

Julie Palmer partner at insolvency experts Begbies Traynor said: “Inflation energy costs and labour availability are risk factors for many businesses.”

The Federation of Small Businesses added: “Our small high street businesses need all the help they can get so giving shoppers incentives to visit them helps.”

Didi Chuxing a $39 billion company that is China’s answer to Uber said on Friday that it would delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange. Just six months ago Didi was a Wall Street darling raising billions of dollars from American pension funds and international investors in a splashy New York initial public offering.

Those sorts of deals once fueled a three-decade relationship that helped reshape the global political and financial landscape. China generated heaps of money for Wall Street by hiring banks to manage deals like I.P.O.s. In return Wall Street gave China access to the halls of global finance and political power especially when it came to introductions in Washington.

Didi’s abrupt decision to leave brings home a stark truth for Wall Street: China doesn’t need it anymore. The world’s No. 2 economy has plenty of its own money and few problems attracting more from elsewhere. China’s friends on Wall Street have lost their sway in Washington at a time when mistrust of Beijing’s intentions is running high. And China’s leaders would rather keep tight control of its companies than open them up to investors on American markets.

Now Wall Street has become the latest area in which leaders on both sides are trying to weaken the extensive and complicated ties between the world’s two largest economies. And just as the alliance of China and Wall Street helped shape business in the past the way the two sides disentangle those ties could reshape its future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9ob3ctbGF0aW4tYW1lcmljYW4tZmVtaW5pc3RzLXNoaWZ0ZWQtZ2xvYmFsLXVuZGVyc3RhbmRpbmctb2YtZ2VuZGVyLWJhc2VkLXZpb2xlbmNlLTE3MzEyMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Latin American feminists shifted global understanding of gender-based violence,"The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is an annual campaign that begins on Nov. 25 the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.

This date was chosen to commemorate the Mirabal sisters — Patria Minerva and María Teresa — who were assassinated on Nov. 5 1960 for their political activism in the Dominican Republic against the decades-long dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo.

Feminist movements in Latin America have a long history and have led to important shifts to understanding gender-based violence at the national regional and international levels.

Beginnings of the global movement

In the 1970s women’s groups were concerned with the role of the state as a perpetrator of violence against women in contexts of political repression. Women in Argentina (Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo) Mexico (Comité Eureka) and El Salvador (CoMadres) to name some examples used public spaces to voice their suffering and demand justice in the face of state-sponsored violence.

In 1975 the first UN World Conference on Women held in Mexico City in addition to the establishment of the UN Decade of Women (1976–1985) made regional and national feminist organizing visible.

During the 1980s Latin American and Caribbean feminist activists and groups organized regular meetings or encuentros to exchange experiences perspectives and mobilization strategies. During their first encuentro in Bogotá Colombia Nov. 25 was declared as a Day To End Violence Against Women.

By the end of the 1990s most Latin American states had passed legislation addressing domestic violence. However their implementation has been limited.

Gender and economic inequality

Following economic changes due to neoliberal policies mobilization for economic justice became part of organizing for gender equality. For example Mexican women have been organizing for decades against deadly violence tied to precarious working conditions for women on the United States and Mexican border.

Between 1993 and 2014 1500 women were murdered in Ciudad Juaréz. Most of them were young women between the ages of 15 and 25 from low socio-economic backgrounds working for maquiladoras – foreign-owned companies — under precarious conditions.

In 2009 several civil society groups organized the march “Éxodo por la vida de las mujeres” (Exodus for women’s lives) from Mexico City to Ciudad Juaréz. Among the organizations were Women in Black whose slogan was Ni Una Más (Not One More). They were dressed in black to mourn the hundreds of missing and murdered women across the country and wore pink hats to emphasize the youthful ages of the murdered women in Ciudad Juaréz.

At the same as the march was taking place the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (COIDH) publicized its ruling on the case based on the murders of three young women in Ciudad Juaréz — Claudia Ivette Gonzalez Esmeralda Herrera Monreal and Laura Berenice Ramos Monárrez.

The court’s decision was significant because it found that the state had violated these women’s human rights through negligence and victim-blaming. Additionally this ruling recognized the state’s role in reproducing gender inequality and held it legally responsible for the prevention of feminicide the killing of cis- or trans-women because of their gender.

By 2015 17 Latin American countries had passed legislation recognizing femicide including the political and judicial structures that enable it.

Online organizing

In 2015 Argentinian journalists used the hashtag #NiUnaMenos (Not One Less) on Twitter to organize a march demanding that the state comply with its administrative and legal obligations of preventing femicide and to ensure the access to justice for victims.

Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter helped organizers share their message broadly and expand existing social networks. However assemblies were still used for discussion and decision-making. As a result the street demonstrations which drew hundreds of thousands of women to the streets position gender and sexual violence as a public issue.

The use of the hashtag and demonstrations quickly spread transnationally and protests were organized in other Latin American countries including Chile Mexico and Peru.

On Nov. 25 2019 hundreds of Chilean women gathered in Santiago to dance a synchronized choreography led by Las Tesis denouncing gender violence. The song “Un Violador en tu camino” (The rapist is you) shifted the blame away from women who experienced sexual violence to agents of the state including police judges and the president. The song quickly spread and performances were organized across the world from Latin America to Europe and the Middle East.

In Toronto members of various Latin American groups put out a call that year to begin practising the choreography and organize a performance outside city hall. Initially the call was intended as an act of solidarity with women in Latin America who had been victims of sexual violence perpetrated by police amidst anti-government protests.

At the same time governments — not only in Latin America but also in Canada — are responsible for perpetuating gender inequality through economic policies and police violence.

When my friends and I saw the call on social media to join the performance at Toronto city hall we felt moved to express our rage against the ongoing violence against women globally.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hZ2F6aW5lLzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvamFwYW5lc2UtbGF0aW5vcy11cy13YXItaG9zdGFnZXMtaGlzdG9yeS01MjM3MTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America's Forgotten Internment - POLITICO,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/05/japanese-latinos-us-war-hostages-history-523711 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hZ2F6aW5lLzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvamFwYW5lc2UtbGF0aW5vcy11cy13YXItaG9zdGFnZXMtaGlzdG9yeS01MjM3MTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlLmdvdi9OZXdzL1NwZWVjaGVzL1NwZWVjaC9BcnRpY2xlLzI4NjE5MzEvcmVtYXJrcy1ieS1zZWNyZXRhcnktb2YtZGVmZW5zZS1sbG95ZC1qLWF1c3Rpbi1paWktYXQtdGhlLXJlYWdhbi1uYXRpb25hbC1kZWZlbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remarks by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III at the Reagan National Defense Forum (,"Thank you John for that kind introduction and thanks for everything you do for the Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute. And good afternoon everybody. It is great to be here in person at the Reagan National Defense Forum.

[Applause]

And I’m glad to see so many friends and valued colleagues including a truly outstanding delegation from the Department of Defense. This is indeed quite a crowd.

And I’m honored to be here at the Reagan Library. The old saying is that institutions are shadows of people and this library is a tremendous extension of the legacy and optimism of President Ronald Reagan.

He always believed that Americans were up for a challenge—up for meeting hard problems with a can-do spirit.

He had bedrock beliefs: a love of democracy a zeal for free enterprise and an implacable opposition to autocracy.

Yet President Reagan also showed a willingness to change. And to work together even with an old foe to try to make all our children safe from the specter of nuclear war.

That’s central to his legacy—not just the vigor that he showed in waging the Cold War but the vision that he showed in helping to end it.

In today’s changing world I hope that we can again summon Ronald Reagan’s sunny conviction that this country can be stronger prouder and better.

His confidence in the power of liberty.

His enthusiasm in the face of challenge.

And his openness to seize an opportunity for statesmanship.

Now if you’re looking for some of that spirit today… if you’re looking for optimism and pragmatism and patriotism… and if you’re looking for a can-do attitude in American life—well look no further than the United States military.

Our outstanding men and women in uniform volunteer to work hard and to sacrifice mightily. And they don’t expect any rewards besides the quiet satisfaction of a mission achieved and the fellowship of teamwork and the honor of defending our democracy.

So we’re enormously grateful to them and to their families as well.

And in return we owe them clear thinking about the challenges of our changing world. And we owe it to them to make the world of the 21st century far more secure and far less bloody than the world of the 20th.

You know I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about that over the past few days. And my team and I took the long way to California—by way of South Korea where we held our important annual security talks with key allies.

This was my third trip as Secretary of Defense to the Indo-Pacific. And that’s yet another sign of the priority that we give to the region and our commitment to its security and prosperity and openness.

In part that’s because of something that everyone who lives in California understands: America is a Pacific power. And we will always be.

And the Indo-Pacific is a region of great opportunity—and real challenges. One of those challenges is the emergence of an increasingly assertive and autocratic China. And that’s what I’d like to focus on today.

Now President Biden has said that we are in “stiff competition” with the People’s Republic of China. And as he’s made clear Beijing is the only competitor [quote] “capable of combining its economic diplomatic military and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system.”

So we’ve got to be clear about the challenge of China and about what we need to do to meet it.

I’d like to focus today on the security dimensions of this competition. Because we’ve seen two decades of breakneck modernization by the People’s Liberation Army.

And China’s military is on pace to become a peer competitor to the United States in Asia—and eventually around the world. China’s leaders are expanding their ability to project force and to establish a global network of military bases.

Meanwhile the PLA is rapidly improving many of its capabilities including strike air missile-defense and anti-submarine measures. And it’s increasingly focused on integrating its information cyber and space operations.

So that means new areas of competition in space and cyberspace where the norms of behavior aren’t well-established and the risks of escalation and miscalculation are high.

Meanwhile China is pouring state funds into key sectors including quantum research. And Beijing is pursuing what its leaders call “indigenous innovation” to cut its reliance on imports. And all that is fueling swift advances in PRC technology with significant implications for China’s military.

China’s nuclear posture is changing as well. The PLA has been rapidly advancing its nuclear capabilities. And that includes growing its nuclear arsenal to at least a thousand warheads by 2030 and modernizing its delivery systems and building a nascent nuclear triad.

Now we always assess not just capabilities but also intentions and actions. And the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party have been increasingly vocal about their dissatisfaction with the prevailing order—and about their aim of displacing America from its global leadership role.

China’s President Xi Jinping regularly talks about [quote] “great changes unseen in the world in a century.” And he recently assured his fellow Party members that [quote] “time and momentum are on China’s side.”

President Biden has been very clear about his concerns over China’s human-rights abuses and its bullying of other countries. And Beijing is misusing technology to advance its repressive agenda at home and exporting the tools of autocracy abroad.

Now I’ve repeatedly described China as the “pacing challenge” for the Department of Defense.

But I chose the word “challenge” carefully. We seek neither confrontation nor conflict. And as President Biden has repeatedly made clear “we are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs.”

So yes we’re facing a formidable challenge. But America isn’t a country that fears competition. And we’re going to meet this one with confidence and resolve—not panic and pessimism.

As President Reagan put it “The future doesn’t belong to the faint-hearted; it belongs to the brave.”

So we’re determined to deter aggression and to prevent conflict and to establish commonsense guardrails. And our new initiatives are part of a government-wide approach that draws on all tools of national power to meet the China challenge.

Now this Department has been stepping up its efforts on China since the very first days of the Biden Administration. Our China Task Force sharpened the Department’s priorities and charted a path to greater focus and coordination. We made the Department’s largest-ever budget request for research development testing and evaluation. And we’re investing in new capabilities that will make us more lethal from greater distances and more capable of operating stealthy and unmanned platforms and more resilient under the seas and in space and in cyberspace.

We’re also pursuing a more distributed force posture in the Indo-Pacific—one that will help us bolster deterrence and counter coercion and operate forward with our trusted allies and partners.

And we’re developing new concepts of operations that will bring the American way of war into the 21st century working closely with our unparalleled global network of partners and allies.

Ladies and gentlemen we will always stand ready to prevail in conflict—but America’s defense will always be rooted in our resolve to prevent conflict.

Now what I call “integrated deterrence” will be the cornerstone concept of the new National Defense Strategy that I will release early next year. And it means integrating our efforts across domains and across the spectrum of conflict to ensure that the U.S. military—in close cooperation with the rest of the U.S. government and our allies and partners—makes the folly and costs of aggression very clear.

I’d like to focus today on two key elements of integrated deterrence and those are partnership and innovation.

First we’re building on a lesson that I learned over four decades in uniform: In war and in peace we’re always stronger when we work together with our friends.

And that defines our approach to the China challenge. No we’re not seeking an Asian version of NATO or trying to build an anti-China coalition. And we’re not asking countries to choose between the United States and China.

Instead we’re working to advance an international system that is free and stable and open. And we’re strengthening our peerless network of allies and partners with a shared commitment to a peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific—a region where all countries are free from coercion and where the rules that buttress stability and expand liberty are upheld. Together.

As one Western leader said in 1989 “We know more clearly than ever before that we carry common burdens face common problems and must respond with common action.”

No that wasn’t Ronald Reagan.

It was Margaret Thatcher.

Now my first trip as Secretary took me to Japan South Korea and India. A few months ago I had the opportunity to visit with leaders in Singapore Vietnam and the Philippines. Yesterday I was in Seoul. And early next year I’m planning on heading back to Southeast Asia.

And in every conversation with our partners I hear the same thing again and again: a call for the United States to continue playing our stabilizing role in the Indo-Pacific.

And make no mistake: we will.

That means joint exercises such as the recent six-country multicarrier operation in Asia. It means deepening our R&D relationships with our regional allies and partners. It means encouraging the helpful and growing security role that our European allies are playing in the region.

It also means strengthening the Indo-Pacific’s security architecture. That of course centers on our valued alliances and ASEAN—but it’s reinforced by a range of mechanisms both old and new including the Indo-Pacific Quad and AUKUS and the Five Eyes and the triangle of the U.S. Japan and South Korea.

Finally we remain steadfast to our one-China policy and our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act to support Taiwan’s ability to defend itself while also maintaining our capacity to resist any resort to force that would jeopardize the security of the people of Taiwan.

Now we are working to bolster deterrence and not seeking to change the status quo.

As President Biden told President Xi last month we share a profound global responsibility: “to ensure that the competition between our countries does not veer into conflict whether intended or unintended.” And we’re going to stick to what President Biden called “simple straightforward competition.”

Yes we have real differences both over interests and values. But the way that you manage them counts.

And we’re going to be open and candid with China’s leaders. As President Biden put it we need to talk “honestly and directly to one another about our priorities and our intentions.”

And big powers should be models of transparency and communication. So we’re actively seeking open lines of communication with China’s defense leaders—especially in a crisis. And both between our diplomats and our militaries we’re taking steps to reduce risk and to prevent miscalculations.

So we’re going to build on President Biden’s discussions with President Xi and President Biden’s push to develop ways to manage strategic risk and work to build strong sensible guardrails around this competition.

Now I also want to focus on a second element of integrated deterrence. And it’s one that I’m especially looking forward to discussing with this audience—an audience with so many industry leaders and entrepreneurs and members of Congress.

And it centers on America’s unique competitive advantage in innovation.

Now integrated deterrence requires us to weave together cutting-edge technology operational concepts and state-of-the-art capabilities to seamlessly dissuade aggression in any form domain or theater.

And so that means that innovation lies at the heart of American security.

Now huge advances in AI and edge computing and nanotechnology are already underway in America—much of that right here in California. Nobody innovates better than the United States of America. But we can’t take that for granted.

And at the Department of Defense that means that serious changes to some of the ways that we’ve done business must be done.

So let’s face it. For far too long it’s been far too hard for innovators and entrepreneurs to work with the Department. And the barriers for entry into this effort to work with us in national security are often too steep—far too steep.

On my recent travels I’ve seen some outstanding examples of cutting-edge tech—including weeks ago in Bahrain where I saw unmanned solar-powered Navy vessels that use AI to build a shared picture of the surrounding seas.

But it often takes too long to get that kind of innovation to our warfighters. So let’s say some great California start-up develops a dazzling way to better integrate our capabilities. All too often that company is going to struggle to take its idea from inception to prototype to adoption by the Department.

We call this syndrome “the valley of death” and I know that many of you in this room are painfully familiar with it.

It’s bad enough that some companies get stuck in the “valley of death.” But some brilliant entrepreneurs and innovators don’t even want to try to cross it and work with us.

So the Department has to do better.

Let me tell you about some steps that we’re taking to transform the way that we do business.

First we’re paving new pathways for American innovators and entrepreneurs to work with us.

Consider the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency—better known as DARPA. It is legendary for scientific breakthroughs. But now DARPA is also connecting its top research teams with corporate leaders and U.S. investors so that those teams can build successful businesses with the cutting-edge technologies that they develop.

Second we’re doubling down on our Small Business Innovation Research program—which as it happens was signed into law by President Reagan. This program helps fuel American firms to pursue R&D tailored to the Department’s unique tech requirements. And so far this year we’ve awarded funds to more than 2500 small businesses working on groundbreaking tech.

We’re also doing more to integrate the Department’s innovators into tech hubs around the country where academics and business leaders and innovators thrive. So we recently opened defense innovation hubs in Seattle and Chicago adding to other sites from Austin to Boston.

The goal here is simple: to connect with new talent who will help us compete and win on challenges from countering UAVs to responsibly leading the AI revolution.

And finally we’re making it easier for companies to safely cross that “valley of death.”

And I would like to commend the congressional leaders who have tackled this issue and many of you are here today. But we need all of your help. And this is urgent. We can’t just keep funding programs and platforms that will be irrelevant. And we must streamline the acquisitions process—or we’ll tie one arm behind our backs.

So the Department of Defense has established the Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserve to let us quickly see if promising tech and prototypes can help our warfighters. It helps identify our most pressing capability gaps and makes funds available to test new technologies that could be game-changers. And it lets the Army the Navy the Air Force the Space Force and the Marine Corps try out innovative tech together at scale for the first time.

Because when we maintain our technological edge we maintain our military edge.

And let me be clear: The United States of America has an advantage that no autocracy can match—our combination of free enterprise free minds and free people.

Even in times of challenge our democracy is a powerful engine for its own renewal.

So I will put the American system up against any other. And I’ll do so with great pride and total confidence.

No other country had the creativity to put such phenomenal computing power into our pockets. And no other nation has our astonishing universities our grounding rule of law and our restless spirit.

So let me offer a call to action to American businesses large and small… and to everyone in this room including industry leaders.

Join with us. Work with us. And help keep our country strong.

Let’s meet this moment.

With all the innovation and ingenuity that America can muster.

Because America’s strength in the world rests on its strength at home.

Innovation in America is rooted in the creativity of an open society and the ingenuity of an open mind.

As President Reagan put it in 1988 “progress is not foreordained. The key is freedom—freedom of thought freedom of information freedom of communication.”

Ladies and gentlemen in America we don’t fear competition. As President Biden says “In the competition against China and other nations of the 21st century let’s show that American democracy and the American people can truly outcompete anyone.”

This is America.

We’re still a country that can do great things—from vaccinating people against a terrible virus to saving the lives of civilians in peril to building a new architecture for global security.

Great powers today must shoulder great responsibilities.

For the safety of our citizens.

For the defense of our democracy.

And for the security of our world.

So we’re going to do our part.

We’ll meet the challenges of the 21st century. But we’ll face them with fortitude not fear.

Democracy has always been our roadmap to success and security.

And I wouldn’t trade it for anyone else’s.

Thank you very much.

[Applause]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsb3NvZnRiYWxsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy83MjQ1OTY2LXVzYS11MTgtbmF0aW9uYWwtdGVhbS1zZXQtdG8tY29tcGV0ZS1pbi13YnNjLXdvbWVucy1zb2Z0YmFsbC13b3JsZC1jdXDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USA U18 National Team Set To Compete In WBSC Women's Softball World Cup,"LIMA Peru –– Following a gold medal finish at the 2021 Junior Pan American Games in Barranquilla Colombia the USA Softball U-18 Women’s National Team (WNT) has arrived in Lima Peru for the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) U-18 Women’s Softball World Cup.

UT think tank triggers

concerns about bias

As a proud alumnus of the University of Texas I am deeply concerned about recent news reports outlining the creation of an entity being called the Liberty Institute within the university.

This so-called think tank is purported to be necessary in order to educate students “on the moral ethical philosophical and historical foundations of a free society.” These are high-minded-sounding goals but when viewed in light of the political stances of the legislators and donors involved in the entity’s creation it is difficult not to question whether the impetus behind it is based upon biases that have no place in a liberal arts university.

If the true goal of a liberal arts education is to provide students with the tools to think for themselves and come to their own conclusions how can UT officials justify the allocation of funds to establish something designed to tilt those conclusions in a particular direction?

Per the law regarding treason

is the former president a traitor?

Per U.S. law regarding treason ""Whoever owing allegiance to the United States levies war against them or adheres to their enemies giving them aid and comfort … is guilty of treason."" The penalty is either death or imprisonment monetary fine and inability to hold office.

Are people who storm the Capitol to prevent the lawful transfer of power attack Capitol security forces threaten to hang the vice president and stalk members of Congress enemies of the United States?

If the president watched the ongoing assault on TV yet chose not to summon forces to quell it immediately did he effectively provide aid to these enemies?

When the president released a video telling these enemies of the United States ""We love you you're very special"" did he give comfort to them?

If the answer is yes to all three questions is the former president a traitor?

Demand that elected leaders

publicly reject partisan politics

To all Americans who are tired of partisan bickering from both sides of the political spectrum:

There are many of us Americans who have resigned from both political parties and are ideologically somewhere in the middle. We the disgusted Independents want thoughtful action from our elected officials. We want authentic leadership from real leaders not positioning from politicians who take extreme stances liberal or conservative. A start to rectify the current political morass would be for “leaders” (both sides of Congress the president) to publicly disavow partisan politics and stand up for what is good for America and our planet.

The COVID pandemic again threatens us and we had best not downplay science again. It might cost a lot more than 100000 unnecessary deaths this time around. Let’s demand that our elected leaders show that they care about the American people rather than their biased political parties.

Speaking at a reception in Lagos U.S. Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard celebrated the contributions of the private sector to the U.S.-Nigeria Commercial and Investment Dialogue (CID) in elevating the business climate for improved trade relations.

“The Nigerian and U.S. Governments use the Commercial Investment Dialogue as a framework for engagement with businesses and one another” the Ambassador said. “And while the initial round of CID talks has come to a close the principles of cooperation and dialogue remain strong between our two countries.”

Ambassador Leonard applauded the efforts of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission the Foreign Commercial Service of the U.S. Mission and the American Business Council for their concerted efforts in making the CID a reality.

“By listening to thoughtful and practical feedback from those engaged in the private sector our respective governments will continue to identify substantive and concrete areas where we can adjust policy for the benefit of businesses and the citizens who depend upon them” she added.

Participants of the CID focused on five priorities areas key to improving trade and investments ties between the United States and Nigeria: infrastructure agriculture digital economy investment and regulatory reform. Each priority area was co-chaired by Nigerian and U.S. business representatives who together led the policy discussions.

U.S. and Nigeria companies at the event included: Visa MainOne American Tower Corporation Coca-Cola Zenith Bank Kimberly-Clark Capital Alliance U.S. Soybean Council and General Electric.

The CID is a bilateral policy instrument focused on trade and investment between Nigeria and the United States. The first round of the CID commenced in 2017 with a signing of a memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and the Minister of Industry Trade and Investment at that time.

A ministerial-level meeting has held in Washington DC on February 4 2020 where the participating company representatives presented challenges opportunities and recommendations to improve the business climate.

Around four million Americans visit the UK each year with visions of sipping tea and bumping into the Queen.

When they arrive many are disappointed by what the find and aren't afraid to make their opinions known.

One thing many feel let down by are our famous landmarks and tourist attractions which often don't live up to their high expectations.

So we've decided to have a little look through the TripAdvisor reviews left by American tourists to see what our friends across the Atlantic think of our national treasures.

Big Ben - ""It's just a clock""

(Image: CC/ Peter Broster)

Big Ben completed in 1859 is without doubt one of the most famous clocks in the world. The tower is 96 metres tall and the climb from the the bottom to the top is a total of 334 steps.

But to some American's ""it's just a clock"".

As Nathan Smith Jr from Los Angeles wrote on TripAdvisor: ""Unfortunately when it comes to the UK most Americans and non-Brits think of Big Ben and Buckingham Palace.

""It's just a bell tower.""

Meanwhile more recent visitors were disappointed to find they'd travelled half-way around the world just to see some scaffolding.

For four years the tower has been covered in scaffolding and Big Ben's chimes have been silenced to allow essential restoration work to be carried out.

Trish from New York not seeing the funny side said: ""I know it will always need repairs but it is disappointing to travel from America just to see a clock surrounded by scaffolding.""

Alvie from Atlanta said: ""Big Ben is closed for maintenance for a year or so and I felt like that should be posted in the airport or something to inform us entitled Americans!""

This comment makes you wonder whether had there been a sign Alvie actually would have headed back home immediately after arriving at Heathrow.

Tower of London - ""The Beefeaters will mock and make fun of Americans""

The Tower of London contains 1000 years of history leaving many Americans in awe.

But some are left disappointed by the Crown Jewels on display.

One tourist was absolutely gutted to find out it wasn't just a collection of pretty necklaces.

Lauri from Mississippi captioned her review ""Crown Jewels not jewellery"".

She said: ""This uneducated American was thinking that jewels meant pearls and rubies Queen Victoria's diamond necklace from Albert not trays spoons and sceptres.

""I was a bit disappointed but the tour of the tower was AMAZING.""

Another problem some Americans encountered at the Tower of London were the ""rude"" Beefeaters who are known to have a bit of fun at their expense.

One tourist didn't see the funny side of this at all although he insisted he isn't thin skinned.

He said: ""Tower London was great however a Beefeater seemed pretty anti-American.

""I was afraid to speak up because I felt odd numbered but I was also embarrassed because he kept on talking and knocking the Americans and I just thought that was horrible.

""I know that he was trying to be funny and I'm not thin skin but I am proud of who I am and I'm certainly proud of my nation.""

Meanwhile Rene from Chicago clearly took offence titling her review ""They don't like Americans"".

She simply wrote: ""Be prepared: The Beefeaters will mock and make fun of Americans the entire tour.""

A spokesperson for the Historic Royal Palaces who run the Tower of London reassured MyLondon the teasing of Americans is all good-natured.

They said: ""Across the centuries the Tower of London has played host to everyone from Founding Fathers to First Ladies.

""Some like Henry Laurens - an important figure in the American Revolution imprisoned on suspicion of high treason – have received a more stern welcome than others.

""On that occasion the guards on duty teasingly played the tune of Yankee Doodle outside his cell while today this tongue-in-cheek approach to our friends across the pond lives on in the tours provided by our Yeoman Warders.’

London Eye - ""A group of Americans thought they spotted the Eiffel Tower""

(Image: Getty Images)

The London Eye or as it's now called has left many tourists disappointed over the years. A common theme of the reviews of the is that it doesn't spin fast enough.

Whether the tourists were hoping it would be a thrill ride or whether they were just bored by the end of many have shared their opinions online.

Avia from Malibu said: ""Eye thought it would be wonderful.... I was let down.

""Everyone who goes to London sees the big wheel in the sky! It is on the bank of the Thames River and is a very popular tourist attraction.

""After a very long wait you are placed inside a capsule with about 20-25 other people and you take a very slow ride once around. It takes 25-30 around with the only great view from when you actually reach the top.""

Another reviewer repeatedly called it the 'Eye of London' while another called it 'London's i'.

However it seems like a few Brits themselves found American tourists amusing.

One TripAdvisor reviewer from Bristol said the the group of Americans in his pod were convinced they'd spotted the Eiffel tower.

Tower Bridge - ""It did not change my life""

(Image: PA)

Tower Bridge is one of the most famous bridges in the world where you can climb the towers for panoramic views of London from the high-level walkways.

What could tourists possibly complain about?

Courtney from the United States said she was furious that the bridge didn't change her life.

She said: ""This bridge is cool but not worth paying to go through the Tower of London to see. It’s just a bridge and did not change my life.""

Another very blunt and quite cutting review from Ross in Atlanta said: ""Oh look its a bridge. It's striped in blue. It's famous. I can't think of any other reason to go there.""

Yonas from California said: ""Nothing special about it to be honest... Not me cup of tea lad. Next time won't waste my time on trying to pass through it.""

At the end of the day its just a bridge.

Days after Navy servicemembers began reporting a foul diesel smell in their tapwater and the local health department found petroleum in the water at a nearby school the Navy said that it had confirmed the presence of volatile petroleum products in its Red Hill potable water well.

Though the service did not conclusively connect the contamination to the tank farm the aging Red Hill facility recently leaked 14000 gallons of fuel/water mixture from a drain line at the site.

The wellwater samples were taken on November 29 and sent to a laboratory on the mainland for testing. The results of the Red Hill sample showed hydrocarbons roughly four to ten times below the Hawaii Department of Health's Environmental Action Level (EAL) the service said though it did not disclose the exact results in parts per million. The Navy conducted a separate test that confirmed vapors another indication of hydrocarbon content.

According to the test results the water quality from a different well site located several miles away remains safe for use under state and federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. The contaminated well has been shut down.

The Navy is now developing a plan to ""restore its potable water system to EPA standards"" identify how the contaminant got into the well and mitigate the problem. In the interim 93000 people who are served by the Navy's water system have been advised by the state that they should not use the tapwater.

The well was shut down on Sunday but local residents were not informed until a town hall on Thursday evening. ""It was the closest shaft to folks who reported petroleum smells sheens in their water and taste in their water so the logical source was the Red Hill shaft"" U.S. Pacific Fleet Deputy Commander Blake Converse said at the meeting.

The recent spill and the fuel in the water have renewed calls to permanently shut down the underground tank farm. Red Hill was built in the 1940s and though the Navy has a plan for renewing the aging steel linings on its 20 underground tanks it has not convinced critics that it can be made leak-proof. The site is located just 100 feet above Honolulu's freshwater aquifer.

""This is totally unacceptable. They said this would never happen"" said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI). ""This has to be treated like a nuclear reactor not a piece of old infrastructure. It needs better staff more staff. It needs the EPA to be integrated into the process.""

""I think the [State] Department of Health ought to close the place down"" former Hawaii Gov. John Waihee told Honolulu Star-Advertiser. ""How much more do you need to do to demonstrate that those facilities are no longer viable period?""

In 2020 facilities officers at Pacific Fleet were accused of hiding information from state regulators about active fuel leaks from Red Hill's pipeline network at Pearl Harbor. Internal emails showed that they were aware of evidence of an active pipeline leak near the USS Arizona Memorial. The evidence included a failed pipeline test and the expert opinion of a spill response contractor.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued violations on Friday to four companies affiliated with the warehouse and to Los Angeles County which is responsible for maintaining the Dominguez Channel.

The warehouse fire started on Sept. 30 and quickly burned through rubbing alcohol wipes that were stored in crates and pallets a Los Angeles County fire inspector told KTLA. Mark Pestrella director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works said in an interview on Sunday that the warehouse contained “large vats of ethanol” and “everything from hand wipes to bottles of hand sanitizer.”

The chemicals then passed into the sewage system the air quality district said and ultimately drained into the Dominguez Channel a flood-control waterway that runs more than 15 miles from Los Angeles International Airport to Los Angeles Harbor. This led to the decay of organic materials in the channel resulting in the emission of hydrogen sulfide gas that far exceeded the state’s nuisance standard the agency said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBqc3Rhci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyLzA1L2lsbGlub2lzLXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLXBlb3JpYS10YXpld2VsbC13b29kZm9yZC1jb3VudHktc2FsZXMtZGVjLTUvODgwMDg1MzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Illinois real estate: Peoria Tazewell Woodford county sales Dec. 5,"Journal Star

LG DVLED Home Cinema Display

LG’s new 325-inch DVLED Home Cinema Display represents a giant leap in television advancement with a brilliant ultrahigh-definition model unmatched in its combination of size and picture quality. While most modern TVs use light-emitting diodes on or behind a liquid-crystal display (LEDs in an LCD for short) here a direct-view LED screen employs more than 99.5 million individual diodes—one red green and blue per pixel—to render an image on a screen that runs 27 feet diagonally. The impressive proportions are matched by 8K resolution that’s touted to deliver incredibly accurate contrast and colors all without burn-in artifacts that can plague typical flat screens. And unlike projector-based systems that perform only in darkened rooms the DVLED reproduces an intense picture even in a brightly lit interior. Previously available to commercial clients exclusively LG’s 2222-pound display is now offered to the home market for an equally hefty $1.7 million.

OMA K3 Turntable + Schröder Tonearm

Pennsylvania-based Oswalds Mill Audio (OMA) known for its artisanal music systems employing horn loudspeakers and vacuum-tube electronics has introduced a state-of-the-art assault on old-school vinyl playback. In development for seven years OMA’s over 200-pound $363000 K3 turntable is an analog rig that suggests a construction crane atop a Bauhaus edifice. The cast- and machined-iron base ensures the type of micro-detail and articulation that the finest phono cartridges are capable of when uncompromised.

The direct-drive motor is more powerful than any ever employed on a turntable and is accurate to arc seconds with stability further enhanced by the high-mass platter. The tonearm designed by Frank Schröder of Berlin is the first to use selective laser melting an additive 3-D printing technology that allows for the manufacture of designs previously impossible to fabricate. Cartridges can be fine-tuned for optimal tracking force and alignment while its low-mass counterweight reduces resonance. And the outboard Xenon tube-rectified power supply can be concealed within a dedicated turntable stand designed expressly for the K3 system.

As a result we have now seen various companies release gaming grips that offer a complete console-gaming experience with D-pads and analog sticks. Citing the popularity Sony is now working on a DualShock-like gaming controller for smartphones.

According to a recent patent which was reportedly published by Sony’s Japanese division the PlayStation mobile controller will offer two controller-grips on either side along with a shaft to place a mobile device in the middle. The patent also mentions that the controller will feature standard DualShock 4 analog sticks a four-button D-Pad and action buttons we see on PlayStation controllers. Furthermore there are additional trigger buttons on each of the shoulders of the controller.

As per the patent the shaft portion “can be tilted by the user” to fit their mobile devices. The accessory if launched in the market would presumably allow mobile gamers to play PlayStation games on their smartphones either via Remote Play or the cloud. Although players can connect their existing PlayStation controllers with their smartphones using Bluetooth the PlayStation mobile controller would be a much portable option.

Sony recently also hired former Apple employee Nicola Sebastiani to take care of mobile game development at PlayStation. The company is also reportedly looking to release several PlayStation titles for smartphones in the future.

However it is worth mentioning that the PlayStation mobile controller is still merely a patent. So it might be sometime before we see Sony launch the accessory in the market. We can expect to get more details about the controller in the coming days. Hence we’d suggest you stay tuned on our platform.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5c3Rhci5uZXQvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2xvYmFsLWVjb25vbXkvbmV3cy9nbG9iYWwtdGF4LWRlYWwtbGVhdmVzLWJpbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLWxvb3Bob2xlcy0yOTA5ODY20gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZGFpbHlzdGFyLm5ldC9idXNpbmVzcy9nbG9iYWwtZWNvbm9teS9uZXdzL2dsb2JhbC10YXgtZGVhbC1sZWF2ZXMtYmlsbGlvbi1kb2xsYXItbG9vcGhvbGVzLTI5MDk4NjY_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global tax deal leaves billion-dollar loopholes,"Leaders of the worlds largest economies hailed a recent agreement to overhaul global corporate tax rules as key ensuring multinationals paid their fair share of tax.

The October deal established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 per cent aimed at curtailing profit-shifting to lower-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland where many large international firms have their European headquarters.

It will eliminate incentives to shift jobs and profits abroad US President Joe Biden in early October.

But some companies could still use Ireland to reduce their tax bills even after the agreement takes effect according to tax specialists and a Reuters review of corporate filings.

Thats because the new agreement wont stop companies benefiting from a strategy widely implemented in recent years that reduces taxes over a period of up to a decade or more.

Irelands relatively generous tax allowances permit multinationals with a presence in the country to sell intellectual property such as patents and brands from one subsidiary to another to generate deductions that can be used to shield future profits from tax.

Companies that have generated deductions to reduce their taxable income by more than $10 billion each in recent years via this tax-minimizing strategy include US technology companies Adobe Inc and Oracle Corp corporate filings show.

Business-software provider Oracle declined to comment and Adobe creator of software such as Acrobat pdf-maker didn't respond to requests for comment. Both companies have said they conform to relevant tax laws.

The agreement brokered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is due to take effect in 2023.

It was signed by more than 130 jurisdictions including Ireland.

The Irish finance ministry said Irelands tax treatment of intellectual property transactions is in line with other OECD countries.

In response to Reuters questions the OECD acknowledged that companies could continue to benefit from profit-shifting strategies already in place but that it expects companies to be unable to build up such tax shields in the future.

The approach typically relies on a company also having a subsidiary in a country with a corporate income-tax rate of zero such as Bermuda that enables the company to conduct the sale tax free.

By phasing out zero-tax jurisdictions for multinationals the OECD expects the global minimum tax of 15 per cent will make the strategy no longer attractive. Were trying to design rules for the future said John Peterson an OECD official.

Peterson added that the OECD cant be certain how each countrys rules would interact with the global minimum tax. But he said the OECD is confident that abuses will be limited by a requirement that countries calculate taxable income in accordance with accounting rules.

Tax specialists say the deals impact remains unclear because key details are yet to be agreed including how to calculate the pot of profit that is to be taxed.

Countries are currently debating carve-outs for certain tax breaks.

In addition jurisdictions could retain wide latitude in how they allow companies to calculate taxable income the specialists said.

Where there isnt accounting consistency there is scope for gaming said Nicholas Gardner a tax partner at law firm Ashurst in London.

The new rules are expected to be finalized next year and require lawmaker approval in some jurisdictions.

That includes the United States where several top Republican politicians have voiced opposition to the deal.

Malta is another country that permits multinationals to minimize taxes via intra-company intellectual property sales.

Maltas finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment on its intellectual property-related tax allowances.

International pressure forced Ireland in recent years to phase out one of the worlds best-known corporate-tax loopholes known as the double Irish.

In response companies have increasingly accumulated tax deductions known as capital allowances via intra-group sales of intellectual property according to tax advisors economists and company filings.

Since 2015 multinationals have moved hundreds of billions of euros worth of intellectual property into Ireland economists say.

This has led to vast annual tax deductions for foreign companies related to so-called intangible assets more than 45 billion euros in 2019 up from under 2.7 billion euros in 2014 according to data from Irelands tax authority.

The data doesnt break down what portion of those deductions were related to intellectual-property transactions within a corporation.

Virtually every multinational has moved intellectual property said Christopher Sibley a senior statistician at Irelands Central Statistics Office.

The profits being shielded from tax by US-based companies typically come from sales to Europe Asia and Africa according to tax specialists and corporate filings.

The US Treasury loses out because the products and services sold are based on research conducted and investment made in the United States academics say.

The US Treasury declined to comment on whether US companies will continue to take advantage of pre-existing tax strategies or benefit from future ones.

Adobe books most of its sales to non-US clients through an Irish subsidiary based in a four-storey block in an office park outside Dublin corporate filings show.

In 2020 Adobe Systems Software Ireland Ltd purchased intellectual property from another subsidiary that was both an Irish-registered company and a resident in Bermuda for tax purposes.

The set-up meant no tax was due on the $11 billion profit from the sale. Meanwhile Irish-tax resident Adobe Systems Software Ireland registered an $11 billion expense that could be used to offset taxes on profits over a period of about eight years because it is an asset that depreciates over time according to the subsidiaries accounts.

Adobe paid $197 million of tax on $3.1 billion of reported profit in Ireland in 2020 and sales of $5.6 billion according to accounts for its main Irish unit.

This equates to an effective tax rate of about half of Irelands current statutory 12.5 per cent corporate income tax rate thanks to the impact of the capital allowances.

Other US companies that have amassed multi-billion-dollar tax deductions from intellectual property sales to affiliates over the last three years include semiconductor maker Analog Devices Inc medical devices maker Stryker Corp and software group Cadence Design Systems Inc publicly available accounts for their Irish subsidiaries show.

Analog Devices and Stryker said they adhere to tax rules and regulations but declined to answer questions on their specific tax arrangements. Cadence declined to comment.",,,,,,

Looking ahead to 2022 there’s still a lot to expect from the company. In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman breaks down everything he expects Apple to unveil in the new year.

In today’s newsletter Gurman corroborates much of what has previously been reported about what to expect from Apple in 2022. Notably he still says that Apple is planning a new iPad Pro design with support for wireless charging as well as updates to the lower-end iPad Air and entry-level iPad.

Gurman also says that Apple has a redesigned MacBook Air in the works for 2022 alongside a “revamped high-end iMac with Apple Silicon.” There’s also a new entry-level MacBook Pro a new Mac Pro and a new Mac mini in the works for next year.

For the Apple Watch Gurman expects three new models including an updated Apple Watch SE an updated standard model and a “ruggedized version aimed at extreme sports athletes.”

“2021 was a modest year for Apple product updates but I’d expect a wider-range of new products in 2022. Let’s go down the list of what I expect to come next year” Gurman says. Here’s the full breakdown of everything to expect from Apple in 2022 according to Gurman:

A new iPad Pro design with wireless charging plus updates to the iPad Air and entry-level iPad.

A revamped high-end iMac with Apple silicon to sit above the new 24-inch model.

An iPhone SE with 5G.

New AirPods Pro earbuds.

The biggest MacBook Air revamp in the product’s history adding the M2 chip and a new design.

New versions of the Mac mini entry-level MacBook Pro and a revamped Mac Pro with Apple silicon.

Of course the iPhone 14 lineup.

Three fresh Apple Watches including a new Apple Watch SE an updated standard model and a ruggedized version aimed at extreme sports athletes.

And probably most significantly the introduction of Apple’s first mixed augmented and virtual reality headset.

If all of this ends up panning out it’s clear that Apple has quite a bit in the works for 2022. What are you most excited to see? Let us know down in the comments!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXRlbnRseWFwcGxlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyL2FwcGxlLWZpbGVzLWZvci10aGUtZmlndXJhdGl2ZS10cmFkZW1hcmstcmVwcmVzZW50aW5nLWFwcGxlLWRpZ2l0YWwtbWFzdGVyLXdoaWxlLXdpbm5pbmctYS1kZXNpZ24tcGF0ZW50LWZvci1pcGhvbmUtMTMtcHJvLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple Files for the Figurative Trademark Representing 'Apple Digital Master' while winning a Design Patent for iPhone ...,"(Click on image to Enlarge)

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Creil – Amiens section méridionale de l’artère Paris – Lille a connu une forte activité marchandises du temps de la vapeur avec le transport de pondéreux provenant du bassin houiller du Nord-Pas-de-Calais. L’ouverture de la LGV Nord-Europe puis le développement de l’offre TER ont redéfini le transport de voyageurs aujourd’hui dominant le transit fret se maintenant à un bon niveau.

Tronçon méridional de 80 km de la grande artère Paris – Lille de la Compagnie du Nord portant le n° 272 au catalogue du RFN c’est une des plus anciennes lignes de la puissante compagnie car ouverte à double voie en 1846. Empruntée également par les convois vers les ports du littoral de la mer du Nord traversant les départements de l’Oise et de la Somme elle a un passé chargé avec les trois guerres successives ayant touché le nord de la France.

Après un siècle de présence sans partage de la traction vapeur et l’amenuisement des trafics lourds de pondéreux issus du bassin houiller du Nord-Pas-de-Calais elle a connu les heures glorieuses du monophasé puis s‘est vue privée d’un coup des liaisons grandes lignes converties en TGV utilisant la LGV Nord-Europe. Si aujourd’hui les circulations TER de la région des Hauts-de-France dominent son activité avec des déplacements de clientèle en hausse orientés vers la capitale le transit du fret n’est cependant pas marginal. Elle reste à tout moment une soupape de sûreté pour accueillir en détournement éventuel les TGV vers Lille et la Belgique lors d’incidents sur la LN 3 heureusement rarissimes.

La présidente de l'Île-de-France favorite avec sa ligne libérale et ferme a remporté 6095% des voix contre 3905% au très droitier député des Alpes-Maritimes.

""Notre unité est notre force""

""Nous posons le premier pas sur le chemin qui va nous amener à la victoire"" a assuré Christian Jacob en se félicitant de cette ""journée de rassemblement d'union"". ""La droite a retrouvé son ADN elle est populaire et solidaire (...) avec une vraie équipe de France prête à diriger notre pays"" a-t-il ajouté sous les applaudissements des militants au siège du parti.

""Merci d'avoir eu cette audace"" de désigner une première femme candidate de la droite et ""je vais m'en montrer digne"" a lancé Valérie Pécresse à la tribune adressant une pensée ""à toutes les femmes de France"" et en promettant de ""tout donner"" dans la campagne présidentielle. ""La droite républicaine est de retour la droite des convictions la droite des solutions"" a-t-elle martelé.

""Notre unité fait notre force"" a encore plaidé l'ancienne ministre de Nicolas Sarkozy en assurant à chacun des candidats au congrès présents samedi au siège des LR que le ""rassemblement ne sera pas que des mots mais des actes"". ""Je m'y engage nous allons restaurer la fierté française et protéger les Français"" a-t-elle ajouté.

Les félicitations de Ciotti

Valérie Pécresse devra cependant composer en ce début de campagne avec la circulation accrue de l'épidémie de coronavirus qui entrave la tenue du premier meeting prévu samedi 11 décembre. ""Compte tenu des conditions sanitaires évidentes nous ne tiendrons pas le meeting en physique tel qu'il était prévu"" a indiqué Christian Jacob en précisant que des détails seraient donnés dans les prochains jours.

Le syndicat Force ouvrière dénonce une pratique dangereuse pour leur sécurité.

Depuis septembre la RATP mène une expérimentation sur les lignes 2 et 9 du métro parisien: désormais les agents doivent fermer leur station seuls et non plus à deux. Une situation qui peut s'avérer dangereuse selon le syndicat Force ouvrière (FO) qui a assigné l'établissement public en justice devant le tribunal de Paris la semaine dernière comme l'expliquent nos confrères du Parisien.

""La fermeture doit se faire à deux normalement. Il y a beaucoup de femmes parmi nous. Et quand il faut mettre les sans-domicile-fixe dehors à 1 heure du matin cela peut être dangereux"" juge Cyril Manach délégué FO et agent de station cité par le quotidien

Le syndicat réclame donc ""l'arrêt immédiat"" de cette expérimentation qui menace ""gravement"" la ""sécurité des agents"". Depuis la crise sanitaire ""les marginaux ont augmenté dans le réseau (...) et l'agressivité aussi"" déplore Cyril Manach assurant que ""quand il faut faire le tour des quais et des couloirs seul c'est compliqué. Et on ne veut pas attendre qu'un drame arrive pour faire cesser l’expérimentation"".

La sécurité des agents ""une priorité"" pour la RATP

D'après nos confrères une ""alarme sociale"" procédure qui permet de faire remonter les problèmes de terrain à la hiérarchie a été déposée par les syndicats le 27 septembre dernier sans succès. FO a alors assigné la RATP en justice.

""Toute expérimentation impactant structurellement les conditions de travail de tous les agents de station et de gare doit faire l'objet d’un dialogue social collectif au niveau du département. Or les conditions de travail des agents dédiés à la fermeture des stations sont évidemment impactées par le fait que ceux-ci pourraient être désormais seuls la nuit entre 1 et 2 heures du matin à affronter délinquants et marginaux errants dans les stations"" explique Me Richard Forget qui représente le syndicat.

Contactée par nos confrères la RATP assure que dans le cadre de cette expérimentation ""l'agent de station peut être soutenu par les équipes itinérantes en ligne"". ""La sécurité de nos agents et de nos clients est une priorité pour la RATP"" assure la direction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdWRvdWVzdC5mci9zcG9ydC9oYW5kYmFsbC9tb25kaWFsLTIwMjEtZGUtaGFuZC1sZXMtZnJhbmNhaXNlcy1zdXJjbGFzc2VudC1sYS1zbG92ZW5pZS1ldC1maWxlbnQtYXUtdG91ci1wcmluY2lwYWwtNzI0MjAzNi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mondial-2021 de hand : les Françaises surclassent la Slovénie et filent au tour principal,"Les handballeuses françaises championnes olympiques il y a quatre mois à Tokyo ont surclassé la Slovénie 29 à 18 dimanche pour leur deuxième match au Mondial-2021 à Granollers (Espagne) assurant mathématiquement leur place au tour principal.

Deux jours après une entame maitrisée contre l’Angola (30-20) les coéquipières de Coralie Lassource ont élevé leur niveau de plusieurs crans notamment grâce à leur défense autour de la patronne Béatrice Edwige qui a totalement étouffé la base arrière slovène pourtant étincelante contre le Monténégro.

🏆 Victoire sérieuse des Bleues contre la Slovénie ! pic.twitter.com/opJoeEx3RS — beIN SPORTS (@beinsports_FR) December 5 2021

«On a fait un match très sérieux très engagé défensivement. On a vraiment réussi à mettre en oeuvre ce que l’on voulait notamment en première période» s’est réjoui le sélectionneur de l’équipe de France Olivier Krumbholz après la rencontre.

Comme pour le quart de finale des Jeux olympiques contre les Pays-Bas (victoire française 32-22) les Françaises ont très rapidement pris le large au score (6-0 12e) aidées par les arrêts de Laura Glauser à nouveau titularisée.

«C’est énorme je ne pense pas que ça nous est déjà arrivé. On est super contentes Laura est vraiment dans sa compétition Cléo (Cléopatre Darleux) va y rentrer progressivement. Je pense que les gardiennes nous ont bien aidées et on les a bien aidées» a apprécié Béatrice Edwige après le match.

«On a eu des ballons de contre-attaque. On a aussi trouvé de bonnes solutions en attaque même si on a perdu quelques ballons. Le point noir ça reste l’efficacité au tir on aurait pu être bien plus à l’aise» a nuancé le sélectionneur en vue des confrontations à venir notamment au tour principal.

«Ça envoie un message»

Cette défense véritable marque de fabrique de l’équipe de France depuis plusieurs années a permis des remontées de balle à l’image de la relance millimétrée de Darleux sur l’ailière et capitaine Coralie Lassource en début de seconde période.

L’arrière gauchère Ana Gros n’a inscrit son premier but qu’après 13 minutes de jeu et a très vite été mise sur le banc par le sélectionneur monténégrin de la Slovénie Dragan Azic.

Tout aussi impériale que contre l’Angola avec sept arrêts en première période contre la Slovénie Laura Glauser a été bien secondée dans les buts par Cléopatre Darleux (cinq parades).

Petite inquiétude pour le sélectionneur avec la sortie de Laura Flippes qui s’est tordu la cheville au début de la seconde période et qui a terminé le pied gauche strappé.

Voilà les Françaises assurées de rejoindre le tour principal avec au minimum deux points. Elles devront terminer le travail contre le Monténégro mardi soir (20h30) afin d’arriver avec le plein de points et de confiance pour la suite de la compétition."

Beginning on May 31 Season 1 of the animated sci-fi drama will begin streaming on Netflix in the U.S. the U.K. Ireland and New Zealand. The Netflix deal is non-exclusive meaning the episodes will remain available on Max. Sources tell Variety that Netflix is considering picking up “Scavengers Reign” for a second season but a decision won’t be made until after Season 1’s debut on the streamer.

The series is set on an alien planet where a damaged interstellar freighter ship gets stranded and follows the remaining crew as they struggle to locate their ship and missing crewmates while navigating a hostile world that has thrived without human interference.

Variety named “Scavengers Reign” one of the top 19 shows of 2023 with critic Alison Herman writing that it “pairs the engrossing ambience of a nature documentary with the propulsive thrust of narrative. Its characters are fully realized and flawed but their main scene partners are an environment they need to intuit the workings of alongside the audience. The 12-episode season is a deep cut worth seeking out (or renewing if you’re the powers that be and Warner Bros. Discovery).”

Popular on Variety

“Scavengers Reign” was created Joseph Bennett and Charles Huettner who executive produce alongside Chris Prynoski. Sean Buckelew and James Merrill serve as co-executive producers with Benjy Brooke as supervising director. The series was produced by Green Street Pictures in partnership with Titmouse Inc.

“We are beyond thrilled that ‘Scavengers Reign’ will be joining the incredible animation lineup on Netflix” said Bennett Buckelew Merrill and Brooke on behalf of Green Street. “We’re immensely grateful to everyone who has watched the show already and to Netflix for giving it an opportunity to be discovered by a wider audience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZ291dHJndi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvMTAvYmFzZWJhbGwtZHJvcHMtc2VyaWVzLW9wZW5lci1hdC1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWJhcHRpc3QuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baseball Drops Series Opener at California Baptist,"Thanks for visiting !

The company's offerings include Zendesk Chat a live chat software to connect with customers on websites applications and mobile devices; Zendesk Talk a cloud-based call center software; Zendesk Guide a knowledge base that powers customer self-service and support agent productivity; Zendesk Gather a community forum software that allows customer end-users to connect and collaborate; Zendesk Sell a sales customer relationship management (CRM) product solution to enhance productivity processes and pipeline visibility; Zendesk Explore which provides analytics for organizations to measure and enhance the customer experience; Zendesk Sunshine a CRM platform; Sunshine Conversations a messaging platform solution; Zendesk Embeddables which allow developers to embed experiences on the Web and mobile applications; Zendesk APIs that allow users to build custom integrations and interact with Zendesk data; Zendesk Apps that enable organizations to customize Zendesk product and platform solution interfaces and optimize workflow through plug-ins; and Zendesk Suite an omnichannel offering which combines its solutions.

Activist Commentary: Jana Partners is a very experienced activist investor with much success in the information technology industry. Jana's returns in this industry average 24.02% versus 7.64% for the S&P 500 over the same period. Jana rarely sends public letters to boards. They are not activists for activism's sake but will only engage when they feel that they can either create significant shareholder value or stop the deterioration of shareholder value. In this case they could potentially do both.

The first thing that Jana can do to create value for shareholders is lead the fight against the merger of Zendesk and Momentive. Jana makes several good points as to why this deal should not happen including: (i) the company is making its largest ever acquisition at a premium valuation using undervalued equity; (ii) it goes against the company's successful historic strategic focus and direction; (iii) Zendesk was already experiencing execution issues with its current business; and (iv) it makes Zendesk much less attractive to a potential acquirer of its business.

But you do not need to take Jana's word on this – the market has spoken loudly. Since the deal was announced Zendesk's stock is down nearly 20% and Momentive is down roughly 25% (as of market close Dec. 3) in an otherwise flat market. Moreover Momentive shareholders are not too happy with it either – activist investor and Momentive shareholder Legion Partners quickly came out in opposition of the deal. This deal is so bad that it could possibly be one of the few if any mergers in history to be voted down by both sides. Just terminating this deal alone should create tremendous value for shareholders.

Once that happens the second thing Jana could do to create shareholder value like they have done in many other companies is bringing an experienced and fresh perspective to the board. Given the execution issues the company has been experiencing and this recent misstep the board and management could certainly benefit from adding a shareholder orientation. As Jana does with most of their active engagements and as they allude to in their letter they are working with a team of public company directors and executives with relevant industry experience who would likely be excellent board candidates. The company's CEO Mikkel Svane is also its founder and he is clearly brilliant but he might not be the best person to run the day-to-day operations of a public company. Moreover the lead director Carl Bass is not a fan of activists: When engaged by activists as CEO of Autodesk he called them sports fans who think they know more than the coaches and owners. Less than one year later he was no longer CEO of Autodesk. If he is not careful he can experience a similar outcome here as he is up for re-election in 2022.

The best thing the board can do for itself is promptly decide to terminate the merger agreement as a response to the will of the shareholders. If instead the agreement is terminated because shareholders vote against it as it appears it will be history has shown that this is a big endorsement for the activist and against management and will allow the activist to walk on to the board next annual meeting if they choose to do so. Further at last year's annual meeting there were already signs of shareholder discontent – Hilarie Koplow-McAdams and Michelle Wilson two of the three directors voted on received 40.04% and 37.43% of votes against them.

This situation would lead to the third value creation opportunity here – a sale of the company to a strategic. Back in 2016 when Salesforce board member Colin Powell's email was hacked it was disclosed that Zendesk was on Salesforce's M&A target list but that their view was that the Zendesk CEO was not interested in selling. Likewise private equity has shown interest with nothing to show for it. Well an activist involved generally puts a company in pseudo-play and a board that is on the precipice of losing a proxy fight suddenly gets incentivized to sell the company if they think they are going to be out one way or the other.

Below are updates on our twenty current high-conviction long and short ideas. We have removed Spotify Technology (SPOT) from the long side. We have added AvalonBay Communities (AVB) Coinbase (COIN) & Rivian (RIVN) to the long side of Investing Ideas. We will send a separate email with Hedgeye CEO Keith McCullough's refreshed levels for each ticker.

PLBY

Long Thesis Overview: We think that the upside here is simply massive. 10-bagger over TAIL duration. Ideas like this come along once every few years. I know that it’s too thinly traded now for a lot of institutions to get involved but that dynamic should change dramatically over the next 1-3 years while the P&L Cash Flow Balance Sheet and float characteristics catapult themselves worlds head of the consensus.

This week Playboy announced that it has partnered with platinum selling hip-hop artist Cardi B as the company’s new Creative Director In Residence. This is massive for Playboy as Cardi B has hundreds of millions of followers across social media.

She has 15mm TikTok followers 20mm Twitter Followers 100mm+ Instagram Followers 32mm monthly listeners on Spotify (64th in the world) and 36mm Facebook likes. Pair that influence with PLBY’s already strong social media presence of 15mm Facebook Likes 10mm Instagram Followers 2mm Twitter Followers and 250k TikTok followers.

Our sense is that her deal with Playboy is chock full of incentives on sales targets and possibly stock which would be very positive for both the stock and the company moving forward.

PSA & CUBE

Long Thesis Overview: We can keep this short - all that really matters for Best Idea Long PSA is that the company inaugurated FY21 FFO guidance with full ranges for all the key drivers (SSRev SSExp SSNOI Development Acquisitions etc). Not only does this bring PSA up to par with the other four peers in the space but it signals management's ongoing commitment to address long-time shareholder gripes regarding engagement with the street governance capital deployment balance sheet efficiency etc. All of these items are core to the long thesis for accelerating earnings growth and a positive re-rating of the stock. Long Thesis Overview: This is a ""keep it simple and straightforward"" type of call: (1) the subsector is highly correlated internally given the submarket overlap and works well in an inflationary environment (2) CUBE backtests well in each of Quads 2-4 (3) upward earnings revisions are extremely likely and a positive catalyst and (4) CUBE's balance sheet is a huge strategic and style factor advantage.

PSA announced last week that it had closed on its previously-announced $1.5 billion acquisition of All Storage which owns and operates 52 assets in the Dallas-Fort Worth MSA.

The acquisition was 100% funded with unsecured debt which given the ~2% cost of debt is an exceptional use of capital for a deal that could ultimately stabilize above a ~5-6% yield. The portfolio is only ~75% stabilized and is immediately accretive to earnings in FY22 as well as forward NAV growth with only a marginal increase in leverage to ~4.5x net debt + pfd./EBITDA. We continue to like the way that PSA is flexing its low-levered balance sheet to increase scale and execute on accretive external growth.

The math tells us that FY22 is setting up to produce another double-digit SSNOI growth year although there is a high probability that the RoC inflects downward after 2Q22. Nothing new to report on CUBE other than that it remains our favorite long idea in self-storage.

FWONK

Long Thesis Overview: In 2020 F1 reached a new Concorde agreement for the 2021-2025 seasons that will meaningfully improve the economics of a race. Liberty has also focused on entering more attractive long-term race deals like the Vietnam and Miami Grand Prix agreements. We believe there is more grease on the wheels. Liberty can maximize its efforts to increase interest in the sport continue to go after underpenetrated markets and use its SVOD service to capitalize on its content more efficiently. The most significant area of improvement for F1 is their sponsorship and partner agreements. We believe there is ample opportunity in sponsorship with only 17 races out of the record-breaking 23 race calendar having a title sponsor and F1 lacking many low-hanging partnerships such as fuel and hospitality providers.

Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton has closed the gap to title rival Max Verstappen following a dominant victory in the inaugural Qatar Grand Prix at the Losail International Circuit with Verstappen recovering from a grid drop that saw him start P7 to finish second as Alpine's Fernando Alonso took the final podium position.

After a clinical start from pole position Hamilton was able to control the pace at the front of the field with in indomitable lights-to-flag win his second in a row after Brazil. But while Hamilton was impressive so too was Verstappen who was dropped from P2 to seventh on the grid for failing to respect double waved yellow flags in qualifying.

Verstappen shrugged off the disappointment though jumping to P4 at the start before quickly making his way up to second before following Hamilton home to limit the damage to his title lead which now stands at eight points as Verstappen claimed the fastest lap bonus point.

Meanwhile there was joy down at Alpine as Alonso returned to the podium for the first time since the 2014 Hungarian Grand Prix the Spaniard having executed an aggressive drive to survive late-race pressure from Red Bull’s Sergio Perez to take third.

Perez’s fourth place was a decent recovery considering he’d started P11 while he finished ahead of the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Lance Stroll taking P6 for Aston Martin.

The Ferrari pair of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc were P7 and P8. Lando Norris took P9 after a late stop for the McLaren driver as Sebastian Vettel took the final points-paying position for P10 – with Pierre Gasly failing to make a two-stop strategy work dropping from P2 on the grid to P11 allowing Alpine to move clear of AlphaTauri in P5 in the standings.

Meanwhile it was a day to forget for Mercedes’ Valtteri Bottas who took his own grid drop dropping from P3 to P6 before falling to 11th at the start and then suffering mid-race tyre issues – as did Williams’ George Russell and Nicholas Latifi – before Mercedes retired him.

So with just two races to go now it’s Hamilton within touching distance of Verstappen in the drivers’ fight. Roll on Saudi Arabia.

ROK

Long Thesis Overview: We expect this to be an unusually good cycle for ROK as developed market automation investment benefits from less ‘offshoring’ of production amid higher emerging market labor costs and other considerations. The capabilities for automation technologies from machine vision to software to 5G and the like broaden the market opportunity substantially. Despite being one of the best businesses in our coverage shares of ROK don’t yet sport the premium valuation we’d expect them to receive as organic growth accelerates through 2H21.

AMH

Long Thesis Overview: On balance we see the data as very supportive of the long-term SFR long thesis in general but in particular AMH with its captive ""bank"" of lot inventory and unique development program set against an extremely tight supply environment. As the space matures and grows more competitive given the outsized yield opportunities operators with pre-sourced inventory to control build and deliver have a massive advantage.

Last week we put out a note on Long AMH HERE where we talked about the lead-lag effect between and among home price appreciation (HPA) leasing spreads and realized rents in AMH’s results.

HPA leads leasing spreads by 3-4 quarters which in turn lead actually results and earnings by another 2-3 quarters. The trend in HPA for AMH’s markets show an acceleration in the RoC on leasing spreads and earnings likely through FY22 and there is zero chance this is accurately being reflected in consensus numbers. Just buy the stock and let it rip.

TOST

Long Thesis Overview: Toast (TOST) shares opened above the price range we highlighted in our pre-IPO Black Book. Comparing to publicly traded peers we thought the shares could trade up significantly. Not only did Toast have a larger TAM in the restaurant sector but it also is set up to have a more dominant competitive position.

As covid cases ramp up into the winter months restaurants will have to deal with slowdowns and possibly even lockdowns. Restaurant goers will wane in the winter months as individuals do not want to deal with dining outside in cold temperatures or risk getting infected indoors.

Takeout and delivery will increase in popularity. These headwinds for the industry will only accelerate adoption of technology. The first covid wave showed how restaurants needed to quickly adapt to the changing environment these restaurants face.

During the first wave many larger chains pivoted to a digital environment. However in future waves it will be the smaller restaurant chains that will need to adapt to compete with these larger chains.

BROS

Long Thesis Overview: The Dutch Bros concept looks strong and is an interesting competitor to SBUX. BROS is an owner-operator and franchisor of drive-thru shops that focus on serving quality hand-crafted beverages with substantial average unit volumes. Founded in 1992 by Dane and Travis Boersma Dutch Bros began with an espresso machine and a pushcart in Grants Pass Oregon. Once public BROS will be one of the fastest-growing restaurant companies by new store growth at 20% annually.

Dutch Bros continues its expansion into the South opening a new location in Houston Texas. This location marks the fourth location in the Spring-area in Houston.

The AUV for the average Dutch Bros location is about $1.7 Million which is tremendous for how small each location is. However for new openings in 2020 and 2021 the AUV for these locations is an astounding $2.1 Million. Dutch Bros has been selectively expanding into new regions.

These new locations have shown to be even more successful than their west coast base. Both franchised and company-owned locations are growing at a rapid pace.

DUFRY

Long Thesis Overview: Despite management teasing a 2023 recovery we think the Street (and the current price) is still too conservative in not expecting a full recovery for another 5-years – particularly the European investment community. We think we’ll see a full recovery by 2023 on an EBIT margin double pre-pandemic rates. There’s your first paycheck. Then you get your second paycheck on the Hainan JV with Alibaba which we think is running ahead of schedule (management is keeping people grounded here with expectations). That gets you paid by another CHf165mm (1.50 per share) once the JV kicks into high gear in 2023. With the meaningfully higher margin profile comes the cash…and we think that the company will take out 15-20% of its share count over a TAIL duration – that is unless it continues to consolidate the 88% of the industry it does not control.

With the news of the omicron variant coupled with the lockdown potential in Europe this name continues to get bashed. Is there anything fundamentally different about this business because of the variant—the answer is no.

Dufry continues to be the global leader in the Duty-Free industry no matter what COVID news flow comes through. Of course the revenue recovery of this business is tied to passenger recovery which may take a hit over a shorter time period but all the updated forecasts have passenger recovery coming back to 2019 levels by 2023 even if the road to get there is bumpy.

Despite the near-term volatility this name still has multi-bagger written all over it as the passenger recovery does normalize the company emerges on a leaner and more variable cost structure to achieve record EBIT margins on higher revenue and continues to develop its operation in Hainan.

PCAR & VLVLY

Long Thesis Overview: The truck industry should undergo a major structural change this quarter with the spin-off of Daimler Truck. We expect Daimler to seek higher margins via pricing. Hints of that are seen in the delays for opening build slots for 2022. If we are reading that correctly we think PCAR and Volvo are straightforward beneficiaries. Long Thesis Overview: Shares of Volvo Group (VLVLY) have lagged other machinery-oriented names despite favorable industry and company specific factors. Trucking conditions in Volvo’s key markets remain extremely tight while labor conditions may ease in coming months. Construction equipment demand in developed markets should remain reasonably robust a view supported by fleet demographics COVID recovery stimulus elevated commodity prices and aging infrastructure. We see greater than 50% relative upside for shares of Volvo as robust demand intersects with stronger 2022 pricing.

With the combination of subsidized electrification and pricing-driven EPS growth we expect PCAR Volvo and perhaps Daimler Truck to revalue into a new range. Daimler Truck is likely to be valued post-spin between €30 billion & €50 billion (*assuming profitability targets are hit*) suggesting the remaining Daimler AG would be ‘cheap-ish’ for a legacy auto OEM. The combined group’s EV should be closer to €100 bil vs. the current ~ €80 bil with adjustments for emissions-related liabilities.

BIRD

Long Thesis Overview: From where we sit – 30% annual top line is a slam dunk for this brand – especially given that it has only 11% brand awareness with huge upside for new customer acquisition. Though it’s currently losing money on roughly $250mm in sales – 100% of which is DTC (i.e. extremely attractive) – the EBIT margin structure is likely to clock in at a 15%-18% level over a TAIL duration on nearly 3x the revenue base. That puts about $0.75 per share in earnings in play.

BIRD put up results for the quarter in line with its preannounced range but the market was looking for it to crush expectations right out of the gate and take up the guide. That didn’t happen. The top highlight of the quarter is that US revenue accelerated to +42%.

The key is that this is happened at the same time the company launched no fewer than 5 new platforms – showing that innovation drives the top line here. Second is the SG&A level.

The brand has only 11% unaided awareness and it has to innovate on one end and then spend up to build awareness of the brand and product at the other end. As a newly public company management is doing what it should to drive accelerated growth.

WYNN

Long Thesis Overview: If history has taught us anything it’s that BIC makes a great lighter and in the casino world BICs catch fire during recoveries and generally outperform the competition. Per our math WYNN is indeed outperforming in the USA. Macau is the wildcard and with all the fits and starts it’s impossible to discern a trend. However we’re optimistic that WYNN will outperform there as well when the market stabilizes and recovers.

If history has taught us anything it’s that BIC makes a great lighter and in the casino world BICs catch fire during recoveries and generally outperform the competition. Per our math WYNN is indeed outperforming in the USA.

By our calculation Wynn has grown its GGR share by almost 200bps in 2021 YTD vs 2019 and that’s with a lower-than-average table hold percentage. Hedgeye EBITDA estimates are now higher than the Street for 2022 and 2023 for the company and across every Wynn market. WYNN’s BIC assets will prove to be share gainers and it remains a Best Idea at Hedgeye.

WOOF

Long Thesis Overview: The company is seeing an impact from strong sales in consumables due to the pet life cycle going from Year 1 (heavy supplies little food) to Year 2 (low supplies lots of food). Also keep in mind that as it scales its vet clinics the services personnel costs are booked in COGS as opposed to store labor which is booked in SG&A.

The first reaction to seeing WOOF come back public earlier this year was “here we go again” as this name has gone public twice already in 1994 and again in 2002. However after more research we found this name to be incredibly intriguing. First it plays in a great category.

The pet category was attractive pre-covid with 1% growth in the pet population each year and 4% increase in per capita spending. That got turbocharged with covid as pet adoptions surged to 4% while people sheltered-in-place. This creates an 8-10 year secular tailwind for the number of pets that need to be fed groomed and vaccinated. Second WOOF also is playing in the Vet business which is a $27bn TAM.

WOOF has close to 200 full vet hospitals in its 1500 total stores with the plan to get to 900 in the future. The addition of a vet center at a store has resulted in ~600bp lift to sales in year 1 of the first 100 clinics.

This vet build out in the face of outsized industry growth over the next 3-5 years is critical to the TAIL call here having any teeth. Tying it all together WOOF is creating an unrivaled ecosystem experience in the secularly strong Pet category.

avb

Hedgeye CEO Keith McCullough added Avalonbay Communities (AVB) to the long side of Investing Ideas this week. Below is a brief note.

Rather than live in fear of other people's lack of process let's keep playing our game... looking for #Quad1 pivots like the one REITs analyst Rob Simone gave us on The Call @Hedgeye this morning:

Buy the damn dip in Avalonbay Communities (AVB) was the call. The Signal didn't come until we saw the emotionally draining red into the close.

coin

Hedgeye CEO Keith McCullough added Coinbase (COIN) to the long side of Investing Ideas this week. Below is a brief note.

Been waiting patiently for consensus to get frustrated with ""Crypto not going up""...

And of course and immediate-term TRADE #oversold signal within Coinbase's (COIN) Bullish @Hedgeye TREND.

From Financials analyst Josh Steiner's Financials Pro research product:

Takeaway: The time is right to add Coinbase on the long side. Back in June we hosted a Coinbase bull-bear debate in which we profiled the risk-reward setup for the broader digital asset space as well as Coinbase the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange. The detailed bull case for Coinbase can be reviewed in that presentation. With the continued widespread growth of the crypto asset class and what had been a cooler third quarter we are adding Coinbase (COIN) as a new Best Idea Long based on the strong October trends and the longer-term secular growth tailwinds across the crypto-verse.

RIVN

Hedgeye CEO Keith McCullough added Rivian (RIVN) to the long side of Investing Ideas this week. Below is a brief note.

After buying some Tech (QQQ) McGough (Consumer Discretionary)... what Sector Style am I fishing for here in #Quad1?

A: Industrials (especially the sexy ones).

This is as sexy as Industrials analyst Jay Van Sciver might get: Long Rivian Automotive (RIVN):

Rivian is set to be one of the largest IPOs of the last decade toward the end of November targeting a hefty $80 billion valuation. The well-funded electric vehicle start-up offers vehicles in the higher value segments of the auto market with innovative ‘adventure vehicles’ the R1T pick-up truck and the R1S SUV. On the commercial vehicle side Rivian is a prospective supplier to Amazon with its EDV platform…positioning the company as another front for the Bezos v. Musk twelve-digit billionaire battle.

RRGB

Short Thesis Overview: Restaurants that we could operate at total capacity saw comparable restaurant revenue increase 7.0% from the pre-pandemic comparable quarter. In addition margins at these restaurants reached 19.5% a 180 bps increase. However overall comparable restaurant sales are still down 2.4% compared to 2019. Nothing exciting to see with Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB).

We remain SHORT most labor-intensive casual dine-in restaurants stocks like Red Robin which sold off on concerns over the new COVID-19 variant that has been reported out of South Africa. The stocks have been under pressure for some time but the incremental selling pressure is well in front of any indication that dining restrictions in the U.S. will be widespread. That said the Delta variants definitely hurt 3Q21 performance.

There are varying press reports the variant carries an unusually large number of mutations associated with increased antibody resistance and is ""clearly very different"" from previous incarnations. South African scientists have already detected 30 mutations to the spike protein which play a big role in how the virus enters the body. The biggest concern is whether the virus could lead to more serious illness or decrease the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments but internally we don't belive that to be the case.

It's likely that the early breakdown from analysts is that the sudden share price drops of restaurant stocks could be overdone without any clear indication that the variant will ultimately impact U.S. traffic but that is not the overriding investment thesis for this group.

The labor issues have created new sales-related problems this quarter and into next year. Some restaurants that are struggling with labor shortages and the return of customers to on-site dining are choosing to scale back the times delivery and to-go orders. Many casual dining companies are cutting capacity in that they can't staff both the in-store delivery on both in-store and digital sales.

SFIX

Short Thesis Overview: There are clear negative implications there for sales predictability gross margins inventory turns and capital intensity. We don't think management is planning for having to compete like we think it will be forced to. This company was something special in its early pre-IPO days. Now it’s become just what the tech investors don’t want to admit – a retailer. Retailers trade on earnings and cash flow. A $40 stock definitely doesn’t respect that reality.

SFIX continues to creep ever closer to its IPO price of $15.

Since shorting this name the company has introduced and significantly pushed its 300-500bps dilutive direct buy initiative it has introduced its “live styling” feature which requires heavier investment on the SG&A line to pay more stylists to be able to interact with customers the Founder and CEO transitioned out into an Exec Chair role (which does not happen in a position of strength) and the COO sent a letter to the companies employees saying it must do better amidst massive stylist turnover.

The company reports next Tuesday and we expect this name to continue to show weakness.

COLD

Short Thesis Overview: Simply put COLD is uniquely vulnerable given (1) its position in the “cold chain” (2) the structure and mix of its revenue agreements (3) the composition of its cost structure and high labor component (4) the risk of integrating recent large acquisitions materializing at exactly the wrong time and (5) consensus numbers that in our view were far too high both in FY21 but especially FY22 and beyond.

Nothing new to report on Best Idea Short COLD. We received the updated USDA report on cold storage commodity levels last week which showed that stock levels increased sequentially from September into October as expected however the stock levels ticked down to 93% of prior year levels versus 94% last month.

Commodity stocks should be building on an absolute basis quarter-over-quarter ahead of the key holiday period however we believe the metric to watch is % of prior year levels. We remain bearish from a fundamental perspective until COLD likely “kitchen sinks” its 2022 outlook in February.

Its very hard to find shorts right now in REITs and COLD is an obvious candidate over the next 3-6 months at the very least as a funding short.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Industry: Scientific research into ocean temperature to provide key data for understanding and predicting climate change

Application: Pressure measurement for depth control in free floating data collection buoys

Solution: High pressure titanium bespoke PDCR1830 depth and level sensor in a 17.5 mm package

Druck’s Customer

Druck’s customer is one of the largest manufacturers of marine instruments. The Company based in the United States offers products for the measurement of salinity temperature pressure dissolved oxygen and related oceanographic parameters in marine water.

Druck’s Customer’s challenge

Argo is an international program that deploys free floating buoys (floats) to provide real time observations of the world’s oceans. The floats measure both temperature and salinity in the upper 2000 meters (m) of the ocean providing key data for understanding and predicting climate change.

Image

Picture 1: Cross section of a float: photograph argo.ucsd.edu

Each float carries a sensor in order to measure the water’s temperature salinity and pressure (depth).

Druck’s customer required a corrosion resistant low power highly accurate long-term stable pressure sensor to provide reliable pressure readings from the floats.

Long term deployment in marine environments required the sensor and the instrument in which the sensor is housed to be highly resistant to corrosion. It therefore seemed logical to choose titanium as the material selection for the instrument as well as the pressure sensor to avoid a galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals. At a deployment depth of 2000 metres (6561 feet) this requires a 200 bar sensor which is unusually high for a sensor made with titanium.

The longer the floats can be active in service the lower the cost of each data point therefore it was essential for the sensor to work accurately at the required depth for the entire deployment and use as little power as possible to provide depth readings without exhausting the float’s energy store.

Druck’s solution

The Druck team conducted a full analysis of this customer challenge and determined that the standard PDCR1830 could be adapted with a new module designed within the sensor to work at high pressures. This involved working closely with our suppliers to select the best grade of titanium to survive this high-pressure environment.

Picture 2: PDCR1830 Pressure Transducers

The accuracy and low power consumption of the bespoke product supplied by Druck has enabled the Argo float program to supply critical data to governments universities and people who live by the sea.

Druck’s added value

Druck’s high stability low power consumption and robust design of its piezoresistive pressure sensors has enabled the customer to supply reliable long-lasting Argo floats to the measurement program for over 10 years.

The ability to deploy the floats for extended periods considerably lowers the cost of maintaining the them. The more floats that are deployed the more complete the data set and the more accurate the predictions of future trends. The equivalent of the entire UK domestic electricity usage is being used to heat the oceans for the last 30 years. The Argo Float program and the PDCR1830 make it possible for us to know this.

It is undeniable that one of the technologies which has found its way into various industries including the oil and gas sector is nanotechnology. As an interdisciplinary technology nanotechnology has attracted the attention of large oil and gas companies. A look at the current status of these companies indicates that depending on the significance they attach to nanotechnology they have dedicated a remarkable part of their innovations and inventions to this technology.

With the advent of nanotechnology numerous scientists predicted that this technology would penetrate varied areas and become one of the most vital tools to meet technological challenges. In this regard the oil and gas industry would be considered a key industry in the world the developments of which have tangible effects on other sectors.





This report aims to examine patents as one of the important indicators to study the degree of penetration and impact of nanotechnology in the oil and gas sector. To do so the statistics pertaining to nanotechnology patents of several large companies active in the field of oil and gas in the world have been scrutinized. The Forbes and Fortune websites have been used to compile a list of the top oil companies while the Orbit database has been employed to extract patent statistics for these companies. Forbes is a business company offering invaluable information in the fields of economics finance industry and market and Fortune is an American business magazine that works in the area of ranking various companies. The original companies have been used to extract the statistics whereas their subsidiaries which have different names from the main companies have not been examined.





Table 1 presents a list of the 25 largest oil companies with the most patents related to nanotechnology. These patents have been issued or registered in different years by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO). The table also outlines the number of nano patents issued by these companies by USPTO and EPO the number of patents in all fields of science and technology the share of nano patents from all the patents and the country where the companies are located. The entire number of patents issued by these top 25 companies in the field of nanotechnology amounts to about 5005 of which more than 84% have been published in the USPTO and about 16% in the EPO.





Of the 25 companies listed nine are owned by the United States and a total of around 58% of the nano patents issued by these 25 oil and gas companies are held by US companies. Among these companies are Baker Hughes Company and Halliburton which have issued 940 and 731 patents in the area of nanotechnology and are ranked first and third in this regard respectively. The second place belongs to the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) which has had a significant growth in the issuance of patents in the field of nanotechnology in the past few years. Another fact is the presence of three companies from Japan a country which possesses scarce oil and gas resources but has a serious presence in this field having registered 205 nano patents.

Table 1. The world's top oil and gas companies based on the number of patents and patent applications issued in the field of nanotechnology.

Studies reveal that in total the two continents of North America and Asia have the highest number of companies regarding nanotechnology patents in the oil and gas sector followed by Europe and South America. Figure 1 illustrates the share of different continents with regard to the top companies in this field.

Figure 1. Share of different continents with regard to the top companies active in the oil and gas sector in the dissemination of nano patents.

Figure 2 shows the patent release trends for the top 5 companies in this field between 2010 and 2020. One of the highlights of Figure 2 is the significant growth of nanotechnology patents by the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) from 2017 onwards. Between 2010 and 2013 Aramco published less than 10 inventions in the field of nanotechnology every year but in 2014 experiencing a noticeable growth it increased the number of inventions in the field of nanotechnology to over 10. However the most significant growth of this company started from 2017 onwards with the company registering the highest number of patents in the field of nanotechnology among all the top 5 companies in 2018 while it achieved the second position in nano patent issuance by November 2021.





The other top four companies issued similar numbers of patents in the field of nanotechnology in 2010 whereas Baker Hughes Company with an increase in patent numbers in this field in 2012 was able to widen the distance with the other companies taking the first place. In 2020 with the exception of the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) the other four companies faced a decline in patent releases a fact which is also observed in 2021. One of the reasons for this could be the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on the global economy including the oil and gas sector and companies active in this field which has led to a degeneration in research and development in these companies.

Figure 2. Number of patents issued in the field of nanotechnology by the top 5 companies in the oil and gas sector over the last 10 years.

One of the indicators proposed in this research is the ratio of patents in the field of nanotechnology to the total patents published in all fields of science and technology. This indicator shows the role of nanotechnology and its impact on the overall findings of a company. In this regard the highest share of nanotechnology patents in the total number of patents belongs to the Iranian Petroleum Industry Research Institute (RIPI) at 41.94%. Of course this company does not possess a significantly large number of patents with a total of 62 patents in the two offices in the United States and Europe. The second position according to this criterion is held by the Indian Oil Company with a share of 12.90% while SK Innovation ranks third having a share of about 11.37%. Among the companies with an American nationality Baker Hughes Company and Phillips 66 account for the largest share of nano patents with a total of more than 6%.





The Middle East is one of the richest oil and gas fields in the world and the countries in this region are among the most active countries that produce and export oil and gas. A review of the companies and patent registration trends for the countries in the region indicates that only two countries Saudi Arabia and Iran have companies which are among the top 25 oil and gas companies investing in nanotechnology. In recent years Saudi Arabia has expanded its patent-related efforts in the field of nanotechnology with the cooperation of other countries including the United States while taking advantage of international researchers in this field.

On Nov. 19 at approximately 11:33 a.m. police say located in the 2600 block of University Blvd. West in Wheaton and proceeded to the manager’s office where he demanded money displayed a black handgun and fired one round.

The manager went behind the teller counter gathered the money and handed it over to Ramirez who fired another round into a wall before fleeing the scene. Detectives reviewed the surveillance footage of the bank and obtained surveillance photographs of Ramirez.

On Dec. 3 at approximately 9:03 a.m. officers responded to the Capital One Bank located in the 15600 block of Old Columbia Pike in Burtonsville for the report of an armed bank robbery that just occurred.



The investigation by detectives determined that Ramirez entered the bank displayed a black handgun and fired several rounds. Ramirez approached a bank teller and demanded an undisclosed amount of money. The teller collected the money and handed it to Ramirez who then fled the scene.

During the course of the investigation detectives identified Ramirez as a potential suspect and probable cause was developed to charge him with the two armed bank robberies. In the afternoon of Dec. 3 detectives applied for and received an arrest warrant charging Ramirez with armed robbery first-degree assault use of a firearm in the commission of a felony and second-degree assault.

Pettus will retire from his position as vice chairman of First Farmers and Merchants Bank.

Pettus whose career in banking spans nearly five decades will formally leave the post on Dec. 31. He will continue to serve as vice chairman of the company and a member of First Farmers’ Board of Directors until its annual meeting in April 2022 when he will have reached the Company’s mandatory retirement age according to the company.

First Farmers and Merchants Bank is a community bank serving the Middle Tennessee area through 22 offices in seven Middle Tennessee counties. As of Sept. 30 2021 First Farmers reported total assets of approximately $1.9 billion total shareholders’ equity of approximately $162 million and administered trust assets of $6.2 billion.

“It has been an honor to work with Tim Pettus at First Farmers over the past 19 years” said T. Randy Stevens chairman and Chief Executive Officer of First Farmers in a press release. “He has been a friend a leader for our team and a strong advocate for our community. He has also served as a great mentor for our team and has helped prepare the next generation of bankers at First Farmers to serve our customers in the future.”

Pettus has contributed his time to supporting a wide range of civic and educational programs across Middle Tennessee.

He joined First Farmers in 2002 as First Farmers’ Regional President after serving as the Senior Banking Executive in Lawrence County Tennessee for Bank of America. He was named the bank’s president in January 2007 and served in the position for nine years.

“We are very pleased to recognize the contributions of Tim Pettus to First Farmers and wish him continued success following his retirement” Stevens said.

Under his leadership First Farmers experienced solid growth and expansion throughout its markets. He is recognized for building sales culture and spearheading entry into Davidson and Williamson counties while serving as president bank officials said.

He was named vice chairman of the bank and company in January 2016.

Pettus launched his career with Commerce Union Bank in 1973 as a trainee and was promoted to bank officer a year later before rising to executive vice president of Commerce Union prior to its acquisition by Sovran Bank NationsBank and then Bank of America. In 2020 Pettus was named a Leader in Banking Excellence by the Tennessee Bankers Association an honor that recognizes elite bankers who have excelled in the areas of banking community service and civic involvement.

He has served as chairman for five human development/educational foundations served on the board of trustees for Middle Tennessee State University and the Columbia State Foundation and was co-founder of the Lawrence County Education Foundation.

As a native of Lawrence County he held a number of leadership roles including past president of the Lawrence County Chamber of Commerce Lawrence County Grand Jury Foreman for 21 years Chairman of the 21st Century Council for Lawrence County and member of the Lawrence County Economic Development Board. He was named Lawrence County’s “Citizen of the Year” in 1993.

Pettus’ contributions and influence extended beyond the local community with his service as a board member for the Middle Tennessee Council of the Boy Scouts former director of the Tennessee Housing Development Agency past chairman of the HCA Crockett Hospital and the board of the Tennessee Bankers Association.

He also served as president of the Kiwanis Club of Lawrenceburg and taught an adult Sunday School class at Coleman Memorial United Methodist Church.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbmV3cy90ZWxlY29tLWl0YWxpYS1jbG9zZS1jaG9vc2luZy1hZHZpc2Vycy0xMTIwNDQ4NTkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Telecom Italia nearing decision on advisers for KKR deal - sources,"MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia is moving closer to picking banks to advise it on a buyout offer approach from U.S. private equity group KKR and could assign mandates as early as this weekend two sources said on Saturday. A special committee set up to study KKR's non-binding bid approach valued at 33 billion euros ($37 billion) including debt met on Friday and will meet again over the weekend the sources said.

KKR's approach was made public on Nov. 21.

""They could come up with three names by Monday but time's tight and it may drag on a bit longer"" one of the sources said. A wide range of banks are still in the fray for an advisory role in what would be Europe's biggest ever private equity deal. Bank of America Barclays and Intesa Sanpaolo division IMI CIB have emerged as front runners the sources said. The sources also said no decision has yet been taken. TIM IMI Bank of America and Barclays declined to comment. Divisions within Italy's biggest phone group are making it difficult for TIM to respond to KKR's offer after a shareholder row a week ago forced Luigi Gubitosi to step down as CEO. TIM's top shareholder Vivendi is pushing for a full board reshuffle after Gubitosi refused to step down from the board sources said - a move that prevented new general manager Pietro Labriola being named CEO last week.

Labriola could be named as CEO if Gubitosi or another director steps down to make way for him.

Goldman Sachs IMI and Bank of America had been lined up for a possible role in advising TIM before Gubitosi stepped aside as CEO sources previously said.

In an email interview with The New Stack Paterson told me he’s worked at more than one institution using its own flavor of Bank Python — and the “strong similarities” suggest IT workers carried the banner of its basic ideology when they moved from one investment bank to another.

“If you know a certain important function existed at a previous bank in a certain file it probably exists in the same file in your current bank” he said.

His own work history includes writing Python in proprietary in-house environments at JP Morgan (Athena) and Bank of America Merill Lynch (Quartz) as well as a four-month gig as a Python developer at Citibank. (Although Paterson also adds that even within the investment banking industry “some banks have it and some do not.”)

To avoid revealing employer-specific details his blog post just presented a fictional amalgamation of what he’s seen throughout his career. But it still offers a great chance to explore an exotic fork of an entire programming language which is almost completely unknown to the general public.

Underscoring the intrigue in his essay Paterson writes that “foreign systems like foreign countries can be mind-expanding when experienced firsthand.”

No Filesystems Just a Big Database of Objects

The first big surprise: Bank Python doesn’t have access to a filesystem! But it also doesn’t seem to need one since most of what it would operate on already exists in a massive database of objects representing things like trade and market data. These objects represent everything from simple bonds to more complex derivative instruments.

“If some bad news about a company is published and a credit agency downgrades their credit rating then someone in bonds will update the relevant Bond object” Paterson’s essay explained.

And this instantly propagates to any other calculations that include the value of that bond object — just as simple as changing a cell’s value in an Excel spreadsheet automatically causes any formulas using that cell to update its own value. (This also allows the implementation of handy additional features like “time-traveling” through your data to see its values in the past or future.)

An anthropologist might argue this structure holds clues to the culture of investment banks. Interestingly Paterson described this stack in his essay as “heavily influenced by the technological path dependency of the financial sector which is another way of saying: there is a lot of MS Excel.”

Through the years he acknowledged in his essay many have had logical business reasons for a company-wide switch to Kubernetes microservices and a service mesh. But weaning reluctant users off their familiar Microsoft spreadsheet “takes away that basic agency of those Excel users who no longer understand the business process they run and now have to negotiate with ludicrous technology dweebs for each software change.”

He continued “Using simple Python functions in a source-controlled system is a better middle ground than the modern-day equivalent of Java 2 Enterprise Edition.

“Financiers are able to learn Python and while they may never be amazing at it they can contribute to a much higher level and even make their own changes and get them deployed.”

So Bank Python programs first just open a connection to that database of objects — and then away they go. But it’s even crazier than that since even your application’s main source code gets stored in that database where it’s run by a single jobs-processing “runner.”

In his essay Paterson compared it to something like Jenkins or systemd — and note that this setup has several advantages. “It can restart your software if it crashes and sends out alerts if it keeps crashing. It stores logs. It understands dependencies between jobs (much like systemd does) so if the job that generates the data your job needs fails your job doesn’t even try starting up but instead fires more alerts.”

But most importantly it lets you run code in a major security-conscious institution just by creating a very simple initialization file. “This is a big deal because negotiating anything in large bank is an exercise in frustration: lead times on hardware can be measured in months” Paterson wrote. “Getting people to agree with you takes of course much longer than that.”

Customized Python ‘Invented’ In-House

Bank Python implementations also seem to be using their own proprietary data structure for tables offering faster access to medium-sized datasets (while storing them more efficiently in memory).

“Some implementations are lumps of C++ (not atypical of financial software) and some are thin veneers over sqlite3” Paterson said. (His friend Salim Fadhley a London-based developer has even released an (all-Python) version of the table data structure called eztable.)

Paterson concludes that while most programming has a code-first approach Bank Python would be characterized as data-first. While it’s ostensibly object-oriented “you group the data into tables and then the code lives separately.”

Needless to say Bank Python inevitably ends up getting its own internal integrated development environment (IDE) to handle all of its unique configuration quirks and it even has its own unique version-control system for code. Paterson acknowledged the uncharitable assessment that it’s all just a grand exercise in distrusting anything that originated outside the company (known in the programming field as the fearful “Not Invented Here” syndrome).

The biggest downside made be for the developers who work there since every year you spend in your employer’s bespoke monoculture “the skills you need to interact with normal software atrophy.” Just one example: “When everything is in the same repository and all code is just an import away software packaging just does not come up.”

Of course after years of working at banks Paterson also experienced a more personal problem: “existential ennui arising from prolonged exposure to Windows 7 and MS Outlook 2010.”

Developers Share ‘Bank Python’ Tales

Paterson’s blog post captured the interest of developers on social media garnering 546 upvotes in Reddit’s programming forum and another 864 upvotes on Hacker News. “Having worked in an investment bank before this brought some flashbacks” admitted one Hacker News commenter.

“Honestly this sounds a lot less insane than a lot of ‘conventional’ stacks” another reader commented.

regarding the bank python article: I’ve worked on systems which were almost equally “locked in” and had some (seemingly) weird choices inside BUT also amazing creative incredibly useful/usable ideas I’d do again in a heartbeat – sometimes in horrible sometimes in good code. — Su-Shee (@sushee@mastodon.social) (@sheeshee) November 14 2021

But it’s a glimpse into an alternate universe where entire software systems are ultimately home-brewed in-house. One Hacker News comment came from Sean Hunter a former vice president on the Goldman Sachs strategist (or “strats”) team who posted that he’d been the one who’d introduced Python there around 2002 to 2003.

And Hunter shared some more memories with the eFinancialCareers site remembering how over his next nine years at Goldman Sachs they’d even created an ahead-of-its-time DevOps environment deploying code updates with a CI/CD pipeline — written in Perl.

“At that time it was 20 million lines of C++ and 10 million lines of Java and we’d push it out to all our machines worldwide” Hunter said. He believes that at the time there was nothing like it anywhere else in the world.

And there was also a cloud-like internal computing grid where calculations were spread across different servers. (In a later comment Hunter recalled 667 different developers committing in just one two-week cycle.) “Everything we did was top secret and no one outside would ever know about it” he told eFinancial Carers about his time at Goldman Sachs. “Banks build huge amounts of things for specific use cases that don’t exist yet and then the world catches up.”

Respect for ‘Bank Python’ Contributors

Paterson enjoyed Hunter’s comments on Hacker News and said he also heard from people who work outside of the finance industry saying they liked the idea of Bank Python. “I think there are a number of ‘k8s dissidents’ who dislike the direction that making software has gone in.”

He also suggested that today the company Beacon is essentially marketing “a white-label version of Bank Python.”

But underneath his reaction seems to be a true appreciation for all the care and effort that went into building an entire Bank Python ecosystem.

Today Python’s core team has now grown and become more professionalized/less volunteer — but Paterson estimates that in 2010 a large bank that forked the Python ecosystem (including the interpreter) could’ve ultimately been deploying more manhours than Python’s original smaller all-volunteer core team.

In our interview Paterson described the system as “brilliant” and told me he wished he could still use it.

Ally Financial Inc. closed on its acquisition of Fair Square Financial a digital-first credit card company based in downtown Wilmington.

Ally had earlier disclosed the pending deal valued valued at $750 million

“The addition of Fair Square and its credit card offerings will enhance our suite of consumer products and aligns with our long-term strategy to be the leading full-service digital bank” said Ally CEO Jeffrey J. Brown.

Fair Square is a digital-first credit card company generating strong growth and solid credit results since being founded in 2016 by veterans of the credit card industry.

“Fair Square was built on the premise of providing fair and transparent credit card offerings” said Fair Square CEO Rob Habgood. “We are excited to continue delivering compelling products with growing momentum as we join the Ally team.”

Habgood is a banking veteran who held positions at Capital One and Bank of America. Prior to its sale Fair Square attracted investors that included the former CEO of Citi.

The Fair Square team brings 86 employees to Ally along with about 693000 cardholders and $816 million in loan balances.

Fair Square offers the Olio card for individuals in the subprime market who may have difficulty in getting a credit card. The company uses analytics and other technology to determine credit-worthiness.

The company has been viewed as a rising star in Delaware’s fintech industry that continues to attract new and existing players.

Ally based in Detroit was spun off from automaker GM and includes an online bank auto finance and insurance operations.

Ally has positioned itself as a consumer-friendly online bank with no overdraft fees.

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vc3BvcnQvcnVnYnktdW5pb24vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY3cwdmxlMW41cnJv0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9ydWdieS11bmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy9jdzB2bGUxbjVycm8uYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Premiership: Newcastle Falcons 17-28 Bath,"It was a fast start by Bath who went over for the first time inside five minutes. Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

In truth Bath's discipline gave Newcastle hope of a comeback as the latter stages were littered with penalties but they managed to hold on for the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDI0LTA1LTA5L2Zvcm1lci1iZWQtYmF0aC1zdWVzLWh1ZHNvbi1iYXktZm9yLTMwMC1taWxsaW9uLXRyYWRpbmctZ2FpbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Bed Bath & Beyond Sues Hudson Bay for $300 Million in Trading Profits,"The former Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. seeking to generate cash for its creditors sued to recover more than $300 million in trading profits from Hudson Bay Capital Management the hedge fund at the center of a last-ditch financing plan that failed to prevent the retailer’s collapse.

Hedge fund Alden Global Capital is attempting to acquire Davenport-based Lee Enterprises one of the country's largest newspaper chains in all the markings of a hostile takeover.

Since Alden's unsolicited offer on Nov. 22 Lee has taken steps to thwart the acquisition and Alden has countered with moves to install its preferred members on Lee's board of directors.

Media experts journalists and some lawmakers have expressed concerns about the deal especially because Alden has been known to slash newsrooms well beyond the downsizing that's already happened across the industry.

At stake is the future of community journalism in cities across the nation.

We spoke with experts in mergers and acquisitions economics and journalism about what happens next.

Who are the players?

Lee Enterprises provides local news and information and is an advertising platform in print and digitally in 77 markets in 26 states. In 2020 it acquired Berkshire Hathaway Group's newspapers for $140 million doubling its size.

Based on total circulation Lee is now the third-largest owner of newspapers in the United States with major holdings in St. Louis Buffalo N.Y. Omaha Madison Wisc. and Tucson Ariz. It also owns 10 newspapers in Iowa including the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier Quad-City Times and Sioux City Journal and has a sharing a news-sharing arrangement with The Gazette.

Lee stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Alden is according to its website a New York City-based investment firm. The hedge fund was founded in 2007 and through acquisitions has become the second-largest owner of newspapers in the United States behind Gannett. Its major newspaper holdings include the Chicago Tribune The Denver Post the St. Paul Pioneer Press and the Boston Herald. It is privately held.

What's in the offer?

On Nov. 22 Alden offered $24 per share for Lee or about $141 million in cash on a day when the stock was trading at about $18 a share. Lee stock closed at $25.11 on Friday.

Alden has a track record of scooping up local newspapers and that's part of a larger pattern of hedge funds buying local media outlets said Rick Edmonds media business analyst for the Poynter Institute for Media Studies a not-for-profit media research group.

Edmonds said hedge funds find media companies attractive because they are relatively cheap to buy and have upside profit potential through the sale of the newspapers' real estate.

“They think they can make a profit both by consolidation so sort of spreading costs over large groups and papers” Edmonds said. “But they’re all — and this particularly true of Alden — specialists or sub-specialists in selling real estate and getting maximum value for real estate.”

Alden owns 6 percent of Lee’s stock already and because it's making a cash offer — something it couldn't do when it purchased the Chicago Tribune — it says it could close a deal in four weeks if Lee accepts.

Alden asserts under its ownership Lee papers “would be in a stronger position to maximize its resources and realize strategic value that enhances its operations and supports its employees in their important work serving local communities.”

Lee said in a news release that “in consultation with its financial and legal advisers Lee’s board of directors will carefully review Alden’s proposal.”

Although unsolicited acquisition offers are common they can be less successful than mergers which are negotiated more privately between company managements according to Manjot Bhussar a professor specializing in acquisitions at Iowa State University.

“It's more common for them to look at some of the target companies that they think are undervalued” Bhussar said.

“Then they plan to acquire them and extract more value for them which will benefit their own shareholders.”

Robert Miller chairman of corporate finance and law at University of Iowa said publicly announcing the offer signified Alden was “going hostile.”

“Going public begins to put significant pressure on the target board because almost always the offer as here was a lot more than the stock price when the market was made” Miller said.

“You have a lot of shareholders who are saying ‘Gee our shares are trading at 18. This guy wants to buy it for 24. That looks good to me.’ That puts a lot of pressure on the board to come to terms with the acquisition.”

What's Lee's strategy?

Lee Enterprises’ board of directors implemented a so-called “poison pill” on Nov. 24 to temporarily guard against a hostile takeover.

Lee Chairwoman Mary Junck in a statement said the plan gives the board and shareholders time to consider Alden’s proposal “without undue pressure while also safeguarding shareholders’ opportunity to realize the long-term value of their investment.”

The poison pill prevents Alden from going directly to Lee shareholders to make a tender offer -- an offer to shareholders to buy out the remaining shares often in excess of the market price.

The poison pill will kick in if Alden gets control of 10 percent or more of Lee’s stock in the next year. At that point other shareholders could buy shares at a 50 percent discount or get free shares for every share they already own.

By flooding the market with additional shares the stock price is diluted making it more expensive for Alden to acquire a controlling stake.

The poison pill expires Nov. 23 2022. But the board can vote to end it at any time and proceed with the acquisition especially if Alden makes a higher offer.

What is Alden's strategy?

In response to Lee's poison pill on Nov. 26 Alden nominated three candidates to join Lee Enterprises’ board.

“I think that is more targeted toward forcing the board to accept their offer and abandon this poison pill” Bhussar said.

After a review Lee's board ruled Alden is not entitled to nominate board candidates for the 2022 annual meeting according to a statement from Lee. Company officials said Alden attempted to circumvent its bylaws by having a third-party shareholder send a cover letter and ""an incomplete and internally inconsistent nomination notice.""

Alden could implement a proxy contest enabling it to send independent information about nominees to Lee’s shareholders. But that would be far more costly for them the experts said.

Three of eight seats are up for election this year. If Alden gains all three seats Lee still has majority control of the board making it unlikely the poison pill will be repealed Miller said.

The shareholders vote on board members at the 2022 annual meeting. No date has been set but it's typically held in late February.

Investigation into the board

On Nov. 30 Kaskela Law announced a stockholder investigation into Lee’s board saying it wants to determine if board members “breached their fiduciary duties” to shareholders through their response to Alden’s offer.

Bhussar said the main job of board members is to protect shareholder wealth and provide guidance to the company's leadership so they meet strategic goals.

“They're bargaining with these people” Miller said regarding the poison pill.

What would an acquisition mean for Lee?

Alden has the reputation of significantly cutting costs in the newsrooms it acquires including selling real estate and offering buyouts or laying off a percentage of staff.

The newspaper business has been consolidating for years as it struggles with shrinking revenues and the transition from print to digital. Newsroom jobs dropped nearly in half from 2004 to 2018 according to Pew Research and the pandemic has exacerbated those stresses.

That's led financial firms to take a prominent role as owners — Alden has expanded its newspaper holdings and Gannett was purchased by New Media Investment Group which is managed by investment firm Fortress Investment Group.

Edmonds said when Alden acquired the Chicago Tribune substantial newsroom cuts immediately were executed to increase cost savings.

Experienced columnists and journalists took buyouts retired or resigned which compromised the quality of the paper he said.

“Some beats don't get covered or don't get covered as well” Edmonds said. “They tend to pull back into the center of a city. Maybe they used to cover a band of suburbs or sort of an outline place where residents of the metropolitan area live and they do less and less and less.”

The unions representing 12 Lee newsrooms also expressed concern about Alden.

Alden has ""... fostered unhealthy and untenable workplaces that make it impossible to retain talent” the unions wrote in a letter to Lee's board. “They’ve shuttered physical newsrooms to leave journalists working from their cars and at properties they lease Alden stiffs local landlords for rent ... . There is optimism in our future with a company we’re building together. A future under Alden has only despair.”

Alden said in a news release that its “interest in Lee is a reaffirmation of our substantial commitment to the newspaper industry and our desire to support local newspapers over the long term.”

The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Others in the journalism business and government sectors have expressed concerns that an acquisition might hurt local news coverage. But in the end public opinion doesn’t make much of a difference Edmonds said.

“Broadly speaking the hedge funds unlike most companies or anybody else really don't care about public opinion” Edmonds said ""and they don't care whether people love them or hate them.""

But he doesn't just have to do it once. Miller films himself over an entire night and day with the goal of pulling 500 pounds every hour on the hour totaling 24 deadlifts in 24 hours.

""I am going to be using straps mainly because I don't want to risk blowing out a bicep or blowing out my thumb if I'm hook gripping and I don't like not using straps when I deadlift"" he says. He also adds that he will be taking ""mini-naps"" in between each lift and that he is curious to see whether this disrupted sleep pattern will have any kind of impact on his performance in the lifts.

Miller starts out with his first lift in the gym at 6 p.m. and manages it with relative ease. Then after the 7 p.m. lift he packs up his weights in order to do the next couple of lifts at home so that he can spend some time with his family before then returning to the gym for alternating lifts and catnaps. In order to stay mobile and aid his recovery between lifts Miller does reverse hypers split squats and uses a massage gun on his hamstrings.

By the time the sun is up again and he's doing his morning lifts Miller is feeling exhausted due to the lack of sleep. ""I didn't think it was going to be this hard"" he says. ""The hardest so far outside of the horrible fatigue is my hands. Even using straps my hands are killing me... My hands hurt my soul hurts my back hurts my hamstrings are really sore.""

The 4150-square-foot home sits on a 6600-square-foot lot and boasts an unobstructed sightline of the ocean on one side.

The property was bought by Matthew McDevitt president of Berwyn-based Warren Avenue Investors and a former BioMed Realty Trust executive.

The six-bedroom six-and-a-half-bathroom home was built in 2019. It spans three floors enabling its kitchen living room dining room and primary suite to overlook the ocean.

The price that Avalon-based homebuilder Thomas Welsh Builders got for the property is unusual for the shore point. Homes there generally top out at $10 million.

“The oceanfronts being over 10 is kind of a big spike” said the listing agent Jack Vizzard of the Jack Vizzard Group with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Fox & Roach.

This sky-high sales price is attributed to the feverish home demand in Avalon that started during the pandemic and has yet to subside.

Last month dozens of ski-mask wearing thieves swarmed a Nordstrom in tony Walnut Creek Calif. They blocked road access with their cars before proceeding to smash display cases and take whatever they could off of the racks then escaped to awaiting getaway cars all in matter of minutes. It was hardly an isolated occurrence for the upscale retailer: smaller scale organized ‘flash mob’ robberies hit two Nordstrom stores in the Los Angeles area a few days later. These came soon after similar thefts last month at Louis Vuitton Burberry and Bloomingdale’s stores in San Francisco’s upscale Union Square. Lululemon Athletica and Ulta Beauty have also been targeted by these groups while Walgreens has closed five stores in San Francisco because of the problem.

The incidents continued over the holiday weekend: Best Buy found itself in the crosshairs of ‘flash mobs’ at three stores in suburban Minneapolis over the Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday weekend the busiest of the year for retailers. The problem has led retail industry leaders to sound the alarm noting the threat to attracting and retaining the workers they desperately need to staff stores adequately as well as the feeling of safety essential to keep shoppers coming.

But the problem is not likely to go anyway anytime soon. The robberies are a tactic of well-established organized crime syndicates looking to replenish inventory of ‘hot’ goods they can sell on resale sites during the holiday season shopping rush.

“The people you see running out of the stores with their merchandise are actually people who are recruited by the criminal organizations profiting from this” said Ben Dugan president of the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail a trade group focused on fighting crimes committed at retailers. “There are tiers to it from soldiers to captains to crew leaders — the whole deal.” Just like the mob he added. The groups he leads has estimated that organized retail crime is responsible for around $45 billion in annual losses 50% more than a decade ago.

The crime syndicates typically recruit locally paying participants about $300 to $500 each in the case of the Nordstrom attack Dugan estimates. They might even provide them with the getaway cars. And reflecting the gravity of these crimes the ‘retail mob’ robberies are typically treated as felony crimes since they are planned events and involve the resale of stolen goods moving across state lines. In contrast someone independently shoplifting a tube of toothpaste for personal use is committing a misdemeanor.

And like everything else these days product shortages are playing a role in exacerbating the spate of retail flash mobs Dugan said. “I don’t think there’s any mistake that that happened before Black Friday and before Cyber Monday” he said. “I mean the criminal organizations that control the online markets needed product. And there’s a supply chain crisis right?”

A new source of worker anxiety

The problem has caught the attention of political leaders particularly on the West Coast where the attacks have been more concentrated and more brazen. “They’re not just stealing people’s products and impacting their livelihoods they’re stealing a sense of place and confidence” California Governor Gavin Newsom said while announcing an increase in funding to law enforcement to fight organized retail crime.

That sense of place and confidence is key to retailers in protecting stores which are increasingly important to supporting their e-commerce as they compete with Amazon. Target for instance relied on its stores for 95% of sales last quarter when including their roles in filling online orders be it a customer coming in to pick the order up or the store mailing an item to the customers.

“These mobs attacking stores suggest to people ‘I’m not going there.’ And if they were predisposed to shop online only this is a hell of a motivation to do that” said Columbia Business School retail professor Mark Cohen.

Retailers aren’t sitting idly by for the problem to go away. Target declined to quantify the potential hit to its business from organized theft or detail how it combats the problem but a spokesman told Fortune that “our security teams in every store are trained to maintain a safe shopping environment and protect against theft” and is in regular contact with law enforcement “on an ongoing basis to address organized retail crime.”

At Nordstrom a spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement that “we’re heightening our in-store security presence and implementing additional protective measures to keep everyone safe.” Best Buy’s Barry said last week that the retailer might put more items under lock much as drugstore giants CVS pharmacy and Walgreens do with items like razor blades. Columbia Business School’s Cohen however cautions retailers against turning their stores into fortresses or adding too many new hassles to shoppers who could easily shop online.

For CEO’s like Barry one of the biggest worries in this crisis has to do with attracting and keeping top retail talent. The attacks on the Best Buy stores sometimes involved people entering the stores armed with crowbars and guns Barry told reporters last week. That has frightened many workers who already had to deal with mask-adverse customers and the fear of being exposed to coronavirus. It’s all making it even harder for retailers to find and keep good workers amidst the great resignation and labor shortage.

“When we talk about why there are so many people looking for other jobs or switching careers this of course would be something that would play into my concerns for our people” Barry told reporters.

Best Buy has been just one of many large retailers in the last year to raise minimum wages in the war for front-line talent. (Macy’s last month raised its own lowest wage and sweetened the pot by promising employees it would help with college tuition and student debt.

“This has got to bring fear to both customers and store associates who basically don’t want to be in a position where they’re at risk for 15 bucks an hour” said Cohen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvaG9tZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2Jvc2Utc291bmRsaW5rLWZsZXgtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bose SoundLink Flex: Our Honest Review,"8.6 / 10

SCORE Bose SoundLink Flex $119 at Amazon $120 at Best Buy $168 at Bose Pros Delivers impressive sound for its compact size

Can be propped up horizontally laid down flat or hung vertically by its integrated loop

Fully waterproof and dust-proof (and also floats)

Up to 12 hours of battery life

Speakerphone Cons No audio input

Silicone finish on back attracts some dust and lint

Uses Bluetooth 4.2 instead of 5.1

Editor's note Dec. 4: The Bose SoundLink Flex now has a CNET Editors' Choice Award. The original review published Nov. 11 follows.

When it launched Bose made some bold claims about the sound quality of the SoundLink Flex particularly its bass performance. The exact quote was that it has ""astonishing bass ... that you can feel in your chest."" There's a bit of marketing hyperbole going on there but I gotta say it mostly lives up to the hype. For its size the Flex packs surprisingly bold sound is fully waterproof and should be near the top of your list if you're looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker. In fact it's the only new Bluetooth speaker we've given a CNET Editors' Choice Award in 2021.

Available in three color options -- black white smoke and stone blue -- the Flex is IP67 dust- and waterproof. It also floats an important feature if you're in the habit of dropping your Bluetooth speakers in your pool or another body of water. I personally wouldn't want to drop it anywhere but Bose says that thanks to its soft silicone back and powder-coated steel grille it ""won't peel or flake and is resistant to corrosion and UV light."" So it's designed to be durable and can survive small drops.

That silicone finish is indeed soft to the touch but I'll note that it does attract a bit of dust and lint that shows more on the black version. I liked the speaker in blue but the white one was a close second. There are buttons on top for controlling playback which is always good to have although most people will just use their phone as a remote to play music. One thing that's missing is an audio input so you can't connect an audio device via an auxiliary cable. This is strictly a Bluetooth speaker.

Bose's SoundLink Micro released in late 2017 and due for an upgrade also delivers impressive sound for its tiny size. The Flex does look and feel like it's in the same family but is basically twice as big weighing 1.3 pounds or 0.59 kg -- and it sounds significantly better than the Micro with better battery life. With the price for the Micro rising to $119 the Flex is clearly the better value at this point for only $30 more.

The Flex uses the older Bluetooth 4.2 instead of 5.1 which seems unusual given that most new Bluetooth speakers use Bluetooth 5.1. Bose told us it didn't see a significant benefit for its customers to going from Bluetooth 4.2 to Bluetooth 5.1 because the enhancements had ""no bearing on the A2DP performance of the Flex"" (since there was no change in the spec for A2DP audio in 5.1). And given that limited benefit of upgrading to 5.1 the company made the decision to use a chip it had previously used in the SoundLink Micro that had been ""thoroughly field-tested and updated over time for interoperability and reliability.""

I didn't have any problems with connectivity -- it was generally rock-solid -- but for those looking for extended wireless range this is only listed as having the standard Bluetooth range of 30 feet or 10 meters. Battery life is rated at 12 hours at moderate volume levels which is pretty good. It's basically got twice the battery life of the SoundLink Micro and charges via USB-C instead of Micro-USB.

Multipositional

The speaker is designed to be propped up horizontally laid down flat or hung vertically by its integrated loop. Bose shows it in pictures with a carabiner attached to the loop but no carabiner is included you have to supply your own. But it's good that there is a loop and it does seem pretty sturdy.

The speaker's sound is automatically optimized according to the position you have it. I tended to keep it upright but it does have a built-in microphone so you might lay it down flat if you're using it as a speakerphone with a few people sitting around it. It's pretty good at picking up your voice and puts out a lot more sound than your phone's tiny speakers.

The sound automatically is optimized for the orientation of the speaker. David Carnoy/CNET

Bose says the SoundLink Flex can fill a living room with sound. From my tests I'd say it would have to be a relatively small living room -- it can only output so much sound -- and to be clear this is a mono speaker. But the key is that it does manage to produce more bass than you think it can. Also it avoids distorting at higher volumes and delivers good clarity in the treble and midrange with overall well-balanced sound that's only slightly bass forward.

You're going to be immediately impressed by how much sound it throws off and decent sound at that. But it can't totally escape being a small speaker. The soundstage only gets so wide and it can sound a little constrained with more complicated music tracks that have a lot of instruments playing at the same time. To avoid distortion certain frequencies get ratcheted back particularly at higher volumes.

Sound comparisons

I compared the SoundLink Flex with several other compact portable speakers. The one that it seems to get compared to the most is the JBL Charge 5 which costs $180 and is also fully waterproof with an IP67 rating. The Charge 5 is a bit bulkier and puts out a little more sound. Its bass is bigger but arguably boomier and more forward so the mids where vocals live can sound a little recessed. The Bose has a better overall tonal balance and the bass has more definition. I preferred its sound overall. Both speakers lack EQ settings in their apps so you have to go with their signature sound. That's fine by me but a lot of people like having some sort of EQ settings to play around with.

I thought it compared pretty favorably with the $179 Sonos Roam which is also an excellent wireless speaker that has Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth and connects to your Sonos system at home. The Bose is more straightforward to use because it's Bluetooth-only.

The Bose's sound also has more body and depth to it than that of the UE Wonderboom 2 an older model that costs $100 and also manages to deliver good sound for its compact size. I also like Bang & Olufsen's Beosound A1 2nd generation. The Bose beats that more expensive model as well offering more full-bodied sound. But the A1 does offer multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can pair it simultaneously with your phone and a computer. The Flex does not appear to have that feature although you can pair it with multiple devices and manually switch back and forth between them.

Some people have asked me how it sounds compared with Bose's canister-style Revolve ($219) which was marginally updated last year. That model is a bit more expensive and produces a bit more sound but it doesn't really sound any better and I prefer the Flex's design. The larger Revolve Plus ($329) has the Flex beat but that speaker costs more than twice as much -- you could buy two Flexes for the same price. And that might not be a bad idea.

That's because while the speaker sounds good as a single speaker you get a big increase in sound quality when you pair two Flexes together in stereo mode. I felt the same way about the Sonos Roam. You just get real stereo separation and both the soundstage and bass seem so much bigger. As a pair they sound like real speakers and indeed can fill a decent-size living room with sound. I should also note that you can link up the Flex with other Bose speakers in party mode -- in other words you can mix and match -- but to get stereo you'll need another Flex.

Bose SoundLink Flex final thoughts

I'll finish by saying that pricing for Bluetooth speakers has been a little weird these days with all the supply chain issues and chip shortages. And by weird I mean that prices only seem to be going up and not much is on sale. So even though $150 might sound like a lot to some people it's a decent price for a top Bluetooth speaker these days and quite reasonable for Bose. As I said at the beginning if you're looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker the Bose SoundLink Flex should definitely be on your radar if not at the top of your list.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9wb2tlbW9uLWNhcmRzLWJ1eS1zZWxsLXByb2ZpdC0xNjU1Mzcx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where To Buy Pokémon Cards—And Sell Them for a Neat Profit,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/pokemon-cards-buy-sell-profit-1655371 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9wb2tlbW9uLWNhcmRzLWJ1eS1zZWxsLXByb2ZpdC0xNjU1Mzcx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8yNS1iZXN0LWNpdGllcy1idXktaG9tZS0xNzAwMDEwMjMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 25 Best Cities To Buy a Home for Less Than $500K,"Konstantin L / Shutterstock.com

More From GOBankingRates

Methodology: In order to find the best cities to buy a home for under $500000 GOBankingRates looked at the 101 most populous cities where home values in 2021 did not go above $50000 and had a 2021 average below $500000 according to Zillow’s 2021 data. Once these 101 cities were identified GOBankingRates looked at the following factors: (1) median household income as sourced from the United States Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey; (2) an overall livability score out of 100 sourced from AreaVibes; (3) violent crime rate per 1000 residents and (4) property crime rate per 1000 residents both sourced from Neighborhood Scout; (5) Metropolitan Statistical Area unemployment rate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ preliminary data for September 2021; (6) percent of population living below the poverty line sourced from the United States Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey; and (7) an annual cost of living expenditures estimate (groceries healthcare utilities and transportation) based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2020 Consumer Expenditure Survey and local cost of living indices sourced from Sperling’s Best Places. All factors were then scored and combined with the lower score being best and then ranked to give the final placements. All data was collected on and up to date as of Nov. 22 2021.

You can see the full interview below.

“It’s been really special” Gareth said previously. “We’re just trying to encourage kids to put two hands on the ball and have fun.

“It’s the best response we’ve ever received on anything we’ve done.”

The programme started out with a pilot programme which you can see and hear more about below.

The club had ongoing help and support from Leinster Rugby and Dublin South County Council along the way.

IRFU Disability & Inclusion Officer David McKay says “It’s great to see the continued development of the tag and mixed ability sections within our clubs.”

“The growth in Leinster over the last few years in particular has been really positive. Clondalkin will be the 38th club in Ireland to have established a disability offering.

“IRFU have completed our mapping exercise which highlights areas where we would like teams to established. We have also developed guidance & how-to guides for clubs that want to get involved in disability rugby.”

“We are not asking every club to have a disability section” says McKay “but my role is to support those who are interested making sure they have received IRFU disability awareness training and help them establish sustainable clubs so that all children and adults can access rugby.”

Cork dad Colm Crowley had the pleasure of decorating his home in Glanmire during the second-last weekend of November.

He was of course spoilt for choice when it came to selecting this year’s star of the show as his business Cork Pot Grown Christmas Trees is located just six kilometres away in Blackrock.

YEAR-ROUND YULE

So is it fun or faff for those in the year-round Yule business? “We love Christmas in our home” says Colm firmly.

“My wife Jacqui our kids Kate and Ethan and even our dog Beauty is getting into the Christmas spirit.”

Intriguingly the festive season is the culmination of an incredibly busy 12 months for Colm.

The festive look at the Crowley home this year.

The Blackrock native based in Glanmire for the past 15 years has notched 24 years now as a Christmas tree trader.

“And when I’m not selling trees I’m a postman with An Post — I’ve worked as a postman for 22 years” he adds.

“I am passionate about Christmas trees and that’s why I set up Cork Pot Grown Christmas Trees this year.

“We sell living Christmas trees in pots and customers can even rent one too and rent the exact same Christmas tree again next Christmas.”

SUSTAINABLE

What’s special about these trees?

“Using Christmas trees in pots is a very sustainable way to celebrate Christmas because so long as the Christmas tree is alive it continues to suck up harmful carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and provide oxygen at the same time” says Colm.

“Our online shop www.christmastree.ie went live in early October and we have seen a large influx of orders from customers looking to rent a real tree.”

Can Colm share his top professional tips?

CARING FOR YOUR TREE

“I recommend always using a water-stand for cut trees. I swear by them.

“Because it’s so manic in our house that time of year we put up our tree early.

“Always take a small slice off the end of the tree around a half-inch or so otherwise the tree won’t absorb water.

""And add some sugar or 7 Up — it helps with the uptake of water trust me.

Colm Crowley with one of his pot-grown trees.

""With the pot-grown trees keep them away from direct heat and don’t have them indoors for more than three weeks.

""They are dormant at the moment; you don’t want them to wake up thinking it’s spring!”

TREE-TIME

Interest has also been keen since Colm's shop opened on November 20 at the Blackrock Hurling Club.

Some people “live” Christmas all year round but I’m curious as to whether this is the case for someone who makes their living from the season.

“My family say it’s like Christmas every day in our house especially during the summer when it’s the busiest time (apart from December that is) tagging trees and feeding and weeding them” says Colm.

“I try to keep trees away from the house in January but that doesn’t stop me from talking about them nonstop though!”

SPARKLE

Maybe it’s the uncertain times we live in but decorations are sparkling in the living room limelight ever-earlier these last couple of years. “People are definitely celebrating Christmas earlier and earlier” says Colm.

“Last year people bought trees very early. I think they just wanted a day out and a release after the lockdown.

“I think if it brings a bit of hope and happiness to people then celebrating a few weeks earlier is no harm and a week extra in January too is no harm either.

It’s dark early so having lights on longer can only be a good thing.

Christmas cruises are also a key to the season of goodwill for Colm.

“One of my highlights over Christmas is driving around the city at night-time especially up in the northside of the city and admiring the effort some families put into decorating their homes” says Colm."

Mr. James who is currently serving as Blackstone’s executive vice chairman will retire in January after a nearly 20-year career there firm officials said.

He joined Blackstone in 2002 in the role of president and chief operating officer helping co-founder and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman shape the business into a dominant financial company whose market capitalization at $169 billion now exceeds that of Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Mr. James 70 years old oversaw the firm’s 2007 initial public offering and led the acquisitions of GSO the foundation of Blackstone’s giant credit arm and its $45 billion secondaries-investment business Strategic Partners.

He also helped create Blackstone’s Tactical Opportunities business which makes investments that don’t fit neatly into a private-equity or credit bucket.

“We would not have gotten as far as we have nor would Blackstone be the firm that it is today without his talent commitment and managerial strength"" Mr. Schwarzman said in a memo Thursday to Blackstone employees that was seen by The Wall Street Journal.

A well-known supporter of Democratic candidates Mr. James has served as a counterweight to Mr. Schwarzman a prominent Republican known for his support of former President Donald Trump.

Before joining Blackstone Mr. James worked for 25 years at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette helping orchestrate the sale of the investment bank to what is now Credit Suisse Group AG in 2000. At the time DLJ’s private-equity business was bigger than Blackstone’s and Mr. James thought he could help Blackstone catch up while also cultivating its fledgling real-estate credit and hedge-fund businesses.

He says he realized early on that success would depend on a combination of careful planning and nimbleness.

“You can’t plan years ahead because markets change so radically so what you need to do is set up the business to be ready to seize the opportunity when it comes"" Mr. James told the Journal.

In 2018 Mr. James ceded the president and COO roles to Jonathan Gray after grooming Mr. Gray for years. Mr. Gray is now seen as the heir apparent to Mr. Schwarzman.

“One of my proudest things about Blackstone is the smoothness of the transition"" Mr. James said.

He said he now plans to devote his time to charitable activities including an organization he established to support students from historically Black colleges and universities.

He is co-chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and chairman of the finance committee at Mount Sinai Hospital System. Mr. James also serves as chairman of Costco Wholesale Corp.

Governmental officials are tackling this issue by increasing rent-control efforts nationwide. This goal will impact the number of private equity landlords operating in Spain and address Spain’s housing crisis.

What are Private Equity Companies and Landlords?

Private equity companies more commonly referred to as private equity firms (PEFs) are designed strictly for investment management. PEFs are companies investing in other companies. PEFs strictly buy and sell stocks in private companies on other private corporations’ behalfs to generate income and revenue from the sales of stocks. PEF investments are not made in the public market but rather in private firms to potentially increase the amount of money made as a return on investment.

Private equity landlords are corporate landlords that PEFs invest in. This places additional pressure on landlords to make a profit and increase returns for PEFs. Therefore on top of the money earned in rental prices and the fees incurred through home management as part of rentals there is a cycle of continuously increasing rents to make more money for PEFs.

Housing Crisis in Spain

Spain’s housing crisis has been an issue since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The changes it has undergone include drastic rent hikes and lack of home availability in certain regions. The main reason is that many did not feel safe living in congested cities and have attempted to vacate the cities and buy or find home rentals elsewhere.

Spanish citizens have struggled to find affordable housing in a nation with 21% of the population at risk of poverty as of 2020. Furthermore roughly 7% of Spanish families live in severe poverty according to El Pais.

To top everything off the hike in rental prices averages 50% over five years. However prices exceeded a 60% jump between 2014-2017 in Madrid and Barcelona. Comparatively wages in Spain have increased by 1.6% on average. This is driving income inequality and presenting challenges in affording and maintaining rental housing. Housing in Spain has become a burden for many due to the influence of private equity companies on rental prices.

During the pandemic with the lack of growth in wages nationwide and increased hikes in rental costs Spanish law mandated that no evictions could take place. Nevertheless in some areas such as Ciutat Mediriana evictions continued. Spain’s housing crisis left people on the street with no way to access affordable housing.

Private Equity Landlords in Spain

Blackstone a PEF based in the United States has investments in 30000 homes across Spain. Blackstone opened housing rental investment opportunities in Spain in 2013. It has not slowed its increases in Spanish housing rental prices since. The return on investments for Blackstone in Spain hit all-time highs for the PEF as it has increased rent prices year after year. The significant returns for Blackstone due to the increased rent prices are costing individuals more than 30% of their income.

Spain’s housing crisis does not have an overnight solution. However the bill that Spain’s left-leaning officials proposed could fix the problem to some extent. According to Euronews if Spain implements the bill it will place rental price caps on any rental company with more than 10 rental homes effectively strengthening rent control.

About Rent Control

Rent control boosts the economy because it diversifies investments in the public and private sectors. Spain’s housing crisis leaves little opportunity for spending money outside of rental affordability. This leaves other economic sectors falling behind and losing strength over time.

Rent control helps individuals living in lower-income situations keep their housing for longer and more secure periods of time. Landlords are also guaranteed filled buildings when rent prices do not increase and overburden their tenants. Rent control reduces homelessness and evictions consequently keeping people in their homes and effectively reducing poverty rates.

The bill that the Spanish government proposed to cap rent price increases also benefits the landlords through reduced taxation giving them the incentive to support the rental caps. This bill could mean diversification of businesses and enhanced opportunities for localized businesses or landlords to combat the PEFs and boost the local economy.

The PEFs in Spain drove rental prices beyond easy affordability for many. Spain’s housing crisis is out of control as a result. This bill could reduce homelessness and poverty. It could boost the economy through localized diversification of business and investments and give Spanish citizens chances to find new homes.

The frontman of soul supergroup Chic invited the culture committee to his Hampton Court Palace gig in August where renditions of Le Freak and Everybody Dance played out among the grounds of Henry the VIII’s former home.

For Rogers it marked a reunion with the group spearheaded by chairman Julian Knight having appeared in front of them last December to express his concerns about the “unfair system” existing between musicians and streaming services.

Among those mingling with the politicians during the performance was Merck Mercuriadis - the former manager of Morrissey Beyoncé and Elton John turned music investment deal-maker who has helped orchestrate an industry revolution.

Since listing in London three years ago Rodgers and Mercuriadis’ song management company Hipgnosis has spent around £1.5bn on the song books of rock and pop legends eager to cash in on the enduring value of their hits amid a sharp growth in music streaming.

Mercuriadis’ Rolodex of artists and music executives has paved the way for deals with the Red Hot Chili Peppers Neil Young Shakira Bon Jovi and Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac handing the business a valuation of £1.6bn and him accreditation as the frontman of a music investment boom that prompted legends to part with their back catalogues.

Investors hungry for returns amid low-interest rates have encouraged him to keep the music playing by sending shares up to a record 130.4p last month - a 25pc rise on its market debut in 2018.

Didi Chuxing a $39 billion company that is China’s answer to Uber said on Friday that it would delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange. Just six months ago Didi was a Wall Street darling raising billions of dollars from American pension funds and international investors in a splashy New York initial public offering.

Those sorts of deals once fueled a three-decade relationship that helped reshape the global political and financial landscape. China generated heaps of money for Wall Street by hiring banks to manage deals like I.P.O.s. In return Wall Street gave China access to the halls of global finance and political power especially when it came to introductions in Washington.

Didi’s abrupt decision to leave brings home a stark truth for Wall Street: China doesn’t need it anymore. The world’s No. 2 economy has plenty of its own money and few problems attracting more from elsewhere. China’s friends on Wall Street have lost their sway in Washington at a time when mistrust of Beijing’s intentions is running high. And China’s leaders would rather keep tight control of its companies than open them up to investors on American markets.

Now Wall Street has become the latest area in which leaders on both sides are trying to weaken the extensive and complicated ties between the world’s two largest economies. And just as the alliance of China and Wall Street helped shape business in the past the way the two sides disentangle those ties could reshape its future."

Now a few months later we’ve come full circle as this yoke and throttle are now sitting in my office.

Hello everyone Patrick here and today I will be reviewing the TCA Yoke Pack Boeing Edition compatible with PC and Xbox. Thrustmaster also threw in an additional throttle quadrant allowing us to get the full experience using two together. Before we get started I think it’s important you know my background. I am not a licensed pilot. In fact the only aircraft I’ve flown in the real world was a stick based SGS 2-33 glider. But I have tried and owned just about every yoke on the market today. From CH to Saitek/Logitech Honeycomb Virtual Fly and others. So I have a pretty wide range of knowledge in how the various flight simulation yokes feel and operate.



For the first time ever Boeing has officially-licensed a consumer flight simulation peripheral. Now this does not mean you can add it to a trainer and log hours like an FAA certified yoke. But it does allow a company like Thrustmaster to produce a 1:1 scale yoke depicting the one found in 787 Dreamliners. Is it truly 1:1? They claim so it’s just difficult to verify without the real life measurements. The yoke measures 11 inches down the center and 12 inches from the top where the buttons stick out. A Boeing 737 yoke is about 13 inches and the 787 yoke appears slightly smaller in photos. It’s entirely possible 12 inches is accurate. The throttle and spoiler range look like they could be accurate too. But the flaps on the 787 extend further and the handles overall are much larger in height.

From the nice box art to the contents inside the box this TCA pack was very easy and straight forward to unpack. The yoke itself is all together in one piece minus the USB cable and a clip you can add to hold charts tablet or phone. The throttle does require some assembly especially if you plan on tethering two together. If you only have one throttle you can go straight into screwing in the mounting clamp. But since we have two throttles we need to unscrew two brackets from the bottom of the throttle. They do provide a small Allen wrench like screwdriver for this but I found it doesn’t have enough torque to turn the screws. Instead I used a regular Phillips screwdriver which removed the screws with ease. After that you can place the brackets to join the two throttles together. Now we just need to add the clamp down the center and it’s ready to go on your desk



The last thing we need to do is configure the spoilers flaps and throttle arms. If you’re only using one quadrant you have a couple of choices. One is you use the two provided throttle arms and then have to decide if you want the last axis as the spoilers or flaps. Most likely your choice will be flaps as it’s the more crucial component for takeoff and landing. Or you go with one throttle in the center so you can have both spoilers and flaps on the throttle. If you do go with the 2 throttles and flaps you can use the yokes bottom axes for spoilers or flaps. I just really wish the design of this throttle had included one more axis for a total of 4. This would have looked great and completely eliminated the desire for two throttle quadrants unless you were interested in a Boeing 747 style setup. While we’re on the topic of two throttles they almost didn’t fit alongside the yoke because I have a corner desk. That is something to consider if you’re thinking of getting two. One would be more ideal for a desk like mine but luckily the yoke ended up having enough clearance without hitting the throttle.

Next we’re going to talk about the buttons and features of this pack. The exterior of the yoke uses a matte black colored plastic. Inside the yoke is built on a metal frame and weighs about 3.6 kg or 8 lbs in total. For perspective the Logitech yoke weighs 1.4 kg or 3.1 lbs. The yoke has 18 buttons and 6 axes. Starting from the left you have 5 button inputs an 8 point hat switch and one button on the back side. On the right 5 buttons and one on the back as well. Also instead of a hat switch there is a mini control stick which is nice to have. Not only for scrolling through a menu but freely panning the camera view around. Moving down we have 3 buttons for view menu and sharing or anything you want to map them to. The base of the yoke has two sliding axes a button to power on the Xbox and a landing lever. The landing gear is a 2 point switch and does require some force to move. The switch is without indicator lights and simply puts the gear up or down.



As you can see a few of the buttons do have the X Y A B labels from the Xbox controller. I know some will not like seeing this. Too late for the current units but the only solution I can think of is leaving these optional and include stickers should anyone want to add them. The yoke appears to have a clamp here at the top but it’s just part of the mold with no hinge or way to hold the thinnest of paper. Kind of a shame because it would have been nice to have for clipping a chart or checklist. Flight sim yokes typically don’t have working clamps so it would have set it apart from others in that way.



One nice feature they added was a 3.35 audio jack on the left of the yoke. I really appreciate the extra slack this gives me for my headphones which are normally stretched over to the audio jack on my computer. The back side has a button to select if you are using PC or Xbox and a USB port. I tried plugging the throttle quads into this port but my computer would not recognize them. I ended up plugging the throttle directly into my USB hub along with the other one where it was recognized right away.

Airliner vs. small general aviation yokes handle differently mechanically. GA planes use a straight and level system while the airliner yokes slightly tilt toward you as they are pulled. My first time pulling on this yokes 8.3 inch range felt shockingly smooth. Unlike every other yoke on the market using a straight shaft this yoke uses a pivot Pendul_R™ system to replicate the system used on Boeing aircraft. It’s a pretty cool way to do it and it feels great. I’m also pleased with how well the clamp holds the yoke to the desk when pulling. I’ve had yokes in the past though mounted would still rise a little bit on the far end. The default tension does give a sense of weight when moving it around. If you want even more tension Thrustmaster does give the option to adjust the springs if you want more. 2 to 4 can be used and there are instructions provided on how to do this. The yoke has 150 degrees in total roll axis. The yoke uses Hall Effect sensors which generally do not wear out because they use a shaft and a magnet that never actually touch the sensor. Pulling and turning the yoke both give you 16 bits of precision which equals 65536 x 65536 counts per revolution. This value is the measurement of voltage converted to a digital value. In other words it’s able to break the travel range into 65536 individual points. This allows it to pick up some pretty fine movements all around. The yoke instantly recenters when letting go of the pitch and has a springy return to center on the roll



Moving on to the throttle which also takes advantage of the 3D Hall Effect sensors. The two throttles together weigh 0.94 kg or 2 lbs. On a single quad you have 3 axes and 17 action buttons in total. 5 buttons on the face a knob for speed heading and altitude a second knob to control those values which also pushes in. At the bottom there is a switch for those using two throttles. This allows you to set which quad will be the 1&2 and 3&4. The throttle arms also have a button on either side which can be used for the Takeoff/Go Around mode autothrottle or whatever you please. On the back you can also tether it to a set of Thrustmaster Rudder pedals. Keep in mind the components inside these throttles are very much exposed to collecting dust. You might want to find a way to keep the unit covered when not in use.



Moving the throttle quadrant arms feels very smooth with a nice amount of tension. It’s important to note the reverse thrust levers are not on an axis but rather picked up as a button when clicked into place. They do feel somewhat flimsy. I think you could break them if you are careless and put downward tension on them for some reason. They are plastic and about as thin as a popsicle stick. When not in use they are not locked in a single position and do have some give to them.



So far we’ve covered the look feel and features let’s see how they do in the simulator. I tested these units in Microsoft Flight Simulator X-Plane 11 and Prepar3D v5.2. Each sim gave me a slightly different experience in functionality. Mainly due to each sims method for using certain controls. Overall I had the least headache when setting them up in X-Plane 11 so I’ll start there. Each sim recognized the TCA yoke and each throttle quadrant separately. X-Plane 11 was great because nothing was mapped when I started out. This might sound like the opposite of what you want but there’s nothing worse when a sim guesses the mappings you want. This leads to many things often dual mapped and a real mess to clean up especially when dealing with this many buttons across 3 units. Starting with the yoke I maped the roll pitch elevator trim and landing gear. Next was the spoilers throttle 1 and my personal choice of using the side button for TO/GA. The reverse thrust I mapped to “hold reverse thrust at max.” I also mapped the knob at the bottom to control the altitude bug. Next was the second quadrant which I’m using for throttle 2 flaps and the knob at the bottom for heading control. I later swapped the bugs around to be in sequence with the MCP.

With the controls setup to my liking I loaded in at San Francisco International Airport using the legendary Zibo Mod 737. Until we start seeing aircraft like the PMDG 737 on Microsoft Flight Simulator this is going to be the best test to run using these controls. I entered the runway set the throttle to 40% N1 engaged TO/GA and I was off. The first officer called out V1 and I gently began pulling back on the yoke. This felt as smooth as can be. Landing gear came up and I started to work with the trim now beginning a turn to the right and leveling off at 3000ft. The heading and altitude knobs also worked as I vectored myself back to the ILS approach for runway 28R.



As I headed down the glide path I had a chance to use some spoilers for drag. I started to put the flaps out on schedule and disengaging the A/P and A/T. With the yoke in one hand and the throttle in the other the aircraft is nicely heading down the glide path under my control. For being my very first landing with these controls and not using a yoke for a couple of months it felt like I had been using them for months. I thought they might have a learning curve but I felt right at home with them. Crossing the runway threshold 50 40 30 20 I closed the throttle and aiming for the center line 10 holding the flare and BUTTER! I grabbed the reverse thrust pulled it towards me and it began slowing the aircraft. I was pleased with how my first flight went. I can’t wait until I truly get used to them… if that’s even possible beyond the way they handled for me already.

Moving on to other sims I decided to give Prepar3D 5.2 a chance. I had to remove some dual mappings and reverse the spoilers and flaps but nothing too major. I tested the controls in the TFDI 717. Starting with the yoke spoilers flaps and throttle everything worked as intended. Where I started to run into issues was with the reverse thrust. Again because this lever is actually a button P3D doesn’t allow you to hold reverse thrust at max at least not with the built in menu. Instead they have a mapping called “Throttle (decrease quickly)” this activates the reverse thrust in increments. This means when pulling the reverse arms back you only get idle reverse. It would take about 7 up and down pushes of this lever to get full reverse and that’s just not going to cut it. This is an issue I’ve had with P3D dating back to my use of the Logitech throttles. But you can map a reverse thrust axis. So I used the open arm to the left of the number one engine to do this. Not ideal but it did work for what I needed. When it comes to using the knobs for heading and altitude I could not get them to work when mapping “Autopilot Altitude bug (decrement)” and (increment). Very possible the button mapping program FSUIPC can fix this  but when using the core P3D button mapping interface I could not figure it out.

My experience with Microsoft Flight Simulator wasn’t exactly plug and play. I figured since this product was inspired by this sim it would be a little more ready to go. I still needed to reverse some axes and remove conflicting axes I didn’t want. Again I ran into trouble with the reverse thrust. X-Plane was the only sim where this worked right away. In Microsoft Flight Simulator you have two options for this command. “Hold Throttle Reverse Thrust” and “Toggle Throttle Reverse Thrust”. “Hold Throttle Reverse Thrust” is supposed to hold the reverse thrust at max but I could not get the reverse to budge no matter which throttle or button I mapped it to. “Toggle Throttle Reverse Thrust” toggles the reverse thrust on and allows your normal throttle inputs to control the in-sim reverse levers. I got this to partially work most of the time. Sometimes one throttle would activate and sometimes both. Either way it was buggy. The throttles click and snap up and down very fast as if something is forcing them in the other direction. I triple checked to make sure I didn’t have any conflicting mappings across the 3 units including my rudder pedals. Now obviously this is more of a Microsoft Flight Simulator problem rather than a Thrustmaster problem. It did after all work fine in X-Plane 11. This is also a symptom of not being able to use an axis to control these arms. I just thought this setup would have worked a little more flawlessly considering it’s designed with Microsoft Flight Simulator in mind. Also remember i’m testing this on the PC version. It’s possible the Xbox might handle things differently. This is also something that may not be an issue anymore by the time you hear it from me.



With all of the controls sorted at best I took the 787 for a short flight. This aircraft is still incomplete and has its quirks. But as I said when PMDG arrives it will be a real treat to pair this set with. This time without the use of TO/GA I got to experience the full range on the throttle as I added power it’s a nice range to have. Rotation felt great the gear lever functioned as did the flaps and trim. This is the first flight where I got to try the mini stick on the right side of the yoke. I have to say I really like having it there. It’s much nicer than the traditional hat switch look which forces a hard turn to the left or right. With the stick I could slowly control my view all around the cockpit.



Everything i’ve shown you today the TCA yoke pack and additional throttle totals $650 before taxes and $697 after taxes when living in California. After getting to use this yoke with my favorite sims I’d be lying if I said I didn’t love using it. I liked it so much I’m considering setting it up as my primary yoke for airliner flying. I didn’t think I would feel this way about it going into this review.



The throttle is nice for what it is. I liked the size of the handles and it was very comfortable to use but it wasn’t really anything special in my opinion. Especially as a single unit. It really needed that 4th axis along with the reverse thrust arms to impress me further. Also not having the throttle lowers the cost a little. The standalone yoke will be available for preorder in February 2022. Thurstmaster is listing it with a suggested retail price of $400. The worth and value all depend on what you’re looking for. This is the only yoke on the consumer market that moves like an airliner yoke with some pretty good sensors too. Without the throttle you still have everything you need at a minimum. You can map the trim on the left flaps on the right and you have an axis for the throttle spoilers or flaps. With all of that you still have the landing gear lever and many buttons left over to map.



But If you really need a throttle or you’re a collector of Boeing memorabilia you will enjoy having this quadrant too. My biggest takeaway from this review is that the yoke really is awesome! The feel of the Pendul_R™ system adjustable springs for the tension a mini control stick for the camera and a headphone jack were all new features I didn’t know I wanted until I had them in front of me. This reminded me of a great Steve Jobs quote “Some people say “Give the customer what they want.” But that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do.” I truly look forward to using this setup for the coming years. Now if you’ll excuse me I have some flying to do…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L3doeS1ib2VpbmctZG9uZS1tYWtpbmctNzQ3LWFpcmxpbmVycy0xOTc1MTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Is Boeing Done Making 747 Airliners?,"The Boeing 747 is the quintessential “jumbo jet.” It was Boeing’s first aircraft to feature two aisles instead of one and is one of the first modern jets to feature an extra upper deck. In an era previously marked by civilian twinjets—and occasionally trijets—the airliner was one of the earliest quadjets featuring two engines on either wing—a virtual necessity considering the weight of the cabin between them.

The first 747 left Boeing’s enormous Washington factory in September 1968. It flew in February 1969 and entered service with Pan Am by 1970. A series of upgraded versions were created throughout the 1970s—the 747-200 in 1982 the 747-300 in 1983 and the 747-400 in 1985. Each addressed problems with the initial aircraft including tremendous fuel inefficiency complicated operations and its reliance on a three-pilot crew instead of the usual two-pilot crew. More recently the 747-8 the largest variant to date was officially launched in 2005 entering service in 2011.

More than fifteen hundred 747 airliners have been built by Boeing since its inception. Nearly every major flag carrier airline around the world has operated the 747 airliners. In the United States it is instantly recognizable as the base plane for Air Force One. Unfortunately the airplane’s days are numbered; after fifty-four years of development Boeing has announced that it will cease manufacturing 747 airliners in 2022. It will be redirecting its resources to the 787 “Dreamliner” and resolving remaining issues with the 737 MAX which has a tarnished reputation following two high-profile crashes in 2019.

Even before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic which led to reduced demand for travel and threw the airline industry into turmoil the airplane’s future was uncertain. The most significant problem with the airplane has been structural; it was designed for an air transport system reliant on a central hub which has been phased out and replaced by a system with many point-to-point connections.

Another major problem has been the increase in fuel costs. This has been one of the most volatile costs impacting the airline industry. While all fuel costs are the same heavy quadjets like the 747 and 737 airliners are far less efficient than lighter twinjets.

InvestigateWest

When Seattle's first commercial airport opened in 1928 Georgetown had been a vibrant community for more than half a century.

""We were here before the airport was. They forget that"" says Rosario-Maria Medina a community activist in the South Seattle neighborhood of Georgetown just north of bustling Boeing Field.

We're sitting in the house that once belonged to her grandfather Ismael Barron who moved from Texas to Georgetown in 1959. Barron joined his brother Manuel who'd arrived in the 1940s and like Manuel set up a barbershop in what was becoming one of Seattle's most diverse areas. Georgetown and adjoining South Park had significant numbers of Latino African American Asian and Pacific Island residents while the Seattle metropolitan area remained overwhelmingly white.

The roar of airplanes punctuates our conversation. To Medina the sonic interruptions are a persistent reminder of how decades of development practices allowed the airport industrial facilities and freeways to encroach on the community. By the time her grandfather arrived the local library and movie theater had closed and the completion of Interstate 5 in 1962 killed much of Georgetown's remaining business activity. ""They knew these areas were mostly immigrants and refugees so they knew they could do what they wanted"" Medina says.

Along with the noise chemical pollutants rain down on the community. The residential mix of Georgetown and South Park remains diverse: 70% Black Indigenous and other people of color; 42% foreign born; and 71.7% low income — and they suffer health problems from that pollution. Soot causes a host of heart and respiratory issues and the toxic lead that causes developmental delays in children is still added to the aviation gas burned by small planes decades after being banned from North America's roads.

Emissions of carbon dioxide meanwhile dissolve into the atmosphere contributing to the climate change-driven heat waves flooding and other weather extremes that already disproportionately affect marginalized communities.

InvestigateWest: Cleaner buildings will cost Oregon Washington billions

On this fall morning planes are coming from the north not just landing a few blocks away at King County International Airport-Boeing Field (the county-owned airport's full name) but also descending toward Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) the Puget Sound area's regional airport five miles to the south.

In 1999 the Georgetown community lost a fight against a Boeing Field expansion plan. And in 2008 Sea-Tac added a third runway. The noise seems to get worse every year. Takeoffs and landings at the county airfield rose 12.6% between 2015 and 2019.

In response Medina joined a coalition that's standing up against further increases in flights — an alliance that's notched several wins over the past 12 months against one of the region's core industries.

It's something that's increasingly common across the Pacific Northwest: In Oregon Washington and British Columbia local activists fighting for quality-of-life issues are teaming up with climate activists and using their collective strength to sway local governments.

And they are winning. Local leaders are responding to this pressure — often backed by the rising moral and legal authority of Indigenous tribes and nations — by passing ordinances and implementing rules that deliver on their stated commitments to address climate change and environmental injustice including rules to phase out gas heating ban new refineries and chemical plants and more.

""These rules just change the whole game"" says Matt Krogh a campaign director for Stand.Earth a climate action group based in Vancouver British Columbia and Bellingham Washington. Krogh says hurdles to oil gas and coal developments have more than a practical legal impact. They also puncture the sense of inevitability that's surrounded fossil fuel expansion ""ever since oil got big"" at the dawn of the 20th century.

Communities that ban yesterday's dirty energy Krogh says begin to imagine another ""inevitable path"" — one toward clean energy: ""It's changing how people are thinking about the future and what's going to happen.""

Thinking globally acting locally

The King County International Airport Community Coalition organized last year in response to a $282 million master plan update crafted by Boeing Field that foresaw more jet flights and thus more noise in Georgetown and higher emissions of carbon dioxide. Led by former state representative and labor organizer Velma Veloria the coalition united groups representing neighboring communities with environmental groups such as 350 Seattle.

The coalition called for the county's elected officials to fulfill recent promises to fight climate change and environmental injustice by blocking the airport's expansion.

Veloria carried a powerful message about the health status of those living in the lowlands around Boeing Field: When the Filipina activist left the Legislature in 2004 residents had a life expectancy that was five years shorter than people ""up the hill"" in wealthier Seattle neighborhoods. ""Now it's a 13-year difference"" Veloria says.

Thanks to earlier advocacy by social justice group El Centro de la Raza and the Beacon Hill Council the coalition had on hand a Seattle & King County Public Health study on Sea-Tac documenting its negative health impacts.

Meanwhile 350 Seattle's volunteer aviation team helped make the climate connection. Its members documented how aviation generates 2.5% of global CO2 emissions but 3.5% of global warming thanks to the vapor contrails created by jets which also trap heat in Earth's atmosphere.

InvestigateWest: Can the West learn to share renewable power?

The coalition and El Centro de la Raza scored its first victory in December 2020 when King County's elected executive Dow Constantine promised that the county's 2021 greenhouse gas inventory would count emissions from all fuel pumped at airports in the county. Another win came in May when the county's updated climate action plan called for cutting aircraft emissions — which Boeing Field's growth plan anticipated would increase 30% between 2018 and 2035. That could help the county meet its self-imposed mandate to cut emissions 50% from 2007 levels by 2030.

The big win came on the third day of this summer's heat dome event at 2:26 p.m. on June 28 when Constantine called Veloria to say the airport's master plan update was off the table.

Another victory for citizen activists came a few weeks later when Whatcom County Washington — home to two large refineries — passed sweeping land-use rules that ban new processing plants such as crude-oil refineries and chemical plants.

There are more bans in the works.

Plastic bag bans are proliferating. Natural gas appliances and furnaces have been banned from certain new buildings in jurisdictions such as Vancouver B.C. Seattle and Multnomah County. And in May Eugene allowed its gas supplier's franchise agreement to expire threatening Portland-based NW Natural's legal authority to lay new gas pipes under city streets.

States provinces and national governments are reluctant to push fossil fuels off the table; in fact British Columbia still subsidizes gas production. But a tougher approach is crucial for decarbonization says Eric de Place who leads energy policy work for the Sightline Institute a Seattle-based think tank. Most state provincial and federal energy policies aimed at addressing climate change provide incentives to build more ""clean"" stuff like renewable power plants low-carbon fuels and electric vehicles. But he sees local action constraining infrastructure as crucial because only less consumption of fossil fuels actually reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

""I'll be in the bleachers applauding for the clean energy stuff"" de Place says ""but I'll be in the streets for stopping fossil fuels.""

Revoking fossil fuels' 'free ride'

Regional activists are busy thinking up new targets beyond large industrial facilities to challenge the dominance of fossil energy.

Krogh at Stand.Earth says many opportunities involve using building codes land-use ordinances and other measures to restrict the growth of fossil fuel consumption that pervades civic life — or even to start ramping it down.

Widespread examples are local plastic bag bans which often focus on the potential to slash plastic pollution can simultaneously constrain demand for plastics. And fossil fuel producers increasingly see plastics as their best hope for future sales of gas petroleum and coal as the world shifts to renewable power battery vehicles and all-electric buildings. By one estimate carbon emissions from the plastic industry could exceed those from coal power plants by 2030.

British Columbia Washington and Oregon all have laws that require distributors of motor fuels to steadily reduce the carbon intensity of their products. They're also seeking to push drivers into battery-powered cars and trucks as soon as possible and reserve biofuels for heavier vehicles that are harder to electrify.

In October British Columbia announced that it would be accelerating its phaseout of conventional cars and trucks seeking to triple the proportion of electric car sales required in 2030 from 30% to 90%.

Hemming in Boeing Field

The fight to constrain airport growth in the Puget Sound region also challenges conventional wisdom. The King County International Airport Community Coalition's call to stop aviation growth runs directly counter to the expansion ethic under which public airports operate and plan for the future — a growth doctrine that's particularly strong in Washington state with its extensive aerospace industry centered around Boeing.

Allowing flights to keep on increasing means carbon emissions might continue to increase for the foreseeable future despite significant industry efficiency measures. That's what the county airfield's plan projected and the airport's recent track record suggests reality could exceed its projections.

According to an overview released with the plan last September the steady increase in traffic at Boeing Field between 2015 and 2019 was forecast to be a 2.9% decline.

The airport's plan reported zero emissions of soot and other particle pollution and counted only the 10% of fuel burned during takeoffs and landings rather than all of the fuel the airport pumps for planes' full journeys. It also ignored additional warming caused by exhaust-induced clouds or contrails. Add them up and climate impacts associated with Boeing Field could already be well over 10 times higher than it estimates.

InvestigateWest: Cascadia needs stronger clean-fuels push for vehicles that can't plug in

While that airport's growth plans have been grounded for the time being activists will face a tougher fight taking on Sea-Tac. And Sea-Tac answers to the Port of Seattle whose enabling statutes enshrine economic growth as a priority.

Activists see their best hope for Sea-Tac may be electing progressive candidates to the port's independent governing commission. All three of the winning candidates in November's commission election campaigned on environmental and equity positions including two women of color who unseated incumbent commissioners.

There are also plans for a second Sea-Tac. In 2019 the Washington Legislature voted unanimously to create a commission tasked with finding short-term expansion opportunities at the state's congested airports and picking a site for a new regional hub. The new hub would pave the way for decades of aviation — and emissions — expansion.

Seattle attorney Sarah Shifley co-founder of the volunteer aviation team for 350 Seattle calls that ""flabbergasting"" after the June heat dome this summer's fires and Hurricane Ida which caused more than $95 billion in damage in Louisiana — all events attributed to climate change. ""I actually think it's insane"" says Shifley without a hint of hyperbole.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee like Boeing Field director John Parrott and the global aviation industry sees fuels with a lower carbon footprint than jet fuel — so-called ""sustainable aviation fuels"" — as the best way to square aviation growth with their commitments to decarbonize.

In written answers to InvestigateWest the governor's office noted that stopping aviation growth could have ""repercussions"" for Washington's economy and insisted that increasing aviation capacity ""remains sound."" Inslee's office identified alternative fuels as the ""most promising"" among various technologies to address aviation emissions which include nascent efforts to electrify airplanes.

However energy and climate experts doubt low-carbon fuels can deliver on such expectations given the challenges associated with expanding biofuels and the weight of batteries needed to electrify large planes. And as Shifley notes focusing on ""sustainable"" fuels ignores the disproportionate local impacts on communities like Georgetown and Beacon Hill.

Increasingly experts associated with Washington state's extensive aviation fuel development programs say constraining aviation demand must become part of the solution.

Ross Macfarlane led Sustainable Aviation Fuels Northwest a stakeholder group formed to create a road map for cleaner aviation fuels. He says the cost of aviation should rise to reflect its impact on climate to help drive demand for air travel toward cheaper and cleaner alternatives such as high-speed rail and virtual business meetings.

The airline confirms to Runway Girl Network that Eclipse is already on board one MAX 8 aircraft flying short-haul with plans for more — and not just for the MAX. Flydubai intends to obtain a supplementary type certificate for Eclipse allowing it to retrofit its existing 737-800 aircraft to replace the Geven Comoda recliner it previously used in this category.

The move paints the future picture of the all-737 airline’s fleet and passenger experience split between the ten Thompson Vantage fully flat beds up front on longer-haul routes the 12 new Eclipse seats on shorter routes and a small subfleet of all-economy aircraft. It is an evolution of the airline’s plans — as discussed with RGN in 2017 — to put the Vantage cabins as the standard for the airlines’ MAX aircraft.

“We introduced business class in 2013 and we were the launch customer for Geven’s Comoda seat. Now we are the launch customer for another new business class seat” Daniel Kerrison vice president of inflight product explains.

“Today flydubai operates a fleet of 55 aircraft 22 of which have the Geven business class seats. We have nine all-economy aircraft and the remainder are configured with our full-flat business class product. Compared to the full-flat configuration with HAECO seating we gain two seats in business class and six seats in economy class.”

In addition to the Eclipse seats flydubai is also upgrading the shorthaul inflight entertainment to Safran’s RAVE Ultra system with 4K capability alongside the ability for passengers to use their own Bluetooth headphones to the IFE system.

(Earlier this year flydubai began offering a complimentary inflight entertainment streaming service — instead of seatback IFE from now-defunct Lumexis — in economy class on the 737-800s.)

The airline has spent over three years developing the Eclipse-based premium product for its operation. “We began developing this seat with HAECO Cabin Solutions and JPA Design in 2018” Kerrison explains noting that “the rollout for the new seat was delayed due to the pandemic and the changes to the delivery schedule.”

Indeed RGN reported in February 2019 that HAECO and its undisclosed 737 MAX customer planned to launch Eclipse in the first quarter of 2020.

The flydubai implementation of Eclipse is certainly an attractive one carrying over the design language from the Vantage implementation with the calming blues and warm desert accent tones creating a modern relaxing palette. The overall look and feel is a little bit darker than the Vantage cabin and to this journalist’s eye at least that’s a pleasing change.

It’s especially super to see that the airline and its design and seatmaker partners have iterated to reduce the amount of off-white thermoplastic that’s visible with the section below the inflight entertainment monitor being the same sort of anthracite-chocolate that wraps the monitor shroud and features on the inside of the privacy dividers.

Of particular note is the rather neatly created storage shelf underneath the wide seatback monitor which also offers a cupholder — ideal for those shorter flights where a cup of coffee or a glass of something more exciting is often particularly welcome. That’s a change to HAECO’s flip-down shelf and to your author’s mind at least it’s a smart one: fewer moving and breakable parts.

Overall both the product and the styling look excellent. For shorter routes within the flydubai network — the Middle East northeast Africa and even into the Indian subcontinent — this is a strong product that stands head and quite literally staggered shoulders ahead of the recliner competition.

Industrial scientists from 3M Abb­Vie AstraZeneca Bristol Myers Squibb Merck & Co. Novartis and Pfizer are being recognized with the American Chemical Society’s 2021 Heroes of Chemistry Awards. These researchers’ contributions have led to advancements in treatments for bloodstream infections cancer diabetes and heart failure.

The Heroes of Chemistry Awards are ACS’s highest honor for industrial chemical scientists who make up a significant proportion of ACS’s membership. The program started in 1996 is sponsored by the ACS Board Committee on Corporation Associates and celebrates industrial advances that have benefited humankind.

Here’s a look at the commercial products being honored this year:

3M: Tegaderm CHG Chlorhexidine Gluconate I.V. Securement Dressing

Credit: 3M

Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are fatal to more than a quarter of patients who contract one. Over 40000 cases of CRBSIs are reported per year. Contact with the catheter insertion site—for example when a clinician lifts the tape and gauze to look for signs of infection—can expose the site to bacteria and increase the risk.

3M’s Tegaderm CHG Chlorhexidine Gluconate I.V. Securement Dressing is a highly breathable transparent dressing that contains a gel pad of the antimicrobial chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG). The dressing is placed over the insertion site for central venous catheters. Clinicians can see through the dressing minimizing contact with the insertion site. The dressing is clinically proven to reduce CRBSIs.

“When we got the evidence that we could significantly reduce bloodstream infections that was just the top of my career” says Bob Asmus a retired corporate scientist from 3M and one of the award winners. Asmus led the development of Tegaderm CHG which launched in 2008.

CHG is clear which made it the antimicrobial of choice for this dressing Asmus explains. But CHG photodegrades is thermally unstable and is prone to forming insoluble salts with certain anions. The Tegaderm CHG team successfully protected the CHG from these factors while ensuring the antimicrobial could still diffuse from the gel pad to the insertion site.

In 2018 3M introduced a new product Tegaderm Antimicrobial I.V. Advanced Securement Dressing a lower-cost dressing intended for use with peripherally inserted IV catheters. Incorporating the antimicrobial directly into the adhesive as opposed to in a gel pad simplified manufacturing explains Ying Zhang a senior product development specialist in 3M’s medical solutions division and one of the award winners.

3M is now exploring the next generation of transparent securement dressings.

AbbVie: Venclexta/Venclyxto

Cancer cells are able to short-circuit a form of programmed cell death known as apoptosis and this ability gives them a survival advantage. Understanding resistance to apoptosis is a critical area in cancer research. Several hematologic cancers depend on B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) proteins to inhibit apoptosis.

AbbVie’s venetoclax marketed as Venclexta in the US and Venclyxto outside the US selectively inhibits BCL-2 proteins. The drug gives patients a new option to treat certain blood cancers.

Venclexta “took an entirely new approach to treating cancer by inducing programmed cell death specifically in cancer cells whereas most other chemo­therapies just kill fast-growing cells” including normal blood cells explains Steve Elmore vice president for drug discovery science and technology at Abb­Vie and one of the award winners.

Elmore led the team that discovered venetoclax which took more than a decade of lab work. Venetoclax was the first marketed drug specifically designed to inhibit a protein-protein interaction.

Elmore says it gives him a sense of purpose and satisfaction to know that “our science and the stuff we did in the lab is helping people reclaim their lives.” He believes there are other opportunities for new drugs to act on different pathways of programmed cell death. “I think [Venclexta] is just the tip of the iceberg” he says.

AstraZeneca/Bristol Myers Squibb: Farxiga

Hyperglycemia or high blood glucose is a manifestation of type 2 diabetes and over time can lead to serious health problems. The drug Farxiga (dapagliflozin) can help treat type 2 diabetes by inhibiting excess glucose from being reabsorbed from the kidneys into the blood instead causing the glucose to be excreted into the urine.

Along with glucose Farxiga also causes some excretion of water and sodium. As a result the drug promotes a modest lowering of body weight and blood pressure. While the exact mechanisms are still being worked out the combination of these effects has shown benefits for cardiovascular disease and kidney disease in addition to its original indication as a diabetes treatment.

The compound was discovered by a team at Bristol Myers Squibb led by award winner Bill Washburn and developed as part of a clinical-stage partnership between Bristol Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca.

Farxiga represented a new class of sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. The shift from an O-linked glucoside to a C-linked glucoside gave the compound more stability in the body and enabled the successful clinical development of SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetes and protection against morbidity from heart failure and chronic kidney disease.

Bruce Ellsworth executive director and head of fibrotic disease discovery chemistry at Bristol Myers Squibb and another award winner says it’s a thrill “that this training in organic chemistry could really lead to something that actually benefits human health.”

“It’s very rewarding and very gratifying to see” says award-winner Nayyar Iqbal vice president for clinical metabolism at AstraZeneca. “Our baby is now mature and grown up.”

Merck & Co.: Keytruda

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Keytruda a humanized monoclonal antibody treatment is a checkpoint inhibitor that binds to and blocks a protein called PD-1 thus helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.

Keytruda represents new hope in the treatment of various cancers. “People are seeing a meaningful benefit in many cancer indications” says Parimal Desai vice president of engineering in Merck & Co.’s manufacturing division and one of the award winners.

Keytruda was initially approved to treat metastatic melanoma but today is approved for more than 30 indications across 16 different tumor types. Tumors that express PD-1 can generally be classified for Keytruda treatment.

When it saw the promise of Keytruda “Merck moved heaven and earth” Desai says. “The whole company got aligned.” Desai led a team of more than 1000 scientists and engineers to expedite chemistry manufacturing and control (CMC) development. The company compressed CMC development timelines and expanded production volumes to keep pace with positive data from clinical trials. The US Food and Drug Administration granted the drug accelerated approval in 2014.

Desai expects that anti-PD-1 inhibitors either alone or in combination with other drugs will change the practice of cancer treatment. “Doctors are feeling for the first time that we have control over a terminal disease” he says.

Novartis: Entresto

People over 40 years old have a 20% lifetime risk of developing heart failure which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body.

Novartis’s Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) has been approved to reduce the risk of death and hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction meaning the heart’s left ventricle does not pump sufficiently. It has also been approved in certain countries to treat chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Entresto is a combination angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor. Valsartan blocks angio­tensin II receptor type 1 which causes blood vessels to dilate and reduces extracellular fluid (ECF) volume. Sacubitril is a prodrug that is activated to sacubitrilat; this metabolite inhibits the enzyme neprilysin thereby increasing the levels of certain peptides that cause blood vessels to dilate and ECF volume to lower as a result of sodium excretion.

The American College of Cardiology now recommends Entresto as the frontline therapy ahead of the previous standard of care which was based on ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.

Pfizer: Lorbrena

For patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer treatments can fail as a result of resistance mutations or brain metastases. Drugs that cross the blood-brain barrier to treat such metastases can be risky because of the potential for side effects.

Lorbrena is an ALK inhibitor that was developed to treat all known drug-resistance mutations plus brain metastases. It was designed to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. “It was risky but it was a risk we wanted to take” says Ted W. Johnson a research fellow with Pfizer and one of the award winners.

The Pfizer team used structure-based drug design which allows researchers to target a specific mutation that’s driving a tumor. This approach meant the compound was safer and gave a higher likelihood it would be efficacious in the clinic.

“As someone in research most of the programs I work on never make it to Phase 1 clinical trials” Johnson says. He was the co–project lead for the Lorbrena program and is the coinventor of Lorbrena.

Lorbrena is an oral therapy and has less severe side effects than traditional chemo​therapy. It was approved as a frontline therapy earlier this year. Johnson believes Lorbrena has opened the door to more such targeted therapies.

When her good friend and colleague Judith Shizuru MD professor of blood and marrow transplantation and cellular therapy was struggling with a difficult case Brown was always her first call.

“She would really dig into the details think outside the box and she could reach into her own understanding” Shizuru said. “She could guide you as if she was a third eye. I’ve never encountered another clinician like her. It takes insights smarts and a real sense of boldness.”

It also helped that she was fully grounded in life — whether inside the lab or clinic or at home. Weissman remembers what she did for his mother during her recovery from cancer and how she approached the life-threatening riddles facing so many others.

“She was the kind of doctor who considered the lives of others just as important as her own family” he said. “And if they’re like your family you’re not going to stop until you figure it out.”

The mom in the stands

Shizuru still doesn’t understand how Brown and Hoffman did what they did as full-time researchers and clinicians and as parents. “Two working physicians who somehow made it to every one of their kids’ events” she said. “She was the mom always in the stands the one who brought the Gatorade.”

Hoffman said his wife had a unique ability to apply multiple passions simultaneously. “From virology to immune cells to the clinical care and research — she loved them all” Hoffman said. “But most of all she loved being a mother.”

At home on bed rest during her first pregnancy Brown managed to work on her stem cell research papers. Then she homeschooled the twins until fourth grade while continuing her research.

“While she was bringing this incredibly important science to bear in my lab she was also homeschooling her twins” Weissman said. “I have no idea how she did all that — and did it so well. But that was Wes.”

She was in the stands even as the kids got older — at her son Jacob’s Stanford baseball games at the lacrosse matches of her daughter Samantha and her son Zach at every Stanford sporting event she could get to.

“She was a very enthusiastic and very loud Stanford fan” Hoffman said. Jacob was able to get the whole family field passes for last November’s Big Game against Cal — exactly the type of gathering “that made her really happy” Hoffman said.

Brown was treating patients during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic when a routine exam uncovered the cancer. She underwent surgery and numerous rounds of radiation and chemotherapy. She and Hoffman spent January through March in Boston at Brigham and Women’s Hospital hunkered down and enduring a phase 1 clinical trial.

“We researched everything we could — she wasn’t going to give up” Hoffman said. “Till the end when she would be hospitalized and she’d learn the life story of every nurse who took care of her.”

She was a unique person and her loss is so tough to grieve. It leaves a big hole.

Benedetti was a blood and marrow transplant nurse who recalls bonding with Brown over their mutual commitment to work and family. She remembers her as a selfless nurturer who always made time to listen never looking for the spotlight herself. That was saved for those closest to her. “Family was everything to her” she said. “Wes was a brilliant humble loving family-oriented person.”

Brown’s biggest disappointment was that she was too ill to return to work after the cancer diagnosis. But she wasn’t about to miss out on the landmark family moments that remained.

She was there for Samantha’s wedding in Los Gatos California in the spring and then at her PhD defense at Harvard University. Recently the whole family spent a weekend at Sierra Family Camp at Fallen Leaf Lake in the Lake Tahoe basin — a Stanford tradition they had enjoyed for years when the kids were growing up.

“That was so important to her — and she hung in there” Shizuru said. “She was a unique person and her loss is so tough to grieve. It leaves a big hole. It’s painful.”

Hoffman knows. He said he has a hard time accepting the death of his wife so early. “She was only 63 — she had so much more life to live” he said. But he draws comfort in the immense legacy she leaves behind. It’s everywhere he looks.

“She was known and loved by so many people” he said. “I never realized how many people she touched.”

Brown is survived by her husband Andy Hoffman and their children — Samantha Jacob and Zachary Hoffman.

BF-B,Brown–Forman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vdXByb3h4LmNvbS9saWZlL29sZC1mb3Jlc3Rlci13aGlza3ktcmFua2VkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All 14 Bottles Of Old Forester Whisky Ranked,"14. Old Forester 86 Proof Bourbon Whisky ABV: 43% Average Price: $24 The Whisky: Old Forester’s 86 Proof is a very straightforward whisky. The mash bill is mid-range rye with 18 percent next to 72 percent corn and a final ten percent malted barley (the same bill for all their bourbon). The juice is aged in a fairly heavily charred oak barrel for an undisclosed amount of time (the youngest barrel is likely older than four years). The whisky is then blended and proofed down to a very manageable 86 proof. Tasting Notes: This has a big nose of vanilla-cherry tobacco with a hint of fresh mint lurking in the background next to a touch of floral honey. The taste has a grilled corn-on-the-cob vibe with a hint of pepper and butter next to small doses of citrus and soft oak. The end is surprisingly long and leaves you with a spicy warmth and a touch more of that sweet corn and butter. Bottom Line: This is a perfectly suitable entry-point whisky. It’s great for mixing but needs a fair bit of ice to work as a sipper. And that’s why we’re starting this ranking with it. Old Forestes knows this is a mixing bourbon so let’s treat it like that. 13. Old Forester Rye Whisky ABV: 50% Average Price: $26 The Whisky: Old Forester’s rye is comprised of 65 percent rye 20 percent malted barley and 15 percent corn. That gives the rye a very “Kentucky Rye” feel with that sweet corn shining through. The juice spends an undisclosed amount of time aging before it’s vatted proofed down with that soft Kentucky limestone water and bottled. Tasting Notes: The nose draws you in with a soft wildflower nature next to hints of crafty root beer that’s a bit sweet but served with a lemon wedge. The taste leans into the spice of that root beer as holiday spices with a lot of cinnamon kicks up on the palate with a slight touch of stewed apple black pepper and maybe a hint of dried dill. The mid-palate brings back that citrus before going all-in on the brown spices and black pepper with a warm end that’s accented by dry cedar. Bottom Line: This is a perfectly suitable rye that shines in a Manhattan. The spice isn’t overpowering and the sweet balances everything out. Still this is a mixer far more than a sipper.

12. Old Forester 100 Proof ABV: 50% Average Price: $28 The Whisky: This line of bourbon is a stone-cold classic. Their 100-proof expression is made in the same way as their 86 proof. The key difference is after these barrels are blended they’re barely touched with water keeping the proof very hearty. Tasting Notes: Oak and caramel draw you in on the nose with a nice dose of cherry candy and a hint of coffee bitterness. The palate wallows in vanilla as a spicy apple pie with a vanilla-flecked buttery crust drives the taste. The oak apple and spice really power the dram home with a medium-length fade and plenty of bourbon warmth. Bottom Line: This is very close to the 86 proof above with a little more refinement and barrel in the mix. For me that makes it a more refined mixer that you want to use in cocktails and less in highballs. Leave the Coke behind and break out the vermouth! 12. Old Forester Single Barrel Barrel Strength ABV: 65% Average Price: $80 The Whisky: This is classic Old Forester from a single barrel that’s not cut with any water. When you find these they’ll generally be a pick from a retailer or bar program. That means they’ll vary slightly depending on what the person picking the barrel was looking for. Still there’s a consistency of “Old Forester” running through them all. Tasting Note: Based on a single barrel I tasted at Louisville retailer there’s a clear sense of dark fruit especially cherry that becomes stewed with dark winter spices on the nose with a good dose of dry tobacco in an old cedar box that’s wrapped up in old leather. A hint of old dry roses sneaks in on the palate as those spices and syrupy cherry and berries intensify and attach to the chewy tobacco. The mid-palate sweetens with an almost rose-water marzipan vibe as the cherry tobacco dried out pretty significantly leaving you with a sense of pitchy pine sap and your grandparent’s old tobacco pipe that’s still hot to touch. Bottom Line: The end on this is pretty damn warm and that slightly overpowered the finish for me. If you are looking for single barrels from Old Forester I’d recommend going for a lower proof — more on that later.

11. Old Forester 1870 Original Batch Whisky ABV: 45% Average Price: $49 The Whisky: This is where we get into the “year” whiskies from Old Forester. This one celebrates the distillery’s founding in 1870. Back in the day Geroge Brown would pull barrels from his three distilleries to create a consistent blend to bottle. Today the good folks at Brown-Forman pull three barrels from three of their warehouses. Each barrel will have a different day of distillation a different entry proof before aging and different ages. Those barrels are married and then proofed down. Tasting Note: This opens with a rush of fresh wildflowers next to bold citrus notes especially grapefruit and orange oils with a dash of lemon zest in the mix. The taste takes that lemon and layers it into a very vanilla and butter-forward shortbread with a dusting of raw sugar that leads towards an eggnog spice mix. That spiciness drives the finish as a hint of cherry and lemon mingle on the warm and fairly long end. Bottom Line: This is where we’re getting into the “Well that’s really nice” territory. I dig this as a sipper on the rocks but it really shines in a whisky sour thanks to those bold citrus notes. 10. Old Forester Statesman ABV: 47.5% Average Price: $60 The Whisky: Yes this is technically a gimmick whisky. The expression was released as a tie-in to Kingsman: The Golden Circle. But that doesn’t really matter –this is an exceptional bottle of whisky. The barrels are all hand-selected from the hottest corners of the warehouse and small-batched to create a deep character and bold presence. Tasting Notes: Moist dark chocolate cake with cloves and oak mix with a flourish of vanilla on the nose. The taste holds onto the spice and amps it into Christmas spice territory with a focus on woody cinnamon next to worn leather and buttery toffee. A dry floral note arrives late with a burst of orange that leans creamy (almost like a sherbert) comingling with all that vanilla and toffee. Bottom Line: This continues to be a solid on the rocks bourbon. Though I did try this in an old fashioned recently and it was excellent thanks to all that spice and orange.

9. Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style Whisky ABV: 57.5% Average Price: $62 The Whisky: Getting back to the years on the bottles this expression “celebrates” the Volstead Act of 1920 which pretty much banned alcohol in the U.S. What this is really celebrating is that Old Forester was one of only six distilleries that was able to keep making and selling whisky (for medicinal purposes) during Prohibition. And that era’s production is what this blend mimics. Tasting Note: That classic choco-cherry note that a lot of Old Forester has comes through on the top of this nose with maple syrup-soaked cedar next to a faint touch of caramel apple. The palate is slightly nutty bordering on Pecan Sandies with a continuation of that maple syrup leading towards light pepperiness that’s almost like cumin as the cedar comes back into play. The mid-palate sweetens pretty dramatically with a Caro Syrup feel to it as the spice hits on a wintery vibe and the taste ends with a finish of (almost smoked) dark chocolate powder on the very backend. Bottom Line: This is just interesting. It’s a huge outlier for the brand and really hits a lot of great tasting notes. It builds it makes sense and it tastes pretty damn good especially when you really let it bloom with some water or a rock. 8. Old Forester 1910 Old Fine Whisky ABV: 46.5% Average Price: $60 The Whisky: Back in 1910 there was a fire at Old Forester which stopped bottling. Whiskies that were ready had to be re-barreled while everything was rebuilt. This created a great bourbon that’s being replicated in the modern day. To do this Old Forester is re-barreling bourbon for a second maturation before blending proofing and bottling. Tasting Note: Stone fruit really drives the nose with hints of apricot and maybe plum next to sweet and soft cedar and black tea-infused dates. Those dates become a rich and spicy sticky toffee pudding with a thick brandy butter topping next to a hint of oatmeal raisin cookies. The sweetness of the mid-palate gives way to a dark chocolate feel with a flake of salt a hint of masa and plenty of wintry spice leading back to that dark stone fruit with tobacco dryness at the very end. Bottom Line: This is a pretty refined sipper at a great price point. Pour this over a rock or two and you’ll be set.

7. Old Forester Single Barrel 100 Proof ABV: 50% Average Price: $100 The Whisky: This is the same vibe as the single barrel above. The key difference is that these barrel picks are proofed down to 100 proof before bottling. Tasting Note: I tried this from a retailer in Louisville as well and it had a subtle nose of cherry blossom next to a woody maple syrup that almost felt like it had some of the bark in there next to a nice dose of winter spice. The taste complimented the nose with light florals and plummy fruit next to a touch of cherry syrup-soaked cedar planks and a bushel of dark spices. The mid-palate had a slight dark chocolate-covered espresso bean feel to it that led to a finish that was slightly bitter and full of dark fruit and warm spice. Bottom Line: Again this will vary depending on which barrel pick you come across. That being said this was miles above the barrel strength version for me. It’s refined accessible and very deeply flavored with clear “Old Forester” tastes. 6. Old Forester Single Barrel Rye ABV: 61.5% (varies) Average Price: $300 The Whisky: This new release from Old Forester is their signature rye in a single barrel format. It’s bottled without any filtration or cutting with water. Tasting Note: The lemon really shines on the nose to the point that it turns into a pudding with hints of burnt sugar and salted caramel backing it up. The palate takes a bunch of cinnamon sticks and soaks them in apple cherry and plum juice then dries them out while hazelnut builds to an almost Nutella level and that dried dill just sneaks in. The mid-palate really leans into the cinnamon and hazelnut until bold cinnamon attaches to a dry cedar box for very dry and peppery tobacco that’s just touched with mint. Bottom Line: This is a pretty damn fine rye. It also goes down almost shockingly easy for a cask-strength whisky. The spice is tempered well by the fruit and sweetness making this a solid sipper on the rocks or in an amazing Sazerac.

5. Old Forester 150th Anniversary Batch Proof ABV: 62.8% Average Price: $360 The Whisky: This special release from Old Forester celebrates 150 years of whisky making by the brand with “150” at the core of the line. Master Taster Jackie Zykan created three batches of this limited release from 150 barrels that were specifically selected by Master Distiller Chris Morris. Once these bottles are gone there won’t be a whisky like this from Old Forester again. Tasting Notes: Based on Batch no. 1 you’ll be greeted with a mingling of menthol and anise with rich and buttery caramel next to a hint of holiday spices and a touch of sweet fruit. The palate embraces the holiday spice and adds in a peppery edge while the sweetness leans towards pancake syrup with a hint of dark chocolate and old wood beams lurking in the background. The finish marries the dark chocolate to the almost chili pepper spice on the medium-length finish as flourishes of orange oils wet leather and salted caramel kettle corn linger on your nicely warmed senses. Bottom Line: These were pretty solid whiskies all around but didn’t quite hit the amazing highs of the next whiskies on the list. Still you can drink this on the rocks all day and never be bored. 4. Old Forester 2021 Birthday Bourbon ABV: 52% Average Price: $1499 The Whisky: Every year Old Forester releases their most anticipated whisky Birthday Bourbon. This year’s release was a 12-year-old blend created from 119 barrels of the good stuff. Tasting Note: Berries really drive this nose with raspberries in cream next to blackberry compote Luxardo cherries and a touch of cranberry bread with walnuts plenty of spice and a moist buttery vanilla-laden cake vibe. The palate holds onto the syrupy cherry notes but veers more towards vanilla cream with woody spices buttery toffee marzipan and a touch of green pepper pretty far in the background. The mid-palate has an old cigar box feel to it that dries everything out from the cherry to the vanilla creating a sort of thin pecan cookie vibe with dry spice tobacco and berries in the mix. Bottom Line: I know this is the most sought-after expression from Old Forester. But this year’s drop wasn’t their best. And even then this is still a top-four bourbon from the brand without a single doubt. Good luck on your hunt for this one.

3. Old Forester 1897 Bottled in Bond ABV: 50% Average Price: $56 The Whisky: Old Forester 1897 Bottled-in-Bond is the brand’s throwback bottle that celebrates the 1897 act that brought the world bottled-in-bond whisky. The juice in the bottle is a mid-rye bourbon mash that’s aged proofed and bottled in accordance with the bonded laws and regulations. Tasting Notes: This drips with caramel on the nose — the kind that’s a bit tacky and chewy — alongside a touch of orange blossom and maybe a vanilla latte. That vanilla and bitter espresso bean note carry on through the palate as a bowl of red and stone fruits soak in a bowl of brandy with plenty of cinnamon sticks and allspice berries thrown in too. The finish marries all those notes while leaning heavily into the caramel sweetness as it fades away at a good clip. Bottom Line: This is both a great whisky and a great bottled-in-bond. It just hits every note so well that you’re left really searching to try and find any faults (there aren’t many). It’s also a great cocktail bourbon that kills in a Manhattan Sazerac or boulevardier. 2. Old Forester President’s Choice Bourbon ABV: 52% (varies) Average Price: $179 sweepstakes only The Whisky: No this isn’t a bottle made for the U.S. president. The juice in this expression is a single barrel hand-picked by Brown-Forman President Campbell Brown (a direct descendant of George Brown who started the company) with the help of Master Taster Jackie Zykan. Tasting Note: Based on last year’s release this whisky opens with a salted caramel apple nose that edges towards apple saltwater taffy with a creamy layer of spicy dark chocolate and a touch of orange blossoms. The palate takes the wintry spices and attaches them to the creaminess creating an egg nog feel to the taste that leans into dark fruits and a hint of toasted coconut cream pie. The end holds onto the spice but focuses more on anise (and maybe fennel) while the caramel and spice attach to sticky tobacco with a warming end. Bottom Line: The next release is going to be sent out in early January but you can enter to win the chance to buy one right now. These are extremely limited and worth the effort to try and at least win one. You won’t be disappointed when you crack it open.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm56aGVyYWxkLmNvLm56L2J1c2luZXNzL2hvdy1hLWxpdHRsZS1rbm93bi1raXdpLWFkLWFnZW5jeS1sYW5kZWQtdGhlLWFsbGJpcmRzLWFjY291bnQvR1ZWWk5RSE43TUpRSE5DVllVWEMzTEZMRTQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How a little-known Kiwi ad agency landed the Allbirds account,"Wrestler co-founders Kat Lintott and Ben Forman. Photo / Supplied

New Zealand shoemaker Allbirds may have recently listed on the US-based NASDAQ with an IPO raising US$300 million ($445m) but the company hasn't forgotten its roots.

Despite having a market cap in excess of $2 billion the company continues to call on little-known New Zealand ad agency Wrestler to lead all the creative direction and filming for Allbirds campaigns rolled out around the world.

What makes this remarkable is that Allbirds could have its pick of virtually any advertising agency in the world. And yet it has opted to retain its connection with the Wellington-based crew that's been part of the story from the beginning.

So how did this Kiwi collaboration start in the first place?

Wrestler co-founder Ben Forman explains that the partnership extends well beyond the current hype surrounding the IPO.

""[Allbirds founder] Tim Brown approached us when he was more known for his football prowess than anything else"" recalls Forman.

""He just had this crazy idea of making woollen shoes.""

Forman and his team had earlier attracted some attention for their Kickstarter campaign for Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's ""What We Do in the Shadows"" and this led Brown to approach them for some help pushing his audacious idea.

""We made this Kickstarter video and it obviously went bananas and all of a sudden Tim had to actually make all these shoes and deliver them.""

Entrepreneurial journeys rarely run in a linear route and it would be around two years before the paths of Forman and Brown would cross again.

""He got in touch and said: 'Hey man things are up and running and we're now called Allbirds – and we're going to go for it.'

By this stage Allbirds had raised some money and moved its headquarters to San Francisco.

In a serendipitous twist Forman and his partner and fellow co-founder Kat Lintott were heading to the United States at the time and met up with Brown while there.

This discussion led to Wrestler being commissioned to develop the brand launch video for Allbirds.

""This was at a time when we were both small. There were maybe four of us at Wrestler and maybe four of them at Allbirds.""

Forman laughs when he thinks back to how tiny the budget was for that video.

""It was myself on the camera our creative director who wrote it and directed it and my wife Kat produced it. It was just the three of us on this farm with Tim. And we even had his parents doing some cameo stuff.

""We had a script but as we were going we just ad-libbed a lot of it. The place where it really came together was in the edit room.""

With the help of a few quirky subtitles that launch video ultimately caught some decent traction that the company was able to build on in the coming years.

""It all just started really organically and continued that way in the future work that we did"" says Forman.

""Taking a step back now to look at the success of Allbirds from a storytelling perspective I think it's because it's always come from a super authentic place. They've always just had this mission of creating exceptionally great products that have amazing values at their core.

""The product and the purpose is all there. So when it comes to the storytelling you don't have to be a cliche advertiser and make things up. You're just presenting what's already there.""

Looking back at the small budget for that original launch video Forman today jokes that he maybe should have asked to be paid in equity instead.

In November Allbirds listed on the Nasdaq at US$15 before rising swiftly to hit US$29.90. Market uncertainty over the last couple of weeks has however seen the share price drop back down to around $14.20.

""The potential of Allbirds is so massive"" says Forman.

""They're not a flash in the pan brand. They want to be a long-term brand that is here for 10 20 years or even longer.""

As Allbirds went into growth mode after the launch video it started to work with a few bigger agencies both locally and abroad.

""We actually drifted apart for about two years. I think that was for the best at the time. The trajectory of Allbirds was bananas and we just weren't on the same trajectory as a business. They went off and worked with some really amazing agencies.""

Forman says that during this period Wrestler grew up as an agency improving its processes and identifying the kind of work it wanted to do. The Wrestler team has grown from a handful of staff in those early days to a respectable mid-sized agency of 25 staff.

""By the end of 2019 we had positioned Wrestler as a value-led organisation that works with brands that push the collective consciousness forward and isn't here to just sell shit for shit's sake. We wanted to work with brands that are pushing the needle and trying to make the world a better place.

""I couldn't help but see Allbirds as a dream client. And I thought: 'well they were a client. So let's get them back.'""

Forman says that all it took was one call to Brown.

""We called Tim and he was like: 'Yeah man I'd love to work with your guys again.' It was awesome that the relationship was still there.""

Wrestler was then commissioned to work on a few projects alongside bigger agencies.

""All through 2020 we just kept doing more and more work for Allbirds"" says Forman.

The project work was good but Forman felt that he wanted the business partnership needed to be more formalised so he called Brown again at the end of 2020.

""I had this plan of how I was going to word it to Tim but he just front-footed it. He said: 'Hey man we've loved working with you. What we love is the way you partner with us. It just feels like an extension of our team. So we want to make this a bit more official.""

Wrestler wasn't put on a retainer but the agency was given the certainty of a minimum set amount of work every year.

""It was so great to not have to sell myself. We did the work it was noticed and the relationship was solidified.""

With Allbirds now on the stock exchange and moving beyond shoes into other areas the pressure will only grow on Wrestler to ensure it keeps delivering interesting ways to tell the stories of one of New Zealand's most famous brands.

This may well be the start of the next chapter in the shared story of these gutsy Kiwi entrepreneurs.",,,,,,,,,

The October deal established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 per cent aimed at curtailing profit-shifting to lower-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland where many large international firms have their European headquarters.

It will eliminate incentives to shift jobs and profits abroad US President Joe Biden in early October.

But some companies could still use Ireland to reduce their tax bills even after the agreement takes effect according to tax specialists and a Reuters review of corporate filings.

Thats because the new agreement wont stop companies benefiting from a strategy widely implemented in recent years that reduces taxes over a period of up to a decade or more.

Irelands relatively generous tax allowances permit multinationals with a presence in the country to sell intellectual property such as patents and brands from one subsidiary to another to generate deductions that can be used to shield future profits from tax.

Companies that have generated deductions to reduce their taxable income by more than $10 billion each in recent years via this tax-minimizing strategy include US technology companies Adobe Inc and Oracle Corp corporate filings show.

Business-software provider Oracle declined to comment and Adobe creator of software such as Acrobat pdf-maker didn't respond to requests for comment. Both companies have said they conform to relevant tax laws.

The agreement brokered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is due to take effect in 2023.

It was signed by more than 130 jurisdictions including Ireland.

The Irish finance ministry said Irelands tax treatment of intellectual property transactions is in line with other OECD countries.

In response to Reuters questions the OECD acknowledged that companies could continue to benefit from profit-shifting strategies already in place but that it expects companies to be unable to build up such tax shields in the future.

The approach typically relies on a company also having a subsidiary in a country with a corporate income-tax rate of zero such as Bermuda that enables the company to conduct the sale tax free.

By phasing out zero-tax jurisdictions for multinationals the OECD expects the global minimum tax of 15 per cent will make the strategy no longer attractive. Were trying to design rules for the future said John Peterson an OECD official.

Peterson added that the OECD cant be certain how each countrys rules would interact with the global minimum tax. But he said the OECD is confident that abuses will be limited by a requirement that countries calculate taxable income in accordance with accounting rules.

Tax specialists say the deals impact remains unclear because key details are yet to be agreed including how to calculate the pot of profit that is to be taxed.

Countries are currently debating carve-outs for certain tax breaks.

In addition jurisdictions could retain wide latitude in how they allow companies to calculate taxable income the specialists said.

Where there isnt accounting consistency there is scope for gaming said Nicholas Gardner a tax partner at law firm Ashurst in London.

The new rules are expected to be finalized next year and require lawmaker approval in some jurisdictions.

That includes the United States where several top Republican politicians have voiced opposition to the deal.

Malta is another country that permits multinationals to minimize taxes via intra-company intellectual property sales.

Maltas finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment on its intellectual property-related tax allowances.

International pressure forced Ireland in recent years to phase out one of the worlds best-known corporate-tax loopholes known as the double Irish.

In response companies have increasingly accumulated tax deductions known as capital allowances via intra-group sales of intellectual property according to tax advisors economists and company filings.

Since 2015 multinationals have moved hundreds of billions of euros worth of intellectual property into Ireland economists say.

This has led to vast annual tax deductions for foreign companies related to so-called intangible assets more than 45 billion euros in 2019 up from under 2.7 billion euros in 2014 according to data from Irelands tax authority.

The data doesnt break down what portion of those deductions were related to intellectual-property transactions within a corporation.

Virtually every multinational has moved intellectual property said Christopher Sibley a senior statistician at Irelands Central Statistics Office.

The profits being shielded from tax by US-based companies typically come from sales to Europe Asia and Africa according to tax specialists and corporate filings.

The US Treasury loses out because the products and services sold are based on research conducted and investment made in the United States academics say.

The US Treasury declined to comment on whether US companies will continue to take advantage of pre-existing tax strategies or benefit from future ones.

Adobe books most of its sales to non-US clients through an Irish subsidiary based in a four-storey block in an office park outside Dublin corporate filings show.

In 2020 Adobe Systems Software Ireland Ltd purchased intellectual property from another subsidiary that was both an Irish-registered company and a resident in Bermuda for tax purposes.

The set-up meant no tax was due on the $11 billion profit from the sale. Meanwhile Irish-tax resident Adobe Systems Software Ireland registered an $11 billion expense that could be used to offset taxes on profits over a period of about eight years because it is an asset that depreciates over time according to the subsidiaries accounts.

Adobe paid $197 million of tax on $3.1 billion of reported profit in Ireland in 2020 and sales of $5.6 billion according to accounts for its main Irish unit.

This equates to an effective tax rate of about half of Irelands current statutory 12.5 per cent corporate income tax rate thanks to the impact of the capital allowances.

Other US companies that have amassed multi-billion-dollar tax deductions from intellectual property sales to affiliates over the last three years include semiconductor maker Analog Devices Inc medical devices maker Stryker Corp and software group Cadence Design Systems Inc publicly available accounts for their Irish subsidiaries show.

Analog Devices and Stryker said they adhere to tax rules and regulations but declined to answer questions on their specific tax arrangements. Cadence declined to comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(WTOC) - The third-ranked Georgia Bulldogs are heading back to the College Football Playoff for the second time and will play second-ranked Michigan in the Capital One Orange Bowl Dec. 31.

The Bulldogs suffered a stunning loss to Alabama in the SEC Championship game Saturday making the Crimson Tide the top-ranked team.

Georgia and Michigan have only met twice before with both meetings taking place in Ann Arbor: 1957 (Michigan 26 Georgia 0); and 1965 (Georgia 15 Michigan 7).

“On behalf of our team and especially our seniors we are excited to be selected for the College Football Playoff and the opportunity to play in the Capital One Orange Bowl” said UGA head coach Kirby Smart in a statement Sunday.

“Playing in a city and game with such rich tradition will be a rewarding experience and it represents another step for our program at Georgia. It also represents a great challenge playing a team like Michigan which has proven to be one of college football’s most accomplished programs” said Smart.

Georgia has appeared in the Orange Bowl three times: Jan. 1 1942 Georgia 40 TCU 26; Jan. 1 1949 Texas 41 Georgia 28; and Jan. 1 1960 Georgia 14 Missouri 0.

This will be Georgia’s 58th bowl game appearance second most of any team in the country. The Bulldogs’ all-time bowl record is 33-21-3. Georgia is making its 25th consecutive bowl appearance which ranks as the longest active streak in the country.

The other College Football Playoff semi-final game will feature top-ranked Alabama vs. fourth-ranked Cincinnati in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic in Arlington Texas.

Once again for a fifth straight game the Blue Jackets chased the puck around the ice were swarmed in their own zone by a stifling forecheck and didn’t gain enough sustained possession time until it was too late.

The result was a 3-1 loss to the Washington Capitals at Capital One Center for a fourth straight loss to end a brutal four-game road trip that began a week earlier with a decisive 6-2 loss to the St. Louis Blues. Another blowout loss followed Tuesday in Nashville along with a 3-2 defeat Thursday to the Dallas Stars in a game that wasn’t as close as the final score.

Several things were commonalities in each one but the biggest was an inability to consistently outwork the opposition.

""No one’s going to give you a game” Blue Jackets coach Brad Larsen said following the loss to the Capitals. “It’s the NHL. You’ve seen our schedule of who we’re playing. We’re playing all the top teams right now and they’re playing well too. No one’s going to come hand you a game. They’re not. You’ve got to go get it and you’re going to have to find a way and grind through not just for 10 minutes or 12 minutes. Its’ going to have to be shift after shift. We’re learning some hard lessons here.”

What’s most frustrating is the lack of evidence that any learning is taking place.

The Capitals (15-4-6) used the same gameplan against the Blue Jackets (12-10-0) as the Vancouver Canucks Blues Predators and Stars did in the previous four games – all but the Canucks successful in their efforts. Each one of those teams pinned Columbus into its own end of the rink for long stretches and forced turnovers in bushels. All but Vancouver made the Jackets pay a steep price for those gaffes.

The Capitals and Stars didn’t score as much as the Predators and Blues did but they netted enough to win – including Alexander Ovechkin 750th career goal standing up as the winner. Aliaksei Protas also scored for Washington which outshot shot Columbus 32-18 to help Ilya Samsonov (17 saves) earn a win in net.

Garnet Hathaway who elbowed Blue Jackets forward Jakub Voracek to the ice without drawing a penalty late in the third sealed the win by scoring into an empty net with 1:27 left.

Eric Robinson scored the lone goal for the Blue Jackets who got another strong performance in net from rookie Daniil Tarasov (29 saves).

It doesn’t get any easier for the Blue Jackets on Sunday when they’ll face the San Jose Sharks (13-10-1) at Nationwide Arena to conclude their second back-to-back in a week and play their sixth game in nine days.

“It’s hard on everybody but you’ve got to dust yourself off and get ready for the next game because nobody cares – other than our fans and us” Larsen said. “We care but the other teams? They want to kick you while you’re down. There’s no easy way through it … you have to go get it.”

Tarasov impressive again in second start for Blue Jackets

Tarasov drew his second straight start after making his NHL debut with a 34-save loss Thursday in Dallas. He was strong in that game and even better against the Capitals making numerous high-difficulty stops against waves of Washington odd-man rushes.

Tarasov took another tough loss but kept the Blue Jackets in a game that could’ve easily become a blowout with lesser goaltending.

“He’s a phenomenal goalie” said forward Justin Danforth who played with Tarasov to start this season with the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. “I mean I hear it around the room. A lot of guys come up to me and they’re like ‘Wow he’s a top-end goalie.’ And you could see it tonight. He wasn’t nervous at all. You’re playing against Washington they’ve got some big shooters there and he did a great job tonight.”

Tarasov got the nod against the Capitals because Larsen wanted to give Elvis Merzlikins a practice day after a non-COVID illness kept both him and Joonas Korpisalo off the ice Thursday and Friday.

Merzlikins will start Sunday against the Sharks while Korpisalo remains on injured reserve with the illness. Larsen said Merzlikins and Korpisalo took follow-up COVID-19 tests and both passed.

“Just like any winter season there’s going to be flu bugs” Larsen said. “So we’re happy it’s just that.”

Blue Jackets lose steam with another letdown in second period

Just like they did Thursday in Dallas the Blue Jackets lost control of the game in the second period. The Capitals outshot them 13-2 in that frame and Ovechkin scored his deciding goal early into it.

It was the seventh game in a row and 16th time in the first 22 games the Blue Jackets have been outshot.

Blue Jackets coach Brad Larsen wants to see more from Jack Roslovic

Line rushes during the Blue Jackets’ morning skate included a couple surprises.

One was Justin Danforth a 28-year old first-year forward centering the fourth line between Yegor Chinakhov and Gregory Hofmann. The other was more notable because Jack Roslovic didn’t skate on any of the forward lines. He was a healthy scratch for the first time this season and first time since joining the Blue Jackets last season in a trade with the Winnipeg Jets.

Roslovic’s play had picked up after a slow start but Larsen wants to address some issues in his game to see if it can spark more offensive production.

“There’s a better game for Jack” Larsen said. “And when you’re not scoring you’ve got to contribute in other ways. I know he’s got a better game. I’m not going to get more in-depth than that. Him and I we’ve had some conversation we’re going to do some video work and try and get him back to where I think he can be.”

Roslovic tallied four points (two goals two assists) in the previous six games and has a scoring line of 3-5-8 in 20 games. He’s also faring better on faceoffs this season winning 49% of his draws overall and 52% during 5-on-5 but his role and production have yet to mimic what he did last season.

Ovechkin notches another milestone goal against the Blue Jackets

The first time these teams met this season a 4-3 Capitals win Nov. 12 at Nationwide Arena Ovechkin scored the 742nd career goal of his career to pass Brett Hull for sole possession of fourth place on the NHL’s all-time list of goal-scorers.

That was now eight goals ago.

Ovechkin’s hard wrist shot sailed under Tarasov’s blocker and above his right pad into the far side of the net at 3:12 of the second period to put Washington up 2-0 on his 750th career goal. It was also his 20th goal in just 25 games this season continuing a torrid pace in his quest to chase Wayne Gretzky’s all-time record of 894 goals. Next on the list is Jaromir Jagr who’s in third with 766.

“I don't think a lot about this goal” Tarasov said. “It’s just a goal. It doesn’t matter who scored. It was bad because I lose and we lost the game but it doesn't matter. You just forget it and keep going.”

He’ll remember facing Ovechkin though.

“He’s one of the greatest players in the world so it was good to play against him” Tarasov said. “I saw him when I was a kid. It’s like … play against a real legend. It was good.”

Blue Jackets give Justin Danforth first shot to play center

The other side of the coin with Roslovic being scratched was Danforth staying in the lineup. Larsen likes his ‘dog on a bone’ approach as a winger and wanted to see if he could keep it up down the middle of the ice at center – a position he’d played almost exclusively prior to joining the Blue Jackets as a free agent signed out of the Kontinental Hockey League.

Danforth is 5-foot-9 180 pounds and has great speed. Larsen wanted to see what he and Hofmann – another burner – could do while playing together on a line with Chinakhov. The trio was one of the only noticeable groups in the first two periods for Columbus and they produced the goal by Chinakhov that was negated by Hofmann’s missed offsides infraction.

“I don’t think ‘Danny’ deserves to come out” Larsen said after the morning skate. “He’s played his tail off and he’s versatile. He can play in the middle. So he’s been competitive I think he’s been ‘dog on a bone’ and it can’t all the time be (Danforth and Hofmann) coming out.”

Danforth was eager for the opportunity.

“I’m hungry to stay on the roster and stay in the lineup every night so for me I know what I have to do on the ice” he said. “It’s going to be a tough night every night for me with the way I play. If I have to play physical and have to be a bit of a rat and get under guys’ skin then that’s what I have to do. If I can bring that every night and that keeps me in that’s good.”

Blue Jackets three stars

First star

Daniil Tarasov goalie

Tarasov made his second straight start and was the Blue Jackets’ best player for the second straight time. Without his 29 saves including some jaw-droppers this game could’ve easily been a rout for the Capitals.

Second star

Justin Danforth center

Danforth got his first chance to play center and acquitted himself well. Along with delivering three hits and winning five of seven faceoffs (71%) in 10:10 of ice time the speedy undersized forward changed momentum with a beautiful dish to Robinson for the Jackets’ only goal.

Third star

Eric Robinson left wing

Robinson charged to the net and made his stick available for a tap-in off Danforth’s feed from the left side of the net in the third pulling the Blue Jackets within 2-1 early in the third. He also blocked a shot and finished with five attempts in 16:23 of ice time.

The Michigan Wolverines and Georgia Bulldogs will meet in the Capital One Orange Bowl held inside Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on December 31st.

No. 2 seeded Michigan (12-1) advances after winning the Big Ten championship over Iowa on Saturday. It will be the second time the Wolverines advanced to the Orange Bowl having played in December 2016 against FSU.

They had close wins against unranked Rutgers and Nebraska and their only loss was 37-33 at Michigan State. But they got on a roll in late November closing the regular season with a 42-27 win over then-No. 2 Ohio State and putting a 42-3 beat-down on Iowa in the Big Ten championship game on Saturday night.

The Wolverines are in the four-team playoff for the first time after winning their first Big Ten title since 2004. They're also the first team to start a season unranked to make the playoff. They didn't crack the AP Top 25 until after their second game a 31-10 win over Washington on Sept. 11.

No. 3 seeded Georgia (12-1) advances after losing the SEC championship to Alabama who is seeded No. 1 and will play Cincinnati in the other semifinal in the Cotton Bowl. It will be the first Orange Bowl for the Bulldogs since January 1960.

The Bulldogs were No. 5 in the preseason and No. 2 to Alabama in the first five polls of the regular season. They took over the top spot after Alabama lost at Texas A&M on Oct. 9 and were there seven straight weeks.

The Bulldogs went into Southeastern Conference championship game as a touchdown favorite against Alabama. But their offense went flat and committed two turnovers one an interception returned for a touchdown and they converted only 3 of 12 third downs. Alabama's Bryce Young threw for 421 yards and three touchdowns and the Bulldogs lost 41-24.

Defense is the identity for both Michigan and Georgia. The Wolverines feature two of the best defensive ends in the country in Aidan Hutchinson and David Ojabo who have combined for 25 sacks and Georgia has the premier defensive tackle in Outland Trophy finalist Jordan Davis.

The winners of this season’s semifinals will meet January 10th 2022 in Indianapolis in the national title game."

Many of these new car wash places offer the latest technologies and equipment for automatic quick-service car washing while some are sticking to the time-honored model of washing cars using human elbow grease.

“There is a lot of private equity money that is chasing car washes because they have a reputation for being strong cash-flow producers” said Miles Morin a partner in MegaWash which opened a car truck and RV washing facility off U.S. 1 in Hanover County in September.

Car washes remain a largely fragmented service nationwide with no large dominant chains Morin said. “There are a lot of medium-sized players” he said.

Within the past three years car wash businesses such as Flagstop Car Wash MegaWash Rio Car Wash Tommy’s Express and Hogwash have opened new locations in the Richmond area. The car washes are competing by seeking prime real estate locations for new facilities offering membership plans installing high-speed equipment and some offering free vacuum services to make car washing faster and more convenient.

“There is competition that is coming into this market there is no doubt about it” said Rob Worrell a partner in Tommy’s Express Car Wash a franchise operator that has opened two locations in the Richmond area with two more — one on Arthur Ashe Boulevard and one on West Broad Street near state Route 288 — scheduled to open in 2022.

Worrell said he and business partners Thomas Folliard and Mark O’Neil plan to open two car washes a year in central Virginia for at least the next several years. (Folliard is the board chairman at automotive retailer CarMax and is the retail chain’s retired president and CEO. O’Neil is the former chief operating officer of Cox Automotive and a board member of CarMax)

A family-owned business formed in Michigan about 50 years ago Tommy’s Express started franchising about seven years ago and has been on a national growth spurt Worrell said.

“I would say the growth [of car washes] in the Richmond market is not unlike the growth anywhere else” he said. “It is a very sought after business model.”

“We think the Richmond market needs and there is demand for a high-speed high-quality express car wash” Worrell said. “We feel like we have got the best car wash model out there in terms of our equipment and technology.”

Speed and convenience are what a lot of new car washes are going after plus various types of washing equipment that each operator believes will give drivers the most satisfactory clean in the shortest time.

Numerous equipment makers around the country supply car washes. Car wash operators say the cost of opening a location can vary a lot depending on the cost of real estate and the type of equipment installed but a new location will typically cost at least a few million dollars. Profitability depends a lot on volume.

To encourage return visits most of the new car wash services are now offering monthly membership plans that enable drivers to go to their locations and get a wash at any time of day.

Tyree Brown the chief operating officer at Car Pool Car Washes in the Richmond region who is the past president of the Southeastern Car Wash Association from 2019-2020 said several dynamics are at work in the growth of car wash services regionally and nationally.

“There is a lot of consolidation on the equipment side” Brown said. “The express model is becoming a simpler model to open. The barriers to entry are still expensive. However there is a growing need. The more cars that are on the road the more need there is to wash them.”

It also is becoming simper because equipment manufacturers have provided owners with a one-stop shop he said.

“It is not as specialized as it used to be. Fifteen years ago you would have to buy equipment from one person and get your training from another person and get your IT from another vendor and your chemicals from another vendor” Brown said. “What is happening is manufacturers are becoming able to provide all these things from under one roof. It becomes simpler for an investor to go and seek out a manufacturer that can provide them all they need to get into the industry.”

Traditional car wash operators are counting on people to still look for car washes done the old fashioned way with teams of people doing detailed work by hand.

That model includes Car Pool Car Washes a full-service car wash operator which grew from one car wash to seven locations and one detail shop in the Richmond area since the business was founded in 1977.

The company continues to see strong demand despite the new competition entering the market Brown said.

“Every vehicle that comes though one of our sites is finished by a person” Brown said. “That is the big difference. All the other car washes that have come into the market are all for the most part automated and the customer for the most part washes their own car.”

The industry as a whole has exploded in the past 10 years Brown said. “At Car Pool we are having a great year as we come out of the pandemic.”

The pandemic did affect business he said. “Although people still wanted to have their cars cleaned so many people were so apprehensive about allowing people inside of their cars. People were not driving as much and the lack of traffic did slow things down.”

While many of the company’s competitors have focused on exterior car washes Car Pool continues to offer full-service car washes including interior cleaning.

“There is no doubt that [automated] car washes do a nice job at what they do” Brown said. “But what we offer when people come to us is that they get a great cleaning inside as well as outside of the vehicle. When you go to an express car wash you get out of the car and you vacuum it yourself. That depends a lot on the person’s capacity to do that themselves.”

Car Pool has one of its locations — on Chamberlayne Avenue in Richmond — that offers only exterior car washes. Free self-vacuum is available with all paid washes.

Despite automation changing the car wash industry over the years Car Pool remains committed to being a full-service car wash operator he said.

When husband-and-wife team Tom and Janet Hogg were looking to open a car wash in the Richmond area in 2018 they got help from Sonny’s Car Wash Services a Florida-based supplier of car wash equipment and washing chemicals.

“I studied the process for a good year — developing a business plan meeting the right people and asking the right questions” Tom Hogg said. “I was able to get some good guidance from people who were knowledgeable in the industry.”

Tom Hogg works another full-time business job in eastern Henrico but he and Janet saw a business opportunity to open a new car wash in the East End.

“I had been used to getting my car washed at an express exterior car wash in town and there were none in the East End that I thought were at the same quality level” Tom Hogg said. “I saw an opportunity to meet a market need there and it turned out to be a pretty good guess.”

In June 2018 the Hoggs bought and renovated a car wash at 6100 Nine Mile Road that had opened in 1986. “It was sort of an obvious choice for what we would name it” Tom Hogg said. “And it has been fun to create a brand.”

They worked with Sonny’s Car Wash to get equipment. Sonny’s also runs a “car wash college” that Janet Hogg and some other members of the Hogwash staff have attended.

“Some of my friends laughed at me but it was wonderful” said Janet Hogg who manages the Hogwash business. “It is a week-long intensive educational program.”

Their second Hogwash Express Car Wash location recently opened on West Broad Street. “We did more business here the first month than we did at Nine Mile Road the first month which is not surprising” given the location along a main thoroughfare through Richmond Janet Hogg said.

What the company has been doing at its Nine Mile Road location is to establish itself as a neighborhood car wash by sponsoring school athletics programs and nonprofits in the area.

“What is fulfilling as a business owner is to see folks out of their cars and talking to each other because they are neighbors” Tom Hogg said.

******

Green Clean Express Auto Wash also is expanding into the Richmond region.

The Ohio-based company has two locations in the region under construction — one near Brook and Parham Road and the other at 4810 Nine Mile Road.

It recently bought an acre of land at 9486 W. Broad St. in Henrico for its third area location according to commercial real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield | Thalhimer which handled the sale.

Green Clean also recently acquired multiple properties in Portsmouth along with sites in Suffolk Norfolk Chesapeake and Charlottesville.

Construction is currently underway on nine additional sites with more than a dozen Green Clean Express locations slated to open across the region by the first quarter of 2022.

******

The MegaWash in Hanover is seeking to differentiate itself by offering services that other car washes don’t have such as an automated car polishing bay.

“Our focus and what sets us apart is our the ability to wash any vehicle big or small and the ability to do is fast for value” Morin said. “In 15 minutes you can get a car washed dried and polished and you are back on the road.”

MegaWash also invested in another service that it expects will help differentiate itself. The company built a 20-foot tall and 100-foot long automatic RV wash. That goes along with the RV storage lot that the company opened on its 6-acre development.

“We think we can create a business facility with multiple income streams that will perform better than one that is just doing single service” Morin said.

“The business concept is to cater to RV owners and their cars” Morin said. ‘We can wash anything that a family owns whether it is an RV or a pickup truck.”

“We’re about 50% RVs and 50% commercial vehicles” at the RV-size wash Morin said adding that the company chose its location just off U.S. Route 1 near Ashland partly because it is near a number of trucking companies.

Henrico County resident Greg Schroder parks his 40-foot RV at the Megawash RV park and he took it through the wash there one recent weekday.

“For me trying to wash it on my own — it is so difficult” he said. “The wash here is fantastic.”

“As far as I know it is one of a kind in the country.” said Schroder who has owned an RV for four years. “I used to have to take it to a place where they scrubbed it by hand. Here you have got storage and the wash and it doesn’t get any more convenient than that.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although she was looking a little worse for wear earlier this year when she entered dry-dock she is now looking new again.

The Carnival cruise ship received the new livery during her dry dock and is now all set to welcome guests onboard again which is happening a little sooner than anticipated. The vessel will be one of two ships to take over the cancelled itineraries of Carnival Horizon which needs to go to dry dock to repair issues that affect her maximum sailing speed.

Carnival Sunshine Completes Much Needed Dry Dock

The Sunshine-class Carnival Sunshine entered dry dock in Cadiz Spain on October 21 2021. During the time in the dock and as seen in the photos by Barcoz Por Cadiz she received the new red white and blue livery which has already rolled out to eight Carnival cruise ships along with the new Mardi Gras. She looked like she needed it as many months without guests had left Carnival Sunshine a little rusty.

Besides the new livery the vessel mainly underwent standard maintenance in the technical and hotel areas during dry dock. This usually includes new carpeting tiling and standard maintenance which Carnival cannot do while guests are onboard.

The 102853-gross ton vessel is now finished with dry dock and making her way across the Atlantic Ocean where she just sailed past the island of Madeira. It’s excellent timing for Carnival Cruise Line that the vessel has now completed her dry dock.

In just a few weeks she will be sailing with guests again. Carnival Sunshine had been scheduled to officially return to service from Charleston South Carolina on January 13 but her return is now scheduled for December 19.

Carnival Sunshine Returns Early

Carnival Sunshine is one of two cruise ships scheduled to take over the cancelled cruises from Carnival Horizon the other vessel being Carnival Liberty. Horizon suffered issues earlier this week that affected her maximum sailing speed and as such needed to go for an urgent dry dock.

Carnival Sunshine will return earlier than expected from her operational pause. So far Carnival has scheduled three cruises for her initially scheduled for Carnival Horizon. On December 19 Sunshine will sail on a 7-Day Exotic Eastern Caribbean from Miami. Ports of call include Princess Cays in The Bahamas; San Juan Puerto Rico; Charlotte Amalie St. Thomas USVI; and Amber Cove in the Dominican Republic.

The second voyage sails on December 26. This 5-Day Bahamas cruise which also sails from Miami calls in Amber Cove and is currently also scheduled for Grand Turk. Whether this call in Grand Turk will go ahead remains to be seen. This week Carnival changed the itineraries for three Carnival ships of which two were due in Grand Turk.

The final cruise that Carnival Sunshine is currently scheduled to sail for Carnival Horizon sails on December 31 giving guests the chance to celebrate New Year’s Eve onboard. This 8-day voyage will call in the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba and Curacao before finishing the voyage in Bimini in The Bahamas.

From January 13 2022 the 3002-passenger vessel will be based in her original home port of Charleston South Carolina. From here she will sail a series of cruises to The Bahamas and the Caribbean ranging in length from 4-10 days.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyL2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1saW5lLWZsZWV0LXVwZGF0ZS1kZWNlbWJlci1lZGl0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Line Fleet Update: December Edition,"Building up on its restart plan Carnival Cruise Line is reactivating more ships in December.

Olds jokes about a keyboard-player friend “who laments that a person can pay a quarter of a million dollars for a violin which has [only] four strings.” Compare that to an 88-key piano — which is not only “vastly more complex” Olds points out “but you have to pay someone to haul it off.”

For several years Olds has been creating assemblage installations using a variety of found and salvaged items. Pianos are notoriously hard to move whole and one day his daughter told him her neighbor wanted to give away just some parts with the requirement that they be used in an art project. “That was me for sure!” exclaims Olds — and that was the beginning of the Piano Bones series.

“I acquired pieces from two more pianos just by talking to people about my work. I recently got an entire player piano which I am very excited about.” (It’s stored in his studio awaiting deconstruction.) Olds is especially drawn to the moving pieces of a piano the interior levers and hammers: “These intricate precision wooden pieces are so cool.” Occasionally though he’ll incorporate bits that did not enjoy a previous life as part of a piano such as wooden furniture parts or sand-casting patterns.

First he must deconstruct the piano “action” — the moving parts that connect the keys to the hammers (which hit the strings). In accumulating these small mechanisms “sometimes ideas begin to jell at that point — I love sorting.” That’s a trait that can probably be traced to his training as an engineer testing engines for Rolls Royce in Indianapolis.

Even before retirement Olds dabbled in art doing acrylic paintings photography rubbings assemblage and hand-made paper casting but now that he and his wife are settled in North Carolina near their daughter in Asheville he can devote more hours to his innovative craft.

“I believe I can make art out of just about anything if I have enough of it” says Olds. First though he might study an arrangement of parts for weeks tweaking it occasionally to arrive at a satisfying design. He admits he sometimes hits a dead end where an interesting composition refuses to present itself. “I then either give it more time or give up and start over with different parts.” Those parts are sometimes painted or varnished and then the artist prepares a mounting board where he draws a layout and eventually glues down the material. His finished pieces range in size from one that is 36” x 72” (titled “Eighty-Eight Notes”) to 9 ½ ” x 72” (“The Choir”).

Olds is a house artist at Mars Landing Galleries a new venue in Mars Hill. Gallery owner Miryam Rojas mentions “Perry’s transition from a long engineering career to a free-spirited artist — I love that.”

He says his assemblages aren’t meant to convey any particular message. “I’m just thrilled to present art that others find fascinating to look at. It’s rewarding when others find joy in my work.”

Perry Olds Mars Hill home-studio visits by appointment (contact the artist at oldwillow22@gmail.com). Olds is represented by Mars Landing Galleries (37 Library St. Mars Hill marslandinggalleries.com)."

Indeed crime ­– theft and burglary in particular – was so rampant that in 1818 the Government resorted to holding a talent contest for the security industry. The Locks Factor if you like.

It proved to be a stroke of genius. Because not only did the winner 28-year-old Jeremiah Chubb come up with something incredibly clever and innovative. But he also used his 100 guineas prize money to start up a business that would lead the world. And from a base in the heart of the West Midlands.

This week's edition is about not one but several Great Lives because the success story behind the Chubb lockmaker was very much a family affair. But it was Jeremiah's invention that lit the torch and his older brother Charles whose persistence and business acumen created a security giant.

Jeremiah Chubb was born in Fordingbridge Hampshire on June 10 1790 18 years after his older brother Charles.

Having served an apprenticeship as a blacksmith Charles set up in business selling specialised ironmongery to the shipping industry first operating out of Winchester before moving to Portsea in the Portsmouth docklands in 1804. It was the height of the Industrial Revolution and there was plenty of money to be made selling ironware for use on ships. But as growth of industry led to levels of wealth and prosperity never seen before this also meant soaring crime rates. Unsurprisingly the naval stores around Portsmouth where all manner of goodies were kept were particularly susceptible and after joining his brother's business Jeremiah realised there could be a serious market for an ultra-secure lock that would put paid to the pilfering once and for all.

Jeremiah was just eight years old when his older brother married Maria Hayter on August 20 1798 possibly against the wishes of both families as no members of either family attended the wedding. It appears Jeremiah was living with Charles and his family when he developed his 'detector lock' that would change both their lives.

The Chubb detector lock

The 'detector lock' was unique in that it had a 'self destruct' mechanism that would render it inoperable if an attempt was made to pick it or open it with the wrong key. This not only made it more difficult for the criminally inclined to gain illicit access it also warned the owner that an attempt had been made to break into his property. The lock could be reset but only with a special regulating key that came with the lock.

In 1818 100 guineas or £105 was about the equivalent of £10000 today. Not a vast fortune but Jeremiah was determined to use it wisely and began recruiting rim and cabinet locksmiths at his brother's shop in Portsmouth – by advertising in the Wolverhampton Chronicle. There was a certain logic to this; at that time nearby Willenhall was the lockmaking capital of the country and there would be far more highly skilled workers in the West Midlands than in Portsmouth.

By this time the brothers probably already had one eye on the future and within two years they opened a lock and safe manufacturing works in Temple Street Wolverhampton with the lockmakers who moved to Portsmouth to join the company presumably returning home.

There is an unsubstantiated but nevertheless enjoyable tale about how the manner in which the fledgling business secured a royal warrant from Prince Regent George IV in 1823.

An advertisement in Melville's 1851 Wolverhampton Directory

In a 1951 interview with an Australian newspaper Charles' great-great grandson the Hon George Chubb painted a rather colourful meeting when the future king summoned Charles Chubb to meet him aboard the royal yacht.

""Charles Chubb arrived with his lock was ushered into a cabin and instructed to await the arrival of the King"" he said.

""He placed his lock on a nearby chair and started to wander round the cabin examining the pictures.

""While he was occupied in gazing at the seascapes King George swept into the cabin and sat down right on top of the lock.

""It’s an old joke in our family that that lock made such an 'impression' on him that he granted us a royal warrant which we’ve had ever since.""

A less colourful version of the story is that Charles Chubb was demonstrating his locks to the captain of a battleship in Portsmouth harbour when the King came aboard. The flustered captain attempted to push Chubb out of the way but George IV called him back and was so enthralled by his sales pitch that he invited him to London.

""I and my friends will make your lock known"" George is said to have told him.

This strange contraption was used to display the priceless Koh-i-Nor diamond at the 1851 Festival of Britain

What is known is that George IV was a huge supporter of Chubb in its early days and it was major contracts with public bodies which secured the company's future.

Which was just as well as the company appeared to have overstretched itself with its expansion in Wolverhampton and sometime shortly after the move Jeremiah is thought to have moved first to France then to the US to flee from his creditors. It appears that Charles may also have been subjected to bankruptcy procedures but nevertheless persisted with the business and achieved the breakthrough in 1820 when he persuaded the Admiralty to issue a contract to supply its locks. In 1823 similar deals were struck with the Post Office and the prison service which operated prison ships in Portsmouth and after a shaky start the business was firmly established.

Charles made more friends in high places in 1828 when the Duke of Wellington called upon Chubb to pick open his front door at Aspley House and supply four new locks.

This was four years after Charles had patented an improved detector lock which did away with the need for the separate regulator key and in 1835 he developed a burglar-resistant safe. The years that followed saw rapid expansion first with the opening of the company's safe works in Cowcross Street close to Smithfield Market in London and then to a new works on the corner of Horseley Fields and Mill Street in Wolverhampton where it would make about 28000 locks a year.

The company became a master of marketing and visitors to exhibitions would regularly be challenged to pick the 1818 lock which remained undefeated until somebody managed to beat it at the Great Exhibition of 1851. And the Great Exhibition saw the greatest publicity stunt yet when Chubb managed to get hold of the huge Koh-i-Nor diamond – one of the crown jewels – to exhibit in a secure cage on its stand. At night on the touch of a spring by the custodian the Koh-i-Nor and two smaller diamonds would ""sink into a massive iron box of impregnable strength and fall into a pedestal of solid masonry"". The company must have been very confident in its product; the adverse publicity had somebody managed to steal the Koh-i-Nor doesn't bear thinking about.

Chubb's show-stopping stand at the 1851 Festival of Britain

The Chubb stand appears to have made an impression on Queen Victoria who wrote in her private diary: ""Chubb's locks were the first exhibits we regularly inspected and they really are wonderful of every size and kind. He explained to us the ingenious manner by which an attempt to form the lock is discovered."" The company's efforts were rewarded with the Exhibition's Prize Medal.

In 1855 the Post Office installed its first pillar box which was fitted with a Chubb lock as most future ones would be.

After a spell working in the US as a machinist Jeremiah returned to Britain in 1828. It was another 11 years however before his name appeared in any patents and he may have worked as a travelling rep for Chubb's products until his only son died of measles. His wife Emilia returned to America and it is thought Jeremiah hoped to follow her but by this time he was in poor health and died in Winchester on November 10 1847.

Charles Chubb was a staunch Wesleyan Methodist known for his donations to charity although it appears the extent of his generosity may not have extended to his own family: it appears Jeremiah or 'Uncle Jerry' as he was known to younger relatives acted as a conduit for family members seeking financial assistance.

Charles and Maria Chubb had 11 children – eight daughters and three sons – and when Charles died on May 16 1846 it was his youngest son John who took over the running of the company which had already been renamed Charles Chubb & Son. His widow Maria died seven months later. Charles left £16000 in his will – about £2 million today – which was divided between his eight surviving children.

John Chubb took over the business on the death of his father Charles

John ran the business until his death in 1872 when he was succeeded by his sons John Charles George Hayter and Harry Withers.

George would emerge as the driving force becoming chairman of the new limited company. This period coincided with rising crime levels across the Atlantic and Chubb responded by opening a subsidiary in the US. George was knighted in 1885 and made a Baronet in 1900 given the baronial title as the 1st Baron Hayter as it was considered improper that the name of a company could be used in the House of Lords. In 1909 he was made a Freeman of the Borough of Wolverhampton. He retired as chairman in 1938 but remained managing until his death in 1946 at the age of 98 when he was succeeded by his brother Harry.

The firm briefly left Wolverhampton in 1882 when the lease on the factory in Horseley Fields had expired and the lock works moved to London. But the exile was shortlived the company opening its imposing landmark building in Railway Street in 1889 the new works capable of accommodating 350 locksmiths and a similar number of safe makers.

The expansion continued into the 20th century and in 1938 a new lock works opened at Wednesfield Road in Heath Town bringing the total factory space to more than 6.5 acres.

The Chubb works in Horseley Fields

In 1956 Chubb took over the famous lock and safe maker Hobbs Hart and Co Ltd and in 1961 the company strated making fire-resistant safe deposit lockers at Park Lane in Wolverhampton.

Chubb remained a family business until 1984 when it was taken over by Racal Electronics although Bill Chubb 4th Lord Hayter remained with the company until 1984.

A takeover by Williams Holdings in 1997 and a further takeover by Swedish group Assa Abloy three years later saw the break-up of Chubb as we know it. Assa Abloy used the Chubb name for its locks until 2010 and Chubb Fire & Security is now owned by the US Carrier Global.

Chubb vacated its famous red-brick factory in the centre of Wolverhampton in the 1960s but restoration work began on the building in the 1970s and in 1984 the Light House media centre opened in part of the building.

Riding a Caterpillar-backed Panigale V4R with standard electronics Miller qualified second for his debut races at The Bend Motorsport Park behind fellow Ducati rider reigning and soon-to-be 2021 ASBK champion Wayne Maxwell.

Race one was red-flagged after six laps when Miller (Michelin tyres) was sitting second to Maxwell (Pirelli).

The three-lap restart proving short lived for the #43 who had been struggling with his starts but this time snatched the holeshot before being embroiled in some frantic passes with the likes of Maxwell and Glenn Allerton.

But Miller was then being taken out when Aiden Wagner attempted to pass but lost the front and sent them both into the dirt.

Race two saw more red flags this time on the opening lap with Miller settling into fourth after a slow getaway on the restart. The double 2021 MotoGP race winner then passed Oli Bayliss son of Troy to move into third before successfully chasing down leaders Maxwell and Allerton.

Maxwell upped his pace to pull 3.8s clear of Allerton's BMW in the closing stages for a perfect double in what could be his final ASBK event.

Miller slipped two seconds from Allerton and had his hands full holding off a late charge from the Dunlop-shod Yamaha of Cru Halliday to confirm the final place on the rostrum.

Miller celebrated by entertaining the fans with his repertoire of wheelies and burn-outs on the slow down lap.

""I think we can be pretty happy with that result"" said Miller denied the chance to race in front his home Phillip Island MotoGP fans for the past two seasons due to Covid.

""The boys really rode good today. I'm normally pretty good at starts but with this thing I'm trying to take off like I'm at the traffic lights and it won't work!

""It was a lot of fun. Thanks to everyone for coming it's awesome to see ASBK like this.

""I love racing motorcycles that's the whole reason we're here and I'd love to come back and do it again.""

Built with a new reduced radius design the 304 features a narrow 1700-mm (66.9-in) track width 254 mm (10 in) slimmer than the 304 E2 for more versatility and access to confined spaces. While narrower the new 304 design increases the performance balance and stability of the 4-tonne class model. Its reduced radius allows for greater stability both 360-degree and when traveling with loads while its extra counterweight option takes the model to an even higher level of stability.

Compact performance of the 305 CR

The new engine on the 5-tonne class Cat 305 CR Excavator delivers nearly 9% greater power to increase machine performance. Hydraulic system improvements provide higher breakout forces – 49.2 kN (11061 lbf) bucket 28.3 kN (6362 lbf) standard stick and 25.2 kN (5665 lbf) long stick – to improve digging efficiency in hard rock applications. It also offers 140 mm (5.6 in) deeper dig depths than the 305 E2 giving it more application flexibility. Its compact radius swing reduces overhang when working to the side while its 1980-mm (78-in) track width and new extra counterweight option help to optimize stability and lift performance in confined spaces.

Advanced efficiency

Both excavator models now offer an angle dozer blade option to optimize machine flexibility in backfilling and finish grading applications. In addition to offering ample above- and below-grade travel with standard float function for easy clean-up the angle blade moves 45 degrees left or right of center. Increasing efficiencies and reducing operator interaction with final grading angle blade movement is controlled by the right-hand joystick while the left joystick handles machine drive.

Tailoring machine weight to job requirements interchangeable counterweight packages offer the balance between low ground pressure and lifting performance. Their industry-exclusive Cat Stick Steer System simplifies machine control by allowing the operator to switch from conventional lever/foot-pedal steering controls to low-effort joystick operation. Two travel speed ranges and standard cruise control facilitate moving around the jobsite with minimum operator interaction.

Meeting U.S. EPA Tier 4 Final and EU Stage V emission standards the turbocharged Cat C1.7 Turbo engine delivers higher power than the previous C2.4 engine. Standard auto idle auto engine shutdown and efficient load-sensing hydraulics with variable displacement pump help to lower fuel usage at the site for more affordable operation. High main-relief pressures coupled with flow rates generates the hydraulic capacity for high digging and lifting forces and more efficient use of a range of attachments. Complete with quick-disconnect lines the standard auxiliary system provides the choice of one-way two-way or continuous flow.

Next-generation comfort savings

Common to most Cat next-generation mini hydraulic excavators the sealed and pressurized cab enclosure is available with heating and/or air conditioning for all-weather climate control. The cab’s large glass areas plus skylight afford all-around visibility. The large display with an advanced touchscreen option provides intuitive machine function control and easy monitoring of critical operating parameters. A canopy option is available in some regions.

Daily maintenance checks for the 304 and 305 CR are quickly made from ground level through side doors. Expanded use of common parts throughout the line plus their damage-resistant exterior construction help to reduce parts inventory investment and lower repair costs. Increased service intervals mean these excavators spend more time on the job and less time in the shop.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzA1L3RvLWJlc3Qtc3VwcG9ydC1uYXRpdmUtd2lsZGxpZmUtZ3Jvdy10aGVzZS1maXZlLWtleXN0b25lLXRyZWUtc3BlY2llcy1pbi15b3VyLXlhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maine Gardener: To best support native wildlife grow these five keystone tree species in your yard,"When Anna Fialkoff a program manager for Wild Seed Project said in a Zoom program for the Native Plant Trust that five keystone species are needed to create a healthy habitat for wildlife in New England it set off a childish competitive reaction in me.

Our yard has only two of the five and I wanted to run out and buy the other three so our yard would be complete.

Those five keystone species are oaks which support more than 500 species of butterflies and moths; willows cherries and birches more than 400 each; and poplars more than 300. Fialkoff said she got those figures from Doug Tallamy’s “Bringing Nature Home.”

Our yard has many oaks and has since we moved here in 1975. It’s the predominant tree in our town and a few years ago when winter moth caterpillars were decimating oaks people were advised to plant other species. A tachnid fly biocontrol has reduced the winter moth threat and oaks are again thriving. I have seen some winter moths this year but fewer than five or six years ago.

We also have a lot of black cherry – one large tree and a grove of smaller ones – that I discovered only last year.

We don’t however have any of the other three keystone trees. And after an hour or so checking catalogs and other sources I’ve decided we can have an environmentally supportive yard without them. And you could too – although if you have none of the five you should get at least one.

It turns out according to the Maine Forest Services’ “Forest Trees of Maine” revised in 2008 that willows “are found along streams and ponds.” We don’t have those on our property.

One poplar prefers “low bottomlands along rivers” although others might fit our habitat.

Five types of birches are listed in “Forest Trees of Maine” and many birches grow in our town. We could grow a birch but I’m not sure we could find a suitable spot for it.

Fialkoff said that trees that support butterflies and moths are important not only for the species themselves but for how they affect other species in the food chain especially in their caterpillar stage. “Caterpillars are a great protein-rich food for birds” she said. “They are like a miniature sausage.”

Fialkoff mentioned the Cecropia moth also known as the giant silk moth. The largest moth in North America it gets as large as some small birds. It spends most of its almost year-long life as a caterpillar living in trees especially black cherries molting several times and feeding on the leaves. Few of the caterpillars survive the several stages to become moths. And as moths the insect lives just 10 days.

One other host I found when I researched the subject online is maples. This pleased me because we have several red maples on our property – all were either here when we moved in or self-seeded with no help from us beyond our clearing out their competition. The red maples are my favorite tree on our property. We tapped them to make maple syrup when our children were young. They aren’t as productive as sugar maples but they do produce syrup. The leaves are beautiful and drop early – unlike our oaks and the evil Norway maples on our neighbors’ properties – and they are thin so they decompose quickly.

I was surprised that maples were not among the five keystone species and I asked Fialkoff about it. They are a valuable and important species she agreed supporting more than 300 species of moths and butterflies. Her answer confirmed my decision not to run out and buy a birch.

Despite its spot as the top keystone species I have a love/hate relationship with oaks. Yes they are stately and handsome but if my wife Nancy and I didn’t spend many hours each year weeding our gardens both ornamental and vegetable the oaks would overtake the gardens. During a single afternoon of weeding we can weed more than 100 sprouted acorns especially after the high acorn crops of the past two years. This year’s crop has been much smaller thankfully although the acorns themselves seem to be larger.

During her talk Fialkoff talked about more than big trees. Think of garden design in layers she told listeners. Plant tall trees as one layer shrubs (including small ones such as native viburnums and serviceberry aka Amelanchier) as the middle layer and perennials for the layer closest the ground. She suggested herbaceous perennials such as milkweeds coral honeysuckle (which supports hummingbirds) asters and goldenrods.

Let me return to trees to close. Our neighbor Kathy Tarpo who is horticulture instructor at Portland Arts and Technology High School pointed one out to me last spring. I hadn’t noticed it before because it is surrounded by oaks and it’s either on our property line or on the neighbor’s property – which is OK because nature doesn’t recognize property lines anyway. It’s the shagbark hickory which supports more than 200 moths and butterflies less than half of what oaks do. But the nuts are edible and non-moth wildlife loves them. Plus this human loves the way the tree looks.

The Toronto Stock Exchange is a bit of a mess. John McKenzie the market’s boss wouldn’t want it any other way.

On a Wednesday morning in late November the chief executive of TMX Group Ltd. joined executives at tech company Coveo Solutions to open TSX trading in a ceremony that scattered confetti across the exchange’s newly-opened event space. They were celebrating an initial public offering that valued the Montreal-based artificial intelligence platform at $1.7-billion.

By early afternoon Mr. McKenzie was avoiding tiny pieces of white and blue paper while leading a tour of the new cathedral for capitalists a basketball-court-sized facility full of flashing screens spotlights and cameras that opened in late October.

Mr. McKenzie has cause for celebration at the country’s premier marketplace operator which also owns the Montreal Exchange and the TSX Venture Exchange. In his first media interview since becoming CEO in August 2020 – the COVID-19 pandemic put a halt to face-to-face meetings – the new(ish) CEO says he’s now winning a global battle to secure new listings from public companies the lifeblood of every exchange.

“We have a unique platform in Canada as the operator of junior and senior markets and we’re successfully selling that platform to the world” Mr. McKenzie said.

He is also well into a cultural makeover that saw the TMX Group’s previous CEO Lou Ecclestone retire early after an investigation into what some employees described as a toxic workplace.

However Mr. McKenzie faces a daunting challenge as the mid-tier exchange operator goes up against far larger foreign rivals all of them focused on snapping up data services and trading platforms to achieve the same goal of global scale and relevance.

In his short time as CEO Mr. McKenzie has seen the landscape reshaped by Nasdaq’s US$2.75-billion acquisition of Newfoundland-based fraud-detection software company Verafin Inc. and the London Stock Exchange’s US$27-billion purchase of data provider Refinitiv.

As CEO of a company with a $7-billion market capitalization – impressive but rival Nasdaq Inc. is five times larger – Mr. McKenzie said “Our balance sheet has never been stronger.” Yet despite having money on hand and global ambitions Mr. McKenzie said the TMX will not rush to do deals. With the lofty valuations today we will likely wait for a tech market correction before we make a major acquisition” he said.

While patience may be financially prudent investors are signalling their impatience with a perceived slower pace of change at TMX than at peers such as Nasdaq. In a recent report Scotia Capital analyst Phil Hardie noted that for many years TMX and the U.S. exchange commanded roughly the same stock market valuation.

That began to change in January as Nasdaq’s acquisitions added new data platforms that generate reliable revenue and Nasdaq’s own stock price soared. Nasdaq shares now trade at a 30-per-cent premium to the valuation on TMX’s stock as measured by the two companies’ ratios of EBITDA compared with their enterprise value.

“We see parallels between Nasdaq and TMX’s approach to using M&A to accelerate their transformation strategy” Mr. Hardie said. “We believe Nasdaq is roughly 24 months ahead of TMX with respect to its transformation.”

Today’s TMX is already radically different from the exchange Mr. McKenzie joined 21 years ago after a stint in the finance team at Procter & Gamble. A generation back the fortunes of an exchange rose and fell on stock trading volumes. Today TMX is increasingly a tech company selling software and data while also serving as a forum for raising money and trading.

TMX’s most recent quarterly financial results show trading brought in just 22 per cent of TMX revenues down from 40 per cent 10 years ago. In contrast data services and capital raising each accounted more than a third of TMX revenues and are growing at a double-digit pace.

“TMX underwent a significant transformation over the past five years which we believe enhanced its resilience and growth prospects” said Mr. Hardie. He said over time Mr. McKenzie will pull the trigger on acquisitions of data-based businesses similar to the London-based energy trading platform Trayport which TMX acquired in 2017 in a $931-million deal. Trayport is now growing at a 10 per cent annual clip.

But Mr. Hardie cautioned that “with public market multiples remaining elevated across the tech sector we believe the timeline for TMX’s next material acquisition is uncertain and potentially extended.”

In the final weeks of his first full year as CEO Mr. McKenzie is on the verge of setting records for welcoming new issuers to Canadian public markets and for raising money. Through the end of October 371 companies joined the TSX or TSX Venture exchanges.

The explosive growth in listings includes 34 companies headquartered outside Canada including a California winemaker a North Carolina clean-tech company and a Bermuda-based reinsurer.

The number of companies choosing to trade on TMX exchanges this year matches new listings at far larger U.S. marketplaces such as Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange and far exceeds the number of debuts on rival Asian Australian and European exchanges.

Looking ahead Mr. McKenzie said “Our relationships with private companies and investment banks give us a good sense of what’s coming and we see the strength in new listings continuing next year.”

The hot run in new listings and number of international achievements – in September the Montreal Exchange launched derivatives trading in Asian time zones – mark an impressive debut for a CEO who wasn’t even sure he wanted the top job.

Mr. McKenzie aged 49 and an accountant by training was the TMX’s chief financial officer in January 2020 when the company’s board led by chair and investment banking veteran Chuck Winograd asked him to step up as interim CEO.

His predecessor Mr. Ecclestone retired with a year left on his employment contract after the TMX launched a review of his leadership. An external investigator found Mr. Ecclestone bullied and humiliated employees. After he departed the TMX board said in a statement it is “committed to creating a collegial culture and treating people with dignity and respect.”

At the time Mr. McKenzie was supporting his 16-year-old son through eventually successful treatment for bone cancer. “The interim appointment worked two ways” Mr. McKenzie said. “The organization was able to test me while I had time to deal with my son’s health issues then ensure I could make a difference and had something to add.”

“John represents safe hands” said Nicholas Thadaney who ran the TSX as the TMX’s president of global equity capital markets before departing in 2018. “Everyone is comfortable with John after the drama of recent years. He’s a strong thoughtful leader.”

Part of Mr. McKenzie’s pitch to the TMX board was the need for the CEO to be “an advocate for markets and an advocate for Canada something my predecessors did not do.” Since winning the job in the summer of 2020 – over rivals who included two other internal candidates – Mr. McKenzie has become one of a few CEOs willing to routinely take political stands.

In the recent federal election Mr. McKenzie wrote a “call to action” for political leaders that urged Ottawa to simplify tax rules support entrepreneurs and partner with business on environmental issues.

In an interview he said another one of his priorities is getting Ontario’s Progressive Conservative government to make markets more efficient by adopting the national securities market passport system that allows companies to access capital across the country while dealing with only one provincial regulator. Ontario is the only province remaining outside the 16-year-old accord.

Until he began returning to the office in July Mr. McKenzie led TMX from a basement office in his Burlington home setting strategy on video calls against a backdrop of a Peloton bike and his kids’ guitars. Remote work was nothing new: Mr. McKenzie earned a MBA from the University of Edinburgh but only visited the campus in Scotland to graduate.

After being named CEO Mr. McKenzie built bonds with the TMX’s executive team with events such as virtual wine tastings bringing in a sommelier after delivering three interesting bottles to each of his colleagues.

In contrast to the relatively high employee turnover that marked Mr. Eccleston’s time at TMX the company’s executive ranks have been stable on the new CEO. Mr. McKenzie has also added an experienced head of human resources – former Cineplex executive Cindy Bush – and a new chief financial officer former CIBC banker David Arnold.

But at the same time as the TMX scouts for international acquisitions its management team faces new challengers in domestic markets. In November Chicago-based Cboe Global Markets Inc. – a US$14-billion company – announced it is buying Toronto-based stock exchange operator NEO Exchange. It is Cboe’s second Canadian acquisition in as many years.

The six-year-old NEO Exchange targets the same innovation-economy stock listings that TMX covets and Cboe plans to expand the platform. Mr. McKenzie said increased competition will be good for customers and will force TMX to up its game.

“Having a quality player like Cboe in our market is positive for Canada” he said.

Cboe has historically focused on its trading systems and put less emphasis on the listings and capital-raising businesses that are central to the TMX’s growth strategy Mr. McKenzie said. “With the depth of our value proposition we feel we can remain the preferred choice for companies listing in Canada.”

And now the TMX is past its internal upheavals he’s confident that strategy will help it to continue to gain ground worldwide as well.

The New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZ Super) a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) with NZ$60 billion ($40.5 billion) in assets under management (AUM) is in the process of increasing its exposure to property in Asia Pacific (Apac) — with major deals set to be announced early in 2022.

“We have several interesting opportunities in the region we are working on” Toby Selman who is in charge of property investment strategy at the fund told AsianInvestor adding that the fund will likely announce details by March.

Selman said that Apac is a particular focus for the fund due to its favourable demographics and market dynamics. The fund favours developed Asia — namely China Japan Korea and Australia — because of the markets’ greater liquidity but it is also keeping an eye on Southeast Asia.

Last year NZ Super invested $150 million to the latest regional fund in CBRE Global Investors’ Asia Value Partners fund series which focuses on logistics property developments across Japan South Korea and China.

NZ Super prefers club deals or small Limited Partner (LP) group funds with fund managers. “We prefer to invest with a small number of investors. If there are only three or four of us we have a meaningful voice on governance and important areas such as sustainability and can push our net zero goals” Selman said adding that the fund had close relationships with other peer sovereign funds including those in Singapore and Australia. “We actively talk about opportunities and market views so we have good alignment.”

Selman said he liked the fundamental supply-demand dynamics for Apac and pointed to the relatively low institutional capital allocations compared to the US or Europe as well as the lower relative supply of prime buildings.

He also stressed the region’s favourable demographics technology adoption and opportunities to help achieve NZ Super’s sustainability goals which include reducing the emissions intensity of the fund by 40% and its carbon reserves by 80% from baseline levels by 2025.

Sustainability considerations play a big role in selecting data centre opportunities in Asia in particular he said. “A big thing we think about is power: its cost and sustainability” he said noting that solar or geothermal power sources are valuable ways to reduce a data centre’s carbon footprint.

NZ Super’s domestic investments include a Future Urban Land platform a NZ$250 million investment comprising large land holdings that will be rezoned. “This is future mixed-use development in communities that are sustainable and have a positive impact” Selman said pointing to affordable and build-to-rent housing as two features.

Selman established a new global investment strategy earlier this year for its property investments focused primarily around living logistics and technology-oriented real estate in sustainable cities with attractive market fundamentals.

“Essentially we are creating a new-economy real estate portfolio” said Selman. Selman together with Sian Orr portfolio manager for real estate managed international funds; and Katie Dean portfolio manager in direct investments; lead the execution of the strategy.

The fund’s technology focus includes data centres life sciences in the form of lab buildings and film studios. “We like those alternative sectors with growth occupiers in technology sectors” Selman said. He pointed to the increasing trend of more operating-type leases such as those in the hotel sector where owners often take a percentage of an operator’s profits (the fund owns a hotel platform in New Zealand); and data centres where leases can be either long duration or a hybrid.

NZ Super favours specialist property managers in specific regions. Besides the CBRE investment the fund has invested an initial €225 million ($255 million) in a European grocery-anchored real estate platform with Slate Asset Management; and €150 million to a fund with Deutsche Finance International (DFI) a European private equity real estate manager focused on future workspace lifestyle and hospitality investments.

“While the retail sector has been heavily impacted by Covid-19 we have been selectively targeting grocery and essential services-based real estate in Europe where we see an attractive combination of pricing arbitrage and longer-term value in aggregating grocery-led logistics nodes in suburban locations across continental Europe” said Selman.

The fund is more growth-oriented than many of its peers since its substantive liabilities to the New Zealand government will not be due for another 30 years.

The Aloft Liverpool hotel has been sold by joint agents Colliers and CBRE on behalf of North John Street LLP for an undisclosed price.

Fragrance Group which is further expanding into the hotel market has acquired the hotel following an invitation for offers at a guide level in the region of £12000000.

Located in the heart of Liverpool city centre this iconic hotel asset was constructed around 1900 as the head office of the Royal Insurance Company and was subsequently sympathetically restored and converted to the 4* globally branded 116-bedroom hotel.

The modern hotel also offers two substantial and well-appointed bar and restaurants together with several meeting/conference suites. Trade to Year End 2019 showed a net turnover of £3878936 and operated under the Aloft franchise (part of Marriott Group). The hotel will continue to be operated by RBH Hospitality Management.

Julian Troup Head of Hotels Agency at Colliers said: “Our instructions were to proceed in a confidential manner and unsurprisingly significant interest was soon generated in this iconic hotel. The considerable level of interest follows a pattern of increasing demand for UK provincial hotels particularly for global branded stock and as a result a competitive bidding process was run amongst several overseas and domestic bidders. The sale of the Aloft adds to the high volume of our UK hotel sales that have been concluded during the year and demonstrates the increasing confidence from a diverse range of buyers.“

Martin Rogers of Global Hotels & Leisure Consultancy who represents The Fragrance Group commented: “This was another strategic acquisition for The Fragrance Group in the UK. Mr Koh first visited Liverpool in 2018 and subsequently purchased The Municipal Building from Liverpool City which we are now converting into a luxury 186-bedroom Hotel due to open in October next year. We are delighted to again work alongside RBH Hospitality Management who already operate six hotels in the UK for the Group.""

The ad – which coincided with the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow – told listeners that carbon capture technology could remove more than 90% of CO 2 emissions from “carbon-intensive industries” and that the company was working to “deploy this technology at scale”. It gave the sense of an oil company tackling the climate crisis with technology that could solve it – and quickly.

Similar ads have run on NPR podcasts including Invisibilia and Up First. The American Petroleum Institute has also run ads in podcasts including on Vox’s Ezra Klein Show (Klein has since left for the New York Times) highlighting that it is “producing more oil and gas while reducing emissions”.

The fossil fuels industry’s sudden interest in podcasts coincides with its recent embrace of social media and newsletter advertising and may well be driven in part by a key difference in the regulation of these “newer” media regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) versus legacy print TV and radio media which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

While the FCC actively regulates advertising the FTC works differently. It generally won’t investigate anything until a complaint is made and even then an investigation is not guaranteed. The FTC has had “green guides” for environmental marketing claims in place for environmental claims for more than 30 years but the first complaint ever filed against an oil company for greenwashing came in 2021 against Chevron. The action is still pending.

The challenge with the FTC’s guidelines including the green guides is that they tend to be product based and specific: your product is either made with recycled materials or not you either take back and recycle packaging or you don’t. All of which leaves podcast and newsletter publishers and social media platforms to develop their own guidelines and factchecking processes.

This is made harder by the industry’s advertising strategy – oil companies almost never advertise their products opting instead to advertise ideas particularly the idea that they’re working hard to address the climate crisis.

ExxonMobil’s ad in The Daily for example emphasizes its work to scale up carbon capture as a climate solution. Yet the company currently captures less than 1% of its emissions according to a report by the activist hedge fund Engine No 1 and uses some of the captured CO 2 to extract more fossil fuels through a process called enhanced oil recovery.

The ad’s statement that carbon capture can remove 90% of emissions also has some important caveats. The figure is a baseline target for carbon capture projects and refers to the emissions captured at a single industrial site rather than all industrial emissions. According to the International Energy Agency the world’s carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects can currently capture approximately 0.1% of annual global emissions.

“ExxonMobil has long acknowledged that climate change is real and poses serious risks” said an ExxonMobil spokesperson Todd Spitler. He said figures from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions show that “CCS can capture more than 90% of emissions from power plants and industrial facilities”.

He added that ExxonMobil had captured more than 120m tons of CO2 in total which he said accounted for 40% of all globally captured carbon since 1970. According to the company’s April 2021 report Exxon’s total CO 2 emissions for 2020 alone from direct operations and its supply chain were more than 650m tons.

“All advertising must meet our advertising acceptability guidelines” said a New York Times spokesperson Nicole Taylor. “This prohibits advertising that is intentionally misleading deceptive or contains false information. Ads submitted to the New York Times are reviewed by an advertising standards team and are subject to factchecking.”

Yet Exxon’s misleading claims about carbon capture passed this filter. Taylor didn’t say whether the Exxon ad went through the company’s factchecking process just that ads “are subject” to factchecking. So either the ad passed or it wasn’t checked closely in the first place.

NPR also says it has processes in place to vet digital ads. “The digital guidelines were developed to protect the non-commercial spirit of NPR with some additional flexibility on language beyond the strict limits imposed by the FCC for broadcast sponsor recognition” said an NPR spokesperson Isabel Lara.

It’s unsurprising that Exxon’s ad passed media companies’ filters said John Cook research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University Australia and an adviser to Facebook on climate disinformation. That’s because it deploys a tactic often used by oil companies called “paltering” he said the use of truthful statements to convey a misleading impression.

“It requires background knowledge to spot it so it’s tough” Cook said. “They can run an ad that’s 100% accurate statements. Exxon is investing in algae – that’s 100% true – then they can do a lot to convey the impression that they’re environmentally friendly without conveying that they’re spending more on advertising than on algae tech. So it’s very hard for factcheckers or social media guidelines to catch that because the companies can say ‘What? Everything is true.’”

Unless the New York Times’ advertising team has a knowledgable climate expert reviewing Exxon’s ads it’s unlikely that a misleading ad would be rejected. “​​The problem with self-regulation is that if it’s against a publisher’s or platform’s financial interests to impose restrictions then they’re less likely to do so” Cook said.

This doesn’t necessarily mean a ban on fossil fuel ads is the only way to get on top of greenwashing Cook said. “I probably would lean towards the solution being more based on the content rather than the source” he said. “But also if the source has a track record of misinforming that should come with penalties.”

The problem is catching the problem to begin with because greenwashing doesn’t fit the usual mold. “Their greenwashing won’t be flagged as misinformation in the first place” Cook said. “So what’s in place now for identifying misinformation in ads is not really a framework for identifying greenwashing.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed crime ­– theft and burglary in particular – was so rampant that in 1818 the Government resorted to holding a talent contest for the security industry. The Locks Factor if you like.

It proved to be a stroke of genius. Because not only did the winner 28-year-old Jeremiah Chubb come up with something incredibly clever and innovative. But he also used his 100 guineas prize money to start up a business that would lead the world. And from a base in the heart of the West Midlands.

This week's edition is about not one but several Great Lives because the success story behind the Chubb lockmaker was very much a family affair. But it was Jeremiah's invention that lit the torch and his older brother Charles whose persistence and business acumen created a security giant.

Jeremiah Chubb was born in Fordingbridge Hampshire on June 10 1790 18 years after his older brother Charles.

Having served an apprenticeship as a blacksmith Charles set up in business selling specialised ironmongery to the shipping industry first operating out of Winchester before moving to Portsea in the Portsmouth docklands in 1804. It was the height of the Industrial Revolution and there was plenty of money to be made selling ironware for use on ships. But as growth of industry led to levels of wealth and prosperity never seen before this also meant soaring crime rates. Unsurprisingly the naval stores around Portsmouth where all manner of goodies were kept were particularly susceptible and after joining his brother's business Jeremiah realised there could be a serious market for an ultra-secure lock that would put paid to the pilfering once and for all.

Jeremiah was just eight years old when his older brother married Maria Hayter on August 20 1798 possibly against the wishes of both families as no members of either family attended the wedding. It appears Jeremiah was living with Charles and his family when he developed his 'detector lock' that would change both their lives.

The Chubb detector lock

The 'detector lock' was unique in that it had a 'self destruct' mechanism that would render it inoperable if an attempt was made to pick it or open it with the wrong key. This not only made it more difficult for the criminally inclined to gain illicit access it also warned the owner that an attempt had been made to break into his property. The lock could be reset but only with a special regulating key that came with the lock.

In 1818 100 guineas or £105 was about the equivalent of £10000 today. Not a vast fortune but Jeremiah was determined to use it wisely and began recruiting rim and cabinet locksmiths at his brother's shop in Portsmouth – by advertising in the Wolverhampton Chronicle. There was a certain logic to this; at that time nearby Willenhall was the lockmaking capital of the country and there would be far more highly skilled workers in the West Midlands than in Portsmouth.

By this time the brothers probably already had one eye on the future and within two years they opened a lock and safe manufacturing works in Temple Street Wolverhampton with the lockmakers who moved to Portsmouth to join the company presumably returning home.

There is an unsubstantiated but nevertheless enjoyable tale about how the manner in which the fledgling business secured a royal warrant from Prince Regent George IV in 1823.

An advertisement in Melville's 1851 Wolverhampton Directory

In a 1951 interview with an Australian newspaper Charles' great-great grandson the Hon George Chubb painted a rather colourful meeting when the future king summoned Charles Chubb to meet him aboard the royal yacht.

""Charles Chubb arrived with his lock was ushered into a cabin and instructed to await the arrival of the King"" he said.

""He placed his lock on a nearby chair and started to wander round the cabin examining the pictures.

""While he was occupied in gazing at the seascapes King George swept into the cabin and sat down right on top of the lock.

""It’s an old joke in our family that that lock made such an 'impression' on him that he granted us a royal warrant which we’ve had ever since.""

A less colourful version of the story is that Charles Chubb was demonstrating his locks to the captain of a battleship in Portsmouth harbour when the King came aboard. The flustered captain attempted to push Chubb out of the way but George IV called him back and was so enthralled by his sales pitch that he invited him to London.

""I and my friends will make your lock known"" George is said to have told him.

This strange contraption was used to display the priceless Koh-i-Nor diamond at the 1851 Festival of Britain

What is known is that George IV was a huge supporter of Chubb in its early days and it was major contracts with public bodies which secured the company's future.

Which was just as well as the company appeared to have overstretched itself with its expansion in Wolverhampton and sometime shortly after the move Jeremiah is thought to have moved first to France then to the US to flee from his creditors. It appears that Charles may also have been subjected to bankruptcy procedures but nevertheless persisted with the business and achieved the breakthrough in 1820 when he persuaded the Admiralty to issue a contract to supply its locks. In 1823 similar deals were struck with the Post Office and the prison service which operated prison ships in Portsmouth and after a shaky start the business was firmly established.

Charles made more friends in high places in 1828 when the Duke of Wellington called upon Chubb to pick open his front door at Aspley House and supply four new locks.

This was four years after Charles had patented an improved detector lock which did away with the need for the separate regulator key and in 1835 he developed a burglar-resistant safe. The years that followed saw rapid expansion first with the opening of the company's safe works in Cowcross Street close to Smithfield Market in London and then to a new works on the corner of Horseley Fields and Mill Street in Wolverhampton where it would make about 28000 locks a year.

The company became a master of marketing and visitors to exhibitions would regularly be challenged to pick the 1818 lock which remained undefeated until somebody managed to beat it at the Great Exhibition of 1851. And the Great Exhibition saw the greatest publicity stunt yet when Chubb managed to get hold of the huge Koh-i-Nor diamond – one of the crown jewels – to exhibit in a secure cage on its stand. At night on the touch of a spring by the custodian the Koh-i-Nor and two smaller diamonds would ""sink into a massive iron box of impregnable strength and fall into a pedestal of solid masonry"". The company must have been very confident in its product; the adverse publicity had somebody managed to steal the Koh-i-Nor doesn't bear thinking about.

Chubb's show-stopping stand at the 1851 Festival of Britain

The Chubb stand appears to have made an impression on Queen Victoria who wrote in her private diary: ""Chubb's locks were the first exhibits we regularly inspected and they really are wonderful of every size and kind. He explained to us the ingenious manner by which an attempt to form the lock is discovered."" The company's efforts were rewarded with the Exhibition's Prize Medal.

In 1855 the Post Office installed its first pillar box which was fitted with a Chubb lock as most future ones would be.

After a spell working in the US as a machinist Jeremiah returned to Britain in 1828. It was another 11 years however before his name appeared in any patents and he may have worked as a travelling rep for Chubb's products until his only son died of measles. His wife Emilia returned to America and it is thought Jeremiah hoped to follow her but by this time he was in poor health and died in Winchester on November 10 1847.

Charles Chubb was a staunch Wesleyan Methodist known for his donations to charity although it appears the extent of his generosity may not have extended to his own family: it appears Jeremiah or 'Uncle Jerry' as he was known to younger relatives acted as a conduit for family members seeking financial assistance.

Charles and Maria Chubb had 11 children – eight daughters and three sons – and when Charles died on May 16 1846 it was his youngest son John who took over the running of the company which had already been renamed Charles Chubb & Son. His widow Maria died seven months later. Charles left £16000 in his will – about £2 million today – which was divided between his eight surviving children.

John Chubb took over the business on the death of his father Charles

John ran the business until his death in 1872 when he was succeeded by his sons John Charles George Hayter and Harry Withers.

George would emerge as the driving force becoming chairman of the new limited company. This period coincided with rising crime levels across the Atlantic and Chubb responded by opening a subsidiary in the US. George was knighted in 1885 and made a Baronet in 1900 given the baronial title as the 1st Baron Hayter as it was considered improper that the name of a company could be used in the House of Lords. In 1909 he was made a Freeman of the Borough of Wolverhampton. He retired as chairman in 1938 but remained managing until his death in 1946 at the age of 98 when he was succeeded by his brother Harry.

The firm briefly left Wolverhampton in 1882 when the lease on the factory in Horseley Fields had expired and the lock works moved to London. But the exile was shortlived the company opening its imposing landmark building in Railway Street in 1889 the new works capable of accommodating 350 locksmiths and a similar number of safe makers.

The expansion continued into the 20th century and in 1938 a new lock works opened at Wednesfield Road in Heath Town bringing the total factory space to more than 6.5 acres.

The Chubb works in Horseley Fields

In 1956 Chubb took over the famous lock and safe maker Hobbs Hart and Co Ltd and in 1961 the company strated making fire-resistant safe deposit lockers at Park Lane in Wolverhampton.

Chubb remained a family business until 1984 when it was taken over by Racal Electronics although Bill Chubb 4th Lord Hayter remained with the company until 1984.

A takeover by Williams Holdings in 1997 and a further takeover by Swedish group Assa Abloy three years later saw the break-up of Chubb as we know it. Assa Abloy used the Chubb name for its locks until 2010 and Chubb Fire & Security is now owned by the US Carrier Global.

Chubb vacated its famous red-brick factory in the centre of Wolverhampton in the 1960s but restoration work began on the building in the 1970s and in 1984 the Light House media centre opened in part of the building.

The network which includes the Catholic Theological Society of America and similar groups around the world promotes collaborative research projects by theologians from different cultures and encourages dialogue with scholars from other churches other religions and various scientific disciplines.

In his prepared text Francis told members of the group that theology is ""a significant and necessary ecclesial ministry"" because ""it is part of our Catholic faith to explain the reason for our hope to all those who ask.""

Bruce Hollen pastor of Calvary Church in The Woodlands is accused of possession child pornography Montgomery County Precinct 4 deputies said.

THE WOODLANDS Texas (KTRK) -- A pastor in The Woodlands stands accused of disturbing crimes involving kids.

Authorities said Bruce Hollen was arrested on May 8 for allegedly promoting and distributing naked pictures of young girls.

His arrest was a result of an operation. The deputies leading the investigation were from Montogomery County Precinct 3 specifically focusing on internet crime against children.

According to investigators Hollen is a pastor at Calvary Church.

Court documents state the photos were of girls between the ages of 9 and 12 years old naked from the waist down.

In some of the images the girls were engaged in sexual activity.

Calvary Church services take place in the auditorium at McCullough Junior High School. The Conroe Independent School District said the services were held on Sundays so students were away.

Hollen and his wife were listed as team members on the church's website but their photos have been taken down.

When ABC13 visited the couple's home Hollen's wife did not open the door and refused to comment on the allegation.

All Calvary Church leadership told ABC13 via a statement that they are doing the best they can to keep things running and they ""don't have all of the information.""

Hollen was booked into the Montgomery County Jail. A judge set his bond at $30000.

Mr. Gonzalez is the image of the modern missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which has changed many of its practices — from how missionaries preach to how they dress.

As many college coaching positions have been filled NFL.com’s Tom Pelissero reports that Fickell has been on the radar of NFL teams even before the start of this season.

The 48-year-old is expected to be in the mix for NFL coaching jobs during the upcoming hiring cycle and interviewed with the Detroit Lions last year before the team hired Dan Campbell — so he has at least shown interest in the NFL in the past — Pelissero reports.

""But his excellent reputation as a leader of men during 15 years on staff at Ohio State and the past five years with the upstart Bearcats makes him intriguing in much the same way Titans coach Mike Vrabel rose from the same Buckeyes staff"" Pelissero writes.

Fickell spent one season on injured reserve as a player with the New Orleans Saints in 1997 but has never coached in the league.

Nearly all the top college jobs that opened recently have been filled with the exception of Oklahoma. Would it make sense for Fickell to leave for the pros if he can practically pick his next college stop?

""Massive money is flying at the college level now with Brian Kelly most recently getting a 10-year $100 million pact to leave Notre Dame for LSU. Michigan State’s Mel Tucker [$95 million] and Penn State’s James Franklin [$85 million] also cashed in recently on 10-year deals"" Pelissero writes. ""That changes the calculus for college coaches who have drawn NFL interest such as Lincoln Riley who recently left Oklahoma for his own nine-figure contract at USC and Iowa State’s Matt Campbell who has spoken in recent years with the Lions and New York Jets and drawn interest from high-powered college programs as well.""

Klik untuk follow WhatsApp Channel & Google News

Ketika kamu jatuh cinta kerap kali kamu berpikir terlalu naif tentang hubungan yang terjalin kemudian. Kamu yakin cintamu padanya akan abadi tak mungkin berkurang apalagi berubah menjadi kebencian.

Bukannya hendak meragukan cintamu tapi mungkin saja perasaanmu padanya berubah total tanpa sempat direncanakan. Mengapa itu bisa terjadi? Berikut lima penyebabnya yang bisa kamu antisipasi dari sekarang.

1. Pengkhianatan ilustrasi pasangan (pexels.com/Pavel Danilyuk) Jika dia membalas kesetiaanmu padanya dengan pengkhianatan bisakah kamu memaafkannya? Ketika kamu baru membayangkannya mungkin sepertinya itu bukan masalah besar. Namun setelah benar-benar terjadi pasti bakal sulit untukmu mengampuninya. Apalagi kalau demi mengejar cinta orang lain dia banyak merugikanmu. Sama halnya seperti menelantarkan keluarga bahkan membawa lari semua uangmu. Wah rasanya tak ada lagi cinta yang tersisa untuknya. Bukannya membukakan pintu maaf kamu justru berandai-andai bila saja kalian tak pernah bertemu.

2. Baru tahu sifat aslinya ilustrasi pasangan (pexels.com/Polina Tankilevitch) Sulit untuk merangkum seluruh sifat seseorang hanya dalam beberapa bulan atau satu dua tahun. Ketika masa pacaran semua yang tampak darinya barangkali masih sisi-sisi baiknya saja. Kalaupun ada kekurangannya yang kamu ketahui itu masih belum seberapa dibandingkan dengan sifat aslinya. Kamu tidak menyangka sifat aslinya akan seburuk ini. Misalnya suka bersikap kasar termasuk saat berhubungan seks sehingga kamu hanya kesakitan.

[QUIZ] Kuis Ini Menggambarkan Sifat dari Hati yang Kamu Miliki dm-player Rasa tidak adil dalam hal apa pun memang perkara yang sensitif bagi semua orang. Apalagi ketika ketidakadilan itu dilakukan oleh orang terdekat. Tak terkecuali oleh pasanganmu dan terkait hal yang mendasar yaitu penerimaannya atas dirimu. Kamu tidak pernah mempersoalkan kekurangan dirinya. Kamu belajar menerimanya sebagaimana kamu menerima kelebihannya. Akan tetapi dia tak dapat melakukan hal yang sama. Kekuranganmu yang kecil pun dipermasalahkannya. Apalagi kekurangan yang lebih besar. Kekurangan diri dipersoalkan sekali saja bisa bikin tersinggung. Ini malah terus-terusan.

4. Apakah kamu jatuh cinta pada orang lain? ilustrasi pasangan (pexels.com/cottonbro) Nah ternyata berubahnya cinta menjadi benci tak melulu karena kesalahan pasanganmu lho. Kamu pun dapat menjadi biang keladinya. Bukan dia yang berbuat serong melainkan kamu ada hati dengan yang lain. Kian besar ambisimu untuk memiliki orang itu kamu juga akan kian membenci pasanganmu saat ini. Dia terasa makin jauh dari kesempurnaan dan menjadi penghalang untuk kamu dapat berhubungan dengan orang itu."

The New South Wales government has teamed up with Cisco to trial the use of AI IoT and edge computing technology to improve the reliability of public transport in Sydney and Newcastle.

As part of the trial Transport for NSW (TfNSW) is using IoT to enable physical objects to be ""digitised"" and connected to the transported network via sensors while edge computing will be leveraged to take real-time data from connected objects to enable faster decision making. AI meanwhile will be used to assist with understanding data and automating the process.

The technologies will be connected to several buses ferries and light rail vehicles in both cities the state government said.

""We've partnered with Cisco to investigate how a real-time view of vehicle supply and customer demand and performance can guide future network decisions and monitor road conditions to identify where repair work is needed"" Minister for Transport and Roads Rob Stokes said.

""We're using AI Wi-Fi and edge computing on Pitt St near Central Station to capture real-time data and identify high-risk events.

""We'll be able to keep a close eye on vehicle movements as more commuters and pedestrians head back to Sydney's busiest transport hubs as COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease.""

The state government added the data captured will also be used to monitor assets and understand the comfort of customer journeys in real-time.

According to Cisco Australia and New Zealand transport and infrastructure general manager Simon Young TfNSW is the only agency in the world to be trialling the company's AI system.

""These trials represent the strength of the partnership between Cisco and Transport for NSW to co-innovate and use technology to solve some of the most pressing and challenging problems facing transport agencies"" he said.

These trials however will not be the first time TfNSW has tapped into AI and data analytics. In September the agency said it was using AI to develop predictive algorithms to help national state local governments manage their road safety performance.

TfNSW teamed up with iMove Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) the University of Technology Sydney the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) and geospatial data firm Anditi to develop a faster and more automated method to extract raw road data.

As part of the initiative dubbed the accelerated and intelligent road assessment program data collection (AiRAP) project the group plans to deliver what it refers to as usable data for 20000km of NSW roads using TomTom's MN-R next-generation map data as well as extraction techniques and machine learning for Lidar data. Pilot assessments will also be conducted on a sample of local state and national highway roads to prove the methodologies.

At the end of last year TfNSW partnered with Microsoft to develop a proof of concept that uses data and machine learning to flag potentially dangerous intersections and reduce road accidents.

As part of the proof of concept Transport for NSW ran a trial in Wollongong to uncover five potentially risky intersections. It involved 50 vehicles generating more than a billion rows of data over a 10-month period before Databricks and Azure were used to curate ingest and interpret the data.

The telematics data was used to identify speed harsh braking harsh acceleration and lateral movement just before the intersection. It was then compared to patterns of existing crash investigation data.

Since the trial two out of the five intersections have been scheduled for modification.

The platform — which has already garnered support from leading SD-WAN vendors: Cisco VMware Palo Alto Networks and Aruba — is a managed WAN service that streamlines the process of connecting on-premises data centers and branch offices to the cloud provider’s global backbone network.

If this sounds familiar that’s because SD-WAN vendors have achieved similar functionality in the past using AWS’ previously announced Transit Connect Gateway and Direct Connect products.

Direct Connect provides an on ramp into AWS while Transit Connect Gateway enabled inter-virtual private cloud (VPC) networking. The two products in conjunction with an SD-WAN overlay enabled AWS to be used as a high-performance middle-mile network.

However these products were never intended for this purpose and had to be meticulously stitched together to fold AWS into an enterprise WAN fabric. The disjointed nature of these products created a patchwork of networking and security policies that was unnecessarily complicated to configure and manage Amazon claims. Cloud WAN which is available in preview now unifies this functionality under a single dashboard with this specific use case in mind.

“AWS Cloud WAN removes the difficulty of stitching together and managing third-party tools so customers can now more easily keep their networks securely connected and high performing” David Brown VP of AWS Elastic Compute Cloud said in a statement.

All Aboard the Cloud WAN Train

Cloud WAN works like most middle-mile network providers. In the case of branch-to-branch communications customer traffic travels a short distance across the internet to the nearest AWS data center where it hops aboard the cloud provider’s private network.

Once on the network customers can define how that traffic should be routed between AWS data centers based on networking and security policy configured in the Cloud WAN dashboard. The traffic then leaves AWS’ network at the data center closest to its destination — or as dictated otherwise by routing policy — and completes its final leg once again over the internet.

While Cloud WAN supports a variety of popular SD-WAN vendors at launch it should be noted that SD-WAN is not a prerequisite. The service also supports AWS VPN Direct Connect and Transit Connect Gateway as on ramps.

However according to Cisco’s Raj Gulani senior director of product management for enterprise cloud and SD-WAN using AWS Cloud WAN in conjunction with SD-WAN presents numerous benefits.

By integrating with Cloud WAN SD-WAN customers can extend their existing WANs into and across AWS’ private network enabling consistent networking and security policy enforcement he said. “We can actually orchestrate the entire internal network backbone with just a push of a script from our side and that gets honored by AWS.”

This is possible thanks to deep API integrations with Cloud WAN that enable SD-WAN vendors like Cisco to orchestrate the middle-mile network based on the customer’s intent he explained. “Now we can actually honor the enterprise SD-WAN policy from an intent perspective.”

By extending the SD-WAN overlay across AWS Cloud WAN customers can also maintain visibility and more importantly extend network segmentation across the middle mile noted Karl Brown senior director of product marketing for VMware’s SASE business unit in an interview with SDxCentral. “If they [the customer] had segmented guest traffic from employee traffic if they had segmented different internal teams … we can maintain that segmentation across the AWS Cloud WAN.”

Cloud WAN Competition Amps Up

AWS is far from the first cloud provider to venture down this path. Earlier this year Google announced the evolution of its SD-WAN Cloud Hub platform — which bears striking similarities to Transit Connect Gateway and Direct Connect — to support middle-mile transport.

Google Cloud’s Network Connectivity Center similar to AWS Cloud WAN provides a single dashboard for provisioning and managing VPN tunnels and SD-WAN interconnects. Cisco was among the first to announce support for the service and was joined by rival SD-WAN vendors Fortinet and Versa late this spring.

Meanwhile Microsoft introduced this functionality more than a year earlier in an update to the Azure Virtual WAN Hub. In addition to providing an on-ramp to workloads running in Azure vWAN provides a platform on which technology partners could extend their SD-WAN overlays across the public cloud provider’s network.

While not public cloud providers content delivery network (CDN) and domain name system (DNS) providers Cloudflare also offers similar transport services targeted at SD-WAN customers.

Building on these developments many SD-WAN vendors see an opportunity to glue the various clouds together enabling branches users and workloads to communicate seamlessly regardless of where they’re located or on which cloud they’re running.

“What VMware as a company will provide is a means to go across cloud and provide security and connectivity as you shift data and workloads across the different cloud providers” Karl Brown said.

VMware isn’t alone in this endeavor. Cisco and Fortinet have announced similar plans to address multi-cloud networking challenges using their SD-WAN and security platforms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFjay5uZXQvc3Rvcmllcy9sZXQtaXQtc3Ryb2xsLWhvbGlkYXktd2Vla2VuZC1jYWxlbmRhciwyNjg3N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Let it Stroll: Holiday Weekend Calendar,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://www.ack.net/stories/let-it-stroll-holiday-weekend-calendar,26877 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFjay5uZXQvc3Rvcmllcy9sZXQtaXQtc3Ryb2xsLWhvbGlkYXktd2Vla2VuZC1jYWxlbmRhciwyNjg3N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdHJlYWxpbmRpYW5zLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTIvNC8yMi1ub29rc2Fjay0zMDYtaG91c2Vob2xkcy1mYWNpbmctaWxsZWdhbC1ldmljdGlvbi1mcm9tLWh1ZC1ob21lc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,22 Nooksack 306 Households Facing Illegal Eviction From HUD Homes — Last Real Indians,"Letter from Attorney Nooksack police re illegal evictions

Re: Nooksack Off-Reservation Homes

Dear Mr. Hoyle: It has come to our attention that you visited Cat Barril at her home in the Whispering Cedars apartments on the off-reservation Suchanon Allotment on Saturday October 30 2021 at 1:35 PM; and Cisco and Billie Rabang at their home in the Rutsatz housing project on the off-reservation Sewalmus Allotment on Sunday October 31 2021 at 5:20 PM during Halloween festivities. In both instances you personally served them while in uniform and dawning your badge and gun with eviction papers.

We represent Ms. Barril and the Rabangs as well as several other families living in federally-funded HUD homes on the off-reservation Suchanon and Sewalmus Allotments. There was no need for you to visit Ms. Barril or the Rabangs at their respective homes during a holiday weekend to serve them with eviction notices. The Nooksack Indian Housing Authority could have instead served those papers upon them via certified mail. My office is also available to receive those papers on our clients’ behalf by email fax or certified mail. Your behavior over the weekend is unbecoming of tribal law enforcement officers but apparently consistent with your police record. We understand that before recently getting hired at Nooksack you were terminated by the Lummi Nation for police misconduct.

Your behavior is inconsistent with an October 5 2021 directive from U.S. Department of the Interior Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs Bryan Newland to Nooksack Tribal Chairman Ross Cline Jr. You also lack police authority at Rutzsatz and Whispering Cedars. State v. Cooper 928 P.2d 406 408 (Wash. 1996) (citing RCW § 37.12.010); AGO 63-64 No. 68 (Nov. 8 1963). The off-reservation allotments on which those housing projects sit fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of Washington State. Id.

Cease and desist from entering upon any of our clients’ off-reservation homes or having any police involvement with our clients there. If you do so again you will risk being sued in Whatcom County Superior Court or the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington under applicable federal law. See Lewis v. Clarke 137 S. Ct. 1285 1292 (2017); 24 U.S.C. 450f(c); 25 C.F.R. §§ 900.190 et seq.

The former KeyBank tower at 126 Central Plaza N and the former National City Bank at 315 Tuscarawas St. W — which were offered for auction in 2019 by owner PJT-Pointe West LLC — might soon be for sale again.

PJT-Pointe West is affiliated with Testa Companies which is based in Cuyahoga Falls. Liberty Commons another Testa affiliate purchased the former bank buildings in 2001 and transferred them to PJT-Pointe West in January 2019.

Paul J. Testa the CEO and founder of Testa Companies did not respond to requests for comment.

According to Stark County court records the PJT-Pointe West owes $113460 in unpaid property taxes and related fees for the Central Plaza N property. Stark County Treasurer Alexander Zumbar filed for foreclosure in September and the case is ongoing.

The Tuscarawas Street property was foreclosed on in August according to court records. Tax Ease OH IV LLC purchased tax lien certificates for the property's $32888 in outstanding taxes in 2018 and the $22062 owed in 2019.

Tax Ease filed to foreclose this year when the debt plus interest and fees was not repaid. An auctioneer was assigned in late September but no date has been set for the auction a company representative said.

Tax Ease's payoff quote for the two certificates related to the Tuscarawas Street foreclosure is $79734. An additional lien purchased this year by Tax Ease brings PJT-Pointe West's total balance to $102722.

The buildings which were constructed in the 1920s have been vacant for years.

The former George D. Harter Bank — renowned for its lobby with a three-story high ceiling and chandeliers — built the Central Plaza N tower where KeyBank operated. KeyBank moved to a smaller office on the opposite end of the block in 2016.

National City Bank — now PNC — was at 315 Tuscarawas St. W until the late 1990s. The bank moved to 210 Market Ave. N.

With the advancement of technology including online and mobile banking more banks have opted to move into modest branches. Two other downtown banks — Citizens and Chase — left large downtown buildings in 2018 in favor of smaller offices.

A Canton Regional Chamber of Commerce executive did not return messages seeking comment.

However the same report indicated that 33% of the Rwandan women surveyed had very low awareness of these products and services.

This fact was made worse with the COVID19 pandemic which hit small and medium size businesses in Rwanda.

To increase this awareness and revive small businesses affected by COVID19 the Bank of Kigali Plc has embarked on empowering vulnerable rural business women as a way of promoting the government agenda of financial inclusion and transforming the lives of Rwandans.

This Friday a group of 100 women in Muhanga district concluded a week of training in financial and business skills courtesy of the Bank of Kigali and The Ndineza organization- founded by a celebrated Rwandan female gospel singer Aline Gahongayire.

This number follows another 100 women in Kamonyi district who also recently graduated under the same financial literacy and banking service program conducted by BK in collaboration with Ndineza.

“Bank of Kigali has different types of loans for clients and the trained women can be eligible to them to boost their businesses in the post covid-19 period including the “Zamuka Mugore” product designed specifically for empowering women financially with free account opening and access to loans with no collateral upon fulfillment of the requirements” said Gedeon Rukundo the Legal Manager and Subsidiaries Corporate Counsel at Bank of Kigali.

Rukundo said that the bank is for common citizens and the bank has developed women’s financial products among others intended to create inclusiveness in all aspects of lives of Rwandans especially women.

“We wish you success in your projects and the bank will be supportive so that we can rebuild and develop the country especially women” Rukundo said.

Esperance Niyonsaba who was trained but has other bank accounts says that she was attracted to the Zamuka Mugore product because of its offers which are attractive and tailor made.

“Most of us were affected by covid19 and some of us have not resumed business because we spent our investment and capital on family needs. So having a loan product with no collateral and no account fees is a good product that can help us to rebound” Niyonsaba said.

Aline Gahongayire the gospel singer behind this partnership says that when they approached Bank of Kigali with the idea of empowering women with financial it was received with both hands and this is a dream come true for women.

“Every woman deserves the best and that is what is wanted for them through offering skills on how to manage finances save so as to improve their welfare. This is what is happening thanks to the Bank of Kigali” Gahongayire said.



To implement this training program the bank has signed a six month contract with Ndineza organization worth Rwf46.1million which will also be used in monitoring following up on implementation activities that will enable the women with small businesses to recover from the pandemic."

Most earbuds are made to be worn for long stretches throughout the day especially if you’re working from home right now. But even the best earbuds for working at home get gross and the buildup of ear gunk can accumulate to the point of discoloration and visible (and invisible) nastiness on your buds. It’s even worse when you look at the earbuds you use for running and working out – all that moisture from sweat and debris from the air outdoors can not only affect the audio quality of your earbuds but could affect your health as well.

While the risk of catching Covid from using headphones and earbuds isn’t particularly high the CDC still recommends regular disinfecting of electronics as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus. The agency says it’s always a good idea to properly clean any device you take outside the house on a regular basis that could pick up germs such as your phone and headphones. Besides being sanitary cleaning your earbuds and headphones can even improve the sound if the speakers are covered with layers of crud. Plus it’s extremely satisfying to compare the before and after.

How to Clean Your Earbuds

If you want to clean your earbuds you’ll need a few essential items: a lint-free and/or microfiber cloth cotton swabs a soft toothbrush and 70% isopropyl alcohol.

Prior to getting started remember that while most earbuds are water resistant not all brands not fully waterproof (and in some cases aren’t built to handle any liquid exposure at all). So try not to completely rinse your buds underwater.

If your earbuds have detachable rubber ear tips those are okay to rinse though when removed from the buds. Giving the bud a gentle tap on a hard surface can help shake out any water that may have crept inside if you accidentally got it wet. If the case is not water-resistant and does get exposed to liquid dry it as best you can then turn it upside-down with the lid open and let it air-dry before putting the buds back in.

The best way to clean your AirPods or any earbud really is to first give everything a good wipe-down with a dry microfiber cloth. (Don’t add any water cleaning solution or isopropyl alcohol just yet – we’ll get there). This knocks out all the grime that’s loose enough to dislodge on its own. Get into the creases of the case and crevices of the bud doing the best you can with just the cloth and some muscle behind it.

Editor’s picks

Next grab a cotton swab and start digging into the smaller tighter spaces like the tiny speaker part of the bud. Twist it spin it gently sweep it up and down into the case’s curvatures until you’ve covered everything.

Gently dip the swab cotton tip in some alcohol and make sure it’s not soaked or dripping – getting any moisture or liquids inside the buds and especially the case is a huge no. An alcohol prep pad can also work but it’s still best to transfer the alcohol onto the swab’s tip rather than use the wet pad to directly clean the buds. Same goes for a Clorox or disinfecting wipe. It’s simply got too much liquid on it and is too risky to use around the mesh speakers and interior of the case.

Finally time for the toothbrush. Any unused one should be fine as long as the bristles aren’t too rigid that they’d cause scrapes or damage. The friction of the brush sweeps away remaining grossness that’s still hanging on at this point.

The same steps above can be used for cleaning your headphones as well. If your headphones have removable ear covers or ear pads you can take them off and wipe them down thoroughly.

Other Tips for Cleaning Your Headphones

An air blower whether in a can or a squeezable one is a risk-free method that can be used to remove surface dust on any part of your earbuds or headphones. It doesn’t go deep or dislodge the really sticky goo but after each step it’s a reliable way to extricate the excess dirt.

Though it’s not recommended by Apple a small and precise object like a rounded pick can also really get in there and provide an extra level of clean. They’re often included in third-party cleaning kits but If you’re not careful this can cause damage to your pods. If you decide to go ahead with it gently – without pushing – run the pick’s end around the edges of the Pod’s speaker and microphone scooping up the gunk that still remains.

For stubborn scuffs a Magic Eraser can buff away marks on the outside of the case but it’s generally too bulky for the buds and ends up crumbling apart.

For the over-the-ear headphones such as Apple’s new AirPods Max head-banded headphones the same cautionary cleaning rules apply. The only difference is with the non-electronic ear cushions and the band which can be cleaned using a bit of detergent in water and wiping with a dry cloth. (The official Apple cleaning guidelines can be found here). If your headphones have screens covering the drivers use a soft brush to gently clean them any superficial dust or dirt. Even if the screens are removable though don’t clean the inside drivers or you might run the risk of damaging the sound quality on your headphones.

Earbuds such as AirPods are devices that get used constantly for long stretches even remaining in your ears when they’re off. Even if you’re not cleaning your earbuds or headphones regularly it’s best to give them a wipe-down and let them fully dry after they’ve been exposed to sweat rain sunscreen or any moisture. Never run them under water or use bleach to clean or whiten them. But a little maintenance work now can save you from a deep (and disgusting) clean in the future.

1. PhoneSoap 3 UV Sanitizer Think beyond just earbuds for a second – all our devices get pretty grimy from being touched all day and then stored in warm places that are perfect conditions for a bacteria house party. Instead of having to wipe them down repeatedly PhoneSoap has a liquid-free solution. Place your items inside this car and two UV-C bulbs zap the germs from your phone buds watch or whatever can fit inside. The interior is reflective meaning that there’s no need to flip your phone or earbuds to get both sides sanitary. This covers all sides 360º for a full clean all-around. It goes beyond electronics too and can even work for other everyday objects like keys glasses cash and credit cards. There are also USB ports in the back to charge up devices while they’re being cleaned. Buy PhoneSoap 3 UV Sanitizer $63.95

2. 34-Piece Cleaning Kit for AirPods This 34-piece kit is loaded with the tools you need to keep your AirPods (and other tech accessories) looking brand new. Three different types of bristled brushes provide the gentle scrubbing necessary to scrape up dirt and then whisk it away. The company’s strong alcohol-free cleaning liquid helps get rid of dust scuffs sweat and smudges from fingerprints and everyday use and a soft cloth (as well as wipes and 20 swabs) is included too. This goes way beyond AirPods and can clean plenty of your other devices including phones keyboards and even DSLR cameras. Buy 34-Piece Cleaning Kit for AirPods

3. ColorCoral Cleaning Gel A flakey putty-type cleaner can leave sticky residue in the worst of places like caught within the mesh holes of your bud’s speaker making it near impossible to remove. And while it’s still a bit riskier than gently cleaning with wipes and brushes ColorCoral’s gel is more of a goopy blob that won’t leave crumbling bits of itself behind. This was designed for electronics and vents getting into the nooks and crannies that are either too small or too awkward to reach with our fingers and hands. This can be split up into parts to make it last a while doesn’t leave a “snail trail” behind and actually smells pretty good too. Plus it’s extremely versatile and works all over your home and car. Buy ColorCoral Cleaning Gel $9.99

4. Binhai Air Blower Cloth and Brush Set Brushes and microfiber cloths are common in cleaning kits but an air blower is less so. That’s why we like this handy kit which is a big help for cleaning out small spaces. Simply squeezing some air into your earbuds’ ports and openings can work wonders blasting out dust and debris. Best of all: it’s perfectly safe. The goat hair brush is a nice addition and nicely soft while the other brush is strong enough to whisk any remaining dirt out of its hiding places. Earbuds are just the beginning though as this mighty little blower is extremely versatile and can work on all your devices including cameras binoculars telescopes and musical instruments.

When you work from home more often than you realize you likely work through your lunch — hovering of your laptop firing off a couple of emails while you scarf last night’s leftovers. While there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that and your boss probably appreciates you getting a little extra done while you eat your keyboard is really the thing that suffers. Not only is your keyboard getting peppered with more and more food crumbs but the oils and grease from your food are being transferred from your mid-day sammie straight to the keyboard via your greasy fingers.

Today's Top Deals

We’re not here to tell you to stop eating lunch and being productive at the same time (though breaks are good) but instead we’re here to provide you with a few different tips on how to clean your keyboard so your wireless keyboard or laptop stays functional and at the top of its game.

What You’ll Need to Clean Your Keyboard

clean your keyboard with a keyboard brush

The first and most obvious way to clean your keyboard is to turn it upside-down and give it a nice little shake. Whatever giant loose crumbs will fall off onto your floor or desk where you can pick them up. Of course that will only get the big stuff. To get the not so big stuff the sticky stuff and to actually wash the gunk off your keys you’ll need a few things:

Keyboard Brush

Compressed Duster

Cleaning Gel

Disinfectant Wipes

Handheld Vacuum

Dish Soap

You don’t have to use everything on this list to clean your keyboard. But pairing a couple of these solutions together — like using cleaning gel then cleaning your keycaps with dish soap — will ensure you keep your keyboard in tiptop shape so it lasts you a long time.

1. HagiBistech Keyboard Brush

This brush is rigid enough to unstick crumbs from your keys but soft enough so it won’t hurt your keyboard. The little red loop also serves as a handy key-puller to pop the keys off of a wireless keyboard.

The three northern islands Delft Nagadeepa and Analthivu are strategically positioned and given India’s security sensitivities red flags went off in New Delhi.The initial survey showed that such systems were bound to fail environmental scrutiny since diesel was part of the mix. Second the company itself was only nominally private.The Indian government weighed in with the Rajapaksa family in power in Sri Lanka . India offered to build the same systems but more environment friendly and at a fraction of the cost. The Chinese project was going to be carried through with an ADB loan as part of the Supporting Electricity Supply Reliability Improvement Project.India offered a big chunk of the money as a grant with a very small loan component on easy terms. Sri Lanka had an offer it could hardly refuse.The Sri Lankan government went into a huddle then fell silent. The Chinese who have tremendous influence upon the Sri Lankan government emphasised it was an ADB project with multilateral funding and all the necessary protections against accusations of a Chinese “debt trap”. The Sri Lankan government latched on to this explanation as a way to keep India at bay. Colombo said trying to assuage Indian concerns that Chinese teams would build and leave. India promised their teams would do the same. Colombo said they could not back out of an ADB project. India drew upon its goodwill cache with ADB to mitigate Lankan inconvenience.Four months passed. A new Chinese ambassador Qi Zhenhong  persuaded the government to move a Cabinet note saying that India had not responded with a counter proposal so the Chinese project should go ahead.India jumped in to show its formal offer made months prior and underlined that it was Sri Lanka that had been holding back. By now Colombo had a fair sense of New Delhi’s seriousness in the matter.Around the same time the Ceylon Electricity Board agreed to sell a 40% stake in a power plant in Kerawelapitiya near Colombo to an American company New Fortress Energy which the Chinese objected to.To bolster their case the Chinese roped in Pakistan whose diplomats weighed in on behalf of Beijing with Colombo including sending their press councillor on a “holiday” near the islands.But India wasn’t giving up. It was finally in November that India managed to convince the Rajapaksa government of the viability of the Indian proposal. By the time finance minister Basil Rajapaksa visited India last week Sri Lanka had agreed to give the project to India after cancelling out the Chinese.From their official handle the Chinese Embassy in Colombo tweeted that the suspension was due to a ‘security concern’ from a third party. Beijing inked a contract with the Maldivian government on 29th November to establish solar power plants in 12 islands in the island country.The fact that China used their official Twitter handle made it clear that China was no longer maintaining the fig leaf of the company being a private one yet another example of their “wolf-warrior” diplomacy.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvc2VydmljZXMvcHJvcGVydHktLy1jc3RydWN0aW9uL2pzdy1lbmVyZ3ktY2VvLXByYXNoYW50LWphaW4tYnV5cy1ycy00NS1jcm9yZS1kdXBsZXgtaW4tc291dGgtbXVtYmFpL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg4MTA5MjAyLmNtc9IBpQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvc2VydmljZXMvcHJvcGVydHktLy1jc3RydWN0aW9uL2pzdy1lbmVyZ3ktY2VvLXByYXNoYW50LWphaW4tYnV5cy1ycy00NS1jcm9yZS1kdXBsZXgtaW4tc291dGgtbXVtYmFpL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84ODEwOTIwMi5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JSW Energy CEO Prashant Jain buys Rs 45-crore duplex in South Mumbai,"Agencies

New Delhi: A buzz around the likely initial public offering of National Stock Exchange NSE ) lifted the prices of peers such as Indian Energy Exchange MCX and BSE. However these are linked more to views than to news say market experts.There are ample roadblocks in NSE’s IPO path and the company has not yet taken clearance or moved to file its (draft red herring prospectus) DRHP they add.In April 2019 the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) barred the NSE from accessing the capital markets for six months for alleged lapses at its colocation facility. The market regulator also directed the exchange to “disgorge” Rs 625 crore along with 12 per cent interest since April 2014. The pendency of this case is seen as a major roadblock for the exchange’s IPO.This is not the only hurdle. Market veterans say NSE may have to take a back seat as Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) may sprint ahead with its initial offering.Arun Kejriwal founder of KRIS Investments says NSE's IPO could be pushed back to fast-track the initial offer of LIC which is the primary focus of the government. LIC's IPO has to happen in the current financial year and one should not be surprised if it knocks the door after the budget he says. ""This may postpone the IPO of NSE maybe to the next financial year.""This way the issues won't clash with each other.According to market sources LIC may file its DRHP in the last week of December and the clearance won't take much time.Ambareesh Baliga an independent market analyst says this is the best time for any company to come out with an IPO. ""There is no clarity over the issue so far. NSE's initial stake sale should hit the street before LIC's mega IPO"" he adds.Unlisted shares of the National Stocks Exchange are available at Rs 3800 apiece which pushes the market capitalisation of the largest exchange in the country to Rs 1.5 lakh crore. Market players expect the NSE to command a valuation around Rs 2 lakh crore. This would make it another mega issue. The exchange may try to raise more funds than Paytm’s IPO which was India's largest.Sandip Ginodia CEO Altius Investech says ""The IPO of NSE is definitely on the cards and a much awaited issue but there is no fixed timeline for it. Even the shares of the bourse are not freely tradeable.""",,,,,,

Originally created in 1886 Coca-Cola has been through plenty of ups and downs over the years. But the Coke recipe has stayed largely the same save for the brand's ill-advised foray into ""New Coke."" The company has also added plenty of other drinks to its name too including things like Diet Coke as well as acquisitions like the Minute Maid family of juices.

And while it will probably be a favorite drink for years to come Coke fans are doing way more than just sipping it over ice. Recipes like cola chicken and Coca-Cola cake have fashioned new ways to make use of Coke's sweet fizzy nature. However you like it Coke is one product that's here to stay. So pour yourself a glass and dive into the brand's history.

The logo is red because of old tax laws

John Stith Pemberton who created Coke in 1886 had originally billed the soda as a ""temperance"" drink or an alternative to alcohol. And because alcohol was heavily taxed in the 19th century Coca-Cola wanted to make sure its (non-alcoholic) drink wasn't subject to those taxes.

""We began painting our barrels red so that tax agents could distinguish them from alcohol during transport"" a Coca-Cola spokesperson told Business Insider. The bright color is still an easy way for fans to recognize Coke cans and bottles today.

The iconic bottle design was created to help Coke stand out from its competitors

As Coca-Cola explains on its website there were plenty of imposter sodas trying to cash in on Coke's fame in the early 1900s. (Some of them had seriously funny names too like Koka-Nola and Toka-Cola.) So in 1915 the Trustees of the Coca-Cola Bottling Association asked glass bottling companies to design a ""bottle so distinct that you would recognize it by feel in the dark or lying broken on the ground.""

The winning company the Root Glass Company created the now-iconic green bottle. With the ridges on each bottle and the embossed Coca-Cola logo the design set the soda apart from its competitors. These days you're more likely to find Coke in a plastic bottle or a can but you can still find the glass bottles at some retailers.

Coke really did contain cocaine at one point

This isn't just a viral legend—The New York Times confirmed it in a 1996 article that included comments from a Coca-Cola spokesperson.

It all goes back to the coca plant which cocaine comes from the Times explained. While Coke contained actual cocaine in the late 19th century when it was first invented it now includes a ""non-narcotic extract"" derived from the coca plant.

""Ingredients from the coca leaf are used but there is no cocaine in it and it is all tightly overseen by regulatory authorities"" a Coca-Cola spokesperson told the Times in 1996. Still the paper confirmed that wasn't the case in Coke's earliest days.

As History.com points out though cocaine and other drugs weren't illegal until 1914. So while the idea of drinking it in soda seems pretty foreign now it wasn't as weird at the time.

No-sugar-added recipes you'll actually look forward to eating.

Coca-Cola invented the six-pack

While the term ""six-pack"" tends to conjure images of beer nowadays it was originally a way to buy and carry multiple bottles of Coke. According to the company's website Coca-Cola invented the six-pack in 1923.

The company helped popularize open-top coolers

If you've packed a tub of soda or beer in a cooler for a road trip or beach day you have Coca-Cola to thank. While metal buckets had been used to hold water for years Coca-Cola helped modernize the cooler.

According to a PDF from the company Coca-Cola debuted ""the first standardized open-top cooler"" in 1929. The rolling metal contraption held up to 72 Coke bottles promising to keep them cool.

Coca-Cola later hired industrial designer Raymond Loewy in the 1940s and he helped create a more portable version of the cooler. The designer even thought to put a bottle opener on the cooler making it easier to take the drink on the go.

Coca-Cola is at least partially responsible for Santa as you know him

When you picture Santa is he a plump bearded older man who's wearing red? You can thank Coca-Cola for that image at least in part. In 1931 the company hired Haddon Sundblom to paint images of Santa holding Coke bottles. According to Coca-Cola those pictures helped ""create the modern interpretation of St. Nick.""

The Coca-Cola recipe is kept in a secure vault

You can't see the recipe itself but you can see where it's kept. At the World of Coca-Cola museum in Atlanta you can visit The Vault of the Secret Formula exhibit where the recipe is held.

Before it (well the vault) was on display at the museum the recipe was in a vault in an Atlanta bank. Coca-Cola is quite literally keeping its signature formula under lock and key.

And in case you're curious here are 17 Things That Happen to Your Body When You Drink Soda.

Coke was the first product featured on a Time magazine cover

In 1950 Time featured a cover illustration that showed the Earth drinking from a Coke bottle. The artwork shows just how popular Coke had become. But according to the company the illustration wasn't what the magazine originally wanted.

""The magazine wants to have a photo of Robert Woodruff on the cover but he refuses stating that the product is the only important element in the company"" Coca-Cola explained in a PDF about its history. Woodruff's intuition seems to have paid off; the cover is definitely a memorable one.

The backlash to New Coke was swift

Stranger Things fans were excited to try New Coke when the company re-released it last summer in partnership with the '80s-set Netflix series. But when New Coke hit the scene in 1985 consumers weren't happy with the new soda formula. In fact it had only been on sale for 79 days before the company brought back ""Coca-Cola Classic"" to appease fans.

The Coca-Cola bears have only been around since the '90s

It's hard to think of Coke without its holiday advertising and special-edition polar bear cans. But the bears didn't become synonymous with the brand until 1993 when the Coca-Cola Company released its ""Northern Lights"" commercial. The polar bears have been a part of Coke's holiday campaigns ever since.

Coke was the first soda in space

In 1985 astronauts drank Coke on the Challenger space shuttle. That marked the first soft drink consumption in space according to the company.

(One thing you won't find on astronauts' missions though is astronaut ice cream. It's never been in space in part because its crumbs could pose safety risks.)

The Coca-Cola Company once thought the soda could replace your morning coffee

In the late 1980s the company's ""Coke in the Morning"" campaign urged people to replace their morning coffee with a Coke The New York Times reported in 1988.

And while drinking soda might sound weird it was more common at the time than you might expect. Citing figures from the Coca-Cola Company the Times reported that 12% of soft drink sales included ""morning consumption."" The ad campaign may not have led coffee fans to give up their morning java entirely but it did put a new spin on drinking soda.

A pharmacist invented Coke—and it was advertised as having medical properties

John Stith Pemberton a pharmacist in Atlanta created Coke in 1886 as we mentioned above. But the earliest ads for the soda suggested that it had medical benefits for consumers too. One early print advertisement bills the soda as ""a cure for all nervous affections"" including hysteria. Yeah that's probably not something modern doctors would agree with.

The original Coke bottle got its shape from a cocoa bean—but there's no cocoa in the soda

Remember how Coca-Cola created its unique bottle to stand out from the competition? Well the earlier bottle designs might have led to a lot of confusion. As the company explains its designers were inspired by ""an illustration of a cocoa bean"" with the ridges and round shape. But at the time Coke was made with trace ingredients from the coca plant not the cocoa plant. Whether or not it was actually a mistake it's still pretty funny.

A Coke employee once got a prison sentence for trying to sell secrets to Pepsi

This might sound like something that's straight out of a TV drama but it really happened. In 2007 former Coca-Cola secretary Joya Williams received an eight-year prison sentence for trying to sell company secrets to rival soda maker Pepsi.

Williams allegedly tried to send ""confidential documents and samples of products"" from Coke to Pepsi The Associated Press reported at the time.

As AP reported Pepsi went to the FBI rather than accepting the trade secrets. An undercover investigation led to charges for Williams and two co-defendants.

There was once White Coke for a very specific reason

As the story goes Russian general Georgy Zhukov who fought in World War I and World War II had a weakness for Coke. Not wanting his fellow Russians to see him drinking American Coke he personally asked the company for a discreet version Atlas Obscura explained. Coca-Cola went along with the plan creating a ""White Coke"" in clear bottles for Zhukov to enjoy.

Mexico is the world's top consumer of Coke products

A 2013 PDF on the Coca-Cola Company's website puts Mexico at the front of its consumption numbers. The average person in Mexico drinks 745 servings of Coke a year according to the chart; in the United States that number is 401. That includes all Coca-Cola Company products not just soda but it's still a huge figure.

Coca-Cola invented coupons

You may have heard that the first Coke servings were given away for free but did you know there was a science behind it? As Wired reported Coke became popular in the late 19th century in part thanks to ""tickets"" that could be redeemed for free servings. They weren't much different from the coupons shoppers use today.

Coca-Cola once tried its hand at ""drinkable advertising""

In 2015 Coca-Cola created ads that allowed viewers to use music service Shazam to get free Coke Zeros at local retailers.

The same year Coca-Cola also created a Coke Zero billboard at the NCAA Final Four event in Indianapolis. The ""Taste It"" sign featured a tube of Coke Zero that fans could sample right from the billboard. That's one way to introduce people to your product.

Coca-Cola's holiday cans have hidden images on them

Sure you know Coca-Cola's adorable polar bears. But the company actually likes hiding other images within the cute illustrations. Look at this 2017 Coca-Cola holiday can for instance. The bears' noses feature white Coke bottles and their eyes are shaped like upside-down bottle caps.

And for more fun secrets check out these 11 Packaged Foods with Hidden Messages in Their Logos.

Coca-Cola's typography is trademarked

You won't see other logos with the Coca-Cola font and that's not an accident. In 1893 the company registered the trademark for ""Spencerian script"" with the U.S. Patent Office.

Coca-Cola is one of the Olympics' longest-running sponsors

Coca-Cola has sponsored the Olympic Games since 1928. Sure Coke isn't the most hydrating option for athletes during a workout but fans and Olympians alike have been enjoying Coke for decades thanks to this partnership.

Coke can be used as a makeshift bug repellent

No we don't mean that you should douse yourself in soda before going outside. But bugs are attracted to sugar and you can use that to your advantage. Setting out a Coke (or any other sweet drink) at a healthy distance away from where you're eating could draw the bugs toward the soda and away from you.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

People swear by using Coke in recipes too

Cola chicken is a popular dish as is Coca-Cola cake. It's essentially a fudgy chocolate cake but with the sweet taste of Coke added to the mixture.

Fanta came way before Diet Coke

You might assume that when Coca-Cola started branching out into other drinks Diet Coke would have been a natural fit. But Fanta Orange was introduced in Italy in 1955 and in the United States in 1960 the company notes on its website. Even Sprite hit the soda scene pretty early in the game making its debut in 1961. Diet Coke meanwhile was introduced in 1982.

Another thing that came before Diet Coke? The company's acquisition of Minute Maid which happened in 1960.

Diet Coke wasn't the company's first diet soda

Yes there were decades between Fanta's release and Diet Coke's. But the Coca-Cola Company actually entered the diet soda game in 1963. Tab which was advertised as having ""just one calorie"" was launched that year. When Diet Coke was launched the company used a similar ""only one calorie"" phrasing to sell the new product.

Coca-Cola once ran a seriously gross giveaway promotion

Coke's ""MagiCans"" weren't so magic at all. It's hard to explain this 1990 promotion because it's just so odd but essentially Coke was selling cans that weren't actually filled with soda.

The Coca-Cola Company wanted to run a promotion where certain cans held cash or coupons instead of Coke. But it also wanted to discourage users from lifting them and determining that the lighter cans would contain prizes. So instead of filling the cans with Coke they filled them with water that was combined with ""chlorine and foul-smelling ammonium sulfate"" The New York Times reported.

The ""foul smell"" was supposed to stop people from drinking them but some of course did anyway. Lesson learned: Don't put something in a drink container if you don't want people to drink it.

North Korea is one of the only places where you can't buy or sell Coke (at least officially)

In 2017 the Associated Press reported that Cuba and North Korea are the only countries in which Coca-Cola ""doesn't officially operate."" Still the outlet pointed out that there are plenty of Coke knockoffs for sale in North Korea. And imported Coke from China makes its way into ""upscale grocery stores"" in parts of the country AP noted. Where there's a will there's a way.

The St. John the Baptist church in Mexico uses Coke in religious services

Colloquially known as the ""Coca-Cola Church"" St. John the Baptist uses Coke during religious ceremonies. (Really!) Business Insider reported that the church's followers think burping ""purges evil from the soul."" And what better way to induce burps than by drinking soda?

Some people swear by drinking ""milk Coke""

The video garnered criticism from many who saw it as a tone-deaf stunt that completely misses the show’s point about income inequality. In response MrBeast’s fans pointed out how he gives away large sums of cash throughout the video even to those eliminated and is generally seen as a humanitarian.

“Mr. Beast is literally donating so much money giving meals to homeless people saving the oceans etc so let this man have fun” one of his defenders wrote on Twitter.

“Saving the oceans” refers to a campaign MrBeast is running with fellow YouTuber Mark Rober called Team Seas. The goal is to raise $US30 (A$43) million to clean 14 million kilograms of trash out of the ocean. “Let’s show the world that we want a clean ocean” MrBeast says in the official campaign video as he recruits dozens of volunteers to pick up trash on a beach; that video had more than 48 million views as of early December and the campaign has already raised $US17 (A$24) million in a few short weeks.

But Team Seas feels closer to MrBeast’s Squid Game and his other stunts rather than something truly aspirational. It’s entertaining to watch makes you root for the participants makes you feel good about the outcome. But the spectacle does nothing to address the deeper problems at hand — and is even providing cover for some polluters to greenwash their reputation. Ultimately it’s a form of positive entertainment. The campaign’s efforts to take those million pounds out of the ocean though will be undone in a depressingly short amount of time. To really be effective this (or any) campaign must look at the broader picture of stopping plastic pollution at its source.

MrBeast is a household name to millions of young people thanks to his stunt videos that rack up an astounding amount of views. His video where he spent 50 hours buried alive was YouTube’s top trending video in 2021; it currently has a jaw-dropping 148 million views.

Part of MrBeast’s appeal has always been his do-gooder bent. Many of his elaborate challenges involve giving away enormous amounts of money at the end. (He once bought a literal island for $US800000 (A$1140320) and gave it away to the winner of a series of challenges.) Polling by Insider shows he’s the most well-liked creator on YouTube. The Team Seas campaign follows a similar initiative MrBeast launched last year called Team Trees which raised $US20 (A$29) million to plant 20 million trees. Both are reminiscent of other MrBeast-style stunts except these ones are designed to get his viewership involved in a good cause.

Neither MrBeast nor Rober’s official Team Seas videos mention any causes of plastic pollution and they made no public requirements of creators who wanted to participate to do any education about the root causes of the problem or more effective ways to get involved.

But before the Team Seas campaign even began it was a source of controversy with some scientists in the YouTuber community. That’s because it’s being done in partnership with the Ocean Cleanup a group that has come under widespread criticism by scientists for its techniques to scoop up plastic from the open ocean. The Team Seas campaign is being used to fund the group’s river cleanup that relies on robots modelled heavily after preexisting trash wheels working in cities like Baltimore to passively clean trash from the mouths of rivers. Scientists say that one of the best ways to do ocean cleanup is to prevent the trash from going in in the first place which machines like the Ocean Cleanup’s are very good at.

“We hope from the TeamSeas partnership to receive funding to raise 15 million pounds of trash from some of the most polluted rivers in the world” Joost Dubois the director of communications for the Ocean Cleanup said in an email.

Still Virginia Schutte a science communicator with a PhD in ecology who runs a YouTube channel and TikTok remembers opening an unlisted video pitching creators on getting involved with Team Seas ahead of the late October launch. Even before she hit play she could guess who the partner cleaning up the trash would be — and a deep trepidation.

“I went to the video and was like ‘oceans. I like oceans. Please don’t be the Ocean Cleanup’” she said. “They said ‘the Ocean Cleanup’ and I was yelling at my phone ‘No!’ I know [MrBeast’s] purpose is to do good. I was concerned that he may not know the controversial stuff about the Ocean Cleanup.”

In October days before the official launch Schutte and a group of other climate and science communicators were discussing their concerns about the campaign in a private Discord server. One of them invited Matt Fitzgerald the campaign director for both Team Seas and Team Trees to participate in the conversation. (Earther tried repeatedly to get in touch with Fitzgerald and the Team Seas and Team Trees press team to ask questions about the campaign but they didn’t return any of our messages.)

“We are fully aware of the controversy surrounding the ocean work of The Ocean Cleanup” Fitzgerald wrote in Discord chats shared with Earther saying that although he himself was “extremely sceptical“ going into the project the Ocean Cleanup was the only nonprofit doing river cleanup work at the Team Seas campaign price point of $US1 (A$1.43) for each pound of trash. When pressed about how the campaign might inadvertently promote the Ocean Cleanup’s work Fitzgerald pointed out that the Team Seas imagery was “the dominant — often exclusive” brand for the campaign meaning that people would mentally link the money they’d give to the Team Seas effort not the Ocean Cleanup.

But the actual campaign materials are another story. The video released by the Team Seas campaign by Rober which had nearly 21 million views in early December focuses almost completely on the Ocean Cleanup’s robots. Those bots have the Ocean Cleanup’s logo prominently displayed the video highlights the nonprofit’s “audacious goal to rid the ocean of all trash and plastic” and Rober interviews Ocean Cleanup founder Boyan Slat whose story of becoming inspired to clean up the ocean as a teenager has long been the calling card for much of the brand’s fundraising. (Slat does emphasise in the video that he hopes eventually his nonprofit “goes out of business” as people figure out how to stop producing so much plastic.)

“Glad to see Slat’s creations getting the recognition it deserves!” one comment on the video reads.

“Picking up 30 million pounds of trash out of the ocean is great but I am concerned about the long-term legacy of a bunch of people who are just stepping into their advocacy selves thinking of the Ocean Cleanup as a go-to solution for pollution” Schutte said.

Beyond the involvement of the Ocean Cleanup the fundraising has led to some interesting partners. By all accounts the Team Seas campaign is on track to exceed its goal of raising $US30 (A$43) million by January thanks to six-figure donations from the likes of YouTube and its CEO as well as a hefty donation from the CEO of Shopify and contributions from a collection of NFT and crypto tokens.

The top donor list however also features Royal Caribbean. The cruise line has made a to-do about banning plastic straws and cutting down 60% of single-use plastics. But it also received a D+ from Friends of the Earth for its ships’ environmental standards. That includes getting an F in water quality compliance.

Another top donor is the Bikoff Foundation which has according to the Team Seas leaderboard donated $US1 (A$1.43) million. The foundation is run by Jill Bikoff and her husband J. Darius Bikoff who made hundreds of millions after selling his company Energy Brands (the makers of Vitamin Water) to Coca-Cola. The bottled beverage industry is an enormous source of ocean plastic pollution and Coca-Cola is the world’s top producer of plastic waste. Despite making big promises on recycling the company has refused to set any target to stop using disposable plastic and has actively lobbied behind-the-scenes against recycling initiatives. (Coca-Cola is also a sponsor of the Ocean Cleanup’s river work.)

It’s hard not to feel a pang of disappointment from what the Team Seas campaign could have been. Scientists say that while there are productive ways to clean ocean trash totally ridding the ocean of garbage is basically impossible and that any campaign that ignores the causes of plastic pollution misses the point. The Team Seas goal of 30 million pounds of trash may sound lofty but it’s a drop in the bucket. An estimated 8 billion kilograms of trash are dumped in the ocean each year translating to a rate of a little over 900000 kilograms each hour. That means Team Seas’ cleanup will be undone in about 15 hours — about eight hours less than one of MrBeast’s earliest viral videos featuring him counting to 100000. The rate of plastic entering the seas is set to triple over the coming decades if polluters aren’t stopped.

The Team Seas website includes a very thorough FAQ that explains some of the core causes of plastic pollution documents how oil and gas companies are contributing to the problem. It also contextualizes the cleanup methods the campaign has chosen and explains that it ultimately hopes to inspire a larger movement to demand more permanent solutions. But many of the most popular videos in the campaign — essentially the public face — have none of that messaging. Neither MrBeast nor Rober’s official Team Seas videos mention any causes of plastic pollution and they made no public requirements of creators who wanted to participate to do any education about the root causes of the problem or more effective ways to get involved.

Yet the need to cut off plastic at the source isn’t a hard one to communicate in video format. In a video criticising the Team Seas project YouTuber Simon Clark filmed himself in a bathtub covered with plastic bottles; a hand reaches in to take a bottle away from him. “Thank you” he tells the offscreen person. “By the way could you do something about the people who are just adding the plastic in?” In response the person throws even more trash onto him. The video goes on to discuss solutions as well as charities working on them right now that Clark says “would produce a far greater impact than just taking some plastic out of the oceans” if a campaign like Team Seas turned the spotlight on them.

A talented YouTuber like MrBeast who has the attention of millions of subscribers who want to help fix problems should have been able to figure out a fun way to convey messages about cutting down personal plastic waste working on local recycling initiatives or holding companies that continue to create plastic accountable. Doing so could make a huge difference in how his viewers think about plastic use moving forward enacting long-lasting change rather than relying on flashy cleanups that while important obscure the bigger problem.

Perhaps this all seems too critical. After all the methods showcased in the Team Seas campaign have been praised even by those dubious of larger-scale ocean cleanup efforts as crucial to keeping communities and beaches clean. MrBeast’s positive brand isn’t exactly the best format to attack big polluters like Coca-Cola which itself runs one of the most popular brand channels on YouTube. And even though cleaning up 30 million pounds of trash will make next to no difference in the ocean if watching MrBeast pick up plastic bottles on the beach can galvanize someone who wouldn’t otherwise care about pollution that’s fantastic.

But the positive PR for MrBeast’s brand also shouldn’t be ignored. He received widespread accolades for his Team Trees campaign which garnered donations from companies like Verizon and figureheads like Elon Musk and was the subject of a documentary; he has already appeared with Rober on Jimmy Kimmel to promote Team Seas. YouTube which partially sponsored the initiative is also benefiting from the positive attention focused on one of its native stars.

MrBeast has an entire channel devoted to philanthropy and “charitable” stunts are a core part of his brand. That’s great given the myriad challenges the world faces but hopefully he thinks about ways to convey how to solve them at the source moving forward rather than just apply Band-Aids. With the world watching his every move he has the rare opportunity to really make a difference if he does that."

By Aditya Kalra and Abhirup Roy

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's household goods salesmen have threatened to disrupt supplies to mom-and-pop stores if consumer companies provide products at lower prices to Reliance Industries according to a letter seen by Reuters.

Reuters reported last month https://reut.rs/3FAVZKK Indian salesmen representing companies such as Reckitt Benckiser Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive said their sales had dropped 20-25% in the last year as mom-and-pop stores were increasingly partnering with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance.

Ambani's deeply discounted offerings were prompting more stores to order digitally from his JioMart Partner app posing an existential threat to more than 450000 company salesmen who for decades served every corner of the vast nation by going store-to-store to take orders.

Citing the Reuters story the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation - which has 400000 members - has written to consumer companies demanding a level playing field saying they must get products at same prices like other big corporate distributors such as Reliance.

If the pricing-parity demand is not met the group said in its letter its salesmen will stop distribution of products to mom-and-pop stores and will also not supply newly launched consumer goods if such partnerships continue beyond Jan 1.

""We have earned reputation and goodwill amongst our retailers by giving them good service for many years ... We have decided to call a 'Non-cooperation' movement"" said the letter.

The group's president Dhairyashil Patil said the letter was sent to Reckitt Hindustan Unilever Colgate and 20 other consumer goods companies.

None of the three consumer companies as well as Reliance responded to requests for comment.

Mom-and-pop stores or ""kiranas"" account for 80% of a near-$900 billion https://reut.rs/2OYLmMV retail market in India. About 300000 such stores in 150 cities order goods from Reliance with the company setting a target of 10 million partner stores by 2024.

Traditional distributors have told Reuters they have been forced to cut vehicle fleet and staff as their business has been suffering because they can't match Reliance's pricing.

Jefferies in March estimated kiranas will ""steadily increase the share of procurement"" from Reliance ""at the cost of traditional distributors"". Such sales for Reliance could mushroom to $10.4 billion by 2025 from just $200 million in 2021-22 Jefferies estimates.

Just this week for example we highlighted a supplement that was recalled because of a pressure issue that could cause an explosion upon opening. And now comes word via the FDA of another recall involving Broccoli Tots from the popular Birds Eye brand. This Birds Eye recall was put into place because there’s a potential that some packages contain small rocks and metal fragments.

How to identify the items subject to the Birds Eye recall

All told there are four Broccoli Tots items that are part of the food recall. The relevant UPC code on all items is 00-0-14500-00125- 2. There are six Best By Dates to be aware of: August 19 August 25 August 11 August 12 November 17 and November 10. Note that all of these Best By dates are for 2022.

A picture of the packaging can be seen below:

What’s noteworthy about the Birds Eye recall is that it wasn’t put into place out of an abundance of caution. Per the FDA Conagra Brands which is the parent company has already received two injury reports involving the product. Specifically the injuries involve dental damage from users biting down on hard foreign objects.

Consumers who have the product above in their freezer should get rid of it as soon as possible. Conagra also urges consumers who may have been injured to talk to a healthcare provider.

Lastly consumers who have any concerns or questions about the Birds Eye recall can contact the company at 1-800-921-7404. The hotline is open from 9 AM to 5 PM Central Time Monday through Friday.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Institutional investors are typically diverse companies or organizations like a hedge fund or mutual fund that invest money for other people instead of private investors who use their own money.

In a multifamily trade California-based Canyon View Capital paid $25.6 million to buy three properties in downtown Bentonville. The principal of Newell Development in Bentonville Jake Newell built all three from 2017 to 2020 and sold them with a combined occupancy of 97% across 85 units.

Newell described the purchase price of approximately $301000 per unit as “record-setting” for the region.

In an office deal New York-based Global Net Lease (GNL) a publicly-traded real estate investment trust (REIT) listed on the New York Stock Exchange paid $40.6 million for a 90334-square-foot office building on Southeast J Street in Bentonville that Walmart leases. A limited liability company managed by longtime real estate executive and entrepreneur Ramsay Ball of Bentonville was the seller. The three-story building opened last year.

“When you have national groups that are coming to our market and seeing the potential and investing here it validates the market” Ball said. “Some [institutional investors] we had who were looking a few years ago [viewed this] as a tertiary market. We’ve had a hard time cracking that. It’s continued evidence of the attractiveness of the market.”

Those acquisitions indicate that the commercial real estate market in Northwest Arkansas is maturing and gaining greater visibility among institutional investors. Still among various commercial real estate executives it is debatable whether they are a bellwether.

“For the most part and in most sectors I don’t think the institutional money has shown up [in Northwest Arkansas] yet” said Steve Lane managing director of Colliers Arkansas in Rogers. The Little Rock-based company is the largest commercial real estate firm in Arkansas with more than 18 million square feet of commercial space leased and managed.

“Our experience from talking to many larger investment houses is that they like to do deals in big markets. Markets where they can build a portfolio.”

Northwest Arkansas commercial real estate broker Clinton Bennett who owns Bennett Commercial Real Estate in Rogers said he still considers the region a tertiary market. Still defining a tertiary market is subjective and Bennett believes investors are warming to the idea of putting more of their money in Northwest Arkansas.

“I think we are seeing investments made by groups that traditionally would not have looked at tertiary markets” he said. “In the past a refrain we would hear is ‘We like those assets but your market just isn’t big enough.’ It seems like now they are comfortable with the size and trajectory of our market. Maybe the trajectory is the same but the demand has expanded significantly.

“Because of Crystal Bridges the Walton investments the Northwest Arkansas Council University of Arkansas the quality of life amenities and investment — I think we’ve hit on a whole different layer of investors.”

According to the U.S. Census the Northwest Arkansas metro remains just outside the country’s 100 largest regions with roughly 550000 residents (No. 105). Still the population has grown by nearly 25% since 2010 one of the fastest-growing regions in the country.

BY THE NUMBERS

Paul Hendershot an analyst with commercial real estate data and analytics business CoStar Group said the Northwest Arkansas market is seeing an increase in the number of institutional buyers.

“I would say it is higher [in 2021] but it is hard to pinpoint since one deal can have an outsized influence on the percentage” he said.

CoStar data indicates that institutional buyers comprised 25% of Northwest Arkansas’ office market sales volume of $166.1 million year-to-date in 2021.

The institutional activity this year compares with 4% in 2020 19% in 2019 and 2% in 2018 and — as Hendershot indicated — is almost entirely attributed to the $40.6 million Global Net Lease acquisition in Bentonville. According to CoStar that deal is the only Northwest Arkansas purchase by institutional investors that’s eclipsed $1 million this year.

Hendershot says many out-of-state and institutional investors look to Northwest Arkansas for less expensive assets and higher returns that many primary and secondary markets cannot provide. The office market cap rate — a real estate valuation measure of a property’s ROI — of 9% is higher than the national average of 6.9%

The total sales volume in Northwest Arkansas’ office market is also increasing. It’s at an all-time high this year. The only other year that office sector sales volume topped $150 million was 2016 ($156.8 million).

“Looking at the data investors have found Northwest Arkansas” Hendershot said. “It’s a vibrant market with solid economic underpinnings and a stable tenant base. That’s increasing the exposure to national investors.”

This year Northwest Arkansas also sees a significant increase in multifamily sales volume reaching nearly $290 million year-to-date. The price per unit has also reached an all-time high of $105502 per unit.

In terms of buyer type Hendershot said 17% are institutional 15% are private equity and 68% are private. Private equity refers to real estate funds that cater to high net-worth individuals who raise equity to purchase real estate. Private refers to companies whose control is private and whose business is primarily geared toward operating developing or investing in commercial real estate.

“I think everybody likes multifamily right now” Lane said. “They [investors] are all chasing returns. The cap rates are getting so low in the big metro areas and we are starting to show up on the radar.”

Lane said Northwest Arkansas doesn’t lack buyers no matter who they are or where they come from.

“We have a lack of product” he said. “You pull up CoStar at a given time and see what’s for sale and there isn’t a whole lot in this market. There’s a lot of opportunity for development. We need more square footage on the ground.”

INVESTOR INSIGHT

Jason Slear leads the acquisitions group for Global Net Lease which has a market capitalization of approximately $1.59 billion and a diversified portfolio of more than 300 properties in 12 countries worldwide.

Slear said GNL’s Bentonville acquisition was the company’s first in Arkansas. He said it was an “interesting opportunity” for GNL because of the tenant and the location.

“One of the things we look for when we buy assets is the creditworthiness of the tenant and Walmart’s credit is pretty much as good as it gets right now” he said. “It ticked all the boxes from an investment standpoint — lease duration the tenant’s credit and rental increases.”

Walmart has seven years remaining on the building lease term.

Would GNL’s interest in Northwest Arkansas have been just as strong if the building tenant was an entity other than Walmart?

“I’m an avid mountain biker so any property that’s in Bentonville is worth its weight in gold to me” Slear joked. “If it was another tenant same credit different name same market I think we would have underwritten it the same way. [Northwest Arkansas] is exploding. We did our research and you can’t not read about the whole area. It’s a good marketplace and it’s in the path of expansion. Which is where you want to be if you are a long-term real estate investor.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now the property has been clearcut to make way for a new Costco store near the intersection of Highway 9 and 20th Street SE. (Chuck Taylor / Herald file)

Until now Marcus Tageant would not confirm his role in the multimillion-dollar sale of acreage that is soon to be a Costco.

LAKE STEVENS — The city will soon cash in on the arrival of Costco. For longtime City Council member Marcus Tageant that payday was in June.

Costco is aiming to open a big new store in the city next fall. Lake Stevens expects to bring in a boatload of sales tax revenue each year.

One of the last pieces of the puzzle fell into place in June when Costco purchased two properties from the city and several adjacent properties from the Nordin family. Collectively the properties sold for about $8 million according to records from the Snohomish County Assessor’s Office.

The broker for the family?

Councilmember Tageant.

As the owner of Task Properties Tageant was set to make a 2.5% commission on the sale according to a 2014 Commercial Brokers Association listing shared with The Daily Herald. The Nordin family’s properties sold for about $4.2 million — which works out to just over $100000 for Tageant.

He wouldn’t confirm or deny that commission but said in an interview last week that the sale was “one of my probably top 10.”

Can a council member profit from a development deal that hinges on council decisions?

Sure but with caveats.

Washington State law recognizes “council members are real people with real jobs” said Candice Bock director of government relations at the Association of Washington Cities. “You have small towns and the local business owners are the ones who run for council.”

But they can’t vote on city decisions when they have a personal stake.

And they need to state their conflict of interest which “must be recorded in the official minutes of the city council” according to the Association of Washington Cities Small City Resource Manual.

When votes related to Costco came up “Marcus always recused himself” Mayor Brett Gailey said. If the development agreement was on the council’s agenda he often walked out of the room.

“I left the room so I wouldn’t accidentally give an expression or look if there was a vote” Tageant said.

He would neither confirm nor deny his role in the Costco sale because of non-disclosure agreements he told the Herald in 2019.

“I think the word got on the street” he said in the interview Thursday. “I just couldn’t have a conversation about it.”

Public records now hint at how much Tageant may have profited from the sale.

The council member sold the Nordin family’s properties at 2402 S Lake Stevens Road for about $4.2 million according to records of the Snohomish County Assessor’s Office.

The city of Lake Stevens sold the two neighboring properties to Costco for about $3.8 million through a direct sale according to Russ Wright community development director for the city.

Tageant was first elected to the City Council in 2009. He fell short in a race for mayor against John Spencer in 2015 and he narrowly won his seat again this year over Joseph Jensen. This year Tageant was re-elected by just 402 votes.

In the recent election Tageant received about 90% of his campaign funds from those with a vested interest in local development.

Costco is planning to bring a 160000-square-foot retail outlet 30-pump gas station and more than 800 parking spots to the city’s “20th Street corridor” which was zoned commercial in 2012. If Costco didn’t move in another retailer could have.

In 2020 the average Costco location brought in almost $200 million in sales. In Lake Stevens that could mean about $600000 to spend in the city annually said Barb Stevens finance director.

It was a feat to bring the big box store to town.

“Costco has been going on for five years” Gailey said last week.

The corporation first showed some interest in the property in 2017 Tageant said. And things moved swiftly for the first few years.

Tageant credited the former mayor John Spencer for enticing Costco to the site. Initially Costco was turned off by limited road access.

In 2017 the city contracted The Watershed Company to conduct a wetland report to determine the feasibility of extending 24th Street SE to access the property. The city also fronted the roughly $3.4 million for the extension of 91st Avenue SE and related utility changes.

Spencer publicly confirmed Costco’s interest in 2018 and by early 2019 the store applied for its first permits.

Over 100 Lake Stevens residents showed up to early meetings about the proposed warehouse where one person called it “the biggest political issue of the year” in 2019.

And in 2020 Livable Lake Stevens a neighborhood coalition opposing the Costco filed a Land Use Petition Act lawsuit alleging the city tried to steamroll the project. It was dismissed by a Snohomish County Superior Court judge.

Early this year Costco got the required city permits and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approval to fill wetlands on the site and begin construction.

In June the Lake Stevens City Council passed an agreement to sell the remaining parcels to Costco by a vote of 6-0 with Tageant abstaining. Ground broke later in the month clearing the way for a massive warehouse in the middle of a neighborhood.

Though thousands of trees were cleared from the site Costco isn’t out of the woods yet.

Few companies have gained more of an advantage during the pandemic than America’s warehouse club giants.

During the early days of Covid shoppers flooded into Costco BJ’s and Sam’s Club — which were deemed “essential” businesses and stayed open through lockdowns — to load up on groceries and household staples such as toilet paper. Those customers are still coming 22 months later and many are buying even more stuff for their homes and families than they did before the crisis.

Millions of customers signed up for club memberships for the first time and held onto them pushing the chains’ member rolls to all-time highs.

Warehouse clubs have “gained quite a bit of share during Covid and continue to” said KK Davey the president of strategic analytics at market research firm IRI. “Lots of members have signed up. Once you’re in the club you continue to buy.”

Club stores gained 0.5% of market share in 2020 and 0.5% in 2021 adding up to around $16 billion according to IRI data. They have also had the fastest sales growth in 2021 from last year of any retail channel.

Their sales and profits have surged during the pandemic lifting their stock prices.

Shares of Costco (COST) — the largest club and third-biggest retailer in America behind Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN)— have increased around 90% since March of 2020.

Sam’s Club the second largest is a subsidiary of Walmart (WMT) and its sales have increased at a faster clip than Walmart (WMT)’s.

BJ’s (BJ) the smallest of the three clubs has seen its stock explode around 240%.

But 2022 may bring more challenges for these chains say analysts.

As prices stay high some shoppers may cut back on the discretionary subscriptions they aren’t using as much. If you have an Amazon subscription a Netflix (NFLX) subscription an Apple (AAPL) one Walmart+ and countless others do you really need to pay 50 or 60 bucks a year just to step foot in a shopping club?

Buying in bulk

When the Covid outbreak started many customers cut out their third and fourth favorite stores and focused on visiting only one or two.

They made fewer trips to stores to minimize potential exposure to the virus but loaded up when they were inside and spent more. This played right into the hands of warehouse clubs which specialize in selling giant packages of ketchup toilet paper and cleaning wipes.

This trend has continued into 2021.

Many people are still working remotely or are in a hybrid model. That means they’re still spending more on groceries than they were before the pandemic and sprucing up their living rooms home offices and backyards.

Warehouse clubs had the highest growth of customer visits to stores of any retail channel in 2021 according to IRI data.

The membership model also leads customers to spend more than they would without one say analysts. A sunk-cost fallacy often drives people to keep buying to try to get the most bang for their subscription fees.

Clubs are more than happy you take that approach: “The more members buy the more valuable the membership is to them” Sam’s Club CEO Kathryn McLay said in an email.

Delivery or curbside pickup?

Covid also pushed more people to buy online.

While warehouse clubs have not traditionally been a top choice for online delivery the companies took steps before the pandemic to build out their e-commerce businesses and technology options.

Wholesale clubs “haven’t always been convenient” BJ’s CEO Bob Eddy said in an email. “We have changed that.”

All three chains partnered with Instacart to offer same-day grocery delivery from stores. Sam’s Club launched Scan & Go which allows members to scan items without waiting in line.

In the early stages of the pandemic Sam’s Club and BJ’s also added same-day curbside pickup for customers buying online.

These moves have paid off helping clubs draw members eager to avoid stores and instead order for delivery or curbside pickup.

BJ’s online sales increased 44% during its latest quarter ending October 30 from the same stretch a year ago. Costco’s increased 12.1% during the nine weeks ending October 31 — its latest figures. They boomed 42.6% last year.

Sam’s Club’s e-commerce sales grew 32% during its previous quarter ending October 31.

Sam’s Club is finding that first and second-year members are likelier “to be more digitally engaged” than veteran members CEO McLay said.

Young families and new homes

The warehouse club model only works if these chains can sign up members every year and convince them to renew.

They make money off membership dues and the more members who pay them the lower the clubs can drive prices. Without that fee income the concept unravels.

The companies have locked in new members during the pandemic many of them younger families who moved to the suburbs and purchased their first homes.

Sam’s Club does not publicly disclose membership numbers but they are at a all-time company highs McClay said.

The majority of new members at Sam’s Club are Millennial families who buy in bulk for their kids and growing household needs she said.

BJ’s has added around 600000 new members since Covid-19 began bringing its membership base to more than 6 million.

“The pandemic has led to younger families moving out of cities to the suburbs” said CEO Eddy. “Many of our members join when they start a family.”

Costco has added more than 6 milliolan members during the pandemic and now has close to 62 million members.

Millennials make up the majority of new members at Costco said finance chief Richard Galanti adding that his chain has answered some analysts’ doubts that Costco was only a store for young shoppers’ parents.

“One of the concerns people have had over the years is that we’re for old people” he said. “But where else can you get an 8-pack of organic fresh kale?”

As more Millennials become parents and buy homes in the suburbs Costco will “see a new wave of members” entering their peak spending years Chuck Grom an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors said in a November 10 report upgrading Costco’s stock.

The future of clubs

Despite these clubs’ success during the pandemic their path gets trickier from here.

As more people return to offices eat out at restaurants go to movie theaters and resume pre-pandemic patterns they may decide to cut back on $300 or $400 runs to Costco or Sam’s. That would squeeze sales.

Rising prices may also lead some members to let their memberships lapse especially ones who recently joined.

As the help of federal stimulus fades and most goods get costlier shoppers may be forced to make trade-offs. If they’re not using their warehouse club memberships as frequently as Amazon Prime and other ones clubs may get cut.

“As budgets get tighter there will be a rationalizing” of memberships said KK Davey from IRI.

Still the clubs say people will be looking to save money on groceries and other stuff as prices rise.

Low prices are “why they pay the membership fee” BJ’s Bob Eddy said. “That becomes even more relevant in today’s inflationary market.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2hhdC1pdHMtbGlrZS10by1zaG9wLWF0LWNvc3Rjby1pbi11cy11ay0yMDIxLTEy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: What It's Like to Shop in Costco Stores in the US and UK,"Overall the shopping experience at the two stores was near identical aside from some key differences in the food goods on offer so die-hard fans on either side of the Atlantic can rest easy knowing that they're not missing out.

What comes to mind when you think of Costco? Maybe it's mega-tubs of mayo or the chance to score a sweet deal on some decent budget-priced booze. For the more anxious among us it could be those sky-high piles of boxes towering over our heads. (Ever stop to wonder what would happen if any of them took a tumble?) On a happier note there are all those yummy goodies at the food court to look forward to when we finally find our way out of the maze of aisles. For many Costco shoppers though no trip to the warehouse is complete without picking up at least one of those delicious – and oh so reasonably-priced - rotisserie chickens.

Costco rotisserie chickens it seems are a worldwide phenomenon. One Redditor in Taiwan posted a few shots of a rotisserie chicken they picked up at a Costco and revealed that their purchase came with a little added bonus they hadn't been expecting."

On the corner of Leicestershire Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire is grand old castle and stately home - Belvoir Castle.

It was originally a Norman castle built right after the invasions of 1066 and has been rebuilt three times into the beautiful country house you see today.

What you might not know is that it's quietly become a star of both the big and small screen - standing in for everything from the Pope's summer palace in Rome to Windsor Palace to the famous horror setting of Hill House.

Read more entertainment news here

Here's a few of the best - and worst - films and TV shows you might have spotted this grand old home in.

The Da Vinci Code

For the first film on our list we go on a mystery thriller adventure based on the international bestseller The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown.

Mid-way through this globetrotting adventure featuring Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou we see the Pope's summer palace Castel Gandolfo.

Only it's not the real thing - that's the exterior of Belvoir Castle with a bit of CGI makeup.

To be fair to the director and producers it would be hard to convince the Pope to film a movie about the secrets of the Catholic Church at his own house ...

And if you haven't seen the film you might have good reason. It's got a 23% rating on the film review website Rotten Tomatoes.

The Young Victoria

For a more British tale (and a much better-reviewed film) see The Young Victoria.

Belvoir Castle serves a big role in the film - the Regent's Gallery is Victoria's dressing room for her coronation and the ""Chinese dressing room"" is Victoria and Prince Albert's honeymoon suite.

The Elizabeth Saloon was the dressing room of the Duchess of Kent in the film and the Castle grounds are used as a stand-in for Windsor Great Park too.

It's a very fitting location for a Royal film - the real Queen Victoria and Prince Albert have visited Belvoir Castle and they actually slept in the Chinese wallpapered bedroom.

They brought a big group of famous faces with them too including the Duke of Wellington and Prime Minister of the time John Peel. Imagine the pressure the Castle staff must have been under to make sure everything was flawless for their visit!

The Haunting

Back to dud films for a bit - the 1999 remake of The Haunting was partially filmed here.

The 1963 The Haunting is a horror classic based on Shirley Jackson's novel The Haunting Of Hill House. When Dutch director Jan de Bont was looking for sets for his remake one of the places he landed on was Belvoir Castle.

All of the scenes set in Hill House's kitchen and pantry were shot at Belvoir Castle.

Exterior shots were done at nearby Harlaxton Manor along with some scenes of its Great Hall. A lot of the interior shots were built in a hangar in far-flung California.

Belvoir Castle might be glad it didn't play a bigger role in this remake with a truly awful 17% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

The Crown

(Image: Sam Churchill.)

From duds to global sensations - The Crown a drama about the life and reign of Queen Elizabeth II has used Belvoir Castle extensively.

For the first three seasons of The Crown Belvoir House was transformed into one of the most famous royal residences in the world - Windsor Castle.

Several interior shots were filmed there mostly using the Elizabeth Saloon and the Regent's Gallery. And the show has definitely played a part in Belvoir Castle's modern tourist popularity.

The producers moved into Burghley House near Stamford in Lincolnshire for season 4 so there's a new Windsor Castle on the block.

Victoria and Abdul

If you haven't guessed by now Belvoir Castle is a popular spot for Royal media - next up is 2017's Victoria & Abdul.

This comedy-drama about ""history's most unlikely friendship"" between Queen Victoria and her servant Abdul Karim starred Judi Dench Ali Fazal Michael Gambon - and was one of Tim Piggott-Smith's final outings before his death that year.

The film is a grand tour of Royal locations all around the UK and stops off at Belvoir Castle too. You can see the grounds entrance hall the the beautiful main staircase at Judi and Ali visit ""Windsor Castle"".

It shares the film with the real Balmoral Castle in Scotland and the Old Royal Naval College in London - so Belvoir Castle is in fine company in this film.

While Tim Paine was forced to resign as the Test captain under controversial circumstances before going on an indefinite break pacer Pat Cummins was handed over the reins of the team.But former India spinner Laxman Sivaramakrishnan feels that Cummins will have his task cut out. ""You want bowlers as captains.They are a rare breed. Not too many bowlers get the honour of captaining their country. But Cummins will have to do a lot of homework. He's got a very good deputy in Steve Smith although there has been some controversy over him with what happened in South Africa but Smith will certainly help him"" Sivaramakrishnan said in a virtual interaction organised by Sony Sports Network.""Being a bowler it won't be easy for Cummins because he will not only have to manage himself but the other bowlers also. He's got a lot of work to do. Generally if the batters do the captaincy it's a lot easier for the bowlers. This particular Australian team under Cummins how they are going to prove themselves and if they get the Ashes is a big big mystery and we'll have to wait and see"" he added.Siva who has played nine Tests and 16 ODIs for India will be part of the Tamil commentary panel for the upcoming Ashes Tour on Sony Ten 4 from December 8-January 18 2022.Elaborating on how Cummins can manage the workload Siva said: ""It's going to be summer in Australia so we might see him bowling short but effective spells that's the most important thing. He's also got to keep a tab of his record against certain players. He will have to identify the batters and probably try to bring himself into the attack when they are at the crease. He has to plan very well so a lot of homework needs to be done to be able to manage his workload and also become a successful captain.""Watch the 1st test of The Ashes Tour 2021 Live on Sony Six (English) Sony Ten 3 (Hindi) & Sony Ten 4 (Tamil & Telugu) channels 5:30 am IST onwards from 8th to 12th December 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9jcmlja2V0LzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvbWFraW5nLXBhdC1jdW1taW5zLW1lbnMtY3JpY2tldC1hZ2VkLTEzLWF1c3RyYWxpYXMtYXNoZXMtc2tpcHBlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The making of Pat Cummins: From men's cricket aged 13 to Australia's Ashes skipper... via a severed finger,"He scored 118 in one innings as an 11-year-old quite the achievement at that age and just seven years later he had gone from playing at Glenbrook’s Knapsack Oval to a Test debut.

His father Peter and brother Tim both played for Glenbrook which is about a 15-minute drive from Mount Riverview a small town on the fringes of the Blue Mountains where Cummins grew up. Cummins a little like Sam Curran was driven by being the youngest brother the one who had to stand up for himself in competitive backyard cricket matches.

The rough and tumble of family life with five children in the house led to the childhood accident that lives with Cummins now. Aged four the top of the middle finger of his right hand was severed when it was trapped in a door. ""I still get my sister in tears... she slammed the door on it” he once told the Cricket Australia website.

There are no photographs from his Glenbrook time or if there are they are in a box gathering dust in someone’s attic. “Nobody would have thought of taking them in those days” says Batty. It was a time before camera phones and digital photographs charted a child’s every move.

But there are plenty of pictures of Cummins at Penrith just down the road from Mount Riverview. Glenbrook is a feeder club into Penrith the local grade cricket side which is where Cummins soon became recognised as a prodigy heading for the top.

When you walk into the NA Hunter Pavilion at Penrith’s Howell Oval almost the first sight is a huge framed photograph of Cummins which also contains a signed shirt from his Test debut. On the opposite wall is a framed jumper and photograph of Trevor Bayliss in his 80s pomp; the former England coach is a legendary Penrith figure still often seen at the ground watching his son play for the first-grade side.

Speak to anyone at Glenbrook or Penrith about Cummins and they all recall a humble quiet boy who was seriously skilful for his age. The personality attributes remain and are why Cricket Australia ever aware of its image has risked appointing its first fast since 1956 to lead the Test side.

“It was 12-13 years ago that we first saw Pat. I just remember this skinny rangy kid with a mop of hair who could bowl fast and also bat quite well” says Paul Goldsmith the Penrith president. “What is a little-known fact is that the year he played in our Green Shield team (junior cricket) he was captain and that was his first captaincy experience. He was the leading run-scorer and we could see at that age he was going to be a pretty good bowler but he was a rounded cricketer as well. He was an athlete at a young age albeit just skin and bones.”

Within three seasons aged 17 he was playing first grade and had already been picked up by New South Wales. After one year of grade cricket and three Sheffield Shield games for New South Wales he was making his Test debut.

“I have seen players with ability get ahead of themselves but Pat was not like that. He was quiet humble a good listener and just a very nice person to be part of a group” says Goldsmith.

Cummins still occasionally turns out for Penrith when coming back from injury; the bond between grade cricket and the Test team still remains strong in Australia. “Normally there is a man and a dog watching grade cricket but when Pat comes back it always helps shift a few more burgers and beers” says Goldsmith.

In 2017 he starred as Penrith won their first title for 16 years Cummins bowling the last over in a limited-overs final and successfully defending five runs to win. There is a photograph of him jumping in the air celebrating with the same passion as if he had just knocked over Joe Root. “It is a good indication of how he views club cricket” says Goldsmith. “I remember before the game he said he was quite nervous because of the expectation that came with it. It meant a lot to him. He gives so much to the team. He comes back is humble and expects to be treated like a normal club cricketer - and he is and he treats his team-mates like that too. He is a natural leader.”

It was spotted all those years ago in the Glenbrook end-of-year report. “Patrick was always encouraging others” it said - the first hint of the skills needed to make him Australia’s 46th Test captain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0c21heC50di9jcmlja2V0L2NyaWNrZXQtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9pdGVtLzkxNTI4LWF1c3RyYWxpYS1vdXQtdG8tcHJvdmUtZ2FiYmEtcmVtYWlucy1hLWZvcnRyZXNzLWFzLWN1bW1pbnMtZXJhLXN0YXJ0cy13aXRoLWFzaGVzLWJhdHRsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australia out to prove Gabba remains a fortress as Cummins era starts with Ashes battle,"Australia will be expected to ensure normal service is resumed in the heat of an Ashes battle at the Gabba when they start a new era on Wednesday.

The Tim Paine sexting scandal presented Pat Cummins with the opportunity to become the first fast bowler to captain the Australia Test side.

Cummins was appointed less than a fortnight before his side start their defence of the urn against fierce rivals England with Steve Smith his assistant as Paine takes an indefinite mental health break from cricket.

The paceman has long since been talked of as a potential successor to Paine and gets his chance earlier than expected.

Cummins was already on a high from playing his part in Australia's maiden T20 World Cup triumph in Dubai last month and should thrive on the extra responsibility of being skipper.

Australia have not played a Test since they were consigned to a 2-1 home defeat to India in January and although England have had plenty of action in the longest format this year poor weather in Brisbane has badly hampered their preparations.

Stats Perform picks out some of the storylines sprinkled with some Opta data from an Australia perspective before one of the great sporting rivalries gets under way again.

Cummins to get Australia going?

Cummins has led Australia's pace attack on many occasions and was the pick of the bowlers in a 2-2 Ashes series draw in England two years ago taking 29 wickets at average of 19.62.

Since the start of 2018 no bowler has claimed more scalps in the longest format than the 28-year-old's 128 - which have come at 19.9 apiece.

Cummins the number one Test bowler in the world will no doubt be licking his lips at the prospect of ripping into what has been a fragile England batting line-up.

Josh Hazlewood will also pose a huge threat and Mitchell Starc will be out to silence critics such as Shane Warne while Jhye Richardson and Michael Neser show Australia's strength in depth in the pace ranks.

Gabba no longer a fortress?

Australia had not lost a Test at the Gabba for 33 years until India's famous victory in January.

Joe Root fanned the flames last month by stating the hostile Brisbane venue is no longer such a ""stronghold"" for Australia.

It has most certainly not been a happy hunting ground for England who have only won four of 21 Tests at the stage for the curtain-raiser for the series. The tourists' last Test win at the Gabba came in November 1986.

England have not won a Test in Australia since January 2011 losing nine and drawing one of their previous 10 contests and they will be braced for a barrage of pace when they start their quest to regain the urn this week.

England must find an answer to Smith and Labuschagne

The England bowlers had seen more than enough of Smith by the end of the 2019 series.

He racked up 774 runs at an average of 110.57 from seven innings reaching three figures on three occasions and scoring a sublime 211 at Old Trafford.

The former skipper broke his own record for number of runs in a Test series in the 21st century. Only the great Don Bradman (19) and Jack Hobbs (12) have more Ashes centuries than Smith's 11.

Marnus Labuschagne was also outstanding in England two years ago averaging 50.42. He has been a revelation at number three and will have a big role to play.

Australia in safe hands with Carey?

Alex Carey will take the gloves and make his Test debut at the Gabba in the absence of Paine.

Drugstores are normally busy this time of year with flu shots and other vaccines but now pharmacists are doling out a growing number of COVID-19 shots and giving coronavirus tests.

The push for shots is expected to grow more intense as President Joe Biden urges vaccinated Americans to get booster shots to combat the emerging omicron variant. The White House said Thursday that more than two in three COVID-19 vaccinations are happening at local pharmacies.

And pharmacists worry another job might soon be added to their to-do list: If regulators approve antiviral pills from drugmakers Merck and Pfizer to treat COVID-19 pharmacists may be able to diagnose infections and then prescribe pills to customers.

“There’s crazy increased demand on pharmacies right now” said Theresa Tolle an independent pharmacist who has seen COVID-19 vaccine demand quadruple since the summer at her Sebastian Florida store.

Pharmacists say demand for COVID-19 vaccines started picking up over the summer as the delta variant spread rapidly. Booster shots and the expansion of vaccine eligibility to include children have since stoked it.

On top of that workload and routine prescriptions many drugstores also have been asking pharmacists to counsel patients more generally on their health or about chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.

Pharmacies also have been handling more phone calls from customers with questions about vaccines or COVID-19 tests noted Justin Wilson who owns three independent pharmacies in Oklahoma.

“We’re all working a lot harder than we did before but we’re doing everything we can to take care of people” Wilson said adding that he has not had to temporarily close any of his pharmacies or limit hours so far.

Tolle said she was lucky to hire a pharmacy resident just before the delta surge arrived. The new employee was supposed to focus mostly on diabetes programs but has largely been relegated to vaccine duty.

Tolle said her Bay Street Pharmacy is now giving about 80 COVID-19 vaccines a day up from 20 before the delta wave.

“God’s timing worked out well for me” she said. “We would not have gotten through without having that additional person here.”

Others haven’t been as fortunate. A CVS Health store on the northeast side of Indianapolis shuttered its pharmacy in the middle of the afternoon Thursday due to staffing issues. A sign taped to the metal gate over the closed pharmacy counter also told customers that the pharmacy will soon start closing for a half hour each afternoon so the pharmacist can have a lunch break.

Such temporary closures have ebbed and flowed in pockets around the country throughout the pandemic but they have grown more acute in recent months said Anne Burns a vice president with the American Pharmacists Association.

Pharmacies all need minimum staffing to operate safely and they sometimes have to close temporarily if they fall below those levels.

Burns said many pharmacies already had relatively thin staffing levels heading into the pandemic and a wave of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians left after the virus hit.

“There is a lot of stress and burnout for individuals who have been going at this since March of 2020” she said.

CVS Health spokesman T.J. Crawford said he couldn’t comment on the circumstances for one store. But he said his company continues “to manage through a workforce shortage that isn’t unique to CVS Health.”

Rival drugstore chain Walgreens also has adjusted pharmacy hours “in a limited number of stores” spokesman Fraser Engerman said.

Both companies are hiring. CVS Health says it has hired 23000 employees from a push it started in September. About half of that total was pharmacy technicians who can deliver vaccines.

As companies scramble to hire or keep staff Burns and Tolle worry about adding even more responsibilities like diagnosing and treating COVID-19.

Tolle noted that it is not clear yet how pharmacists will be reimbursed for the time they take to diagnose and prescribe. That will have to be clarified especially if cases surge again and drugstores need to add even more workers to help.

“We want to be able to help our communities” she said. “I don’t know how pharmacies are going to manage it.”

Sherri Brown a city employee in Omaha Nebraska was searching for a vaccine booster dose but two nearby pharmacies didn’t have appointments available and a third didn’t have the brand she wanted. She wound up getting a shot at a county-run clinic on Friday.

“I just wanted to protect myself” said Brown who suffered through two weeks of coughing headaches and fatigue when she caught the virus in January before she was vaccinated. “I guess I’m encouraged to see that people are taking this more seriously.”

A premature baby born 18 weeks early in Texas was discharged from the hospital just in time to come home to her family for the holidays.

Jimena ""JC"" Macias weighed 1 lb. 9 oz. and measured 11 inches long when she was born on April 29 per KHOU 11. At the time JC's mom Juana Gallegos began to feel sick and later went into labor when she was just 22 weeks pregnant.

Gallegos said doctors told her ""they weren't going to be able to resuscitate her or be able to do anything for her if she was born there at that time that early."" To give her daughter the best possible chance Gallegos went to Memorial Hermann The Woodlands Medical Center in Shenandoah Texas.

At Memorial Hermann which features a level III neonatal intensive care unit Gallegos gave birth to JC who was put on a ventilator and given nutrition through an IV.

Baby ""JC"" was born 18 weeks early. The micro preemie weighed 1 lb 9 oz. at birth. She spent 112 days in the NICU.



She went home from the hospital in time to spend Thanksgiving with family.

Following 112 days in the NICU JC was officially cleared to go home with her family KHOU 11 reports.

Gallegos who enjoyed Thanksgiving this year with JC at home told the news outlet that she was unsure if her daughter would be discharged in time for the holiday. ""On day one day two day 30 … I didn't think it would be possible to spend the holidays together"" she said. ""God had other plans.""

JC's father Eduardo Macias also told KHOU 11 that he and Gallegos are thankful for their newborn saying ""We see it in a different point of view as grateful because we wouldn't experience that if she wasn't here.""

While JC is no longer in the NICU she is still undergoing physical therapy though doctors say the baby is right on track for all of her milestones.

Premature babies are categorized as any baby born more than three weeks before their estimated due date according to the Mayo Clinic. Premature babies like JC can have ""complicated medical problems"" and often ""need a longer hospital stay in a special nursery unit at the hospital.""

Dr. Rebecca Ballard a neonatologist with the Memorial Hermann/Pediatrix Medical Group of Texas told KHOU 11 that JC is a ""miraculous"" case.

""While I wish this story would happen with every baby born this early it's not possible"" Ballard said. ""Not to think her story represents every baby but it makes it so much more miraculous that it happened.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8wNC9mbGFzaC1tb2Itcm9iYmVyaWVzLW9yZ2FuaXplZC1jcmltZS1ub3Jkc3Ryb20tYmVzdC1idXktcmV0YWlsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flash mob robberies are a multibillion dollar problem for retailer,"A spate of brazen sometimes violent robberies by organized rings descending on stores to steal everything from $5000 handbags to $10 razor-blade packs in lightning-quick attacks is the latest challenge for a beleaguered retail industry already grappling with high employee turnover supply chain headaches and skittish shoppers.

Last month dozens of ski-mask wearing thieves swarmed a Nordstrom in tony Walnut Creek Calif. They blocked road access with their cars before proceeding to smash display cases and take whatever they could off of the racks then escaped to awaiting getaway cars all in matter of minutes. It was hardly an isolated occurrence for the upscale retailer: smaller scale organized ‘flash mob’ robberies hit two Nordstrom stores in the Los Angeles area a few days later. These came soon after similar thefts last month at Louis Vuitton Burberry and Bloomingdale’s stores in San Francisco’s upscale Union Square. Lululemon Athletica and Ulta Beauty have also been targeted by these groups while Walgreens has closed five stores in San Francisco because of the problem.

The incidents continued over the holiday weekend: Best Buy found itself in the crosshairs of ‘flash mobs’ at three stores in suburban Minneapolis over the Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday weekend the busiest of the year for retailers. The problem has led retail industry leaders to sound the alarm noting the threat to attracting and retaining the workers they desperately need to staff stores adequately as well as the feeling of safety essential to keep shoppers coming.

But the problem is not likely to go anyway anytime soon. The robberies are a tactic of well-established organized crime syndicates looking to replenish inventory of ‘hot’ goods they can sell on resale sites during the holiday season shopping rush.

“The people you see running out of the stores with their merchandise are actually people who are recruited by the criminal organizations profiting from this” said Ben Dugan president of the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail a trade group focused on fighting crimes committed at retailers. “There are tiers to it from soldiers to captains to crew leaders — the whole deal.” Just like the mob he added. The groups he leads has estimated that organized retail crime is responsible for around $45 billion in annual losses 50% more than a decade ago.

The crime syndicates typically recruit locally paying participants about $300 to $500 each in the case of the Nordstrom attack Dugan estimates. They might even provide them with the getaway cars. And reflecting the gravity of these crimes the ‘retail mob’ robberies are typically treated as felony crimes since they are planned events and involve the resale of stolen goods moving across state lines. In contrast someone independently shoplifting a tube of toothpaste for personal use is committing a misdemeanor.

And like everything else these days product shortages are playing a role in exacerbating the spate of retail flash mobs Dugan said. “I don’t think there’s any mistake that that happened before Black Friday and before Cyber Monday” he said. “I mean the criminal organizations that control the online markets needed product. And there’s a supply chain crisis right?”

A new source of worker anxiety

The problem has caught the attention of political leaders particularly on the West Coast where the attacks have been more concentrated and more brazen. “They’re not just stealing people’s products and impacting their livelihoods they’re stealing a sense of place and confidence” California Governor Gavin Newsom said while announcing an increase in funding to law enforcement to fight organized retail crime.

That sense of place and confidence is key to retailers in protecting stores which are increasingly important to supporting their e-commerce as they compete with Amazon. Target for instance relied on its stores for 95% of sales last quarter when including their roles in filling online orders be it a customer coming in to pick the order up or the store mailing an item to the customers.

“These mobs attacking stores suggest to people ‘I’m not going there.’ And if they were predisposed to shop online only this is a hell of a motivation to do that” said Columbia Business School retail professor Mark Cohen.

Retailers aren’t sitting idly by for the problem to go away. Target declined to quantify the potential hit to its business from organized theft or detail how it combats the problem but a spokesman told Fortune that “our security teams in every store are trained to maintain a safe shopping environment and protect against theft” and is in regular contact with law enforcement “on an ongoing basis to address organized retail crime.”

At Nordstrom a spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement that “we’re heightening our in-store security presence and implementing additional protective measures to keep everyone safe.” Best Buy’s Barry said last week that the retailer might put more items under lock much as drugstore giants CVS pharmacy and Walgreens do with items like razor blades. Columbia Business School’s Cohen however cautions retailers against turning their stores into fortresses or adding too many new hassles to shoppers who could easily shop online.

For CEO’s like Barry one of the biggest worries in this crisis has to do with attracting and keeping top retail talent. The attacks on the Best Buy stores sometimes involved people entering the stores armed with crowbars and guns Barry told reporters last week. That has frightened many workers who already had to deal with mask-adverse customers and the fear of being exposed to coronavirus. It’s all making it even harder for retailers to find and keep good workers amidst the great resignation and labor shortage.

“When we talk about why there are so many people looking for other jobs or switching careers this of course would be something that would play into my concerns for our people” Barry told reporters.

Best Buy has been just one of many large retailers in the last year to raise minimum wages in the war for front-line talent. (Macy’s last month raised its own lowest wage and sweetened the pot by promising employees it would help with college tuition and student debt.

“This has got to bring fear to both customers and store associates who basically don’t want to be in a position where they’re at risk for 15 bucks an hour” said Cohen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vY29uYW5kYWlseS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8wNC9yYW1pbmEtYXNoZmFxdWUtYmlvZ3JhcGh5LTEzLXRoaW5ncy1hYm91dC1taXNzLWdyYW5kLXBha2lzdGFuLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ramina Ashfaque biography: 13 things about Miss Grand Pakistan 2021,"Advertisements

Restaurant chains are starting to grapple with the growing demand for to-go orders.

Workers have been saying things were untenable since early in the pandemic.

Americans are consuming much more food than before the pandemic data shows.

Restaurant chains have enjoyed huge boosts in delivery and to-go orders over the last year and a half but now they're facing a demand that they can't handle.

Off-premise orders were key to keeping these restaurants afloat in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic closed many dining rooms and online orders subsequently exploded. Mobile orders drove Starbucks' recovery and grew to an ""all-time high"" in 2021 making up over 25% of all orders and at Chipotle they now make up nearly half of all orders. Even restaurants that traditionally concentrated more on dine-in business have emphasized online orders and Cheesecake Factory doubled them in 2021 to $3 million in sales per restaurant.

Consumers are spending way more on delivery and restaurants in general than they have in the past. They've shown a growing preference for ordering digitally Kalinowski Equity Research founder Mark Kalinowski told Insider. At least 10% of US restaurants around 100000 businesses or more by most estimates closed since the onset of the pandemic so a smaller number of restaurants are responding to this growing demand as the restaurant industry has one of its best years in recent memory.

Part of the higher demand is that people are simply consuming more Kalinowski told Insider. Combined food service and grocery sales which are a close proxy for overall food purchases are up more than double digits over 2019 levels Kalinowski told Insider based on US census data. For example in October 2021 US consumers spent 14.3% more on restaurant and grocery purchases than in October 2019.

The desire for to-go and delivery orders continues to grow but now chains are realizing that they've created more demand than they can fulfill with current staffing and ingredient levels. IHOP and Applebees have begun to shut down delivery orders during the busy evening and weekend morning periods CEO John Peyton said.

Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse both owned by Darden Restaurants are throttling online orders because of ""excess demand"" CEO Gene Lee said in a recent earnings call. Cheesecake Factory managers now have the ability to temporarily close digital orders if needed.

While management is just starting to grapple with the tolls of excessive delivery demand workers have been well aware. Restaurants are chronically understaffed without enough workers to meet even average demand without the additional orders this year. Some business owners say they're unable to find staff and in some cases even cite a lack of desire to work while workers say they can demand better pay and benefits in the tight labor market. This mismatch has led to restaurants decreasing hours and closing dining rooms and a third of restaurant workers say they want to leave the industry.

These problems are coming to a head across the country. In mid-November a group of five employees at an Austin Chipotle quit their jobs led by their general manager. They reached their breaking point as digital orders kept coming in and the manager closed the dining room in an attempt to keep up with the online orders.

Across the industry workers told Insider that they agree these orders have gotten out of hand.

""Digital ordering was the worst thing that ever happened to fast food"" a Taco Bell worker of 20 years who recently quit told Insider. These online orders can be ""so ridiculously customized"" he said that they're highly difficult to make coming in much faster than they can be made.

Brits love to break out the chocolate tubs at Christmas - but research has found that some brands have a better mix of treats than others.

Few households will be without a tub of Celebrations Heroes Quality Street and Roses over the festive period.

But research by consumer experts Which? has found a very different mix of chocolates within these.

In short Celebrations are good for nut lovers Heroes for eclairs and Fudges Heroes for Double Deckers and Creme Eggs Quality Street for Fudges and Roses for plain chocolate and cremes.

Which? said Celebrations had the most nut chocolates with an average of 12 Snickers per tub. There were also 12 MilkyWays but only half as many Galaxy Caramel and Galaxy bars.

When it came to Mars bars there were 11 on average per box eight Maltesers Teasers and eight Bountys - but only seven Twix bars.

What is your favourite chocolate tub? Let us know in the comments below

Image: Which?) Which?)

Of all the chocolate boxes Which? included in its research Celebrations has the least variety containing only eight different types of chocolate.

With Cadbury’s Heroes Which? found that the tub contained more Eclairs and Fudges than any other chocolate - averaging at nine each.

That was significantly more than Twirls or Wispas which averaged just five each per tub.

Image: Which?) Which?)

A tub of Heroes also contained an average of eight Double Deckers and Creme Eggs and seven Crunchies Dairy Milk and Dairy Milk Caramels.

Quality Street also had a wide range among its selection with nine Pink Fudges on average compared to only four Green Triangles and four Orange Crunches.

However there were plenty of caramels toffees and fruit cremes. Quality Street also has the most variety in its tub overall with 11 different types of chocolate.

Image: Which?) Which?)

Meanwhile Cadbury Roses were found by Which? researchers to be a good option for those who prefer plain chocolate with an offering of nine Dairy Milks per tub.

Fudge and truffles on the other hand averaged only four each per tub.

Roses were a good option for caramel and fruit creme lovers though as they came second after Dairy Milk with an average of eight in a tub.

Image: Which?) Which?)

These chocolate tubs come in a range of sizes however Which? experts recommend going for a 600g or 650g tub which tend to offer better value for money.

Which? home products and services editor Lisa Barber said: ""A box of chocolates on the sofa and a Christmas movie is a seasonal tradition for many across the UK but you might find yourself fighting over your favourites if there just aren’t enough of them to go around.

“Whether you’re a fudge fan a caramel connoisseur or just nuts about chocolate Which? has found there is a selection box for everyone so make sure you get the one best suited to the tastes of your household this Christmas.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
DE,John Deere,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZ2ZtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3N0cm9uZy1kb2xsYXItaGl0cy1jb3Jwb3JhdGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pressure Rises With The Dollar,"The rising value of the US dollar is affecting companies and economies globally—for better and worse.





What does Coca-Cola have in common with FCA Poland a car manufacturer in the southern Polish city of Bielsko-Biala? They are just two of the companies that depend on international trade for a sizable percentage of their revenue and are now being sideswiped by the steady rise in the US dollar.

John Murphy Coke’s chief financial officer told analysts on the company’s third-quarter earnings call in late October that he expected a “two- to three-point currency headwind to revenue and a two- to three-point headwind to earnings for the full-year 2022.”

Other US multinationals such as tractor maker John Deere also reported taking a hit because of currency. The US dollar index which measures the US currency against a basket of six other currencies has increased 4.57% since January.

In fact the US Census Bureau which tracks imports and exports of goods said the trade deficit widened to $98 billion in September. That compares with a deficit of $67 billion in January 2020 before the Covid-19 pandemic began. While exports remained static the strong dollar made imports more attractive growing from $203 billion in January 2020 to $240 billion in September although some of the increase could be attributed to the rebound in the economy as consumers opened their wallets and returned to shopping malls.

Calculating the dollar’s impact on developing countries is a bit more complicated than trade figures or simple currency conversions would suggest. According to Jane Foley head of foreign currency strategy in London for Dutch bank Rabobank the threat of inflation is far greater in developing countries than in the major industrial nations of the G10. That’s largely because energy prices soared recently with benchmark Brent crude oil which traded at $49 a barrel in December 2020 now close to $84.

“When you look at emerging markets there are a lot of headwinds” Foley says. “There are higher energy prices fear over the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates and a lot of dollar- and euro-denominated debt.”

At its most recent meeting on Nov. 3 the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee announced that the central bank would begin reducing its purchase of US government debt by $15 billion a month. Traders in the fixed-income market expected the Fed to beginning raising interest rates from near zero levels next June.

The fear is that the Fed taper in purchasing bonds will be a rerun of the “taper tantrum” in 2013 when the Fed began selling debt it bought during the 2008 financial crisis causing emerging market assets to tumble as investors headed for the higher interest rates in the US and other developed countries. The J.P. Morgan index of emerging market debt in local currencies is already down 6.1% this year.

One area where dollar-denominated energy prices have had a major impact is Eastern Europe. In Poland which is in the European Union but maintains its own currency inflation reached an annual rate of 6.8% in October.





In response the National Bank of Poland raised interest rates for the second time in two months to 1.25% saying it was reacting to higher commodity prices—which are priced in dollars—and shortages due to supply-chain issues (see cover story on supply chains). Despite the increase in interest rates the Polish zloty has fallen 6% this year against the dollar meaning that energy and other commodities became more expensive for companies that export products.

Tomas Dvorak an economist who studies Eastern Europe for the consultancy Oxford Economics says the inflation problem was a major concern across the region including for Hungary and the Czech Republic. Prague joined Warsaw in hiking interest rates in October to keep a lid on inflation. The question for companies in these countries is how they can survive high inflation with the cost of borrowing money rising.

“It depends on whether the central banks will stick to their guns and keep hiking the rate or if they will be forced by circumstance to slow down or reverse course” Dvorak says. For the moment the higher interest rate has benefited manufacturing firms by supporting the Polish zloty and Czech koruna because they must import intermediate goods priced in dollars before finishing them and exporting them to other countries.

“A stronger currency is good for manufacturing firms” Dvorak says.

Another country being hit by the strong dollar is Turkey which must rely on imported oil and other commodities to keep its industry functioning. But unlike the Eastern European countries the Turkish central bank—under apparent pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to make economic growth a priority—cut interest rates from 18% to 16% in October sending the Turkish lira crashing to 9.45 to the dollar its lowest level ever.

Fadi Hakura a consulting fellow and Turkey expert at Chatham House a British think tank says the government was trying to spur a consumption boom to boost the growth rate. As a result the country’s foreign-denominated debt ballooned to a record $328 billion. “Foreign investment has been on a clear downward path for the past five years” Hakura says. With up to 80% of industry depending on inputs from abroad for their factories the declining lira has made production more expensive and undermined the advantage the cheaper currency would normally provide to boost exports.

Turkey wasn’t the only one getting hit by the strong dollar. The South Korean won recorded an 18-month low that prompted the central bank governor to warn that he is considering taking the rare step of intervening in the foreign exchange market to support the won. The central bank raised its policy rate in August but the won kept depreciating against the dollar. Other emerging markets such as Iran and South Africa were also negatively impacted by the strengthening US currency.

Countries that export oil however earn dollar income. Russia Saudi Arabia and others have thus benefited from dollar appreciation.

A study in December 2020 by the Bank for International Settlements the world’s central bank looked at the effect of dollar strength on emerging market economic growth. “Our results suggest that broad dollar appreciation dampens real GDP growth on average” the study said. It added that the dollar affects emerging markets more strongly than small advanced economies especially countries with high dollar debt and a large foreign investor presence.

Alexei Oreskovic/Insider

Companies that spend millions of dollars on air travel are given incredible perks from airlines.

One such perk is top-tier frequent flyer status that comes with free upgrades lounge access and chauffeurs.

Amazon and Microsoft even have dedicated check-in counters at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

Loyalty has its perks especially when loyalty means spending hundreds of millions of dollars on airline tickets every year.

Business travel is a leading revenue source for airlines and the top corporate spenders are frequently given extra benefits in exchange for their continued business. Some of the perks go way beyond what even the most frequent individual traveler could ever hope to receive.

Tech companies are among the top spenders on airline travel given as Big Tech giants have offices and facilities around the world. China for example is a top destination for Silicon Valley-based firms like Apple.

United Airlines in 2018 revealed that Apple was buying 50 business class seats every day on flights to Shanghai China. Apple's business with United at the time was worth more than $150 million in revenue.

Airlines however lost a big chunk of that revenue during the pandemic as international borders started to close in January 2020. Cost-minded leisure travelers tend not to spend as much as business flyers and are less likely to pay for premium cabin travel or costly last-minute fares when vacationing.

When big business does return to the skies these are the perks that will likely await them.

Expedited access to elite status

Employees that travel enough will often earn elite status with an airline that gives them extra privileges when flying.

""The basic idea is you get to bypass a lot of the hassles"" Brett Snyder founder of the aviation blog CrankyFlyer told Insider.

Acquiring elite status requires loyalty to a particular airline to the tune of a few thousand dollars in purchased tickets and tens of thousands of miles flown. But airlines can also offer elite status memberships to corporate travelers as a ""sweetener"" in a contract even before the first flight Snyder said.

Most of the perks will come from having that elite status but airlines can still go above and beyond for top corporate clients.

Dedicated check-in lanes

For some companies spending millions of dollars on travel means never having to wait in line at certain airports. At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for example Delta Air Lines has dedicated check-in desks for Amazon and Microsoft employees.

While check-in counters are becoming obsolete given improvements to self-serve kiosks and airline mobile applications employees can use them to quickly check their bags or have airline staff assist with any flight issues.







The scheme isn't replicated at every Delta airport for Microsoft and Amazon employees but they will still likely have access to priority check-in areas. Business travelers often earn elite status on the airlines they frequent and can often use priority check-in lanes as a result especially when traveling in a premium cabin as Insider found when testing out the lowest tier of Delta's elite status.

Some US airlines have private check-in areas altogether for elite status holders and premium cabin travelers away from the main check-in desks such as Delta's Sky Priority check-in area at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Access to invite-only programs

While elite status is a common perk of frequent business travel the highest echelons of those programs are reserved for an airline's top spenders. Attaining membership in the unlisted programs is the dream of any frequent traveler and top corporate clients may be given an allotment of memberships for their top travelers.

American Airlines has ConciergeKey United Airlines has Global Services and Delta Air Lines has 360°.

""These are highly coveted programs there's a mystery to them"" Henry Harteveldt a travel analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group told Insider.

Even if a member of these programs purchases the cheapest economy ticket on a given flight they will still reap the benefits of complimentary lounge access priority check-in lanes early boarding and a host of other secretive amenities that airlines won't discuss publicly.

Airlines have different requirements for who is invited into their programs and limits on the number of memberships they can distribute each year according to Harteveldt. Companies seeking to get memberships for their flyers would have to spend a significant amount on yearly air travel with spend requirements varying from city to city.

""Delta 360° is an annual invitation-only program for our top SkyMiles Members offering an exclusive suite of benefits and services even beyond Diamond Medallion Status"" Delta writes on its website. ""An invitation into Delta 360° is based on your overall investment with Delta. If you're selected to join we'll contact you directly.""

A certain number of memberships are then given to corporate travel managers to distribute to employees Harteveldt explained with airlines being incredibly mindful of how many are allocated.

Lounge access

Airline lounges are exclusive hideaways that offer private and comfortable seating when waiting for a flight as well as complimentary snacks beverages and food items. Corporate customers flying internationally in business class will often have access to these lounges included in their tickets.

Airlines will also give complimentary lounge memberships to their most frequent flyers. On American for example executive platinum status holders can choose to receive an Admirals Club membership as one of their free perks.

ConciergeKey Global Services and Delta 360° members also receive complimentary lounge access for their respective airlines according to Harteveldt Upgraded Points and SFGate.

Members of the ConciergeKey Global Services and Delta 360° programs need not worry about running from one flight to another when passing through an airline hub with a tight connection. Rather they'll be escorted down to the ramp and driven to their next flight in a luxury vehicle.

American will chauffeur passengers in a luxury General Motors vehicle while United transfers its passengers in a Mercedes-Benz and Delta in a Porsche according to Upgraded Points. [not sure this blog is reputable enough to cite on its own] Cadillac was formerly American's vehicle manufacturer of choice for airside transfers until the switch was made to GM the airline confirmed to View from the Wing. [caddy is owned by GM — so need different wording here]

It's a ""surprise and delight"" perk Snyder said that isn't guaranteed for everyone with a short layover. Airlines may also be more accommodating to passengers on delayed flights by holding their connections Harteveldt said depending on the customer and corporate client.

Priority Boarding

Elite status holders are often among the first passengers to board a flight whether they're seated in a premium cabin or not. ConciergeKey members for example can board ahead of first class customers and active duty military members even if they've booked a basic economy ticket according to American's boarding priority list.

Early boarding gives flyers first pick at overhead bin space and more time to get settled before the rest of the plane boards.

Better opportunities for first class upgrades

Complimentary upgrades to first class are among the most valuable perks for an elite status holder. A single upgrade can be worth more than the price of a ticket and instantly elevate a travel experience especially on longer flights.

In many frequent flyer programs any elite status holder can request an upgrade and they'll accommodate if there is a seat available. But oftentimes there ends up being people that don't make the cut because there aren't enough seats available for all elite status holders.

Corporate travelers however have a better shot at upgrades because airlines consider a variety of factors when determining who to upgrade. The level of elite status and how much a traveler's company spends with the airline in a given year are also taken into consideration.

""Generally if you have all things being equal the person who works for a large corporate account that may have a major business relationship with an airline would likely get the nod for the upgrade ahead of the person who is an individual traveler"" Harteveldt said.

An airline also might give a certain number of upgrade coupons to a corporate client that can be used to get a premium cabin seat Harteveldt added.

Drink coupons and free snacks

Not all of what corporate clients get are grand gestures however and sometimes a free drink can make the difference. Coupons for a complimentary alcoholic beverage are sometimes included in a corporate contract according to Harteveldt and offered on certain fares geared towards business travelers.

Airlines like Delta and American also offer complimentary alcoholic beverages in their extra legroom sections which companies may be willing to purchase for their employees. Southwest Airlines' ""Business Select"" fare also comes with a free drink coupon.

Some US airlines aren't currently offering alcohol in regular economy sections until the pandemic subsides but the perk will likely return.

Some airlines also might offer complimentary meals or snacks to corporate flyers even if they're sitting in economy on domestic flights. American offers Executive Platinum status holders a complimentary snack and an alcoholic drink in economy Snyder said.

Dedicated reservation lines

Airline hold times have markedly increased as airlines sought to shed their staff during the pandemic. Travelers can find themselves waiting on hold for hours.

Elite status holders however have special phone numbers to use when calling the reservations desk with shorter hold times and corporate travelers with elite status can also use them. Some companies were so important to airlines however that special phone lines were created just for their employees.

""In the past some airlines would create basically special toll-free numbers for their largest corporate accounts where the employees would call in and get a dedicated sub-group of agents within a reservations office so that they were served faster"" Harteveldt said.

Harteveldt noted that the perk likely doesn't exist anymore and those phone lines have been merged into the dedicated lines for top frequent flyers. ""If you put somebody into the higher tiers of a frequent flyer program they're going to get expedited service anyway"" he said.

Travel agents however including those with corporate accounts still have lines to many airline reservation desks Snyder said. ""It's for the travel planners the people that are doing the work"" he said.

Free or discounted extra legroom seats

Not all companies pay to fly their employees in a premium cabin on every flight but airlines can help make the economy experience more enjoyable by offering favorable rates on extra legroom seats according to Harteveldt. Delta's ""Comfort+"" seats for example offer extra legroom as well as complimentary alcohol and premium snacks.

Some airlines also offer complimentary upgrades into extra legroom sections for their elite status holders.

Airlines also block certain regular economy seats that don't offer extra legroom but have a more preferable location in the cabin. Snyder says that corporate clients may be given advance access to those seats ahead of the public.

Waived checked bag fees

A basic perk of earning elite status is getting a complimentary checked baggage allowance which can save travelers and their companies money when a trip requires checked baggage. Companies may also be able to negotiate lower fees for checked baggage Harteveldt said.

More flexibility for corporate travelers

Many US airlines have abandoned change fees for domestic flights but tickets can still be restrictive. The nature of corporate travel however requires additional leeway that airlines are willing to give to high-spending clients.

""You get much more flexibility as a corporate [client]"" Snyder said noting that some airlines have a system for clients where points can be redeemed for perks. Common perks include things like name changes on tickets flight changes and converting non-refundable tickets into refundable tickets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2xveWFsdHlsb2JieS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8wNS9tZW93LXdvbWFuLWJyZWFzdGZlZWRzLWhlci1jYXQtb24tZGVsdGEtYWlyLWxpbmVzLWZsaWdodC1waWxvdHMtbWVzc2FnZS1ncm91bmQtc3RhZmYtZm9yLWFzc2lzdGFuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meow: Woman Breastfeeds Her CAT On Delta Air Lines Flight Pilots Message Ground Staff For “Assistance”,"Whenever you think there’s nothing that can surprise you anymore then there’s another aviation story coming this time about a woman who decided it’s a great idea to breastfeed a cat (!!) during a Delta Air Lines Flight.

The flight from Syracuse NY to Atlanta GA took an unexpected turn when the passenger allowed her cat out of the carrier and then started to let the animal feed on her breasts while being seated.

Passengers reported the matter to the cabin crew and in response flight attendants demanded the passenger cease her bizarre activity which she refused to do.

ADVERTISEMENT

As Newsweek reported the matter was relayed to the pilots who then messaged the ground staff in Atlanta that someone should meet the flight to handle the matter.

A woman on a recent Delta Airlines flight allegedly began to breastfeed her pet cat mid-flight and refused to stop after getting caught. The incident allegedly happened during a recent trip onboard Delta Flight 1360 a route that travels between Syracuse New York and Atlanta Georgia. An image posted to social media suggests that the purported cat breastfeeding happened while the plane was headed towards Atlanta although it is not clear exactly when the incident happened. The image circulating online describes the supposed event in what appears to be a screen capture of message sent using the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) which pilots use to transmit short text-based messages to the ground. The message reports that a passenger is seat 13A “is breastfeeding a cat and will not put cat back in carrier” in response to a request from a flight attendant. The message asks that the situation be addressed by the airline’s “Red Coat” team upon landing. Delta describes members of the team as “elite airport customer service experts” who are “specially trained to handle on-the-stop customer issues.” A TikTok account from flight attendant Ainsley Elizabeth appears to refer to the incident with a video posted on November 2 claiming that “security met the flight because a woman was breastfeeding her cat.” “This woman had one of those like hairless cats swaddled up in a blanket so it looked like a baby” Ainsley Elizabeth said in a follow-up video posted on November 13. “Her shirt was up and she was trying to get the cat to latch and she wouldn’t put the cat back in the carrier. And the cat was screaming for its life.”

Delta has not commented publicly on this incident and nothing else except these reports is known although they paint a pretty clear picture.

Have people gone totally bonkers now? Like… WHY!?

Why would the animal even be interested in being breastfed like an infant? Cats also have pretty sharp teeth and claws so this entire situation is simply insane. The account of the crew as quoted in the article also stated that the poor cat was pretty unhappy with all this. It’s also generally prohibited to take onboard pets out of their carrier and the passenger refused multiple times to put the cat back.

I wonder if this person is going to face the same stiff fines the government has recently implemented for people who don’t follow the instructions of the crew and create a scene on board. Or is that only for folks who refuse to wear a mask!?

This seems to be a case that’s pretty clear-cut and well documented. Let’s see if we ever hear anything about this person being fined or banned from Delta.

Conclusion

Assuming this story checks out I guess it’s another one for the ban list if the carrier applies their standards about interference with the cabin crew in an equal manner. Penalties should also be applied.

Something is obviously wrong with this lady and I feel sorry for the pet because this kind of behavior just cries abuse. Some people shouldn’t be allowed to keep animals. Since January of this year Delta doesn’t accept any more emotional support animals except for trained and certified service dogs so this must have been a regular pet in cabin booking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiwwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuaW4vdGhlbGlmZS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWZsaWdodHMtZnJvbS1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtaGF2ZS1iZWVuLWZvcmNlZC10by1tYWtlLXN0b3BzLWluLXBsYWNlcy1saWtlLWJvc3Rvbi1hbmQtcHVlcnRvLXJpY28tYmVjYXVzZS1vZi1wYXlsb2FkLWlzc3Vlcy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84ODA4MjEwOS5jbXPSAccBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmluL3RoZWxpZmUvbmV3cy9kZWx0YS1mbGlnaHRzLWZyb20tc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLWhhdmUtYmVlbi1mb3JjZWQtdG8tbWFrZS1zdG9wcy1pbi1wbGFjZXMtbGlrZS1ib3N0b24tYW5kLXB1ZXJ0by1yaWNvLWJlY2F1c2Utb2YtcGF5bG9hZC1pc3N1ZXMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg4MDgyMTA5LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta flights from South Africa have been forced to make stops in places like Boston and Puerto Rico because o,"Two Delta Air Lines flights from South Africa have had to make fuel stops in the past week.

flights from have had to make fuel stops in the past week. A mix of worsening weather conditions for aircraft and increased passenger and/or cargo count might be to blame experts say.

Two Delta Air Lines flights from South Africa to the US have had to make unscheduled stops for fuel in recent days on their way back to the US. The first diversion occurred on November 28 when Delta flight 201 from Johannesburg South Africa to Atlanta made a technical stop in Boston to be refueled.

Another flight from Johannesburg to Atlanta that departed December 2 diverted to San Juan Puerto Rico where it also refueled before continuing on. Delta said both stops were ""pre-planned"" and new flight crews were required to fly the final legs to Atlanta.

""The redirection of the flight had to do with the technical specifications of our A350 aircraft and the payload of this particular flight"" Delta told Insider of the Boston diversion in a statement. ""This can happen on ultra-long-haul flights when optimal operating conditions can't be met.""

Numerous factors can play a role in a diversion including weather and payload especially on an ultra-long-haul flight such as Johannesburg to Atlanta. Delta hasn't seen a diversion on the route since September 6 the earliest date available for viewing using FlightAware tracking data and the route only relaunched on August 1.

One possibility could be a newfound demand for flights out of South Africa leading to fuller flights. The discovery of the Omicron coronavirus variant and the start of travel restrictions imposed by the US government has prompted some travelers to leave South Africa for the US.

""You have some unusual market conditions posed by the emergency of the Omicron variant and changes to travel policies in the US"" Henry Harteveldt travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group told Insider.

Delta declined to comment on how full its flights were on both occasions. But fuller flights is just one possibility out of many that could affect an ultra-long-haul route such as Atlanta-Johannesburg.

The route may be seeing increased cargo demand Harteveldt said and weather might also be playing a role as the weather gets warmer in South Africa and colder in the US.

Johannesburg is a ""hot and heavy"" city for airlines meaning that aircraft are operating in high temperatures at a high elevation airport both of which affect an aircraft's performance capabilities. November and December are in the middle of the spring season in South Africa when temperatures rise and aircraft performance suffers.

And in Northern Hemisphere November and December is the start of the cold season and when winds become stronger. An ultra-long-haul flight such as Johannesburg to Atlanta is at the top end of the Airbus A350-900 XWB's performance capabilities already and any adverse condition could affect its range.

Delta's flight 201 on November 29 was able to make the 7300-nautical-mile journey non-stop in 17 hours and 16 minutes FlightAware data shows. Delta formerly flew the Boeing 777-200 on the Atlanta-Johannesburg route the longest route in Delta's network until the aircraft was retired in October 2020. As the only aircraft in Delta's fleet capable of flying the route the A350 was used to relaunch the route in August and Delta is still adjusting to using the aircraft on ultra-long-haul routes.

""There might be a little bit of a learning curve here for Delta if they've not used this aircraft on this route before"" Bruce McClellan an aviation analyst at Teal Group told Insider. ""I just think probably they had some bad luck and they had pretty bad weather that came at them that caused the plane to divert and refuel.""

Both experts agree that making fuel stops on scheduled non-stop flights can have reputational issues for Delta if they continue. United is currently Delta's main competition as the only other airline flying non-stop between South Africa and the US.

One solution might be to restrict how many passengers and how much freight is carried on the plane even more than it is now. Delta will then need to assess how much it can restrict before the flight becomes unprofitable.

If the A350 can't reliably perform the route without making stops and without significantly restricting its payload Harteveldt said then ""the airline has a fiduciary responsibility to reassess whether that route should be operated.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9kZWFscy9kZWFsLWFsZXJ0LWZseS10by1kZW52ZXItZm9yLWFzLWxpdHRsZS1hcy02ay1kZWx0YS1za3ltaWxlcy1ldmVuLWR1cmluZy1za2ktc2Vhc29uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deal alert: Fly to Denver for as little as 6k Delta SkyMiles even during ski season,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

A flight crew member who witnessed the disturbing incident relayed a message via the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) on the jet. While mid-air the attendant notified the staff on the ground that the passenger seating in ""13A is breastfeeding a cat and will not put cat back in its carrier when [flight attendant] requested.""

The crew member also requested Delta's ""Red Coat"" team to approach the woman as soon as the flight landed at its final destination in Atlanta. According to Delta's website Red Coats are ""the elite airport customer services experts identifiable by their bright red coats. They are specially trained to handle on-the-stop customer issues.""

Flight attendant Ainsley Elizabeth shared on social media her experience handling the situation. ""This woman had one of those like hairless cats swaddled up in a blanket so it looked like a baby"" she explained. ""Her shirt was up and she was trying to get the cat to latch and she wouldn't put the cat back in the carrier. And the cat was screaming for its life."" Another video shows security got involved in the confrontation. However Elizabeth said she had no knowledge of what happened to the woman and her cat once the flight touched the ground.

The woman did not break the rules by taking her cat on the plane but she failed to comply with the code after refusing to put her cat back into its cage. According to their site the airlines permit animals such as small dogs cats and household birds to board domestic flights and ""must be able to fit in a small ventilated pet carrier."" As for the airlines' policy of women breastfeeding children the website stated ""Delta fully supports a woman's right to breastfeed onboard Delta and Delta Connection aircraft and in Delta facilities. Breast pumps are allowed on board. At the airport and if you prefer many airports do offer private lactation rooms or spaces.""

The metaverse is already garnering more interest from investors and that only increased tenfold when Facebook decided to change its name to “Meta.” The social media giant is looking at creating online communities that are a part of an even bigger virtual universe.

“3D spaces in the metaverse will let you socialize learn collaborate and play in ways that go beyond what we can imagine” notes the Meta website.

How does the crypto space feed into all of this? Since the metaverse incorporates blockchain technology crypto development talent can help build out metaverse projects.

Solana in particular is using its own blockchain ecosystem to maybe one day supplant Ethereum by discerning itself as being more cost-efficient and faster when it comes to processing transactions. Ethereum already hosts metaverses — Sandbox and Decentraland — where cryptocurrencies are used.

“Every virtual economy needs money. Cryptocurrencies work like virtual cash in virtual worlds” a Motley Fool article explains.

Yakovenko sees an alternative where there won’t be separate metaverses operating exclusively but interchangeably so different metaverses can be linked. It would be similar to blockchain ecosystems interacting with one another to form a larger cohesive unit.

“Once that happens it’s not going to be like a single metaverse Sandbox it is going to be a bunch of small ones that all kind of work together and a bunch of experiences” Yakovenko said.

Right Time for Metaverse ETF

In these virtual worlds investors are already snatching up digital real estate. Just recently metaverse projects sold for over $100 million — given this massive investment potential it only makes sense that the exchange traded fund (ETF) industry gets in on the action and it has.

ETF investors can look to opportunities like the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (META). The fund tracks the Ball Metaverse Index which is the first index globally designed to track the performance of the metaverse via globally-listed companies operating in the space.

According to a Business Insider article demand for the ETF surged since its inception growing from a grubstake of a few million dollars on June 30 to over $820 million. That’s an increase of close to 600% in under six months.

AFP

The idea of spending millions on non-existent land may sound ludicrous – but feverish predictions of a virtual reality future are pushing investors to bet big on digital real estate.

Last week New York-based company Republic Realm announced it had spent a record-breaking $4.3 million on digital land through The Sandbox one of several “virtual world” websites where people can socialise play games and even attend concerts.

That came hot on the heels of a $2.4-million land purchase in late November on a rival platform Decentraland by Canadian crypto company Tokens.com. And days before that Barbados announced plans to open a “metaverse embassy” in Decentraland.

Such websites bill themselves as a prototype of the metaverse a future internet where online experiences like chatting to a friend would eventually feel face-to-face thanks to virtual reality (VR) headsets.

“Metaverse” has been a Silicon Valley buzzword for months but interest soared in October after Facebook’s parent company renamed itself “Meta” as it shifts its focus towards VR.

The Facebook rebrand “introduced the term ‘metaverse’ to millions of people a lot faster than I would have ever imagined” said Cathy Hackl a tech consultant who advises companies on entering the metaverse.

According to crypto data site Dapp land worth more than $100 million has sold in the past week across the four largest metaverse sites The Sandbox Decentraland CryptoVoxels and Somnium Space.

For Hackl it’s unsurprising that the market is booming spawning an entire ecosystem around virtual real estate from rents to land developers.

“We’re trying to translate the way we understand physical goods into the virtual world” she said.

And while it may be some time before these sites operate as true metaverses transporting us elsewhere with VR goggles digital land is already functioning as an asset just like real land said Hackl.

“They can build on it they can rent it out they can sell it” she said.

Fifth Avenue of the metaverse

Tokens.com has bought a prime patch in Decentraland’s Fashion Street district which the platform hopes to develop as a home for luxury brands’ virtual stores.

“If I hadn’t done the research and understood that this is valuable property it would seem absolutely crazy” admitted Tokens.com CEO Andrew Kiguel.

Kiguel spent 20 years as an investment banker focused on real estate. He insists the Decentraland plot makes exactly the same kind of business sense as it would in the real world: it’s in a trendy area with high footfall.

“That is advertising and event space where people are going to congregate” he explained pointing to a recent virtual musical festival in Decentraland which attracted 50000 visitors.

Luxury brands are already venturing into the metaverse – a Gucci handbag sold on the Roblox platform in May for more than the real version – and Kiguel hopes Fashion Street will become a shopping destination akin to New York’s Fifth Avenue.

As for how the land could be used to make money “it can be as simple as having a billboard or it can be as complex as having a storefront with an actual employee” he said.

“You could walk in with your avatar and have 3D digital representations of a shoe that you can hold and ask questions.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkZ3VsbHkuY29tL2NvbnRyYWN0LWFkdmVydGlzaW5nLS1zLW5ldy1maWxtLWZvci1sLXQtcmVhbHR5LTExMTY3Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Contract Advertisingâ€™s new film for L&T Realty,"Buying a house is a once in a lifetime decision and you need to put your hard-earned money on someone who you can trust because of years of expertise in construction. This is the foundation on which the narrative for L&T Realty has been built.

The film conceptualized by Contract Advertising a part of the Wunderman Thompson Group and member of the WPP network shows how a closeted writer who has not had a chance to show the world his writing skills ends up as a neighbour with a Film Director who trusts him enough to surprise him with a big break. The analogy is with L&T Realty who understands the needs of the home buyer and the trust they put in the brand which encourages L&T Realty to deliver much more than just a home

Ayan Chakraborty EVP & General Manager Contract Mumbai said “When we spoke to customers of L&T Realty we found that there is almost a kind of blind faith that they equated with the brand. They felt they could trust the brand with their eyes closed. Because L&T always pleasantly surprised them with the product and the service at every step of the way. This is what sparked off the thought for this narrative”

Rahul Ghosh SVP & ECD Contract Mumbai said “The genome of trust doesn’t come from promises made on legal paper. Trust is built brick by brick. By people behaviour and interactions. And L&T Realty’s legacy of trust is brought alive in a tale of what it means in people’s lives. In a category dominated by fuzzy make-believe worlds we went back to good old storytelling that told a tale of trust that is far beyond the world of square feet”

Abu Dhabi Global Market guides the virtual asset industry with the world’s first fully comprehensive regulatory framework ushering in a period of dramatic economic growth and unlocking endless opportunities for innovation.

Traditional finance and the virtual asset economy have become increasingly intertwined this year. From the development of crypto-first ecommerce to the proliferation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) it was a year of unrestrained tech adoption innovation integration and – in some circumstances -even resistance.

By some definitions a virtual asset may well take the form of any digitised token of value that could be traded transferred or used for payment. A potential advantage of developing a virtual asset economy may be its ability to transfer value swiftly securely and efficiently and ultimately democratise access to innovative financial services for businesses and people.

Embracing a virtual asset economy that runs in tandem with and spurs the development of traditional financial markets holds new possibilities enabled by the tokenisation of traditional financial instruments commodities and physical assets in the MENA region. Whether through virtual assets or businesses adopting new distributed operating models running on distributed ledger technologies blockchain is transforming the global financial and capital markets.

The promise of virtual assets is that they provide an accessible fast and cost-effective alternative to traditional means of physical and electronic value transfer - making access to financial products more feasible for those who may have historically missed opportunities to benefit from products and services offered by traditional financial services firms.

Virtual asset transactions on public blockchains are pseudonymous and in some cases completely anonymous due to the nature of the blockchains that support the virtual assets. As the popularity of virtual assets continues to surge the additional scrutiny by regulators around the world has increasingly been focussed on the risks related to crime money laundering and terrorist financing activities being conducted using the virtual assets.

One thing to note is that blockchain technology is not entirely new it has been around for over 10 years now. Since their creation virtual assets like bitcoin have become hugely popular as trading and investment instruments. Nonetheless without a robust regulatory framework and ongoing oversight the virtual asset industry will remain an outlier in its significance compared to the overall finance industry.

Jurisdictions must adopt a balanced and technology neutral approach to ensure a healthy and orderly virtual asset industry continues to develop to ensure it delivers on its promises.

Innovation in the virtual assets industry is inevitable and regulators like Abu Dhabi Global Market’s (ADGM) Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) anticipated that wave by setting in place the world’s first comprehensive regulatory framework in 2018 which acts as a springboard for what is set to be the next evolution in finance.

Abu Dhabi Global Market leads the way

Before the publication of ADGM FSRA’s regulatory framework virtual assets and virtual asset exchanges/custodians and other intermediaries were subject to limited to no regulatory oversight. The ‘honour system’ was applied until that point with the players within the virtual asset industry complying if they wanted to with industry standards. This did not provide the security and stability to lay the foundations for the long-term growth and development of the virtual asset industry for investors providers and end-users.

Therefore ADGM being a forward-looking and dynamic jurisdiction created the world’s first regulatory framework that met the expectations of virtual asset industry players consumers and traditional financial institutions providing the protection for key stakeholders involved in the virtual asset ecosystem.

ADGM has become the destination of choice for many start-ups investors and businesses looking to set foot in the virtual asset market. Since the framework officially came into practice in 2018 ADGM has issued a number of Financial Services Permissions (FSPs) to virtual asset multilateral trading facilities (MTFs)custodians and other intermediaries.

“We believe our robust approach to the regulation of digital and virtual assets is a key pillar of ADGM’s strategy to foster sustainable and responsible innovation in the financial sector. Businesses and consumers holding and investing in digital assets can be assured that our licensed firms are required to comply with the highest standards” commented Emmanuel Givanakis CEO of the ADGM Financial Services Regulatory Authority

The ADGM FSRA continuously engages with virtual asset players to keep pace with product innovation market and technical developments so that licensed firms continue to meet desired regulatory standards.

The FSRA set clear guidelines to determine which digital assets are allowed to operate under ADGM’s umbrella and exactly what is a Virtual Asset: elements in dotted blue square are allowed to operate (Source: Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Virtual Assets Activities Guidance)

Being the first jurisdiction globally to develop and implement a comprehensive virtual asset regulatory framework means that the team at ADGM FSRA has deep insights and practical experience and expertise in handling the unique and complex regulatory landscape that comes with virtual-asset activities. With that in mind the FSRA engages globally both bilaterally and multilaterally to support the efforts of regulatory and industry forums (across IOSCO FATF and Global Digital Finance for example) to share insights and to establish partnerships with relevant stakeholders.

It is important to note that as set out in the diagram above the ADGM Digital Asset framework separately caters for both Virtual Assets and Digital Securities (which has a dedicated framework as laid out here).

Trust and agility at the core of the virtual asset regulatory framework

Knowing the virtual asset industry is in a constant state of development and growth the FSRA has focused on creating a trustworthy transparent and fair environment for all stakeholders.

This framework allows the regulator to ensure compliance not only with the regulations and rules of the FSRA but also relevant and applicable UAE laws and international standards which include prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing activities.

With the UAE federal level Anti Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism legislation and Financial Action Task Force recommendations on a global level all being applicable to FSRA licensed firms including additional controls mandated by the FSRA for virtual assets the comprehensive licencing regime is intended to give investors and consumers peace of mind knowing that their virtual assets are stored and transacted safely and securely.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpaml2aWxsYWdlLmNvbS9uZXdzL0ktam9pbmVkLUxlYWRlcnNoaXAtRmlqaS10by1kaXNjb3Zlci1tb3JlLWFib3V0LW15c2VsZi0tLUtub3gteDg0cmY1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I joined Leadership Fiji to discover more about myself - Knox,"I joined Leadership Fiji to discover more about myself - Knox

EMU has been close to reaching both milestones recently when they finished with seven wins in 2016 and 2018 having a chance for eight wins but seasons but ultimately suffering close losses in the 2016 Bahamas Bowl (24-20 to Old Dominion) and the 2018 Camellia Bowl (23-21 to Georgia Southern).

The Eagles’ last bowl win was in the 1987 California Bowl a 30-27 victory over San Jose State.

Eastern Michigan heads into this one with some high-quality wins on its resume versus MAC contenders in 2021 including 52-49 versus Toledo 22-21 versus Western Michigan and 13-12 versus Miami OH.

Fans may know the game by the names it has had over the years including the Dollar General Bowl GoDaddy Bowl GMAC Bowl and Mobile Alabama Bowl. But whatever the name the games featured some exciting performances like in 2001 when then MAC squad Marshall Thundering Herd erased a 30-point halftime deficit to beat the East Carolina Pirates in double overtime 64-61.

For the first time in its 23-year history the game will be played at different site than Ladd-Peebles Stadium moving to the recently-minted Hancock Whitney Stadium which opened in 2020 and is home to South Alabama football.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Friday announced the sentencing during a press conference outside a Burlingame CVS store. He said the five pleaded guilty to participating in a multi-million dollar theft scheme targeting Bay Area retailers with charges including conspiracy to commit retail theft receiving stolen property money laundering along with an aggravated white collar enhancement of over $500000.

The investigation began in April 2020 and led to the discovery of a major theft ring dealing in stolen property from burglaries across the Bay Area. According to the complaint defendants transported stored and sold stolen goods in other countries and laundered the money back to the United States.

Over the course of the investigation nearly $2 million was seized from the defendants' bank accounts.

The man identified as the ringleader Concord resident Danny Louis Drago will be sentenced to six years in state prison with four others already sentenced to lesser terms.

""The retail theft we're seeing across California is unacceptable"" said Bonta. ""Those who break the law and peddle stolen goods they will be held accountable.""

Bonta said those participating in the current wave of thefts should take note.

""Today's announcement should serve as a warning shot to anyone thinking of participating in organized retail theft"" Bonta said. ""You will be held accountable.""

The five defendants were arrested in September of 2020 and during the operation law enforcement seized about $8 million in merchandise stolen from retailers such as CVS Target and Walgreens as well as $85000 in U.S. currency from the defendants' warehouse residences and storage facilities.

""We believe we have the key figures behind this operation"" said Bonta. ""They have been arrested and they received the biggest punishment. We have covered the gamut here.""

The other defendants were identified as Drago's wife Michelle Renee Fowler San Francisco husband and wife Edgar Geovany Robles Morales and Isis Vasquez Villanueva and Jose Villatoro. Their arrests followed a joint investigation by the California Department of Justice's White Collar Investigation Team the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office's Crime Suppression Unit the San Mateo County District Attorney's Office and the California Highway Patrol.

Drago was scheduled to be sentenced to a six-year prison term on February 25. Fowler was sentenced to three years in state prison suspended pending two years' supervised probation including 364 days in San Mateo County jail. Robles Morales and Villanueva were sentenced to probation with 364 days of electronic monitoring or work program. Villatoro was sentenced to probation and 30 days in jail.

Bonta promised more prosecutions of retail theft rings and the case was a good example of law enforcement agencies working together to hold these organizations accountable.

""The organized retail theft we're seeing in California and throughout the country are coordinated efforts by groups that are targeting stores with the intention of stealing as much as possible with no regard for the safety of the workers or consumers in those businesses"" said Bonta in a prepared statement. ""In this case we see that the coordination doesn't stop at the initial theft. Groups are in turn reselling items and in many cases using them to fund additional illicit activity including human trafficking and organized crime. The defendants in this case have been held to account for their crimes and I can assure you others will be as well.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2RhdGVib29rLnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9mZXN0aXZhbHMvbm90LWEtc2FmZS1zcGFjZS1ibGFjay1jYXN0LW1lbWJlcnMtYm95Y290dC1kaWNrZW5zLWZhaXItb3Zlci1mYWlsdXJlLXRvLXByZXZlbnQtcmFjaXN0LWJlaGF2aW9y0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vZGF0ZWJvb2suc2ZjaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL2Zlc3RpdmFscy9ub3QtYS1zYWZlLXNwYWNlLWJsYWNrLWNhc3QtbWVtYmVycy1ib3ljb3R0LWRpY2tlbnMtZmFpci1vdmVyLWZhaWx1cmUtdG8tcHJldmVudC1yYWNpc3QtYmVoYXZpb3IvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Not a safe space’: Black cast members boycott Dickens Christmas Fair over failure to prevent racist sexist behavior,"For her first Great Dickens Christmas Fair in 2015 LaToya Tooles fashioned a gown out of dollar-store hula hoops and a tablecloth. A friend had invited her to the annual event a festive re-creation of 19th century London inspired by the works of Charles Dickens that has been running in San Francisco for nearly 40 years.

Almost as soon as she arrived at the antique winter wonderland she joined the revelers on Fezziwig’s dance floor and didn’t stop waltzing for hours.

“I met some of my greatest friends at the Dickens Fair” says Tooles who went on to join the event’s volunteer cast taking on bigger roles and more responsibility each year.

Her history with the tight-knit fair community is what makes the past two years so heartbreaking for Tooles who is one of a small number of Black cast members at the Great Dickens Christmas Fair. What started as a goodwill effort to help rectify what is seen as the event’s failure to protect its volunteers and guests from racist and sexist behavior has turned ugly. Now more than 200 cast members and thousands of guests have pledged to boycott this year’s fair which is set to return to the Cow Palace on Saturday Dec. 4 in a scaled-down drive-through experience for the next three weekends.

“I want people to recognize what their values are and decide if the Dickens Fair aligns with them” says Tooles founder of an affinity group for the fair’s Black performers called Londoners of the African Diaspora or LoAD.

Organizers of the boycott a group of Dickens Fair cast and crew dubbed the London Solidarity Network won’t support a return to the fair until a list of safety requirements is met. A petition in support of the action has already received more than 3000 signatures.

“Now is our moment to raise our collective voices against injustice” the petition reads calling on the fair’s administration at Red Barn Productions “to make The Great Dickens Christmas Fair a safe and equitable space for all.”

Dickens Christmas Fair is back in Bay Area — with COVID-era mobile format

Representatives from Red Barn Productions which puts on the Dickens Fair call the boycott “a surprise and a disappointment.” They point to a series of actions they have taken to try to address LoAD’s concerns and insist that management has always been professional and compassionate. But now after months in which nearly every corner of public and corporate life has faced a racial reckoning this year the fair is facing its own opposition.

While less has been said about equity issues in hobby and play spaces the fight against discrimination in those spaces can be more complex. Americans dedicate an average of five hours a day to leisure and sports activities but these arenas often lack formal organizational structures for initiating or carrying out substantive change. For Black people the harm can be multiplied when they find themselves facing discrimination in spaces where they are going for rest and relaxation — especially when their hobby involves pretending to exist centuries ago in places where equality and safety for marginalized people were even further out of reach.

“Every member of LoAD has been called a slave” says Anastasia Elizondo an Afro-Chicana actor and comedian from Oakland who has been performing at the Dickens Fair for nearly 20 years. She adds that fairgoers’ limited knowledge of Black history can lead to offensive generalizations and assumptions. “One of us has been called Aunt Jemima another Sally Hemings.”

Angel Dotts who is biracial and calls herself a Dickens “Fair brat” started attending with her parents when she was a toddler. She says she’s used to being one of the few brown faces at the fair but when her husband a Black man started attending she began to understand what the situation was like for attendees of color. Despite having a cast member pass she says he was stopped at every security gate — not just by hired security officers but also by fellow fair participants and looked at with suspicion by vendors.

“His experiences started to make me recognize that this was not a safe space” Dotts says.

According to others in the world of historical costuming and re-enactments what’s playing out in the Bay Area is not an anomaly.

“Dickens is one great example of what’s been going on in these places for a while” says Bianca Hernandez-Knight a lifetime member of the Jane Austen Society of North America.

Hernandez-Knight recently resigned from all her roles on the society’s national board after months of a back-and-forth with the group’s leadership over a proposed (and ultimately rejected) diversity statement.

“This all relates to a bigger conversation around how people view history” she said. “The issues we are facing in historical costuming spaces and the backlash to critical race theory — I genuinely think those things are very similar. There are people who just really need their history to be as whitewashed and as comfortable for them as possible.”

This isn’t the first time Red Barn has been alerted to concerns among its cast. LoAD is just one established affinity group within the fair. During a roundtable in May which included members from other groups a representative of survivors of sexual and gender-based violence at the Dickens Fair said that known offenders “have been able to prey upon and abuse other participants for decades.” This has spurred many fair participants to keep a list of such predators and abusers so that they can warn new participants.

In 2019 more than 15 people sent letters to Red Barn describing their experiences with sexual assault or harassment resulting in the dismissal of a serial offender. But the stories stayed locked away inside the “fair family” — with no human resources professional on staff or a formalized process for reporting abuse.

Red Barn CEO Kevin Patterson says that affirmative consent training was implemented in 2016 but admits it was not enough. But he also believes that the scope of the problem has been overblown.

“Social media has made one complaint sound like 1000 complaints and one circumstance sound like the norm when it is the outlier” he says.

For Ari Yovel who is autistic and transgender the current conflict LoAD members are facing parallels their own struggle to advocate for marginalized communities within the fair. For years Yovel advocated as a representative of the Order of the Golden Needle a neurodivergent advocacy group for a de-stimulation space within the fair or “de-stim” room. “Each time I was met with the sentiment that even though they took my requests very seriously they just couldn’t possibly do anything about them. All the while I was being paraded out as a poster child for how progressive and cooperative RBP (Red Barn Productions) were” says Yovel who is boycotting this year’s fair and is unsure if they will ever return.

In June 2020 when Red Barn Productions released an emphatic statement of support for the Black Lives Matter movement LoAD saw an opportunity to ensure the company’s actions aligned with its words.

At Red Barn’s request LoAD members spent weeks researching and crafting a meticulous 53-point plan that addressed developing a standardized method for reporting harassment and discrimination ensuring increased representation of Black Indigenous and people of color at the fair conducting mandatory antidiscrimination training and hiring HR and diversity and inclusion professionals. It also asked that Red Barn discontinue a tradition of portraiture casting a practice that casts only people with an aesthetic resemblance to a historic character.

But after LoAD submitted the initiative in August of last year Tooles and others said Red Barn continually refused to engage with the document or complete the requested review steps. What LoAD felt were requests for simple acts of solidarity — such as making a public statement to condemn a racist post by a longtime fair vendor — were met with resistance. “This is more complicated than you may imagine. … The general public who attend the Fair could be confused and even agitated by a public post like this” Patterson wrote in an email.

Scheduled meetings were repeatedly canceled and verbal commitments to make specific changes were contradicted by several actions: Instead of a promised HR professional the company hired a dramaturge or artistic director. A verbal agreement to halt portraiture casting was not carried out they said and the practice in fact seemed to be reaffirmed in a meeting of fair directors.

But Patterson says his instructions to fair directors about casting policy were misunderstood.

“We had every intention of maintaining that agreement with LoAD to enact color-conscious casting” he says. “In the course of the intellectual conversation it was taken way out of context and misunderstood as being something we were changing our minds on.”

While members of LoAD felt they’d been deceived Patterson’s response seemed to calm things and the uproar in the wider fair community quickly died down.

For LoAD member Leandra Darden however the moment brought a revelation.

“The community proved to me that it was unwilling to protect itself not just me” she said. “I really believe that if white women don’t demand things Black women cannot get them.”

The Great Dickens Christmas Fair grew out of the Southern California Renaissance fair scene of the 1960s.

Ron and Phyllis Patterson staged the country’s first Renaissance Pleasure Faire in 1963. By 1968 the couple began hosting a holiday party at their Hollywood Hills home that re-created Charles Dickens’ version of Victorian London. The parties were such a hit the Pattersons decided to stage them on a larger scale and open them to the public.

In 1970 the first Great Dickens Christmas Fair debuted at the old Anchor Works warehouses (now Levi’s Plaza) in San Francisco. It changed locations over the years moving to Oakland at one point before landing in Daly City at the Cow Palace where it’s been staged for the last two decades.

When Ron Patterson died in 2011 his son Kevin took over the business now known as Red Barn Productions which he runs with his wife Leslie and son Andrew. The quirky holiday party hosted by a theater-loving family has become a massive monthlong event with dozens of vendors a volunteer cast and crew of more than 1400 and 66000-plus ticketed guests each season.

The event was not held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but Red Barn promised to pick up the discussions with LoAD in early January. Meetings were canceled or postponed until early May. By April both the artistic director hire and the casting policy were announced which spurred LoAD to take action.

At the scheduled May 6 meeting it issued a statement of no confidence in Red Barn Productions to manage the Dickens Fair. It also demanded the formation of a supervisory board and the hiring of a qualified HR consultant and a diversity and inclusion professional. The group set a deadline of May 14 for Red Barn to agree to those terms or face public exposure and a possible boycott.

“Our trust had been broken too many times” says Tooles.

On the day of the request Red Barn spokesperson Shannon Damnavits announced that the Dickens Fair Cast & Crew Facebook page would be archived with posting disabled. She also released a statement on the Facebook page saying Red Barn was “shocked and saddened by the abrupt and declarative actions of Londoners of the African Diaspora” characterizing LoAD as a threat: “Tonight they elected to walk away from the table and are attempting to take over the Dickens Fair.”

Within days that statement was replaced with a post that read “we hear your concerns” and emphasized the company’s commitment to “continue with its Diversity Equity and Inclusion work.”

In the months since Red Barn has made a human resources hire launched a “Red Flag Reporting System” for people to anonymously report any improper activity and engaged a diversity and inclusion firm Hummingbird Humanity. It has a new single-page DEI Commitment statement that “encourages” BIPOC representation rather than requiring it and is asking that all Dickens cast crew and vendors sign it and pledge to be better.

Red Barn says its full statement on diversity and inclusion should be finished early next year.

“We are going to work together to see what needs to be done in the future to make things not just satisfactory but excitingly better for everybody” Patterson says.

Red Barn however has declined to create a supervisory board something LoAD members see as non-negotiable.

“We’re a privately held company not a nonprofit organization we’re not going to be governed by a board” says Patterson. “We know for a fact that over time we will rebuild the trust that is necessary. They don’t need to wrest the power away from us and make all these decisions.”

The contentious negotiations with the fair’s administration has soured many former devotees on an event that once seemed magical.

“I love making old dresses. I love dancing. But I do not love them more than the safety and well-being of myself and others who are marginalized” says Tooles.

More than 200 former participants including members of LoAD and other affinity groups will be boycotting the event with Tooles. In solidarity several of its traditional performing groups — including Jeremy’s Escort Service Fezziwigs the Royals and the Fairies — have declared that they will not participate. More than 3000 cast and crew members vendors and guests have also committed to boycott.

As the movement has grown some Dickens Fair cast members and vendors who have been on the periphery of the yearlong conversation have jumped in aghast and aggrieved that the advocacy groups are “trying to ruin the magic” and “destroy Dickens.” But Tooles and others maintain that they are trying to fix the fair not harm it. They also make clear that walking away from Dickens amounts to more than just losing a beloved hobby.

LoAD member Mandy Beri who is deaf and autistic has been performing at the Dickens Fair since 2016 as part of the Coventry Carolers choir. It’s an experience she especially treasured because the fair was one of the few places she says she’s been able to showcase her vocal talent.

“I’m likely going to lose a lot of friends in this process because I won’t see them” says Victoria Spencer who lives in Southern California but would travel north every year just for the fair. “I’m also recognizing that I’m losing people that weren’t ever really my friends. There’s a lot of relationships that won’t ever be the same because we took this stand.”

Others like Elizondo are less sanguine. She says she has been snubbed by people she considered longtime friends over speaking out. “But that’s our history though isn’t it as Black people in America? People love to say ‘Look at these amazing Black women. Look what they’ve done’ — until it no longer benefits them. Then they’re gonna push us to the front and let us take the bullets.”

For Tooles the chapter of her life that included hours of waltzing on Fezziwig’s dance floor is now closed. But she didn’t exit the party without leaving a gift.

Earlier this year LoAD created a document that laid out minimum requirements for a safe Dickens Fair. It includes a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment; the renovation of a long-secret VIP bar known as the Opium Den seen as rife with Asian stereotyping; allowing all trans or nonbinary actors to portray the gender representation of their choosing; and more.

In other words they are advocating collective liberation.

“Dickens Fair will probably continue on after this conversation” says Tooles “but whatever changes that happen inside of that organization are because we did not shut up.”

VALLEY — Dolly Knickerbocker had lived all over the world before finding a place that was perfect for her at Sylvia Word Manor. She’s been there for 16 years now and loves it.

She’s full of energy and very creative. Her Christmas trees and table decorations in the Sylvia Word’s activity center are in striking colors and were all handmade. Knickerbocker also made the large candy canes that are on display in the small trees in the courtyard area.

“My mind stays busy all the time” she said. “Sometimes when I’m thinking of things I can be doing it’s hard to sleep at night.”

While most people don’t think of decorating for Christmas until it’s past Thanksgiving Knickerbocker starts planning for the next Christmas at Sylvia Word in January. It’s convenient to have a Dollar Tree store within walking distance and Knickerbocker goes there to purchase items for her Christmas creations.

“At the Dollar Tree I get everything at bargain prices” she said. “I get lots of ribbon paper products card stock and paint. I like to make things that are new and different.”

She stays busy making craft items during the winter months and in the weeks leading up to Christmas. She makes Christmas trees for the tables out of red and green paper napkins. She also makes snowmen to put in front of the trees.

Winter scenes remind her of the time she was living in Buffalo New York and sometimes had to find a way through waist-deep snow. She’s glad she’s now in a warmer climate with milder winters.

While most people decorate for Christmas with the traditional colors of deep reds and greens Knickerbocker prefers softer tones. The main tree inside the activity center is something to behold. The dominant colors are lime green and pink. It’s not Christmas in the traditional sense but is beautiful nonetheless.

The pinks are handmade poinsettia-type petals. The light greens resemble living plants. There’s also some large butterflies and ornaments that are light green and there are some artificial spruce limbs that look to be covered with snow. It’s all topped off with a black stovepipe hat Abe Lincoln would have been proud to wear. There’s something special underneath the tree – a tiny white bird on the rim of a bird nest.

There are smaller trees with the pink and green theme. Lots of delicate work went into making all of them. One of the tables has a pink a green and a blue Christmas tree each made from napkins. It took a dedicated patient person to make the many leaves each tree has and to place ribbons on them.

“Where you live is what you make it” Knickerbocker said. “Take your time and do things the right way. It’s a good idea to choose your friends carefully and to spend your time with them. They treat us right here at Sylvia Word. All we have to do is enjoy it.”

Knickerbocker doesn’t want her creations to become stale and predictable. She puts a lot of thought into what colors she will highlight with each passing season.

“It’s different every year” she said. “This year was pink and green. Next year will be plaid.”

In the warm weather months Knickerbocker enjoys gardening in an area the residents have developed just behind the Sylvia Word property.

“We have a beautiful place back there” she said. “We have benches a swing and picnic tables. We have all kinds of flowers back there. I grow nandinas azaleas roses day lilies and anything else I can come across. We are always accepting donated plants. I got some angel trumpets last year and they did well.”

The garden is in a cool shady area and the residents have put up signs to give it a homey feel.

“We call it Elder’s Roost and love spending time there. It looks professionally landscaped and we are proud of its appearance” she said.

Lots of elephant ears are growing in a drainage area.

“It’s beautiful back there when it’s in season” Knickerbocker said. “We have done a lot to make it look good but we still have a lot more to do to make it what it can be. “

Some of the best contributions to the garden have been made by a retired professor from Tuskegee University who lives at Sylvia Word.

She has hung some one-foot-wide white globes from the trees to add an unusual touch. She also has the skill of making topiaries out of small shrubs.

“I love being in our garden” Knickerbocker said. “It’s a place where you can work with plants and enjoy being with your friends.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2JhYnlzLWJyZWF0aC10cmVlLWZpbGxlci0zNzAxMTE0NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baby's Breath Makes Great Tree Filler and You Can Find It at Trader Joe's,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/babys-breath-tree-filler-37011146 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2JhYnlzLWJyZWF0aC10cmVlLWZpbGxlci0zNzAxMTE0NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMi8wNS9zdHVkeS1ibGFjay1jaGlsZHJlbi1oaWdoZXItaG9zcGl0YWxpemF0aW9ucy1kdWUtcmFjaWFsLWluZXF1aXR5Lzg4MzY0MzkwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Study: Black children higher hospitalizations due to racial inequity,"Black children suffer from more severe chronic illnesses when compared with white children and two new studies show it isn't about biology.

It's about inequities.

Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center researchers looked at the issue asking these questions: Why are so many Black children readmitted to the hospital for asthma? Why do Black children suffer more with a life-threatening complication of Type 1 diabetes ketoacidosis?

“We didn’t find any (statistically significant) genetic differences based on the race of the children"" said Tesfaye Mersha PhD a researcher in the Cincinnati Children's Division of Asthma Research and lead author of the asthma-focused study.

If social and environmental inequities caused by historical racism were fixed Mersha said the gap in between Black and white children's hospital readmissions would narrow.

“It's not just asthma"" he said. ""This racial gap is everywhere.”

Poverty housing food availability often determine health outcomes for Black children

The second study found a disproportionate number of Black children with type 1 diabetes were admitted for ketoacidosis. The group of kids enrolled was 25% Black yet 41% of admissions for the complication were Black children the research showed.

The study shows that there are social constructs stemming from inequities over time that give Black children less of a chance to stay well said study author Dr. Nana-Hawa Yayah Jones. A lot of it has to do with their environment she said: ""The places where you grow live work and play.""

And that's often determined by income. More Black children than white children lived in families who lived below the U.S. poverty line from 2010-2019 according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation's Kids Count data center. The range for Black children living in poverty for those years was a high of 38% to a low of 31% Kids Count data show. That compares with a range of 14% to 10% of white children living in poverty.

Jones says that something as simple as a parent having reliable transportation can make a world of difference in managing a child's diabetes.

""For some people the closest grocery store might be the Dollar Tree. You can imagine how hard it is to have access to fresh fruits fresh vegetables meats proteins"" Jones said.

About 700 children took part in Mersha's study on asthma readmissions. The scientists followed them for about a year.

They collected lead samples checked the homes for water leaks and mold in carpets and measured air pollution outside. They followed closely whether and how often the children received medication whether they had to sleep outside the family's income and whether health care was covered by insurance. More than 37 social and environmental factors were examined.

The analysis after that year showed 79.1% of the children who were readmitted to the hospital for asthma were Black. About 20% were white. ""Most of the differences came from the social and environmental factors"" Mersha said.

None of it surprises Renee Mahaffey Harris president and CEO of the nonprofit Center for Closing the Health Gap in Avondale.

“None of this is new information” said Mahaffey Harris.

But more people are aware of inequities which have become pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic Mahaffey Harris said. ""The fact that a child isn’t getting a chance to live a full healthy life because of factors in which they live hasn’t gotten enough attention.""

Understanding inequities is the start to fixing them

So what's the solution?

Mahaffey Harris said the United States' healthcare approach historically has been reactive not preventive.

""Hospital systems are built to take care of people when they’re sick"" she said. ""Our country’s model of health is a sick model.""

Prevention she said needs to be the focus with the youngest children the target. ""Kids they’re sponges that absorb what they see.""

Her suggestion to parents? Eat a meal together when they can.

""When you do that you are cooking something together and when you sit down and have that conversation it’s the opportunity to slow down"" Mahaffey Harris said.

""Society isn’t focused on us stopping and breathing. So we have to build it in. Even if it’s twice a week.""

Jones the Cincinnati Children's endocrinologist said the systemic failures are complicated but understanding inequities is a start to fixing them.

""These are structural inequities which you didn’t ask to be born in live in work in play in. What I’m asking for is an awareness that you exist in privilege or that other people don’t exist in privilege"" Jones said.

""I’m asking that no matter what field you’re in anything that you do try to start looking at it with an equity lens.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhYnlnYWdhLmNvbS9jaHJpc3RtYXMtYWN0aXZpdGllcy10b2RkbGVycy1jb3N0LW5vdGhpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Christmas Activities You Can Do With Toddlers That Cost No Money,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhYnlnYWdhLmNvbS9jaHJpc3RtYXMtYWN0aXZpdGllcy10b2RkbGVycy1jb3N0LW5vdGhpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vaG9sbHl3b29kdW5sb2NrZWQuY29tL2NoYW5lbC1mYWNlcy1iYWNrbGFzaC1hZnRlci10aWt0b2tlci1leHBvc2VkLTgwMC1hZHZlbnQtY2FsZW5kYXItaXRlbXMv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9ob2xseXdvb2R1bmxvY2tlZC5jb20vY2hhbmVsLWZhY2VzLWJhY2tsYXNoLWFmdGVyLXRpa3Rva2VyLWV4cG9zZWQtODAwLWFkdmVudC1jYWxlbmRhci1pdGVtcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chanel Faces Backlash After TikToker Exposed $800 Advent Calendar Items,"Write Comment

TikToker Elise Harmon reviewed the product after she stated she’s never seen the brand’s advent calendar. During the unboxing Harmon liked the packaging as the box was shaped like the bottle of Chanel No. 5. However things took a slight turn when she noticed the numbered boxes in the package contained small items such as stickers temporary tattoos a string bracelet and a jewelry dustbag. According to Diet Prada some of the items were previous “gift with purchase” merchandise that can be found on eBay.

Diversified said it will be investing $3 million per year for three years in advanced technology to pinpoint methane emissions across its production and distribution assets beginning in Appalachia and then expanding more broadly. It’s also giving each of its well tenders a handheld methane detection camera to spot and fix leaks at individual well sites.

Alabama-based Diversified operates about 67000 wells across the Appalachian basin: conventional and unconventional natural gas natural gas liquids and oil-producing wells. It’s the single-largest well operator in West Virginia with about 29000 conventional wells across the state including Monongalia Preston and Marion counties. Diversified also operates 17000 miles of natural gas-gathering pipelines and a network of compression stations and processing facilities.

Well tenders at a Diversified Energy well in Pennsylvania.

The company said it has engaged Bozeman Mont.-based Bridger Photonics to perform multi-year aerial scans of the company’s natural gas production and distribution assets starting with the Appalachian region.

Bridger specializes in the application of precision laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) equipment to identify methane emissions from gas and oil facilities.

“Today’s commitment to invest $9 million over the next three years into advanced LiDAR technology supports our near-term goal to reduce our 2020-level methane emissions by 30% by 2026 on the way to net-zero by 2040” Diversified CEO Rusty Hutson said on Tuesday.

Bridger President and CEO Pete Roos said “We are thrilled to support Diversified Energy’s leadership role and strong commitment to emissions reduction. Our Gas Mapping LiDAR technology will efficiently detect pinpoint and quantify typically more than 90% of basin emissions to inform and streamline Diversified’s repair and maintenance activities.”

During a 2021 trial in Diversified’s Appalachian basin footprint Bridger’s LiDAR technology detected emissions well below the EPA-defined leak definition of 500 parts per million Diversified said.

The company said it will also deploy an additional 500 methane emissions detection devices to its Appalachian upstream field operations team. This follows the results of a pilot project that deployed 100 devices across Appalachia and proved to be effective in identifying small emissions for trained well tenders to eliminate at little-to-no incremental cost.

The 600 portable methane emission detection devices empower its personnel to identify and remediate emissions otherwise undetectable using traditional techniques like AVO (Audio Visual and Olfactory) Diversified said.

“Adding aerial emissions detection to the handheld devices we’ve placed in the hands of our skilled well tenders further enhances our ability to detect and repair fugitive emissions across our asset base” Hutson said. “Our partnership with the Bridger team is another important milestone as we continue to evaluate other investments that will support our methane-reduction initiatives.”

Diversified said it is committed to repairing all emissions and to documenting and publicly disclosing the results of its emissions detection and repair activities. “By enhancing its measurement processes and capabilities the company is designing its emissions reduction programs to exceed existing state and federal regulatory requirements governing methane emissions including the U.S. EPA’s most recent proposed methane emissions guidelines.

Hutson said “Respecting environmental stewardship in making business decisions is a core value for our employees. Diversified remains committed to the continuous improvement of our environmental performance and to outpacing the expectations of our stakeholders.”

Danica Roem is Virginia's heavy metal yoga-loving assemblywoman who made history as the first openly transgender person to win a statewide seat when she was elected in 2017. And in a year when many Democrats lost ground she was handily re-elected once again in 2021 by constituents who have grown to adore her and her commitment to policies that matter. ""I'm a trans lady from NOVA with an ERA tattoo who drinks kombucha with her vegan breakfast burrito and chills out to Porcupine Tree"" she tweeted after her win. ""That's supposed to make me pretentious but I'm not. People care about constituent service [and] I'm good at it. Be yourself. Help people. That's all.""

State politicians don't usually take center stage in the national media but her history-making defeat of a 25-year incumbent is just one thing that makes Roem so fascinating.

From the outside the Eagle Rock Los Angeles home looked like your typical 1960s split-level tucked away at the end of a small cul-de-sac on a steep hillside yard with a kidney bean–shaped pool. But inside it was “very slapped together” as Kristin Korven one part of the duo behind the architecture firm Part Office puts it. “There wasn’t a lot of meat to work with.” The 2185-square-foot space had been haphazardly added onto over the decades amounting to three different stories that shared none of the same finishes (picture a crazy mix of carpeting and vinyl). Korven and cofounder Jeff Kaplon were brought on by the then current homeowner a couple with two children who had purchased the house sight unseen to mend the splits.

Step one: Relocate the bedroom and en suite bathroom (it eventually became a powder room) on the main level in order to expand the kitchen dining and living areas. “They really wanted the ground floor to act as a hangout and social space” says Kaplon. But that wasn’t even the biggest puzzle to solve.

Stair Tetris

The central staircase was the most problematic area of the house. The choppy structure of inconsistent rises runs and landings blocked the view from the front living room to the kitchen and backyard zone. Surprisingly though “we came to the conclusion that we should just celebrate the fact that it was kind of strange and illogical” notes Kaplon.

The living room before.

The architects did their best to open it up and peel back some of the fussy half walls and turned it into a feature moment by cladding parts of it in marine-grade plywood and adding a window in the upper landing to help flood the stairwell with natural light throughout the day. “It gives you the visual connection diagonally from the front all the way down to the rear yard but also from the kids’ rooms on the second floor” says Kaplon. “They could peer downstairs from there.”

On the ground level they clad a built-in bench in the same material and added doors for shoe storage (the lower set of stairs lead right to the garage so it’s a convenient spot to store outerwear).

Open Sesame

The kitchen and dining area before.

The existing ceiling was vaulted with a structural tree (a.k.a. a central post that supports various beams that redistribute the load of the new volume and layout). It was an easy decision to make after the designers ripped open the old Sheetrock and found that the house’s architecture would allow for more headroom. “Similarly with celebrating the stairs we wanted to show what was going on up there so that’s why some of the beams are exposed” says Kaplon.

Balancing the Books

Fortunately using affordable plywood in a lot of areas (including the pitched ceiling) helped even out the cost of the splurge-worthy Italian terrazzo floor tiles from Concrete Collaborative. And in any case “we didn’t want this house to feel super-high-end” notes Korven. “The plywood came in as this warm natural element; a nice paradox with the polished stone.” The pair looked at dozens of sheets and hand-selected each one opting for really simple joint details over popular exposed edging. “It’s a really common building material so we wanted to make sure we treated it with a certain level of respect” says Kaplon.

Window Into a New World

Sliding glass doors now offer instant access to the pool deck outside while a new long skinny rectangular window in the kitchen is all about continuing the views. Picking fresh paint for the facade was one of the very last decisions the designers made so they made it a power move opting for Behr’s Russian Olive.

The Derek Trucks– and Susan Tedeschi-led twelve-piece continued to dig deeper into its bag of tricks with a cover-heavy performance featuring a four-song acoustic mini-set.

After opening the performance with “Don’t Drift Away” “Misunderstood” and “When Will I Begin” the band moved into a run of covers with Bessie Smith‘s “Gin House Blues” Derek and the Dominos‘ “Tell The Truth” and The Wood Brothers‘ “Smoke Ring Halo”. A standout rendition of “Part Of Me” led into Tedeschi’s “Looking For Answers” before the powerful combination of “Leaving Trunk” (Sleepy John Estes) and “Volunteered Slavery” (Rahsaan Roland Kirk) closed out the first frame.

Tedeschi Trucks Band – “Tell The Truth” (Derek and the Dominos) – 12/3/21

Tedeschi Trucks Band – “Looking For Answers” (Susan Tedeschi) – 12/3/21

The band returned from set break and sat huddled together with acoustic instruments at center stage for a four-song segment featuring lively communal takes on Bob Dylan‘s “Lord Protect My Child” The Rolling Stones‘ “Dear Doctor” Howlin’ Wolf‘s “Down In The Bottom” and Tedeschi’s “It Hurt So Bad”.

Tedeschi Trucks Band – “Dear Doctor” (The Rolling Stones) – 12/3/21

As the delighted Orpheum audience howled with approval the twelve band members resumed their usual posts and barreled into their second electric set of the night with “Signs High Times”. A growling Mike Mattison-sung cover of Dr. John‘s “I Walk On Guilded Splinters” gave way to a surprisingly searing “Greensleeves” tangent before finding its way into a fearsome “Shame”.

With time for a few more the band dove into covers of “Keep On Growing” (Derek and the Dominos) “The Sky Is Crying” (Elmore James) and “I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free” (Billy Taylor) before encoring with a rousing homage to Mad Dogs & Englishmen with “Space Captain” (Matthew Moore).

What does 2022 have in store? In Design Psychic our community of editors experts and tastemakers predict the trends coming soon to a house near you.

From a tonal emerald reno in Abilene Texas to a forest-tinged Nashville space to a Washington D.C. project that went from builder-grade to sage—green kitchens were everywhere this year. Designer Stephanie Dyer even had a client go as far as to hand her a green velvet pillow and say “Design me a kitchen around this.” The cabinet hue felt especially comforting these past two years as our lives were largely confined indoors. As we baked sourdough bread it reminded us of sprouting buds in spring and leisurely walks through the woods. But as we look forward to what 2022 has in store we’re ready for a fresh start. The next kitchen cabinet color that will hit it big? Pink.

No we’re not talking princess-y shades of fuchsia or bubblegum. Think: muddy rose and dusty mauve. We’ve been seeing these colors slowly overtake our Instagram feeds (Wit and Delight founder Kate Arends used Farrow & Ball’s Sulking Room Pink in her recent reno) and we’ve even gotten a few glimpses of examples from brands like Plain English and DeVol. Here are some tips for pulling off the next It color in your kitchen.

Pick Two Tones

The nearly white blush lower cabinets in this Plain English–designed kitchen help neutralize the muddy lavender island and wall paneling without giving up on a cool monochromatic scheme.

Don’t Skip the Knobs

Paint right over your hardware for an instantly modern look as in Orla Read’s space swathed in Edward Bulmer’s aptly named London Brown.

Upcycle in Style

When you paint an old vanity or salvaged freestanding cabinet a punchy color it instantly comes to life again. Psst: Do like DeVol’s creative director and get your green fix with tile.

Pair It With Blue

Moscow-based firm Design Buro5 shows us how to truly color-block in this space with its predominantly sky blue cabinetry and unexpected rose pink punch on the ceiling.

Sometimes there's only one thing that cuts the mustard where takeaway's concerned and that's pizza.

Often shop bought pizzas pale in comparison to the cheesy delights of a fresh 12-inch delivered to your door - especially when you can scrap the cooking and washing up for a night too.

But who's your go-to for the perfect pizza? We decided to put deals from Domino's and Pizza Hut to the test to see how they compare on quality and price.

While not specifically marketed as family meals deals we chose the 'feed 4 for £24' option from Domino's and Pizza Hut's similar priced £24.99 deal.

READ MORE: We cooked Christmas dinner from Aldi and Lidl for just £3.50 a head and this is how it turned out

Now size is key here as with Domino's you're getting two 11.5 inch pizzas or at least that's what you're supposed to get.

Ours fell slightly short at 11"" x 11"" for one and 11"" x 10"" for the other.

It's not that clear what size you're supposed to get from Pizza Hut as the large simply says '10 slices' but I'm assured it's meant to be 13"" for large cut classic crusts and that's what arrived - for one of them at least the other slightly smaller at 13"" by 12"".

It's the first time I've ever taken a tape measure to a pizza but accuracy is everything and it did prove that we were being slightly shortchanged - and every mouthful counts when you've got a family to feed.

Both offer a variety of flavours and a create your own option for those wanting something not on the usual list.

Ordering from both at exactly the same time on a Sunday evening to also check out their delivery times we went for a pepperoni from each place and a create your own.

(Image: Manchester Family / MEN)

With Domino's you get to choose four toppings from a list of 23 but we just went for two - sausage and pork meatballs.

Pizza Hut gave us a choice of four toppings from 17 but sadly meatballs wasn't an option and rather bizarrely we couldn't get the spicy pork sausage as a topping even though it's included on their Supreme pizza.

So instead we instead went for their BBQ Meat Feast with bbq sauce spicy pork ham pepperoni and seasoned minced beef.

The Domino's deal comes with set sides of garlic pizza bread and potato wedges.

Pizza Hut offers a bigger variety - of either potato wedges Doritos cheesy nachos garlic bread or mixed leaf salad.

Or you can pay extra for cheesy garlic bread (50p more) or £2 more for either Italian style sausage tear and share topper 5 breaded chicken strips 7 bbq chicken wings 7 cheese triangles or a portion of mac 'n' cheese.

You get a larger drink from Pizza Hut too - a 1.5l bottle of Pepsi Max or 7up Free compared with the 1.25l bottle from Domino's where you can choose Coca Cola Diet Coca Cola Fanta or Sprite.

So it's clear that Pizza Hut's offering is bigger but who's is better?

Well everyone's taste buds are different of course but for us nothing beats the flavour of Domino's.

While Pizza Hut certainly gives it a good run for its money there's just something about the latter - perhaps its pillow soft dough or flavoursome tomato sauce - that makes it unique.

It took two minutes longer for Domino's to arrive - 37 minutes compared with Pizza Hut's 35 - but it was definitely worth the wait.

A spokesperson for Pizza Hut Delivery said: ""We are always looking for ways our customers can get great tasting pizzas for great value. The deals on our website are customised depending on location and we regularly update our deals to include new products.”

We have approached Domino's for a comment.

Stocks rallied to start the week Monday with the Dow erasing its losses from the previous week as investors shook off fears around the emerging threat of the Covid omicron variant. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped while the Nasdaq Composite lagged though it was still in positive territory. Here's what was influencing the markets to start the week: Shares linked to the economic reopening gained in Monday trading including energy industrials and airlines.

Investors sold tech stocks with relatively high valuations. Those shares dragged the market down to a losing week on Wall Street last week. Indeed though the Nasdaq gained Monday it still underperformed the S&P 500 and the Dow.

The 10-year Treasury yield

There's a major shift underway at the Federal Reserve to bring about a faster end to its pandemic easing policies.

Bitcoin declined sharply at the end of the prior week plummeting by $10000 in a 24-hour period from Friday to Saturday. The move suggested a decreasing risk appetite among investors. The Dow gained 646.95 points on Monday or 1.8% to 35227.03. Meanwhile the Nasdaq Composite climbed out of negative territory and ended 0.9% higher to 15225.15. The S&P 500 rose 1.1% to 4591.67. All three major averages finished the week lower on Friday.

Stocks linked to the reopening of the economy gained boosting sentiment on the Dow. General Electric and Boeing each gained more than 3%. Chevron climbed 1.5% and Caterpillar added 1.7%. Leisure and hospitality stocks saw the biggest advances. United Airlines jumped 8.3% and American rose 7.8%. Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise Lines gained more than 8%. Shares of Wynn Resorts climbed 6% while Marriott and Hilton each rose more than 4%. Travel booking stock Expedia added 6.7% and Booking Holdings rose 5.3%. Those moves followed comments White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci made Sunday saying the initial data on the omicron variant is ""encouraging."" The comments came the same day CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told ABC News the new variant has now been discovered in at least 15 U.S. states and less than two weeks after the World Health Organization designated it as being ""of concern."" ""Clearly in South Africa omicron has a transmission advantage"" Fauci said. ""Although it's too early to make any definitive statements about it thus far it does not look like there's a great degree of severity to it.""

CNBC

The Nasdaq though higher lagged the other major averages Monday weighed down by health care and tech stocks. Moderna the biggest decliner in the index fell 13.4%. AMD and Nvidia were off by 3.4% and 2.1% respectively. But as investors' fears about omicron faded several high-priced tech shares that began the day in the red turned green. Craig Erlam senior market analyst at OANDA urged investors to stay cautious until more data can provide more cause for optimism. ""Reports of the omicron symptoms being less severe are boosting risk appetite but it's too soon to get carried away"" he said in a note. ""For one we've seen this repeatedly since the initial news broke a little over a week ago. Markets have been very headline-driven and this is just the latest rally on the back of some positive reports."" Erlam also warned that the rest of this week could prove to be as volatile as the last. ""While this may be the first in a slew of positive data around the new variant it could also be the anomaly and what follows could explain why world leaders and various agencies have been so anxious"" he said. ""Weeks like this the economic data would always play second fiddle but as it turns out it's looking a little thin on that front and central banks are in the same position as the rest of us.""

On Friday tech stocks pulled the market lower. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.92% with shares of Tesla as the biggest drag. Cathie Wood's flagship Ark Innovation Fund fell more than 5% on Friday and all of the fund's holdings entered a bear market apart from two stocks. But it was comments from the Fed that unnerved markets late last week not fears about the omicron variant according to Tom Essaye author of the Sevens Report. Last week Chair Jerome Powell signaled the Fed's focus is inflation even with the new variant emerging. That led investors to rotate out of tech and into sectors with better exposure to higher growth. Essaye called the market behavior a ""sort of Taper Tantrum 2.0 as markets react to a more hawkish Fed and rotate into sectors with more positive exposure to rising rates."" The central bank is likely to decide to double the pace of its taper to $30 billion a month at its meeting next week CNBC's Steve Liesman reported Monday based on comments by Fed officials. Initial discussions could also begin as soon as the December meeting about when to raise interest rates and by how much next year. Tom Hainlin of U.S. Bank Wealth Management said investors are also focused on what the terminal interest rate will be and that he expects it to be lower that what investors are pricing in. ""The long-term growth rate is challenged by factors that are changing — demographics productivity and longer-term growth in the labor force — and drive the economy in the long-term"" he told CNBC. ""We still think those are muted relative to history so the idea that the Federal Reserve would raise rates up until up to a rate that we've historically seen — we think that it's not likely to get up to that level.""

The data is startling. Our communities and the world face a global pandemic unprecedented disasters from hurricanes to floods and deep-rooted racial inequalities and systemic injustices that affect many of our families neighbors and colleagues.

While the pandemic changed how people engaged for impact local restrictions and safety remained top priorities. Employees rose to the challenge to ensure our communities nonprofit partners and schools were supported while advancing our ambition. Today on International Volunteer Day we celebrate how our employees have continued to be active in the communities where they work and live.

“People are the catalyst for change which has been both needed and challenged more than ever. We remained steadfast in working to make things better” said Justin Land Program Officer Dow Global Citizenship. “Being apart was difficult; volunteering proved to be a platform where employees could come together for a higher purpose. I was repeatedly impressed by how colleagues created new ways to engage in our communities while keeping safety at the forefront.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZXMvc2xpZGVzaG93L1Rocm93YmFjay1XaGVuLUplc3NlLUphbWVzLWNhbWUtdG8tdG93bi1hbmQtb2xkLTIyOTQwNy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Throwback: When Jesse James came to town and old time Midland,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ourmidland.com/lifestyles/slideshow/Throwback-When-Jesse-James-came-to-town-and-old-229407.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZXMvc2xpZGVzaG93L1Rocm93YmFjay1XaGVuLUplc3NlLUphbWVzLWNhbWUtdG8tdG93bi1hbmQtb2xkLTIyOTQwNy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbmRxdWlzdG1vcnR1YXJ5LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2plcnJ5LXdpbGxpYW1zb25qctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jerry Williamson Jr. Obituary 2021,"Jerry Dow Williamson Jr.

While the pesticide plant at which the leak occurred was operated by Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) which was then controlled by Union Carbide Corporation Dow Chemical Company a multinational chemical giant in the US has since acquired ownership of the company. The survivors of the tragedy continue to agitate 37 years after the incident as a result of Dow’s refusal to hold itself accountable and provide sufficient relief.

“In USA Dow is paying for clean up of 171 contaminated sites including the Tittabawassee and Saginaw river plains near its headquarters in Midland Michigan. But on the matter of cleaning up the ongoing contamination in Bhopal Dow says it is the responsibility of the Madhya Pradesh government.” said Nousheen Khan of Children against Dow Carbide. The toxic remains at the plant are yet to be cleaned to date.

Presenting facts to counter Dow CEO Jim Fitterling’s claims of non-discrimination given that he was a member on the Board of Advisors of an LGBTQI+ organization the four organisations also released a letter from senior LGBT+ activist Peter Tatchell asking Fitterling to own up to the company’s legal responsibilities in Bhopal. In his letter Tatchell says “If rather than being poor brown Indians the victims of Union Carbide’s appalling 1984 gas disaster had been white privileged Americans I doubt that I would need ask why you appear to believe that your company shouldn’t subject itself to a criminal justice process that seeks legitimate redress for the avoidable deaths of thousands of innocent people? I really hope that you can be the person to put right the mistakes of the past which is why I am writing to you with this heartfelt plea for action for the Bhopal victims.”

Sanjana Singh an LGBT+ survivor of the Bhopal disaster said “Fighting discrimination against LGBT+ people teaches us to fight against all forms of discrimination in society. It is wrong for Fitterling who came out as gay in 2014 to make claims of inclusivity while heading a company that starkly discriminates against the Bhopal survivors.”

Rashida Bee President of the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Stationery Karmchari Sangh accused the company of dishonesty and alleged: “Dow Chemical’s premium product Chlorpyriphos is banned in USA for causing possible neurological damage reduced IQ loss of working memory and attention deficit disorders and birth defects. However in India Corteva a corporation with close ties to Dow Chemical sells chlorpyriphos with the trade name Dursban without mentioning its health hazards or its regulatory ban in USA.”

The US Environmental Protection Agency made a press release in August 2021 announcing that it would stop the use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos on all food to better protect human health particularly that of children and farmworkers. “Today EPA is taking an overdue step to protect public health. Ending the use of chlorpyrifos on food will help to ensure children farmworkers and all people are protected from the potentially dangerous consequences of this pesticide” said Administrator Michael S. Regan. In May 2020 India moved to ban 27 pesticides including key products like chlorpyrifos. In July 2021 the Centre informed the Rajya Sabha that 12 of them had been barred and six of them had been phased out. The Leaflet cannot confirm whether Dursban continues to be sold in India although specifics for the product are available on Corteva’s website.

According to Rachna Dhingra of the Bhopal Group for Information & Action in the United States Dow submits unquestioningly to government agencies and courts. In 2005 a Dow joint-venture pled guilty and paid $84 million as criminal fine for participating in an international conspiracy to fix the prices of synthetic rubber in violation of the Sherman Act. In India Dow has ignored six separate summonses to appear in the court’s proceedings in the disaster claiming that Indian criminal courts have no jurisdiction over it.

Leaders of all four organisations have called upon Dow to take responsibility for the disaster and stand trial in India in the criminal case to provide enhanced compensation to the survivors and to remedy the toxic waste that has plagued the water soil and air in the surrounding regions. Thatchell concludes his letter by saying:

“Human decency Jim demands you send your subsidiary Union Carbide to court so that people who have suffered inhumanly for longer than most in their country have been alive might see some truth reconciliation and restitution in what remains of their lives.

Decency demands you accept India’s petition for further compensation to meet the reality of this endless disaster and so do what you can to ease the suffering of those your company has condemned to a life of pain and despair.

Decency also demands you end the poisoning of yet more innocents in Bhopal ensure your company’s mess is cleaned up and compensate those already irretrievably harmed.

You need to do all of these things Jim and you need to do them now. As you say yourself ‘If you want to make a difference in the world—you have to take action. Words won’t cut it.”"

Special to the Herald-Tribune

Less than a mile east of I-75 just off Bee Ridge Road at the northern end of Mauna Loa Boulevard is Baytown Square a gated maintenance-free community offering privacy and security to families and working people in pleasant surroundings.

The 89 two-story attached townhomes occupy 15 buildings situated around a rectangular ring road composed of Boxwood Drive Baytown Drive and Twilight Gray Lane. Eight of the buildings are grouped around a central pond. Three back onto a large lake at the eastern end of the neighborhood with a sparkling water fountain and a forest backdrop on the other side. The rest have views of Florida woods wetlands and greenbelts.

Started in 2016 Baytown Square is another affordable home development in the Sarasota-Bradenton area by D.R. Horton a giant national home builder headquartered in Arlington Texas.

“It’s a nice basic community” said Benjamin Litke a Realtor with Coldwell Banker. “D.R. Horton is a value builder without a lot of frills.”

Amenities are limited to a community pool keeping HOA dues low – from $160 to $184 a month. There are no CDD fees.

D.R. Horton offered just two floor plans with three bedrooms two or 2.5 bathrooms a guest room and a one-car garage. Living spaces were devised with 1674 and 1530 square feet under air. End units have side entries. Interior homes have front entrances. Buildings have a minimum of four units.

Design choices reflect attention to convenience. “It was smart of the builder to put half a bathroom on the main floor and the laundry upstairs so you don’t have to go up and down the stairs as much” said Litke.

Granite countertops covered balconies and screened-in patios in back provide comfortable spots to sit and enjoy the views. He has one of the larger townhomes under contract at 6413 Boxgrove Drive. The 3-bed 2.5-bath townhome has granite countertops in the kitchen a covered balcony and a screened-in patio in back.

Although the townhomes were initially priced in the $200000s values have risen to the mid- to upper-$300000 since then. Litke’s listing had an asking price of $360000.

The demographics in Baytown Square are a mix of mostly younger residents. “There are families with teens and kids in their early 20s still living at home families with younger children and working people” Litke said. “I haven’t seen a lot of retired couples. The stairs tend to discourage older buyers.”

School-age children can attend Tatum Ridge or Lakeview Elementary McIntosh Middle and Sarasota High School.

Baytown Square is a pet-friendly community. Homeowners can rent their townhouse twice a year for a minimum 6-month lease agreement.

“It’s a great place for those who need to travel north or south – easy to get to places even in Tampa and St. Pete and now with the new development around the Bee Ridge corridor there is more commercial development” Litke said. “You don’t have to travel far to get to amenities.”

There is convenient access to shopping restaurants fitness clubs banking and medical facilities including Doctors Hospital. UTC and Lakewood Ranch’s activity hubs are just two exits north on the interstate. Downtown Sarasota and Lido and Siesta Key beaches are within a half-hour’s drive.

For golf enthusiasts nearby Bent Tree Laurel Oak Country Club and Heritage Oaks all offer memberships. There are several fitness clubs a few minutes away too.

Townhomes in Baytown Square don’t come on the market often and those that do go quickly. Litke's sold after just two open houses and had multiple offers. ""It's unusual east of the interstate but we had a good turnout"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2Fya2Fkdm9jYXRlLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTIvMDQvcHVibGljLXJlY29yZHMtbGlja2luZy1jb3VudHktcHJvcGVydHktdHJhbnNmZXJzLW9jdC0xLTgvODg0MzkyMzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Public records: Licking County property transfers Oct. 1-8,"Newark Advocate

The sleek building on U.S. 90 replaces the organization's previous spread out location on Stewart Street. It also allows Community Health Northwest Florida to expand its operations and provide the community with additional health needs.

""So access to care is important and we provide important access to care to people who may not have access"" said Community Health Northwest Florida Chief Community Engagement Officer Ann Papadelias. ""And access to care for mammography and X-ray to an uninsured person especially in rural areas is just critical.""

The new location at 6671 Caroline St. started treating patients in August after renovations started in 2019. Community Health Northwest Florida held an open house Friday at the renovated space.

As part of the relocation Community Health Northwest Florida is adding X-rays a mammography unit a pharmacy dental services and women's health services all of which were not provided at the original location.

""We had pediatrics and we had family (medicine). And we had some medication assistance. And we tried to do behavioral health as best we could"" said Community Health Northwest Florida CEO Chandra Smiley. ""And so the space we have here we're able to add more family practice. We've added a pediatrician. Dental is a whole new service line and the pharmacy is a whole new service.""

Smiley said part of Community Health Northwest Florida's distinction is the fact that the organization prides itself on providing access to anyone who needs it.

""So all of our locations we're here to take care of anybody"" Smiley said. ""So it's regardless of your insurance status. We have a lot of Medicaid patients.""

Smiley said about 58% of Community Health Northwest Florida's patients use Medicaid — a state and federal program that helps with health care costs for lower income people — and about 25% are completely uninsured. She said the organization also provides services to people who are homeless.

Smiley said Community Health Northwest Florida's willingness to work with non-insured individuals fills a needed gap.

""Hardly anybody takes uninsured unless you can pay and you're talking $100 just for a visit"" Smiley said. ""And Medicaid there's nobody that wants to take Medicaid.""

The organization is planning to add new pieces to its expanded coverage as they come in. The funding of roughly $330000 for the mammography unit was just approved by the Santa Rosa County Commission in October. Papadelias said staff have ordered the mammography unit and it should arrive around the end of the first quarter of 2022.

""There's a lot more than meets the eye than just plugging it in"" Papadelias said. ""There's a lot of it. And we hope to get it up and going during the second quarter probably late second quarter 2022.""

Smiley and Papadelias both emphasized the new building also better equips the Milton location to handle behavioral health.

""... It's really integrating the behavioral health and wellness services into the medical practice"" Smiley said.

She added the organization is working to hire licensed clinical social workers for the location.

Papadelias said the renovation of the Milton location will be a good addition to the organization.

""This really is a game changer for our organization in providing care to the community over in Milton and center of the county so we are super thrilled"" Papadelias said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdGl6ZW4tdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5L21vbmV5LzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvYXNoZXZpbGxlLW5vcnRoLWNhcm9saW5hLXByb3BlcnR5LXRyYW5zZmVycy1ub3YtMTgtMTkvODc4MDk5OTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asheville North Carolina property transfers from Nov. 18-19,,,,

Styx and REO will alternate headlining each night and start the trek on May 31st in Grand Rapids Michigan at Van Andel Arena with the bands winding things down on August 21st at Wantagh New York at Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater.

Styx guitarist Tommy Shaw said in the tour announcement :

I can’t think of a better way of touring the USA next year than with good friends we’ve known for years and performed with on many a stage. What a great night of music this will be!

REO's Kevin Cronin added :

Tommy (Shaw) and I have done a number of Zoom performances together during the pandemic and REO and Styx are ready to go get UnZoomed and out on the road for our fifth U.S. tour together. Add our great friends Mike Reno and the Loverboy guys and I am totally psyched. If I wasn’t performing in it I would totally come out to see this show. See you all LIVE and UNZOOMED!

Loverboy frontman Mike Reno said :

We can’t wait to take the stage and rock this summer it’s gonna be awesome. These are all the groups I grew up with and I’m there too. Best tour of the summer — guaranteed.

Styx guitarist Tommy Shaw told us that the Styx-REO connection stems from his personal friendship with fellow Midwesterner REO's frontman Kevin Cronin: “Kevin and I ran into each other — we've known each other since like 1975 and it's something we'd talked about. We ran into each other in 1998 at a MTV at some kind of a game show that he and I were both on. And he wound up coming back over and I was doing 7 Deadly Zens at the time and he said 'Let me come over and be on your solo album.' So that was kind of the genesis of it that 'Wouldn't it be cool if we did this?' But so many things had. . . the planets had to align. And they finally did and once they did it was like a piece of cake.”

Kevin Cronin told us that out of countless musicians he's known over the years — especially those he played with while growing up — he's never forgotten how truly blessed he is to earn a living as a working musician: “I lucked out man. I saw the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show decided that's what I wanted to do — and I'm still doin' it. And obviously it's the REO Speedwagon fans that have given me this great opportunity — and believe me; I don't take it for granted for one second. And I try to thank them every night by givin' them a great show and letting them know that I don't take their support for granted.”

We asked the Loverboy lead singer Mike Reno how and why a band that hails from Calgary Alberta can be treated like local “hometown” heroes in so many cities across the U.S.: “Y'know that is really is amazing that you picked up on that because we talk about it all the time. There's some pockets in the U.S. that treat us like we're homeboys and it's so cool. Y'know what I think a lot of it stems from is that they grew up listening to our music when they were going through school or when they were going through college or when they were getting married; and we're a good memory. So we're part of their DNA and I think people wanna pull things out that make them feel good and make them happy. The Loverboy days were happy days for most everybody and we definitely try to keep it that way.”

Experts say it will put one of the nation’s most pristine wetlands at risk.

A predawn phone call woke Ron Bledsoe with a jolt. It was his supervisor telling him to come in.

Bledsoe dressed and drove an hour to the power plant near Kingston Tennessee where he worked. He arrived at a shocking sight: A mountain of coal ash covering the road and a set of railroad tracks. It looked like the surface of the moon he recalled.

Hours earlier an embankment at the plant had ruptured flooding the area with gray muck. The spill was an environmental calamity and the fallout was immediate. The ash blanketed up to 400 acres killed hundreds of fish damaged more than a dozen homes and polluted nearby waterways. The clean-up took years and cost more than $1 billion.

Coal ash an umbrella term for the residue that’s left over when utilities burn coal is one of the United States’ largest kinds of industrial waste. It contains metals — such as lead mercury chromium selenium cadmium and arsenic — that never biodegrade. Studies have shown these contaminants are dangerous to humans and have linked some to cancer lung disease and birth defects.

For a time the Kingston incident catapulted coal ash into the public consciousness. But experts say it continues to pose a massive threat throughout the country.

About 400 miles southwest of Kingston a coal ash lagoon — which holds almost four times as much sludge as what spilled in Tennessee — is sitting in the Mobile–Tensaw Delta one of the most biodiverse areas of the United States with flora and fauna not known to exist anywhere else on Earth. Environmentalists community members and scientists fear the pond could someday unleash a Kingston-like catastrophe on southern Alabama and say leaving the coal ash in the delta is shortsighted and dangerous.

“We’ve got an A-bomb up the river” John Howard who lives in Mobile County and said he has been fishing in southern Alabama for decades said. “It’s just waiting to happen.”

‘Horror’ scene in Kingston

Most Americans had likely never heard of coal ash until three days before Christmas 2008 when the Kingston spill news broke.

Before the 1970s many utilities pumped their coal ash into the atmosphere attorney Lisa Evans who has focused on coal ash litigation for more than 20 years said. After Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1970 which regulated power plants’ air emissions some facilities began storing their coal ash in dirt ditches commonly known today as ash ponds or surface impoundments.

Hundreds of these sites now dot the country according to data that federal regulations require pond operators to publish and was compiled by Earthjustice a nonprofit that handles environmental lawsuits. Because coal plants produce electricity by converting large volumes of water into steam many of these waste sites are situated near river systems and flood zones. But 40 or fewer have a protective liner to contain the leftover ash and more than 200 have been shown to contaminate groundwater with toxic substances at levels that exceed federal safety standards the Earthjustice data shows.

With the Clean Air Act the nation traded one environmental problem for another Evans who works for Earthjustice said.

“One could see the billowing black smoke” Evans said. “You can’t see coal ash contaminating underlying groundwater (…) you can’t see the slow pollution of the adjacent river and the dying of the fish (…) It’s likely to be less dramatic.”

After 5.4 million cubic yards of coal ash spilled at the Kingston plant the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated the area as a Superfund site. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) which owned the plant spent more than $1 billion over six years to clean up the spill.

The aftermath “was like nothing I’ve ever seen before” Richard Moore who served as the inspector general for the TVA at the time said. “It was like a scene out of a horror movie.”

Tommy Johnson — like Bledsoe the worker who compared the Kingston spill to the moon’s surface — was at the facility that day. He spent six years working on the clean-up effort and said he believes exposure to the coal ash made him sick.

In 2018 Johnson joined more than 200 plaintiffs in suing Jacobs Engineering a TVA contractor hired to oversee the Kingston cleanup alleging Jacobs lied to workers about the ash’s toxicity. Bledsoe was also part of a suit which was filed in 2013. A jury eventually found that Jacobs failed to keep workers safe during the cleanup and that this failure could have caused the illnesses and injuries they suffered. The parties are now litigating over whether individual workers’ illnesses are a result of coal ash exposure.

“It’s (been) one ailment after another” Johnson said.

Today Johnson said he struggles to breathe and walk. Bledsoe according to court filings signed by his doctor suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease a disease that is typically caused by cigarette smoking. Bledsoe and his doctor have said he was never a smoker.

In a statement Jacobs spokesperson Heather Byrd told CNN the company “stands by its work assisting TVA with the difficult job of cleaning up the Kingston coal ash spill” adding that “the evidence will prove that the plaintiffs’ claimed conditions were not caused by exposure to coal ash at Kingston.”

TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks said in a statement that the utility has become an “industry leader in the safe secure management of coal ash.”

EPA’s ‘tipping point’

In response to the Kingston disaster the EPA set out to review the condition of more than 500 coal ash ponds across the United States.

“(Kingston) was almost a tipping point” Mathy Stanislaus who served as assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response from 2009 to 2017 said. “The reaction (at the EPA) was ‘We need to do something about this.’”

In 2015 the agency implemented its first-ever regulations on coal ash disposal forcing utilities across the country to begin closure and remediation of ponds that were unlined and contaminating groundwater above permitted levels.

The rule gives such ponds’ owners two closure options: seal the ash through a procedure known as capping-in-place or dig it up and move it to a lined landfill.

Depending on a pond’s size the EPA gave utilities between five and potentially 15 years to close them. In 2018 a federal court decision prompted the EPA to amend its rule. Today some utilities may have until 2036 to complete closure of certain ash ponds.

But environmental advocates say capping-in-place is not always an effective option especially for ponds where coal ash sits below the water table the point below which the ground is saturated with water because the cap does not prevent heavy metals from leaching into the surrounding area. They often point to a 2001 report by the Electric Power Research Institute in which researchers studied three unlined closed ponds and found that while groundwater quality improved at two it didn’t improve at the third where some ash sat below the water table.

Moreover they fear that as weather patterns become more extreme and less predictable leaving coal ash in an unlined pond is reckless because the potential for a catastrophic spill will always loom.

A nationwide challenge

There are an estimated 511 coal ash ponds in the United States according to a CNN analysis of the data compiled by Earthjustice. Nearly half — about 46% — are unlined and have been or will be closed in place. The utilities’ self-reported data shows around 160 are known to be contaminating groundwater but groundwater data gathered by the Environmental Integrity Project a nonprofit watchdog that advocates for better environmental law enforcement places that number at closer to 200. It’s unclear how many of those ponds sit below the water table or have direct contact with groundwater but around 60 sit in a flood zone.

Mapping coal ash ponds

Geologist Mark Hutson said that because the majority of the ponds are constructed along rivers — and typically in flood plains — many are likely to pollute the groundwater.

“The science points us clearly to excavation as the only way to protect public health and the environment” Michael Regan who ran North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality and now serves as EPA administrator said about ponds in that state in 2019.

In the 2015 rule the EPA declined to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste instead opting to regulate it as solid waste a category that can include everything from banana peels and candy wrappers to sewage and industrial sludge. That designation effectively allowed utilities to police themselves unless state regulators or private citizens which the law gives standing to seek enforcement through the courts intervened.

Stanislaus the former EPA assistant administrator said the agency declined to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste in part because business leaders raised concerns that doing so would hamstring their ability to recycle the substance which is frequently used in cement grout and other construction materials and because officials felt regulating coal ash as solid waste would still adequately prevent it from contaminating air and water.

That decision meant that initially states could regulate coal ash through existing water and waste programs. But it was a missed opportunity to enact stronger safeguards Dalal Aboulhosn the Sierra Club’s deputy director of policy advocacy and legal said.

“If EPA would have decided to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste we would have gotten the strictest of protections for communities” Aboulhosn said. “From cradle to grave we would be looking at coal ash as something that could harm communities and (making) sure it would be disposed of properly.”

In 2016 the federal government reclaimed some oversight when a new law authorized the EPA to review states’ programs for regulating pond closures. For states that didn’t develop their own programs the law required the EPA to develop one instead.

The EPA must still approve states’ programs but Evans said lax oversight and vague benchmarks — guidelines the agency published in 2017 say mainly that state programs must be “at least as protective as” federal regulations and should ensure public participation — have given states considerable leeway when regulating coal ash.

“The absence of (federal) requirements has left important criteria up in the air and fails to guarantee important safeguards nationally” Evans wrote in an email.

When President Joe Biden chose Regan to lead the EPA last December Evans hoped the pick would usher in more rigorous enforcement. Regan had firsthand experience with the consequences of coal ash pollution; In North Carolina he led the state’s department of environmental quality in the years following a spill.

In an interview with CNN last week Regan signaled the Biden EPA will indeed take a firmer stance on coal ash management.

While Regan did not provide specifics he said the agency is planning to announce details which he said could include additional regulatory actions soon. That announcement Regan said will give a “clearer picture of how the agency plans to move forward” nationwide.

“We’re pretty far down the road on this and we recognize the sense of urgency” Regan said.

Sources familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement is still being finalized told CNN they expect it to include decisions on a handful of applications for closure extensions at coal ash ponds across the country and notices to several facilities about compliance obligations.

In the meantime some state governments have taken it upon themselves and forced utilities to excavate their coal ash pits.

After a broken pipe unleashed more than 46000 cubic yards of coal ash from a retired power plant on the Dan River in 2014 near Eden North Carolina state officials enacted a law forcing the closure of all unlined coal ash ponds in the state ultimately requiring utilities to recycle the ash or put it in a lined landfill.

And in 2019 a Virginia law required Dominion Energy to excavate more than 27 million cubic yards of coal ash from ponds across the state.

But in other states including Alabama utilities still have the option to close ponds through cap-in-place.

‘We love our power company’

Standing behind the wheel of a motorboat in April Ben Raines a former newspaper journalist who offers tours of the Mobile–Tensaw Delta steered with the confidence of a man cruising across the Mediterranean on a yacht.

The Mobile–Tensaw Delta is part of the Mobile River Basin which drains most of Alabama’s water through the delta the Mobile Bay and into the Gulf of Mexico. It is one of the largest and most biodiverse river systems in North America; the region is home to at least 35 kinds of orchids and likely more turtle species than any other river system on Earth. At least 30 types of carnivorous plants live in the delta. Raines who has often referred to the delta as “America’s Amazon” points out one that eats insects.

Alabama’s ecosystems are particularly diverse because glaciers never covered the state during Earth’s last ice age unlike large swaths of what is now North America.

The delta is where Alabama Power’s James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant’s smokestacks tower above the treeline. Many refer to the plant named for the executive who led the utility from 1949 to 1952 as simply “Barry” or “Plant Barry.” It’s about 25 miles north of downtown Mobile sits on the Mobile River and forms a corridor of industrial facilities. At 597 acres Barry’s ash pond is nearly as large as the National Mall. A grassy berm dotted with yellow flowers lines the property’s edge and separates 21.7 million cubic yards of coal ash from the river.

“Coal ash is sitting there right on the edge of (the delta)” Raines said occasionally stopping his boat to pluck a plant from the water and marvel at it.

“If there were an accident (…) we would have lost you know one of America’s treasures and a treasure that people are only beginning to understand and explore.”

Alabama Power spent $30 million to construct Barry which opened in 1954. The plant was intended to meet the area’s rapidly expanding electricity needs. Mobile’s population exploded during World War II as the shipbuilding industry grew Mark VanLandingham a population studies professor at Tulane University said. Mobile was fairly developed by the 1950s; it had 17 movie theaters four hotels and two daily newspapers. The city which had about 174000 residents in 1956 was a manufacturing hub for pulp and paper products lumber and textiles. A guide to Mobile from 1957 boasted that the city was on its way to becoming one of the “great centers of trade and industry.”

But that didn't pan out. The city’s population peaked at roughly 200000 in 1960. As residents moved to suburbs and manufacturing began moving overseas Mobile’s population like many other post-industrial cities’ declined VanLandingham said.

As of 2019 census estimates showed the city of Mobile was home to almost 189000 people. About 18% of the city’s residents lived in poverty. That share was higher — about 21% — for Black Mobilians who made up more than half the city’s population.

With about 6000 employees Alabama Power is a major employer in the state. It provides energy to roughly 100000 customers in the city of Mobile. Its corporate parent Southern Company owns electric utilities in Georgia and Mississippi and is the third largest electric utility company in the country by market value.

In a state where storms are commonplace “the most important person who shows up at our door after a hurricane is the Alabama Power guy who has just turned our lights back on” said Casi Callaway who grew up in Mobile and spent 23 years as the executive director of Mobile Baykeeper an environmental nonprofit that aims to protect southern Alabama’s waters.

“We love our power company” she said.

Alabama Power’s choice

Alabama Power is poised to close the Barry pond through capping-in-place. Its process according to the closure plan filed with state environmental regulators last year would remove water from the pond to shrink its footprint by nearly half before filling the perimeter with soil and sealing the ash with a cover made from plastic crushed rock and artificial turf that the company has said is designed to “virtually eliminate infiltration of surface water.”

Records show the site has been contaminating groundwater for years. In its most recent groundwater monitoring report from 2020 Alabama Power revealed elevated levels of arsenic and cobalt near the Barry plant that exceeded groundwater protection standards by more than eight times and more than five times respectively. In 2018 state officials fined the company $250000 for arsenic pollution saying the company had “caused or allowed the unpermitted discharge of pollutants associated with ash pond wastewater from the Plant Barry Ash Pond to waters of the State.”

In a document filed with the state’s utility regulator last month company officials acknowledged environmental groups’ concerns about the cap-in-place method’s effectiveness toward protecting groundwater and that “the risk of an adverse outcome remains” but wrote the company believes its plans for Barry’s ash pond and about 10 other coal waste sites in the state meet federal requirements and that requiring full ash removal would “dramatically” increase costs and “adversely impact” nearby residents’ quality of life through “decades of constant truck traffic.”

“It’s about the money” Moore the former TVA inspector general who now lives near Barry in Baldwin County said. “I believe the corporate culture and the corporate mindset at most utilities is the same way: If they can do it on the cheap that's what they're going to do.”

Alabama Power has estimated that it will spend about $860 million to close the Barry ash pond by capping it in place and an additional $36 million for post-closure maintenance according to its closure plan. Jack Bonnikson a company spokesperson declined to say what the company estimated excavation would cost.

But no excavation cost would compare to cleaning up a spill Evans the environmental attorney said.

“It is infinitely cheaper to scoop ash out of a pond and truck it to a lined landfill than to excavate it out of a river and out of people’s yards” she said.

Frank Holleman a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) who has litigated against utilities over coal ash contamination for over a decade said utilities often misrepresent how much each method will cost.

“As a general rule they overstate the cost of excavation and they understate the cost of cap-in-place” Holleman said.

In addition Holleman said utilities often prefer capping-in-place to avoid the “managerial hassle” of transporting coal ash.

In written responses to CNN Bonnikson challenged Holleman’s claim. He said cost estimates often change as work on a project progresses and that the engineers and geologists who develop cost estimates are expected to adhere to professional standards.

Closing these ponds has sometimes come at a high price for utilities though often their customers are footing large shares of the bill.

Duke Energy for example has estimated it will spend $8 billion to $9 billion to comply with North Carolina’s law and excavate 31 ponds in that state in addition to four in South Carolina.

Bill Norton a spokesperson for Duke Energy couldn’t say how much of that total pertained to the North Carolina ponds. But he said it made up “the vast majority” of the multibillion-dollar estimate and that about $3.8 billion — or at least 40% — will be passed on to North Carolina retail customers.

But customers’ payments aren’t just going toward the cost of pond closures. They’re also lining shareholders’ pockets.

Because many utilities operate as natural monopolies where state regulators control prices the companies’ profits often depend on how well they control costs. In 1923 the US Supreme Court ruled that to ensure that utilities remain financially sound and can continue to provide services they should be entitled to recoup the costs of certain investments and profit from them.

Utility regulators and courts are supposed to make sure such investments are reasonable and necessary and that the costs passed onto customers are appropriate.

But Dave Rogers a deputy director at the Sierra Club said they are often politicized and customers don’t always get “a fair shake.” Jim Lazar a former senior adviser at the Regulatory Assistance Project said the result is that today’s customers end up paying for earlier generations’ mistakes.

It’s unclear how much Alabama Power stands to profit from the Barry closure. Bonnikson declined to provide a figure but a recent filing with the state’s public service commission outlined financial information related to how the company will comply with government mandates next year.

Anna Sommer a consultant at Energy Futures Group who has advised groups working toward improving Alabama’s public utility regulation process reviewed the filing for CNN and estimated that the utility would likely return around $200 million to shareholders in the coming years as a result of the Barry pond closure. Sommer’s assessment was reviewed by two ratemaking experts for CNN: Lazar and Stephen Hill an independent consultant who has provided expert testimony in ratemaking cases.

Debating Alabama Power’s plan

In an email Bonnikson said the utility’s annual filings “transparently provided estimated costs for compliance and associated rate calculations.” He declined to comment on Sommer’s estimate saying only that the utility “will not validate estimates or calculations (CNN) may have received from a third-party group.”

In March community members environmentalists and coal industry advocates gathered at a Hampton Inn in Saraland a Mobile suburb near Plant Barry for a public hearing to comment on Alabama Power’s closure plan.

Some speakers including Jonathan Hale who runs an Alabama-based mining company supported the utility’s plan. Hale said he was concerned that transporting the waste to a landfill could lead to ash spills on roads and put unnecessary wear and tear on Alabama’s highways.

Many speakers opposed Alabama Power’s plan. One woman became emotional as she recounted learning there was an unlined coal ash pond near her home. A man compared the Barry pond to a rotting tooth that needs to be taken out a cancerous skin lesion that should be removed and mold growing on drywall that needs to be gutted and replaced.

Nicholas Williams a 29-year-old sales and support representative for a small online hunting gear retailer stood at the microphone in a T-shirt and baseball cap.

“Twenty years I’ve been poking around up there looking for deer and hogs and ducks and big ol’ flatheads” Williams said. “Looking for game but also looking for the peace that a vast mass of calm waters and cypress trees brings. Looking for a sense of being and perspective that you find when you stand on top of the Indian mounds (…) and realize that you’re really very small in the grand scheme of things.”

For Williams being in the delta is a way of life. He and his wife Sarah bought a home perched on Tensaw Lake a tributary in the delta three years ago. The couple have chickens in their front yard — the rooster is named Sue after the Johnny Cash song — and a collection of birds Nicholas has killed is mounted on their living room wall. He said he worries that a spill at Barry could destroy the delta that he hopes to one day share with his children.

“I believe leaving the coal ash pond in place is taking a chance with something that should not be left to chance” he said. “We don’t have to jeopardize the Mobile–Tensaw Delta.”

While state regulators approved Alabama Power’s plans for the Barry pond in July EPA Administrator Regan told CNN last month that his agency is “actively investigating (…) the Plant Barry situation.”

“We understand the concerns about this facility in Alabama” Regan said. “The last administration’s leadership failed to act on these concerns. This administration will act to protect communities and based on my prior experience if there is coal ash in contact with groundwater that’s putting the health and safety of communities at risk and requires our attention.”

‘Nothing God can do’

When Hurricane Ida approached the Gulf Coast in late August Cade Kistler and the Mobile Baykeeper staff prepared for the worst.

At their downtown Mobile office they put trash bags over computers and moved them away from windows. They prepared their boat and test tubes to take water samples from the river and check for coal ash. Kistler Baykeeper’s interim director made sure his family had enough food in case the power at their home went out.

After the storm made landfall in Louisiana Kistler drove to Barry to look for signs of damage.

He put a chainsaw in the back of his Subaru in case he needed to cut through fallen trees. The rain was still heavy he said recalling how his car shook from the wind as he crossed Mobile Bay on the highway. Kistler who remembered feeling cautiously optimistic because Ida didn’t directly hit the area said he didn’t see any signs indicating a disaster had struck Barry.

Meanwhile Ida was carving a path of destruction across the country killing at least 80 people across eight states. By any measure it was one of the strongest tropical storms to ever hit Louisiana.

“We got off really light” Kistler said. “It really is just a matter of when a similar storm (…) hits coastal Alabama.”

When Kistler and his staff learn a hurricane has formed in the Gulf they worry about two disaster scenarios at Barry: its dam collapsing or that river water will overtop the dam sending coal ash surging into the delta.

A coal ash spill wouldn’t be southern Alabama’s first brush with environmental disaster. In 2010 an explosion on a British Petroleum (BP) oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers and set off a domino effect that caused oil and natural gas to leak into the Gulf for nearly three months.

The Gulf is still recovering from the calamity which the EPA has called the largest marine drilling-related oil spill in history. As of 2018 researchers were still detecting oil contamination in thousands of fish in the Gulf of Mexico according to one study.

“You couldn't walk on the beach” Mobile resident Madelyn King said. “There were tarballs washing up all the time.”

The BP spill hobbled leisure tourism in the region. Visitor spending in Louisiana dropped by $247 million in 2010 according to a report prepared for the state’s tourism agency by Tourism Economics a consulting firm that analyzes global travel data.

Callaway who was leading Mobile Baykeeper at the time (she left Baykeeper for a job as Mobile’s chief resilience officer in May) said southern Alabama dodged a bullet.

“The power of the Mobile River and the delta pushing water out of the bay made sure we didn't have much oil come into the bay” Callaway said. “If something happens with the coal ash pit there’s no natural protection. There’s nothing God can do to protect us from that.”

If the Barry pond were breached the volume of slurry could eclipse the amount of oil that spilled into the Gulf during the BP disaster.

“They would be dealing with that for God-knows-how-many years“ Keith Johnston an attorney for the SELC said. “It would be devastating for the city of Mobile and the bay. A lot of people rely on that bay for their livelihood.”

When an environmental disaster strikes Black and Brown communities often suffer the worst consequences Aboulhosn the Sierra Club deputy director said.

“Across the board communities that are people of color that don't have the socioeconomic levels of some predominantly White communities are the ones that are shouldering this burden” she said.

Joe Womack who grew up in Mobile runs an environmental advocacy organization in the city’s Africatown neighborhood a historic Black community that is choked by highways and industrial facilities. He said he worries Africatown where residents still talk about the ash from a nearby paper mill that would rain down on the community years ago would continue to bear the brunt of industrial pollution and its consequences.

For “folks that are at the bottom end of the totem pole” Womack said “(it’s) just like anything else: You see things happen to you more in a negative sense.”

“The thing with Barry” he said is “just more of the same.”

In his remarks to CNN last week EPA administrator Regan — the first Black man and second person of color to hold the position — called environmental justice and equity “a pillar” for the administration.

“What we’re saying is ‘We see you we hear you and we’re responding’” Regan said. “Too often whether it’s the coal ash pond or a chemical refinery or a landfill our communities are disproportionately impacted by exposure to pollution.”

The SELC and Mobile Baykeeper have called on Alabama Power to change tack and excavate the pond. The organizations argue the utility’s plan will allow groundwater contamination to continue and that the potential for a disaster will remain if the coal ash is not removed.

Bonnikson declined to say whether the utility has studied how far coal ash might travel if its dam was breached but told CNN in an email that the company’s “structural stability analysis and regular inspections demonstrate the dikes are safe and secure and continue to function as designed.”

In 2010 engineers — hired by the EPA to conduct Barry’s dam safety assessment as part of the national review launched following the Kingston spill — determined that Barry’s dam was in “satisfactory” condition but had a “significant” hazard potential because a failure could cause major damage to the environment wildlife and habitat if coal ash were released into the river.

Alabama Power has modeled potential flooding in the area with the help of third-party experts but Bonnikson declined to provide CNN with the data used to run the model. In an email he wrote that the experts’ models for “extreme river and tropical flood events (showed) no overtopping of the ash pond’s existing dike wall” and that “Even a 500-year tropical flood with an additional 5 feet of storm surge showed no impact on Plant Barry or its ash pond.”

“Since 1965 15 different tropical storms and hurricanes have passed within 50 miles of the plant site with no impact to plant operations or the ash pond” Bonnikson wrote.

Storm path data from 1980 to 2020 shows that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico aren’t necessarily becoming more frequent and an analysis of synthetic aperture radar data which can be used to track how water saturates land showed no notable flooding near Barry after heavy rainfall. A predictive analysis of flood gauge data at Barry didn’t suggest large deviations from the norm in the coming years.

There is some evidence that more storms are reaching a higher intensity although there’s some indication that the frequency of storms may be going down Michael Bell an atmospheric science professor at Colorado State University said. In 2020 for example researchers at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and NOAA looked at nearly 40 years of data and found the probability of storms reaching major hurricane status — Category 3 or higher — increased decade after decade.

Sean Powers a marine scientist and professor at the University of South Alabama said changing weather patterns are his biggest concern about the Barry ash pond.

“Everything now is based on our understanding of the risk that exists now” Powers said.

“Obviously sea level will rise” he said. “Storms will increase at least in intensity if not frequency and all of those pose serious risk for the release of that material.”

While environmentalists keep an eye out for the next Ida some scientists say a less visible and more insidious crisis is already underway.

“Eventually (a disaster) is going to happen” geologist Mark Hutson whom the SELC hired to review Alabama Power’s closure plan for the Barry pond last year said. “In the meantime there will be decades of slow release of metals into the swampy areas.”

In his report for the SELC Hutson concluded that to effectively close any coal ash storage site the waste must be permanently isolated from water including groundwater and that the Barry pond’s location — on a meandering river system’s floodplain — was an unsuitable place to permanently store waste.

“No (new) waste disposal facility” he determined “would be permitted in this physical location.”",,,,,,,,,

Du Pont's lawyer is putting together a very strong case against rapper Jub Jub as more victims stepped forward.

Amanda Du Pont’s lawyer confirmed the former Skeem Saam actress would be opening a rape case against rapper Jub Jub (Molemo Maarohanye).

Earlier this week du-Pont posted a heartrending video on Instagram and urged other victims to speak out against Jub Jub and more women have since stepped forward.

Amanda Du Pont speaks out

Rape not ‘smash’

The video was in reaction to Jub Jub boasting on Podcast and Chill how he “smashed” Du Point and later cheated on her with Kelly Khumalo.

Du Point hit back by saying he didn’t “smash” her he physically abused and repeatedly raped her during their two-year relationship.

She said her only crime at the time was to “brush this under the carpet and not say anything for so long” but that’s about change.

Du Pont to file rape charges

As reported by The Sunday Times Du Pont’s lawyer Tony Mathe said the actress “is prepared to take this matter forward and to have the perpetrator account for what he has done”.

“We can confirm that having consulted with our client there will be a case open soon enough. We can’t give the specific date at this current time but we can confirm that a case will be opened”.

“Currently we can confirm that the main charge that we will be pursuing is the charge of rape. It will be upon the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to add other charges should they see fit”.

More rape allegations against Jub Jub

Mathe said the legal team is “putting together a very strong case [and] considering various factors” to ensure the case isn’t compromised.

Three other women reached out to Mathe seeking legal assistance to file rape allegations against Jub Jub

“They are all saying Jub Jub raped them” Mathe said.

Du Pont and Jub Jub’s relationship

Questions mounted as to why Du Pont stayed for so long despite the actress explaining she had feared for her life if she left the abusive relationship. In her video she explained:

“I left you because you tried to kill me. You literally suffocated me.”

Du Pont said she also had an “abortion because of course there is no way I would have a child that was forcefully given to me”.

Back then she also tried to lay a charge at the police station but the officer did not assist her because “too many women go back to their abuser”.

As reported by The Citizen earlier this week the case has led to growing calls for our justice system to support and listen to victims.

Cassper Nyovest shines spotlight on abuse amid Jub Jub's serious accusations

Earlier Briefly News reported that Cassper Nyovest has placed a spotlight on abuse amid serious accusations levelled against Jub Jub. Two of the Uyajola 9/9 presenter's ex-girlfriends have accused him of raping them when they were still young.

Mufasa took to social media to respond to a tweep who asked him if he has abused any of his former baes including Boity. The Siyathandana hitmaker made it clear that he's against GBV.

Masechaba Ndlovu also accuses Jub Jub of sexual abuse

In related news Briefly News reported that Masechaba Ndlovu has also taken to social media to accuse Jub Jub of sexually assaulting her when she was still a teenager. The radio host alleged that the Uyajola 9/9 presenter raped her at Mama Jackie's house in Naturena some years backs.

The stunner said she was still a virgin at the time the rapper allegedly forced himself on her. Masechaba was reacting to actress Amanda Du Pont's tweet about her relationship with Jub Jub. Amanda also shared that the star allegedly raped her.

Taking to Twitter Masechaba said she believes Amanda's story because the same thing apparently happened to her. Tweeps shared mixed reactions to Masechaba's revelations.

News from Jub Jub’s closet continue to overwhelm Mzansi ever since Amanda du Pont accused him of rape.

Social media users had taken sides with some crying out for justice for the alleged victims and some demanding that Jub Jub be given the chance to tell his side of the story.

As the drama continues Jub Jub has revealed that he’s laying charges of crimen injuria and defamation of character against Amanda du Pont Masechaba Khumalo and Refilwe Khumalo.

The rapper who has since been suspended by Moja Love TV has issued a statement through the family’s spokesperson Andile Ngcobo.

Sunday World reports that the statement reads:

“It is unfortunate that these heavy allegations are false and fake.” “As a family we met Amanda du Pont when our son introduced her to us we accepted her as one of our own.”

The statement adds that Du Pont also introduced Jub Jub to her father when they were dating and that they had mutual respect and understanding love and support.

“The claims and serious allegations by Ms Du Pont were clearly concocted to injure and defame our son’s name which he is working hard to safeguard.”

In the same statement Jub Jub also dismissed claims that he raped Masechaba Khumalo at his mother’s house and says Khumalo made a move on him before he turned her down.

“He will be opening a case of crimen injuria and defamation against Amanda du Pont Masechaba Khumalo Bonokuhle Nkala and Refilwe Khumalo.

They have been pulled in to campaign against our son by Amanda du Pont on her social media page. Molemo our son and his management team will not leave the claims unattended.”

There was once a time not that long ago that you could hear the roar of engines echoing around the east of Long Eaton.

That sound would have been coming from Long Eaton Stadium - a motorsports and greyhound racing track with more than a hundred years of history in the area.

However a catastrophic fire tore through the popular speedway venue in 1998 spelling the end for the stadium.

After nearly two decades of dereliction the shell of the track was demolished. Today it's a housing development ringed with roads that call back to its past like Speedway Close and Circuit Drive.

The stadium was the home of the Long Eaton Invaders - older fans might remember them as the Archers Rangers or Outlaws - who had to leave the stadium before the fire in 1998.

EBAY,eBay,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8wNC9pbnZlc3RpbmcvZWJheS1zdG9jay1qYW1pZS1pYW5ub25lL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUVodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzEyLzA0L2ludmVzdGluZy9lYmF5LXN0b2NrLWphbWllLWlhbm5vbmU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How eBay's new CEO turned it into a pandemic winner,"New York CNN Business —

When PayPal split off from eBay a few years ago eBay was considered to be the less exciting company. But that’s certainly not the case on Wall Street this year.

Shares of eBay (EBAY) have surged more than 30% this year while PayPal (PYPL) has stumbled more than 20%.

The companies have had a wildly different 2021. PayPal which now lets people buy and sell bitcoin has been subject to the volatility in the cryptocurrency market and concerns about its rumored plan to offer to buy Pinterest (PINS) though PayPal later said no deal was happening.

Ebay by contrast has made a big comeback during the pandemic thanks to bets on several rapidly growing parts of the digital commerce market — namely sneakers sports memorabilia and car parts.

CNN Business spoke to eBay CEO Jamie Iannone who rejoined eBay in April 2020 about the firm’s transformation into an enthusiast-focused retailer.

“This is part of a multi-year reimagining of eBay. These categories we’re focusing on are huge” said Iannone who was an executive at Barnes & Noble and Walmart (WMT) before returning to eBay where he worked for most of the 2000s.

Focusing more on the repeat power buyers

Iannone has helped push eBay into markets where buyers are willing to spend lots of money numerous times a year. Wall Street likes that.

Shares of eBay are up more than 70% since Iannone came back to the company. That’s better than the gains for PayPal and the broader market during the same time frame. The pivot to collectibles that have passionate younger buyers has been a big win for the company.

Iannone said eBay realizes there is a big difference between its casual shoppers and its so-called power buyers who make purchases of nearly $1000 multiple times a year.

That audience is where eBay is now putting much of its attention Iannone said because it makes more sense to cater to the loyalists instead of spending a lot more money on marketing and advertising just to increase the general user base.

“Some of the [power buyers] wake up get a cup of coffee and turn to eBay” Iannone said. “We were too focused on acquiring buyers and getting them at any costs. We’re leaning in now on the enthusiasts.”

As a result of this new focus Iannone said eBay made more money selling trading cards in the second quarter of this year than it did in that category in all of 2020 for example.

The ‘accidental entrepreneurs’ give eBay a boost

Iannone said he loves meeting with people who have set up stores on eBay and now make their living from it. That includes someone who was laid off by the Orlando Magic basketball team during the 2020 shutdown of the NBA season and now sells sneakers full-time on eBay. It’s been a common story during the pandemic he said as many people left the traditional workforce.

“These are the accidental entrepreneurs” Iannone said adding that while most people on the platform say they start selling on eBay to boost their income nearly 15% are doing so because they have lost a job.

The company is also leveraging the power of social media and the influencer community -— including a sneaker marketing campaign on TikTok.

The company has increased efforts to authenticate the value of items like shoes baseball cards and musical instruments. For example eBay just acquired sneaker authentication service Sneaker Con. It’s also tracking the value of trading cards in real time like stocks. (And Iannone himself recently bought a “barely used” oboe for his daughter on eBay.)

“Ebay has been a pioneer of collectibles exchanges and re-commerce” Iannone said. “We’re leaning into that. It’s all about regaining trust on the platform.”

Motor vehicle accessories are the next big area of focus for eBay he said adding that when he needed a part for a windshield he found a perfect fit on eBay for $9 that probably would have cost $40 at the auto dealership.

Buy now and pay later — but not with bitcoin

The company is also embracing more modern forms of payment to continue attracting younger millennial and Gen Z customers.

EBay now accepts Apple Pay and Google Pay and it’s experimenting with the “buy now pay later” (BNPL) trend in the form of a partnership in Australia with Afterpay (which Square (SQ) is in the process of buying for nearly $30 billion).

“This does help attract newer customers to the platform. People like to use it for high-priced items” Iannone said. “BNPL is bringing in a younger demographic.”

But one trend eBay isn’t embracing just yet is bitcoin. Given the volatility in cryptocurrencies Iannone said the company will not be accepting any of them as payment “for the foreseeable future.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzUvMjI4MTg1ODgvZWJheS1zdXNwZW5kZWQtdXNlcnMtZ2xpdGNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,eBay accidentally suspended 'a small number' of users,"eBay inadvertently suspended an unspecified number of users on December 3rd. The platform has since acknowledged the incident noting that users who were accidentally suspended have received a notification so they can resolve the issue.

Users across social media began reporting that they’ve been suspended from eBay on Friday despite not knowingly breaking any rules on the platform. An entire Reddit thread on r/ebay is dedicated to the issue and although the original post has since been deleted dozens of other users have added their own experiences to the thread. One user describes their own account of the situation much of which is echoed by other comments:

Suspended tonight with no chance of appeal did an online chat and the woman just told me it wouldn’t be discussed and then cut me off. Member since 1999 100% positive haven’t sold anything for years no disputes have bought 5 small items over the last month with no issues.

Other users claim that eBay canceled their bids on products that they’ve already purchased and received some of which were “Buy It Now” items which users can buy outright. As for the justification for these bans users say they got an email from the company saying that they put “the eBay community at risk.” Some users allege that when they contacted eBay’s customer service about it their bans were upheld and no further information was given to them.

Outside of Reddit users across Twitter also complained of the seemingly random suspensions that took place on the 3rd. The next day eBay responded to some of the reports noting that users can DM the @AskeBay Twitter account with their information to sort out the issue.

“On December 3rd a small number of eBay accounts were inadvertently suspended” said eBay spokesperson Trina Somera in a statement to The Verge. “The issue has been resolved and any users who need to take action have been notified. We regret any concern this may have caused.”

Although eBay has acknowledged the issue we still don’t know how many users were accidentally suspended as well as why this occurred. However we can speculate that the mass suspensions might’ve been caused by some kind of error with eBay’s algorithm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2NvbGxlY3RvcnNkYWlseS5jb20vZGFubnktYW1lbmRvbGEtdGFsa3MtZWJheS1wb3AtdXAtc2hvcC1qZXJzZXktc3dhcHMtaGlzLWxhdGVzdC1idXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Danny Amendola Talks eBay Pop Up Shop Jersey Swaps His Latest Buy,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/danny-amendola-talks-ebay-pop-up-shop-jersey-swaps-his-latest-buy/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2NvbGxlY3RvcnNkYWlseS5jb20vZGFubnktYW1lbmRvbGEtdGFsa3MtZWJheS1wb3AtdXAtc2hvcC1qZXJzZXktc3dhcHMtaGlzLWxhdGVzdC1idXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzA0L2FnbS1ydWdnZWQtcGhvbmVzLWF2YWlsYWJsZS13aXRoLW5pY2UtZGlzY291bnRzLW9uLWViYXkv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2l6Y2hpbmEuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMDQvYWdtLXJ1Z2dlZC1waG9uZXMtYXZhaWxhYmxlLXdpdGgtbmljZS1kaXNjb3VudHMtb24tZWJheS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AGM rugged phones available with nice discounts on Ebay,"The AGM brand focuses on rugged phones and is without a question one of the top names in this category.

While the game suffered a rocky technical launch the rumor is that the game has still sold well and the developer has done a lot of updating already to put things up to snuff. Even though we aren’t far removed from 2042 we already are getting rumors about what the next game will look like and it’s looking to be a very different experience.

Leaker Tom Henderson who has leaked a wealth of information about the series has said the next Battlefield title will be a “hero shooter” presumably in the vein of something like Overwatch or Apex Legends and will have a battle royale mode. He says that 2042 and its specialist system was meant to be something of a stepping stone to this hero shooter structure. Henderson does say that plans could change as 2042 went through several changes itself before release but he seems pretty convinced this will be the direction for this new title.

We know that EA is looking to expand Battlefield with a recent report about the new multi-studio approach to the franchise. We’ll have to see what the future holds. As of now Battlefield 2042 is now available on PC and consoles.

The next Battlefield title is scoped as a hero shooter of sorts – It's not a removal of specialists but an enhancement of them. #Battlefield2042 has always been intended to be a stepping stone to a ""hero shooter"" with a Battle Royale – It was just executed poorly. — Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) December 3 2021",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydWVhY2hpZXZlbWVudHMuY29tL240ODAwOC9maWZhLTIyLWZ1dC11bHRpbWF0ZS10ZWFtLWluLWZvcm1zLXNiYy1vYmplY3RpdmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIFA 22 Locker Room: What's new in Ultimate Team this week? (December 4th),"Our Pick: Laborde (85 — ST — Stade Rennais F.C.)

It's the TOTW 11 and it is jam-packed with good cards. Van Dijk headlines with a striker-destroying 90-rated card in his native centre-back role. De Jong has an 88-rated card in CM which is deliciously flexible. The main issue with the Dutch international's card is that Atlético Madrid's Llorente exists with an even more well-rounded set of numbers. Speaking of the Atléti man his teammate Antoine Griezmann has made it to the TOTW in ST with an 86-rated card. It's good no doubt but it's just a bit. Shout out to the Feature Player this week — that is the one with the star — Bakayo Saka of Arsenal. What a sensational player. A nifty card too as he rocks an 85-rated double-upgraded item. These are some solid if unspectacular numbers but I know a few of you will not care about that one iota.Well it wasn't an ideal pick. The Leverkusen winger Diaby nearly got in here but the issue is that the French starlet already has better cards that are in the reasonable price range. Laborde is worth a look if you are building a French team though. It's his all-around 80's that really help you because you can mould the 5'11 frontman to your needs. He has a strong-weak foot at four stars so just apply a Deadeye chemistry style and you are good to go with a 92-rated card! The great thing? He is valued at 15k. That is a bargain that will help you invest in every other part of the pitch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbW9hb2JzZXJ2ZXIud3MvY2F0ZWdvcnkvYXJ0aWNsZS85NTUyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experience Edge of Your Seat Gameplay Create Spectacular Multi-class Cross-Platform Races and Live Your ...,"REDWOOD CITY Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec 3 2021--

Bloomberg News reported previously that the buyout firm has been informally discussing the idea of an IPO after the successful listings of Bridgepoint Group Plc and EQT AB though no decision has been made people familiar with the matter said at the time.

CVC has not mandated any banks and is not actively preparing a listing people familiar told Bloomberg News on Saturday. The firm continues to discuss internally the option of a listing and several banks have approached the firm with proposals but nothing has been decided the people said.

The buyout firm agreed in September to acquire secondary buyout specialist Glendower Capital and also lined up a minority stake sale to Blue Owl Capital Inc. at a $15 billion valuation. The fresh investor and acquisition were seen as CVC paving the way for a future IPO the people said.

Representatives for CVC and Goldman Sachs declined to comment on a potential IPO or mandates.

Established in 1981 as the European venture capital arm of New York-based banking giant Citicorp CVC describes itself as a private equity and credit firm with $125 billion of assets under management. Its investments in the past decade have ranged from Asian hospitals and European betting operations to a US pet supplier.

With Covid-19 crushing the finances of live sporting events CVC has moved heavily into seeking deals in cricket rugby volleyball tennis basketball and European football.

The firm tried and failed to strike deals with Italy’s Serie A and Germany’s Bundesliga the top football leagues in those countries. But its €2 billion injection into Spain's top two divisions in return for a long-term share of broadcasting revenues appears headed toward an approval vote on Friday despite opposition from the two largest and richest clubs.

In October CVC won an auction to buy one of two new franchises in India's Twenty20 cricket contest for €658 million. It followed that with agreeing to pay Unilever €4.5 billion for its tea division which includes the PG Tips and Lipton brands.

Governmental officials are tackling this issue by increasing rent-control efforts nationwide. This goal will impact the number of private equity landlords operating in Spain and address Spain’s housing crisis.

What are Private Equity Companies and Landlords?

Private equity companies more commonly referred to as private equity firms (PEFs) are designed strictly for investment management. PEFs are companies investing in other companies. PEFs strictly buy and sell stocks in private companies on other private corporations’ behalfs to generate income and revenue from the sales of stocks. PEF investments are not made in the public market but rather in private firms to potentially increase the amount of money made as a return on investment.

Private equity landlords are corporate landlords that PEFs invest in. This places additional pressure on landlords to make a profit and increase returns for PEFs. Therefore on top of the money earned in rental prices and the fees incurred through home management as part of rentals there is a cycle of continuously increasing rents to make more money for PEFs.

Housing Crisis in Spain

Spain’s housing crisis has been an issue since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The changes it has undergone include drastic rent hikes and lack of home availability in certain regions. The main reason is that many did not feel safe living in congested cities and have attempted to vacate the cities and buy or find home rentals elsewhere.

Spanish citizens have struggled to find affordable housing in a nation with 21% of the population at risk of poverty as of 2020. Furthermore roughly 7% of Spanish families live in severe poverty according to El Pais.

To top everything off the hike in rental prices averages 50% over five years. However prices exceeded a 60% jump between 2014-2017 in Madrid and Barcelona. Comparatively wages in Spain have increased by 1.6% on average. This is driving income inequality and presenting challenges in affording and maintaining rental housing. Housing in Spain has become a burden for many due to the influence of private equity companies on rental prices.

During the pandemic with the lack of growth in wages nationwide and increased hikes in rental costs Spanish law mandated that no evictions could take place. Nevertheless in some areas such as Ciutat Mediriana evictions continued. Spain’s housing crisis left people on the street with no way to access affordable housing.

Private Equity Landlords in Spain

Blackstone a PEF based in the United States has investments in 30000 homes across Spain. Blackstone opened housing rental investment opportunities in Spain in 2013. It has not slowed its increases in Spanish housing rental prices since. The return on investments for Blackstone in Spain hit all-time highs for the PEF as it has increased rent prices year after year. The significant returns for Blackstone due to the increased rent prices are costing individuals more than 30% of their income.

Spain’s housing crisis does not have an overnight solution. However the bill that Spain’s left-leaning officials proposed could fix the problem to some extent. According to Euronews if Spain implements the bill it will place rental price caps on any rental company with more than 10 rental homes effectively strengthening rent control.

About Rent Control

Rent control boosts the economy because it diversifies investments in the public and private sectors. Spain’s housing crisis leaves little opportunity for spending money outside of rental affordability. This leaves other economic sectors falling behind and losing strength over time.

Rent control helps individuals living in lower-income situations keep their housing for longer and more secure periods of time. Landlords are also guaranteed filled buildings when rent prices do not increase and overburden their tenants. Rent control reduces homelessness and evictions consequently keeping people in their homes and effectively reducing poverty rates.

The bill that the Spanish government proposed to cap rent price increases also benefits the landlords through reduced taxation giving them the incentive to support the rental caps. This bill could mean diversification of businesses and enhanced opportunities for localized businesses or landlords to combat the PEFs and boost the local economy.

The PEFs in Spain drove rental prices beyond easy affordability for many. Spain’s housing crisis is out of control as a result. This bill could reduce homelessness and poverty. It could boost the economy through localized diversification of business and investments and give Spanish citizens chances to find new homes.

ETSY,Etsy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbWVzYW5kZ2FyZGVucy5jb20vbmV3cy9ldHN5LWNvbG9yLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLTIwMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Revealed: Etsy's Color of the Year 2022,"Looking for a new year refresh? Etsy’s Color of the Year 2022 is the place to begin. The e-commerce company has forecast that Emerald Green will continue its interior design domination throughout 2022 – so you can paint in confidence.

How can you be sure that the power of Emerald Green will prevail? While this tone has already influenced interior design trends over recent months Etsy reveals that its appeal shows no sign of slowing down.

‘Symbolizing harmony and growth along with royalty and refinement emerald green is the perfect color to remind us to find balance this year’ explains Etsy’s Trend Expert Dayna Isom Johnson. With this in mind the site recently observed a surge in searches for emerald green items (up 64%) whilst searches for emerald green decor also rose by up 60%.

According to Dayna the craving for a balanced life remains a priority as we conclude another year 'filled with ups and downs'. The color perfectly embodies the concept of ‘Lagom’ – which Danya explains ‘ translates to ‘not too much not too little’ or ‘just the right amount.’

‘I anticipate shoppers will embrace Lagom as they look to live their lives with balance and moderation in mind’ she adds.

Plus there is a reason why this therapeutic yet rich shade is set to remain at the peak of paint trends for 2022. While emerald green makes a statement when standing alone it similarly works alongside a range of varying colorways.

From ‘earthy terracottas and neutrals’ to ‘luxe golds and silvers’ Dayna emphasizes the colors range – before adding that it is ‘easy to add into existing decor.’ And beyond the paint world emerald green will continue to enrich other areas of the home.

For a stylish starting point Dayna recommends investing in an emerald knot floor cushion that celebrates Etsy’s color of the year in all its glory. For a subtler alternative she also suggests the Esme Hexy ring dish or these vintage tumblers that will complement your tablescape in the year ahead.

Our choice of colour palette will become more confident as we experience new feelings of hope and positivity for the future and according to recent research we will find happiness and fulfilment in rolling up our sleeves and tackling DIY home projects.

Below design experts weigh in on the top interior design trends for 2022.



1. Statement lighting

Form matches (or surpasses) function in 2022 as we see a reframing of lighting as decorative objects.

Dayna Isom Johnson 's Trend Expert says: 'Equal parts functional and fashionable statement lighting allows folks to spotlight their beautiful homes while doubling as eye-catching artwork. Many are already on the hunt for statement lighting – from sculptural pendants to standout sconces – that reflects their own personal style. On Etsy we’ve seen a 344 per cent increase in searches for 70s lighting a 27 per cent increase in searches for sculptural or decorative lighting a 25 per cent increase in searches for vintage lighting and a 22 per cent increase in searches for colourful lighting.'

2. Sleep sanctuary

Bedrooms have had to work harder than ever over the last 18 months for many of us doubling up as home offices as we navigate working from home. For 2022 there's a desire for the bedroom to return to a calm peaceful sanctuary to retreat to.

Amy Wilson Interior Designer for and 247 Curtains says: 'For a lot of people 2022 is the time to reclaim your bedroom as the sanctuary it should be. Bedrooms are a place of rest and recuperation so focus will be on mood lighting soothing colour palettes and layers of comforting textures.'

Designing a space conducive to quality sleep will be paramount. 'There will be a move towards simplifying the bedroom removing clutter and distractions and instead creating beautifully styled beds with soft and inviting cushions and investment bedding' Amy continues. 'If possible an open window all year round is going to benefit your bedroom environment as well as some blackout curtains to ensure quality deep sleep. Bedside tables should discretely bookmark your bed with just enough room for a good book and a glass of water (no charging devices in the bedroom).'

Heather Hacket Design Manager for  suggests using accessories and a soft colour palette: 'Combine neutral walls with beige oatmeal and biscuity accents in your soft furnishings and round the look off with an abundance of throws and rugs in thick cosy materials such as wool to create a snug homely feel.'

3. Shades of green

Our connection to nature and the world around us has never been more important – during the pandemic or post. Marianne Shillingford Creative Director of  comments: 'After so long trapped indoors we have come to appreciate the power of nature to uplift and revitalise us. Colour-wise we are throwing open the doors and windows and inviting every shade of nature in for tea.'

Pinterest has seen searches for green interior inspiration increase by 80 per cent this year as we embrace a plethora of nature-inspired green tones.

Ben White design and trade expert at Swyft says: 'Bringing the outside in; it’s a trend we’ve spoken about for a while but next year it will come into fruition. We will see green and natural tones blended into our interiors through the use of plants timber and terracotta. We might also see the use of green velvet sofas sage or olive painted walls or jute textured rugs.'



Heather suggests a moderate approach to decorating with green: 'Sage and mineral-based greens bring nature indoors and enrich interior spaces. However a whole green room can seem a bit daunting. If you love the colour but don't want to make any permanent changes add in pops of rich jewel-toned greens through your cushions prints and decorative items such as vases and candlesticks.'

4. Colourful kitchens

Amidst the pandemic our design choices has revolved around countering instability and uncertainty – the use of comforting neutrals and cosy soft furnishings to cocoon ourselves. But as we slowly emerge with a feeling of hope and positivity for the future bright and optimistic colour combinations throughout the home will become more appealing.

Claire O’Brien Head of Design at Splashback says: 'A love of colour is also transported into the heart of the home – kitchens are no longer confined to neutrals blues or greens. There is a move to introduce a broader colour palette in this space with colourful stoves and AGAs painted walls accessories and splashbacks like the Laura Ashley Copper Splashback. Kitchen designers are introducing multiple shades to cabinets differentiating from high and low level furniture and kitchen islands. For a more confident look coloured cabinets are alternated in shade creating a modern and playful space.'

Championing a joyful colour palette will also tip over into a more experimental use of print and pattern. 'As we move on a journey of self-discovery propelled by a maturing confidence in our design choices embracing pattern alongside a growing love affair of colour is creating a perfect storm' Claire adds. 'It can be retro traditional or modern in feel simple and orderly or bold and chaotic but whatever form it takes there is no doubt that print and pattern plays a major part within interiors for 2022.'

5. Cottagecore

One of the biggest trends to emerge in 2021 with more Google searches globally than any other design style cottagecore will continue its dominance into 2022 – thanks in no small part to the saturation of dreamy cottagecore content shared across Instagram and TikTok.



Claire explains: 'The Cottagecore trend is the epitome of The Good Life drawing inspiration from the countryside with its sprawling meadows and wildflowers. It harnesses the look and charm of an idyllic country cottage through embracing familiar floral prints and patterns chalk painted surfaces organic textures and woods – creating a wholesome pastoral and mindful rural vibe.

'Cottagecore brings the outdoors in at every opportunity – helping us connect with nature once again. It embraces sustainability and celebrates a return to artisanal skills such as foraging and home baking.'

6. Sustainably minded

2022 will see a further emphasis on sustainable materials responsible manufacturing and the reuse and resale of furniture and homeware.

Ben says: 'Sustainability and use of organic materials have become prominent in recent years. With the public's increased exposure to climate change the idea of sustainability has fed into the interior industry and our homes. This will translate into how we buy furniture; a move towards furniture items with reclaimed woods and accessories with recycled glass and metal... investing in meaningless furniture and accessories is a thing of the past.'



Sophie Hill Marketing Insight and Innovation at Rothley agrees: 'We’ve seen a clear shift towards more conscious choices whether that is materials or extending the life of items around the home rather than buying more things.'

This drive to purchase more consciously is particularly pronounced amongst millennial and Gen Z shoppers with second hand furniture and homeware predicted to become a preferred resource as evidenced by the new homeware resale marketplace app Narchie.



7. DIY and upcycling

L: Fy! R: Urban Outfitters Left:  Right:

A natural progression from the above 2022 will see a surge in homeowners taking on DIY projects as part of creating a more mindful home.

Sophie says: 'Low-waste living and upcycling is at the heart of creating a mindful home and we have definitely seen a rise in upcycling which is likely to continue – from people sewing and making over old outfits to making garden furniture out of wooden pallets. For the less experienced DIY-ers taking an old piece of furniture and customising it is a great way to reduce waste and also means no one else has the same piece as you.'

A recent survey by Blinds Direct has revealed over two thirds (68 per cent) of UK homeowners are choosing to complete a variety of home improvement tasks themselves with younger generations taking up the mantle of the DIY nation – 58 per cent of 18–24-year-olds are planning on updating their homes themselves.

Darren Green Managing Director at Blinds Direct says: 'We’re becoming increasingly confident in taking on the challenge of keeping our homes beautiful ourselves. Whether it's fitting a wooden blind painting a wall or building a new desk we are becoming increasingly confident in our own abilities and the positive effect it has on our happiness reinforces the importance of doing things independently.'

Customers,"A dramatic increase in the cost of energy is now about to happen. Eversource New England's largest utility and the primary supplier of electricity in Eastern Massachusetts and the Southcoast has filed for a 25% rate increase with state regulators.

The Mass. Department of Public Utilities will have the final say but in a recent e-mail to its customers the utility signaled that approval was likely. Eversource wrote ""In Janaury your electric bill will be higher because of the increased demand for electricity and natural gas."" Natural gas is often used to generate electricity in the region's power plants.

The e-mail also stated that customers who use 500 kilowatts of electricity a month ""could see a 25 percent or $30 increase in their total bill compared with December.""

According to Eversource the average residential customer paying around $120 a month for electricity would be paying about $150 in January.

Eversource spokesman William Hinkle told the Boston Globe ""The recent soaring global demand for natural gas has been driving up energy prices everywhere as winter approaches. Those market conditions are reflected in our recent filing with the DPU. ""

Eversource has more than 1 million electricity customers in Massachusetts.

National Grid the state's other large electricity utility was granted a similar increase on November 1st.

Both Eversource and National Grid have programs offering discounted rates for low-income households.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lY24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvaW4tcmktdXMtZW5lcmd5LXNlY3JldGFyeS1zYXlzLW9mZnNob3JlLXdpbmQtYnJpbmdzLWd1c3Qtb2Ytam9iLWdyb3d0aC8yNjI5NDE5L9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lY24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvaW4tcmktdXMtZW5lcmd5LXNlY3JldGFyeS1zYXlzLW9mZnNob3JlLXdpbmQtYnJpbmdzLWd1c3Qtb2Ytam9iLWdyb3d0aC8yNjI5NDE5Lz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In RI US Energy Secretary Says Offshore Wind Brings ‘Gust' of Job Growth,"U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Thursday that the administration's goal for offshore wind and the projects being developed now represent a ""gust of job growth throughout the country.""

Granholm visited a new offshore wind manufacturing hub in Providence to talk about the Biden administration's plan to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030 and to promote the investments in the $1 trillion infrastructure deal.

""More offshore wind means more jobs for iron workers line workers engineers electricians plumbers pipefitters"" she said. ""Jobs in mining and manufacturing and management and operations and sales not to mention of course the benefit to surrounding communities.""

At the Port of Providence Orsted a Danish energy company and the utility Eversource are constructing a building for the fabrication and assembly of large advanced components for turbine foundations. Orsted officials gave Granholm and Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee a tour. The group met union workers who are building the facility.

McKee said he envisions Rhode Island as the ""base camp"" to support the offshore wind supply chain along the East Coast. Granholm said looking at the building reminded her of a proverb: ""When the winds of change blow some build walls others build windmills.""

""And we know which side of that Rhode Island falls on"" she said.

Eversource President and CEO Joe Nolan said the Biden administration's support of offshore wind is a ""breath of fresh air"" after the Trump administration. Both Nolan and Orsted Offshore North America CEO David Hardy said such support is critical while the U.S. industry is still in the fragile early stages.

""The momentum is happening"" Nolan said. ""We need it to continue.""

""It's a young industry"" added Hardy. ""We need help getting the first projects off the ground.""

Their manufacturing hub at the port is scheduled to be finished this spring to support two offshore wind projects Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind.

Revolution Wind is a planned offshore wind farm south of Martha's Vineyard Massachusetts to provide power for Connecticut and Rhode Island. The federal government is currently reviewing the construction and operations plan.

The South Fork Wind project will be located off the coast of Rhode Island. Its transmission system will connect to the electric grid on Long Island New York making it the state's first offshore wind farm and jumpstarting the offshore wind industry there.

The interior department announced last week that the administration approved the construction and operations for South Fork Wind as part of a plan to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030. It was the administration's second approval of a commercial-scale offshore wind energy project in the United States. The first commercial-scale project is off the coast of Massachusetts.

The first U.S. offshore wind farm began operating off Block Island Rhode Island in late 2016. But at five turbines it's not commercial-scale. Orsted acquired the developer Rhode Island-based Deepwater Wind and now operates that wind farm.

Granholm also visited a manufacturer of electric vehicle chargers and a clean energy technology company in Connecticut Thursday. On Friday she's hosting a roundtable discussion in Boston about the transition to clean energy.

Granholm has been making stops around the country to talk about how investments in infrastructure incentivize companies like these to open and expand driving the transition away from fossil fuels creating jobs and helping people save money on energy. She is visiting areas that are proactive in reducing emissions and areas where more work needs to be done.

President Joe Biden signed his hard-fought $1 trillion infrastructure deal into law in November declaring that the new infusion of cash for roads bridges ports and more is going to make life ""change for the better"" for the American people. It has $100 million for wind energy research and development $2.5 billion for transmission lines including transmission from offshore wind farms and $20 million to ensure offshore wind is built sustainably Granholm said.

The companion piece of legislation the social and environment bill under consideration in the Senate has $600 million for port infrastructure as well as significant tax credits to incentivize offshore wind development and turbine manufacturing she added.",,,,,,,,,

Then the DLC and updates arrive and they take up even more room. Do you routinely clean house to keep space free or are those bars in Windows Explorer permanently in the red for you?

How much free storage space have you got on your PC?

Here are our answers plus some from our forum.

Jarred Walton Senior Editor of Tom's Hardware: Just this week while prepping to install Windows 11 on a new SSD I ran into an interesting problem. I had a 2TB SSD as my main Windows 10 OS drive a Kingston KC2000 and I noticed with a game update in Steam that it was behaving poorly. It only had 120GB of free space so I decided to move some of the games to the new (and mostly empty) Crucial P5 Plus 2TB drive. Data was initially copying at 100-130 MB/s. Not good for an M.2 drive! Once I got to about 400GB of free space read performance shot up to 500-700 MB/s. Besides those two drives I have a 4TB Samsung 850 Evo that's still good for mass storage. Moral of the story: You can never have too much capacity and don't fill your SSDs beyond about 70-80% if possible.

Nat Clayton Features Producer: 130 GB. I built this PC last year with a single M2 SSD thinking ""aye 1TB will be enough"" forgetting that I work in games media and might need to install new games or record footage every now and then. That said though the download speed at my old co-working space was nonsensically fast enough that uninstalling and reinstalling games didn't give me pause (the folks there have some outrageous setup that meant even a beast like MS Flight Sim only took an hour or two to download). And if I'm entirely honest I only really need enough space for two things: Apex Legends and a video folder for Apex Legends pop-offs.

Dave James Hardware Lead: I've actually still got hard drives in my gaming PC chock full of old digital photos from the dark ages of my youth and utterly legitimate video and audio files. They're both in the red with just 30GB left between them. Luckily there's also 12TB of NVMe storage split over a couple of drives to keep them company. One's my 8TB boot drive and the other a 4TB stick of gum with my Windows 11 install on it.

As you may note the games are not the true storage hogs that's me.

Sarah James Guides Writer: I currently have 820GB free out of 2.5TB but after this weekend I'll be adding a second m.2 drive to bring my overall storage up to 3.5TB. I don't usually have much of a problem with space though and I'll uninstall anything I know I won't play again any time soon. I'm basically only adding the extra NVMe drive because I'm doing a major upgrade and it would be rude not to.

Harry Shepherd Guides Editor: I currently have 1.8 of my 3TBs free but I expect that'll go fast. When putting my current PC together about six months ago I ran out of cash after a single terabyte of storage. It was an expensive Gen 4 M2 drive but hey I was future-proofing. It was always my intention to take advantage of the second M2 slot on my new motherboard and as expected I was seduced by the temptations of Black Friday and picked up a 2TB stick. I've had to be very organised with my storage up to this point but I predict the gigabyte flood gates to open now.

Lauren Morton Associate Editor: Like Dave I've still got some chonky HDDs in my system holding old My Documents folders from systems going back to my teen years way too many photos and all my footage from six years of Twitch streaming. Combined those packrat tendencies have left me with 139GB remaining on a 2TB hard drive. I've still got a cushy 2.39TB available on my 6TB hard drive where I install the majority of my games though and 66GB free on my 512GB NVMe boot drive. I think I can safely keep kicking the can down the road a bit longer on this problem.

Phil Savage Editor-in-Chief UK: I've got a 2TB SSD that's dedicated to games—the drive is called ""Games"" that's how you know. It's got about 337 GB remaining. So yeah it's getting lower but there's plenty of things I can cut for space. Looking at WinDirStat the big space hogs right now are GTA 5 which I've not played for months; Vermintide 2 which I still play occasionally but maybe not enough to justify its 100 GB toll; and Red Dead Redemption 2 which yup that can go too. Elsewhere there's still 1 TB free on my old HDD that's filled with music Blu-Ray rips and Shadowplay footage and 500 GB left on the M2 SSD used for Windows and various programs. Neither of those drives are called ""Games"" though so they're useless for my current predicament.

Andy Chalk News Hammer: Got a 500GB SSD my boot drive which has 268GB free and a second much newer 2TB SSD with 666GB free. There's also a 1.5TB HDD with 735GB free which I use for music and image storage (although truth be told I've got a bunch of other crapola on there too) and an empty 600GB HDD that I just recently installed because it seemed a shame to waste it. It's a bit of a mess (although nothing like a Dave James mess) but you can never have too much storage and while there's absolutely no reason not to make the move to SSD at this point (and trust me you will not regret it) those cheap fat HDDs still have value as a place to keep your lower-priority stuff.

Hitobat: I have about 300GB on a Samsung EVO 1TB ssd free. The main reason I think is that I'm pretty ruthless with uninstalling Steam games once I realise I haven't played them for a while. I keep only a small area on my desktop for game shortcuts so that really helps to drive home when I'm adding new games and not cleaning up the old.

Zloth: If you check Steam's help menu and select System Information then scroll down you can get the exact number. Total Hard Disk Space Available: 5722329 MB

Kaamos_Llama: According to Steam about 430GB across 3 drives but I'm a snob and I won't install games to the HDD anymore. I also just culled a few I haven't played for a bit.

I would love to keep all of my games installed as my download is not the fastest at 50mbps. Sometimes I get an urge to play something and it's annoying that I can't just launch it. Some bigger games take several hours to download and often the moment has passed by the time it's finished.

Of course you can copy and paste Steam games across to the main directory which is quicker but my old 2TB disc doesn't hold everything anymore. Time for a bigger mass storage drive in the new year probably certainly won't be buying a graphics card anytime soon anyway!

Pifanjr: Just enough for Total War: Warhammer 2 to update. So about 60 GB.

Even a basement with a limited floor area can function as extra living space a home office a playroom or fulfill other needs.

Executing your basement ideas may mean making an unfinished zone into one that’s habitable or even digging down but even if the resulting space isn’t particularly large good design can make it a pleasurable place in which to spend time.

Here we’ve assembled the top small basement ideas and expert advice to create an area whose spacious feel belies its limited proportions.

Small basement ideas

A small basement needn’t be relegated to a storage-only space. A wide range of different rooms can be created at this level of a home and the right design and decor choices can make it feel anything but constricted.

1. Consider scale

(Image credit: Future / Paul Raeside)

Whichever type of room it is to make small basement ideas successful ensure the proportions of the furniture selected are appropriate.

‘Make the most of small spaces by keeping space and scale in mind’ says Maggie Griffin founder and lead designer of Maggie Griffin Design. ‘Built-ins for storage and a small wet bar keep things handy while comfortable upholstery (think small-scale sectional) can invite one for movies and bingeing Netflix.

‘Even basement bedrooms can be small but chic and cozy. Keep colors light to make the most of the natural light.’

2. Keep small basements feeling open

(Image credit: Mel Yates)

In addition to considering the size of furniture think about its design to keep a small basement feeling open and therefore larger. In this home office the desk has a slim profile with no legs that make it a less bulky presence than alternative styles.

Meanwhile the majority of the storage is hidden behind sliding doors to keep the room feeling streamlined.

3. Add in a cozy nook

(Image credit: Jon Day/Future)

Consider adding a nook to boost seating in a space-efficient way if yours is a small basement.

‘We emphasize the coziness with the deep wall color and soft fabric textures’ says Mindy O’Connor of Melinda Kelson O’Connor Design of her designs.

4. Make it light and bright

One of the most simple but effective small basement ideas? Choosing a light paint color for walls plus trim. ‘Prioritize creating a light and bright environment so it’s a place you want to be not a dreaded dungeon’ says Andi Morse founder and principal designer Morse Design.

Try following the same strategy with light colored flooring and neutral upholstery too. Also worth considering is a glass balustrade for the basement staircase so it doesn’t block light.

Up the textural interest of your decor choices to avoid a flat feel when light colors dominate.

5. Go low in a small basement

(Image credit: Best Practice Architecture/Ed Sozinho)

A small basement often presents the issue of a low ceiling along with the problem of a lack of floor area. If that’s the case pay attention to the height of furniture. In this room a low sectional assists in making the ceiling feel higher and it’s worth adopting the same tactic when choosing armchairs footstools coffee tables and more.

If your basement has a window using a shade makes more sense when hanging drapes would impede the positioning of furniture or a floor-length curtain when this isn’t a problem. A drape that falls just below a sill will emphasize a low ceiling height.

6. Opt for custom storage

(Image credit: David Cleveland/Future PLC)

If you are wondering how to make the most of your basement know that good storage is a must in a small space. Places to tidy away are even more crucial in a smaller area than a large one because it can easily look cluttered and cramped.

Custom shelving and cabinets are often the superior solution allowing the use of every inch of space from floor to ceiling. They’re also best for the area under the basement stairs as they can be built to follow the slope. Consider pull-out designs for storage fitted here to make access to contents easy.

7. Use a small basement as a laundry room

(Image credit: Sims Hilditch)

Laundry room ideas can be great for small basements if yours is super compact; an efficient version doesn’t demand a large area.

It’s an option interior designers Sims Hilditch took advantage of in one of their projects. ‘We installed bespoke joinery in which we stacked the washer and dryer’ says design director Louise Wicksteed. ‘We also installed a Belfast sink complete with useful storage around and beneath it. Although this is a functional space why not bring an element of fun to it with some colored or patterned floor tiles?’

8. Let mirrors work their magic

(Image credit: Future/Rachael Smith)

Decorating with mirrors is a tried-and-true way to make a room feel larger – and small basements can benefit as much as other rooms. This can be especially the case in a small basement bathroom as these are often windowless with any window given to living or bedroom space instead. Either way they can help to bounce around and increase natural light.

If you have chosen this solution for a basement bathroom follow this example by sizing the mirror to the wall above the basin to boost the light and visually stretch the space. Fitting shelves alongside and displaying decorative objects is a neat trick too helping to make the small room feel deeper.

9. Create display space

(Image credit: Michael Sinclair)

A basement without decorative accessories can feel bland and uninviting but if it’s small it can be hard to accommodate the furniture on which to display these pieces. Hanging a shelf can be the answer providing a place for objets as well as artwork without filling the floor area.

This room features a warm wall color that also makes the space welcoming and cozy. When adopting a deeper palette painting the ceiling white and selecting pale upholstery and wood finishes can provide the necessary balance.

10. Slim down

In a basement that’s small and especially if it’s narrow too slim wall-hung furniture can prevent it feeling overcrowded and preserve circulation space. Here a chic wall-hung desk provides a place to work and there’s even a slim bar to make the basement an appealing place to spend time.

A color palette of black and white makes the space cohesive and sophisticated to boot.

What can you do with a small basement?

A small basement provides the opportunity to add a host of different rooms despite its compact dimensions. Think about using it as an extra cozy family room or a playroom or a space apart for older kids. It could make an intimate movie theater or consider it for a home gym or games room neither of which necessarily require large square footages.

And while it might be unsuitable for a basement kitchen it might be a good venue for a home office to avoid disturbance by the rest of the family and would make a good study space for the same reason. Depending on the layout of your home it could make a convenient mudroom. A small basement can also be a sensible location for a laundry room avoiding the noise of appliances on the main floor.

Which flooring is best for a small basement?

A wide choice of flooring is available for a newly constructed or remodeled small basement that’s been correctly waterproofed when teamed with the appropriate sub-floor. Engineered wood has the appearance of solid hardwood but will resist warping in response to changes in humidity.

For a cozier feel carpet is an option. It’s also a good noise insulator and warm for young kids to play on – area rugs on a hard floor are an alternative.

Consider too tile for durability: both ceramic and porcelain might suit and they can replicate the look of wood if that’s your preference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvaHVnZS1oaWdodG9uLWhvbWUtaXMtYS1yZW5vdmF0aW9uLXNlbnNhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Huge Highton home is a renovation sensation - realestate.com.au,"WATERSEDGE by name waters edge by nature.

Newtown sale tips in buyers’ favour

The size of Geelong’s housing boom revealed

Geelong West home gains $700K in three years

The sprawling house at 9 Watersedge Tce has had quite the journey in 2021 selling earlier this year as a half-finished project without a kitchen.

Savvy buyers one a builder jumped at the chance to renovate rejuvenate and extend the striking home that has curved and picture windows framing treetop views.

“The aim was to treat it purely as a project” the vendor said.

“We wanted to totally transform the property into a new feel and look.”

Part of the makeover was to switch the home’s exterior from white to black with Black Magic the chosen hue.

Black is tactfully woven through the interior too via cabinetry tiling in the wet areas fittings and fixtures to create a moody undertone along with plenty of timber trimmings and natural light.

Other new inclusions – a huge butler’s pantry a sunken lounge set away from the main hub and an ensuite to fourth bedroom creating an option to use as the main bedroom guest wing or a great spot for the teens.

Even the sauna copped the treatment with a new heater ready to go.

“The sunken lounge addition is the room of the house with picture windows you can settle in with a red wine and a book and watch the world go by” the vendor said.

As well as the views he said the feelings of seclusion and privacy once up the driveway were pretty special.

In a boon for those working from home the study area complete with long built-in desk separate external access and its own bathroom even has room for a few extra colleagues if required.

Oh and in case you were wondering about the kitchen situation the new one is a cracker.

It has a curved island bench with stone tops loads of storage and European appliances including a built-in fridge and freezer and river views.

Plus there’s an epic breakfast bar with a servery that links to the backyard.

Speaking of outside the connection is seamless from multiple access points.

Plonk yourself down on the north or west-facing deck and admire the landscaped gardens and views beyond.

The first floor is home to three bedrooms including a second main suite with a walk-in wardrobe and ensuite with a walk-in shower double vanities and floor-to-ceiling tiles.

Hodges Geelong West agent Marcus Falconer has the listing with price hopes of $2.2 million and $2.4 million and said the property was perfect for families seeking extra space and privacy.

“It’s a versatile home with multiple living zones and space to entertain a big family and has been magnificently finished off” he said.

Extras include central heating and cooling a water tank and irrigation system.

The property is close to Buckley Falls and top schools across the river in Newtown.",,,,,,

The ad – which coincided with the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow – told listeners that carbon capture technology could remove more than 90% of CO 2 emissions from “carbon-intensive industries” and that the company was working to “deploy this technology at scale”. It gave the sense of an oil company tackling the climate crisis with technology that could solve it – and quickly.

Similar ads have run on NPR podcasts including Invisibilia and Up First. The American Petroleum Institute has also run ads in podcasts including on Vox’s Ezra Klein Show (Klein has since left for the New York Times) highlighting that it is “producing more oil and gas while reducing emissions”.

The fossil fuels industry’s sudden interest in podcasts coincides with its recent embrace of social media and newsletter advertising and may well be driven in part by a key difference in the regulation of these “newer” media regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) versus legacy print TV and radio media which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

While the FCC actively regulates advertising the FTC works differently. It generally won’t investigate anything until a complaint is made and even then an investigation is not guaranteed. The FTC has had “green guides” for environmental marketing claims in place for environmental claims for more than 30 years but the first complaint ever filed against an oil company for greenwashing came in 2021 against Chevron. The action is still pending.

The challenge with the FTC’s guidelines including the green guides is that they tend to be product based and specific: your product is either made with recycled materials or not you either take back and recycle packaging or you don’t. All of which leaves podcast and newsletter publishers and social media platforms to develop their own guidelines and factchecking processes.

This is made harder by the industry’s advertising strategy – oil companies almost never advertise their products opting instead to advertise ideas particularly the idea that they’re working hard to address the climate crisis.

ExxonMobil’s ad in The Daily for example emphasizes its work to scale up carbon capture as a climate solution. Yet the company currently captures less than 1% of its emissions according to a report by the activist hedge fund Engine No 1 and uses some of the captured CO 2 to extract more fossil fuels through a process called enhanced oil recovery.

The ad’s statement that carbon capture can remove 90% of emissions also has some important caveats. The figure is a baseline target for carbon capture projects and refers to the emissions captured at a single industrial site rather than all industrial emissions. According to the International Energy Agency the world’s carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects can currently capture approximately 0.1% of annual global emissions.

“ExxonMobil has long acknowledged that climate change is real and poses serious risks” said an ExxonMobil spokesperson Todd Spitler. He said figures from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions show that “CCS can capture more than 90% of emissions from power plants and industrial facilities”.

He added that ExxonMobil had captured more than 120m tons of CO2 in total which he said accounted for 40% of all globally captured carbon since 1970. According to the company’s April 2021 report Exxon’s total CO 2 emissions for 2020 alone from direct operations and its supply chain were more than 650m tons.

“All advertising must meet our advertising acceptability guidelines” said a New York Times spokesperson Nicole Taylor. “This prohibits advertising that is intentionally misleading deceptive or contains false information. Ads submitted to the New York Times are reviewed by an advertising standards team and are subject to factchecking.”

Yet Exxon’s misleading claims about carbon capture passed this filter. Taylor didn’t say whether the Exxon ad went through the company’s factchecking process just that ads “are subject” to factchecking. So either the ad passed or it wasn’t checked closely in the first place.

NPR also says it has processes in place to vet digital ads. “The digital guidelines were developed to protect the non-commercial spirit of NPR with some additional flexibility on language beyond the strict limits imposed by the FCC for broadcast sponsor recognition” said an NPR spokesperson Isabel Lara.

It’s unsurprising that Exxon’s ad passed media companies’ filters said John Cook research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University Australia and an adviser to Facebook on climate disinformation. That’s because it deploys a tactic often used by oil companies called “paltering” he said the use of truthful statements to convey a misleading impression.

“It requires background knowledge to spot it so it’s tough” Cook said. “They can run an ad that’s 100% accurate statements. Exxon is investing in algae – that’s 100% true – then they can do a lot to convey the impression that they’re environmentally friendly without conveying that they’re spending more on advertising than on algae tech. So it’s very hard for factcheckers or social media guidelines to catch that because the companies can say ‘What? Everything is true.’”

Unless the New York Times’ advertising team has a knowledgable climate expert reviewing Exxon’s ads it’s unlikely that a misleading ad would be rejected. “​​The problem with self-regulation is that if it’s against a publisher’s or platform’s financial interests to impose restrictions then they’re less likely to do so” Cook said.

This doesn’t necessarily mean a ban on fossil fuel ads is the only way to get on top of greenwashing Cook said. “I probably would lean towards the solution being more based on the content rather than the source” he said. “But also if the source has a track record of misinforming that should come with penalties.”

The problem is catching the problem to begin with because greenwashing doesn’t fit the usual mold. “Their greenwashing won’t be flagged as misinformation in the first place” Cook said. “So what’s in place now for identifying misinformation in ads is not really a framework for identifying greenwashing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vZmZzaG9yZS1tYWcuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLXJlcG9ydHMvdXMtZ3VsZi1vZi1tZXhpY28vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDIxNTA2NC9oZXJuYW5kZXotYW5hbHl0aWNhLWZ1dHVyZS1sZWFzZS1zYWxlcy1tYXktaW5jbHVkZS1tb3JlLW9mZnNob3JlLWNhcmJvbi1jYXB0dXJlLWJpZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Future lease sales may include more offshore carbon capture bids,"In January 2021 federal offshore lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico were suspended by executive order effectively creating a leasing moratorium that hearkened back to the drilling moratorium of 2010. The court-ordered Lease Sale 257 which took place last month effectively ended the moratorium at least as far as we can tell. But perhaps the most interesting thing about Lease Sale 257 is that it can be considered the first time that an oil producer namely ExxonMobil in this case acquired offshore blocks for the purpose of offshore carbon capture and storage (OCCS) activities.

For context the leasing moratorium was put in place by an executive order from President Biden in January. And it was not a coincidence that shortly after that the US rejoined the Paris Agreement thereby affirming its pledge to environmental protection and the energy transition. It is further worth noting that the concept of OCCS has received support from the United Nations the organizing body of the 2015 Paris Agreement. As such it may perhaps be considered ironic that the US energy transition and decarbonization efforts may have converged with Lease Sale 257 which of course was created for the purpose of offshore hydrocarbon production.

Notably the blocks related to the area that ExxonMobil placed bids on (see the “blue blocks” in Figure 1) are considered to be in shallow water an area that had scant interest during the lease sales of 2020. Importantly over 90% of US offshore production takes place in deepwater per BSEE’s 2020 released data. The fact that ExxonMobil’s blocks are not in deepwater suggests that the company has another purpose for them. Looking at the map one can further easily note that these “blue blocks” are near the company’s flagship Houston Ship Channel endeavor. With this project ExxonMobil says that it intends to decarbonize industrial sources by sequestering captured CO2 in offshore reservoirs via underwater pipelines. It seems likely that future OCS lease sales will include more bids focused sequestration.

OCCS trends

OCCS projects are not a new idea and ExxonMobil has experience in this area. Notably it joined with Equinor on the Sleipner project in 1996. There over 19 million tons of CO2 have been permanently sequestered in subsea reservoirs offshore Norway. This sequestration experience no doubt bolsters ExxonMobil’s readiness to deploy and execute OCCS projects in the Gulf of Mexico.

The recently formed joint venture between Talos Energy and Carbonvert is a further testament to the growth of the OCCS market in the Gulf. In August the joint venture acquired 40000 acres in Texas state waters near Beaumont/Port Arthur in Jefferson County for the purpose of carbon sequestration. Interestingly the offshore blocks acquired by ExxonMobil lie in close proximity to the acreage acquired by the Talos Energy/Carbonvert venture.

In addition just days prior to Lease Sale 257 Talos Energy and Storegga announced their intentions to sequester CO2 from Freeport LNG’s facility into reservoirs in the Gulf. (This author described emerging UK-US OCCS collaboration here). This effort is separate from and in addition to the Talos Energy/Carbonvert joint venture. Tim Duncan CEO of Talos Energy has pointed out that his company’s collaboration with Freeport LNG “is complementary to our larger hub-based project in Jefferson County.”

Moreover it has been shown that an onshore LNG facility can successfully utilize offshore reservoirs for sequestration as was realized by Equinor in Norwegian waters via an 88-mile subsea pipeline at Snøhvit.

Federal vs state waters

There is of course a key distinction between federal and state waters and it will be interesting to see whether OCCS blooms in state or federal waters. The Talos Energy/Carbonvert venture opted for Texas state waters while ExxonMobil is targeting federal shallow-water areas offshore Texas. The leasing moratorium that took place this year may not augur well for future OCCS projects in federal waters – a point that would be ironic given that the moratorium was ostensibly designed to protect the environment. But companies investing millions of dollars in OCCS projects may not wish to have those projects be subject to the disposition of changing presidential administrations and shifting political sentiment. For example the Talos Energy/Carbonvert joint venture was able to obtain acreage in (Texas) state waters even while the federal leasing moratorium was ongoing.

It should be noted that the Submerged Lands Act (SLA) of 1953 ratified the different jurisdictions between state and federal waters and gave the US executive branch regulatory authority over the latter. The legislation also limited state waters to just a few nautical miles with the federal government having jurisdiction over the vast remaining portion of national waters. Obtaining acreage in state waters may be preferable for OCCS activities in that it constrains the ability of the federal government to intervene one way or another. However there is a significant downside to acquiring acreage in state waters since these areas are typically limited to a few nautical miles.

A new emerging marketplace

The US is on the cusp of realizing an offshore sequestration marketplace. This was bolstered by the recently passed infrastructure bill which pledges to support companies that sequester CO2. To be sure potential sequestration projects in the US Gulf are likely to also require tax credits such as those that can be found in section 45Q of the IRS tax code. From a feasibility standpoint there is precedent for subsea carbon storage and the US Gulf of Mexico has a long history of technological and business innovation. It must be noted that should support from government be withdrawn the viability of this marketplace could be called into question. In the context of these trends and parameters it will be interesting to see how many additional energy companies enter this space.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ndWxmLXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS83MDU3NjQvZXh4b25tb2JpbC1xYXRhci1kZWxlZ2F0aW9uLXZpc2l0cy1xYXRhcmdhcy0yLWFzc2V0LXJlY29nbmlzZXMtc2h1dGRvd24tbWFuYWdlbWVudC1leGNlbGxlbmNl0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5LzcwNTc2NC9leHhvbm1vYmlsLXFhdGFyLWRlbGVnYXRpb24tdmlzaXRzLXFhdGFyZ2FzLTItYXNzZXQtcmVjb2duaXNlcy1zaHV0ZG93bi1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWV4Y2VsbGVuY2UvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ExxonMobil Qatar delegation visits Qatargas 2 Asset; recognises shutdown management excellence| Gulf Times,"Upon invitation from partner Qatargas an ExxonMobil Qatar team headed by Nick Pearce vice president and Joint Venture asset manager and Mohamed al-Shareef Joint Interest asset manager visited Qatargas 2 Asset during its planned shutdown last month.

On Switch alone it’s been a thing – along with its Afterbirth+ expansion – for over four years. A big final addition to the game with the Repentance 'expansion' then seems a little belated. Helpfully Isaac is the kind of game that engenders obsession.

The further that Isaac moved from its original incarnation the less balanced and therefore the less fun it became. It’s still ace of course – by some distance it remains the king of the roguelites in this writer’s opiniom — but the bloat (not to be confused with boss monster The Bloat) introduced with each successive expansion made the game steadily more complex less breezy not as pick-up-and-play fun. Sure you don’t expect to win every run in a game like this but spawn The Haunt on the first floor with absolutely no power-ups and you may as well just restart.

Not anymore though. On top of adding 130 items 100 enemies 25 bosses and 20 new playable characters Repentance extensively rebalances the game buffing many items and nerfing others; quite frankly this serves nothing less than to make Isaac great again. Available as DLC or as a separate physical Switch release direct from the publisher there’s so much new and remixed content here with many graphics extensively redrawn for consistency new music a new fuller-featured co-op mode (no more lame babies!) and a brand new ending with new super-bosses to fight that it almost feels like a full sequel at times.

It cannot be stressed enough that – again in this writer’s opinion – Repentance is almost a full-scale apology for what Afterbirth+ wrought upon the game. While the purity of the original Flash title (and initial Rebirth remake) is absolutely lost what remains is one of the most content-rich fullest-featured titles available on the Switch.

By no means is Repentance perfect. It’s still rather bloated depending on which ending you’re after and there may be some unpleasant surprises for veteran players; many of your favourite broken item combos are no longer available or nerfed to the point of near-uselessness. Greed mode is still lingering around the game like a bad smell and unlocking much of the content requires you to beat it over and over with the new characters and “tainted” variants of the old ones.

Overall this is a return to form for The Binding of Isaac and comes close to capturing the magic of its original pre-Wrath of the Lamb incarnation. The simplest recommendation we can give is that we can see ourselves pouring another 500 hours into a game that had until now resolutely burned us out. Those Greed Mode unlocks may never see the light of day but we’ll be having a blast discovering the thousands of new item synergies defeating the brilliant new bosses and exploring that alternate route through the game to fight against… well that would be telling.

Repentance by name and wonderful welcome repentance by nature this expansion is an apology for what became of Isaac and a promise to do better — a promise that it very much delivers on.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A plumber doing repair work at pastor Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church found hundreds of envelopes of cash and checks hidden in a wall that police think is connected to a massive 2014 theft at the Houston mega-church.

Officers were called to the church on November 10 to investigate the discovery according to a statement from the Houston Police Department.

“Church members stated that during a renovation project a large amount of money – including cash checks and money orders – was found inside a wall” the statement said.

Police said that evidence from the recovered checks suggests that the envelopes are connected to the March 9 2014 theft of undisclosed amounts of money from the church.

CNN reported at the time that about $600000 – $200000 in cash and $400000 in checks – was taken from a church safe. The money came from contributions given on March 8 and 9 of 2014.

Burglary and theft officers inventoried and documented the recovered money and left it in the custody of the church because it was property found on its premises the statement said.

Police said the investigation is ongoing.

Lakewood Church confirmed the discovery in a statement provided to CNN but it did not provide additional information because the investigation is still active.

“Recently while repair work was being done at Lakewood Church an undisclosed amount of cash and checks were found” the statement said. “Lakewood immediately notified the Houston Police Department and is assisting them with their investigation.”

News of the find became public on Thursday when a man who identified himself as the plumber called into Houston radio station 100.3 The Bull and shared the story with the Morning Bullpen show.

“There was a loose toilet in the wall and we removed the tile … Went to go remove the toilet and I moved some insulation away and about 500 envelopes fell out of the wall and I was like ‘Oh wow’” the caller said.

The caller said he contacted the maintenance supervisor and turned the money in.

Co-host George Lindsey told CNN that they talked to the man who said his name was Justin off the air to make sure it wasn’t a prank.

“I wish we had video of our faces because we were all just like ‘holy cow’ Lindsey said. He said he was impressed that Justin did the right thing and turned in the money.

“He could have stashed some of this money in his pocket and walked out and never said anything to anybody but [he] was an honest stand-up kind of guy” Lindsey said.

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Walk up to French Tulip Flowers in San Francisco's Noe Valley neighborhood and you'll be greeted by a sign that reads 'We are hiring anyone that shows up'.

""Right now we'll take anyone who are willing to learn and stay with us"" said the store's owner Andrei Abramov.

Abramov says right now he and his girlfriend are the only two people working at the shop- working all day every day.

A few weeks ago Abramov put the sign in the store's front window to try and attract anyone willing to help out.

""We had two employees and one of our employees retired and one employee just opened his own shop"" Abramov said.

But French Tulip Flowers isn't the only shop having difficulties getting employees.

Several in Noe Valley say it's a persistent problem.

Just a few feet down the road at Casa Mexicana Jose Rodriguez says his team has been short staffed for months.

Something he fears could potentially get worse with the emergence of the new omicron variant.

""Very worried about it. There's a lot of people who don't want to get the vaccine"" Rodriguez said.

Issues like these have been popping up for business all around the country says Julia Pollak the chief economist for ZipRecruiter.

She says the pandemic's effects on the labor force are still being widely felt but are especially pronounced for small and medium-sized businesses.

""They just don't have the financial cushion to compete on pay and benefits to the same degree. And two you know they don't have entire departments devoted to human resources analytics"" Pollak said.

The hack was first reported on Saturday night (Dec. 4) when security analysis firm PeckShield showed that a BitMart address was showing large outflows of entire token balances sometimes for tens of millions to an address known as “BitMart Hacker.”

PeckShield later tweeted that the losses were around $100 million on the Ethereum blockchain and $96 million from the Binance Smart Chain.

BitMart representatives initially denied the hack and called it “fake news.” The company originally posited that the outflows were just regular withdrawals.

Then the company confirmed the security breach hours later.

According to the report the hacker had been using decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch trading the stolen assets for the cryptocurrency ether and then using a secondary address to deposit the coins into Tornado Cash a privacy mixer. That made it more difficult for the funds to be tracked.

Cybercrime including hacking and fraud related to crypto has been on the rise since the pandemic started as many people and businesses began relying more on the internet to conduct daily life and business.

PYMNTS writes that hackers have begun stealing crypto from just random individuals as the “crypto boom” has been attracting more normal individuals and “mom and pop” types of businesses. This is a change from the usual hacking targets who were often wealthier investors.

The carriers have upped their security measures in response while law enforcement is trying to team up with other entities to address the breadth of scams.

The Federal Communications Commission has boosted rules for wireless carriers to tighten restrictions. In response to that some companies like AT&T have said the new restrictions could end up with customers subject to more fraud overall if requests to switch devices or carriers are mistakenly tagged as SIM swap scams where hackers switch information from one device to another.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here are its stages explained.,"Update for Dec. 4 2021: The total solar eclipse of Dec. 4 has ended over Antarctica. You can see a video above and see photos and our full wrap story here.

On Saturday Dec. 4 a total eclipse of the sun will take place the first since Dec. 14 of last year when the moon's dark umbral shadow darkened portions of the South Pacific Patagonia (south Chile and Argentina) and the South Atlantic. But many ardent eclipse chasers passed on last year's eclipse because of the COVID-19 pandemic so very few people witnessed it.

Concerning this upcoming solar eclipse however the odds are again excellent that only a small contingent of people will very be in a position to see it. And just where does one have to travel this time to see moon completely blot out the sun?

How does Antarctica strike you?

The tale of the moon's shadow

The northern edge of the moon's dark umbral shadow arrives at 2 a.m. EST (0700 GMT) touching down on Earth some 380 miles (611 kilometers) southeast of Stanley the capital of the Falkland Islands.

It will take 5 minutes 48 seconds for the entire umbral shadow to make its way onto the surface of the Earth. By this time 2:05 a.m. EST (0705 GMT) the leading/northern edge of the umbra — which is racing at 2.1 miles (3.4 km) per second — has already pierced 728 miles (1170 km) east and has crossed over the boundary at 60 degrees south latitude (as recognized by the National Geographic Society) of the Southern Ocean. Thus initially the shape of umbra's footprint resembles a slender raindrop about 84 miles (135 km) at its widest but nearly 1200 miles (1900 km) long.

About 250 miles (400 km) east of the northern limit of totality are South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands a British Overseas Territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean; a remote and inhospitable collection of islands. No permanent native population lives in the South Sandwich Islands and a very small non-permanent population resides on South Georgia. King Edward Point is a permanent British Antarctic Survey (BAS) research station on South Georgia Island and is the capital of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The settlement is the smallest capital in the world by population; currently 12 BAS personnel overwinter at the station rising to around 22 in summer. If any of them are outside just after sunrise they no doubt will notice an eerie ""counterfeit twilight"" that will descend upon the island for a couple of minutes thanks to 96% of the sun's disk being obscured by the moon.

Around 2:08 a.m. EST (0708 GMT) the umbra will make its first landfall at the South Orkney Islands a group of islands in the Southern Ocean about 375 miles (604 km) northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Britain and Argentina both maintain bases on the islands. The Argentine base Orcadas is sited on Laurie Island.

Shortly thereafter the umbra will turn south and then south-southwest over the ice-filled waters of the Weddell Sea — deemed by scientists to have the clearest water of any sea — for 23.7 minutes before making its next — and final landfall on Antarctica. About 66 miles (107 km) northeast of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf the point of greatest eclipse — that spot along the eclipse track when the distance between the moon's shadow axis and Earth's geocenter reaches a minimum — occurs at 2:33 a.m. EST (0733 GMT). Here the duration of totality is 1 minute 54.4 seconds and the sun's altitude is 17.2 degrees.

Fifteen seconds later the umbra makes its first contact with Antarctica Earth's southernmost continent; the fifth largest and nearly twice the size of Australia. Its landmass is almost wholly covered by a vast ice sheet covering 98% of the land. Its average thickness is about 5900 feet (1800 meters). Ice shelves or ice sheets floating on the sea cover many parts of the Ross and Weddell seas. These shelves — the Ross Ice and the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf — together with other shelves around the continental margins fringe about 45% of Antarctica.

Is it any wonder that the nickname for Antarctica is simply: ""The Ice.""?

For the next 30.6 minutes the moon's umbra will travel southwest then west and then northwest traversing the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf skirting across the boundary between Ellsworth Land and West Antarctica then passing closest to the South Pole — 464 miles (746 km) at 2:50 a.m. EST (0750 GMT) — and finally out over Marie Byrd Land where it will also pass over the Executive Committee Range — a mountain range consisting of five major volcanoes — before moving back out over the open waters of the Southern Ocean.

By this time the umbra has again stretched out into something resembling a cigar; its southern edge has already slipped off the Earth's surface at 3 a.m. EST (0800 GMT) to be followed by the northern edge of the umbra 5 minutes 45 seconds later.

Meanwhile the northern belly of Earth's outer shadow (called the penumbra) grazes the southernmost portion of the continent of Africa so that southern sections of Namibia Botswana Lesotho and South Africa see varying degrees of a very small partial eclipse ""denting"" the top of the sun during the early morning. Cape Town gets about 12% coverage though in most other cases the amount of the sun that is covered is imperceptibly small (Bloemfontein gets less than 0.5% coverage!). Later just before it slides completely off the Earth's surface folks in the southeast corner of Australia most of Tasmania and southernmost New Zealand can see a small ""bite"" taken out of the upper left portion of the sun just prior to sunset.

New moon's close proximity

Another interesting fact is that Saturday's moon will also be making its closest approach (called perigee) to Earth in 2021: 221702 miles (356794 km). Even more interesting is that the moment when the moon comes closest to the Earth — 5:07 a.m. EST (0807 GMT) — will come just 144 minutes after the occurrence of new moon.

So both the sun and moon will be positioned on the same side of the Earth with the moon practically at its closest possible point to the Earth. Such ""proxigean"" moons can produce the highest tides of the year and indeed ocean tides will be experiencing a far larger than normal range during the few days immediately following this new moon. Low tides for instance will be much lower and high tides much higher than usual (hence the term ""spring tide"" to ""spring up"").

Desperately seeking totality

Getting back to the eclipse for a moment it has been written that those who have witnessed the beauty of a total solar eclipse firsthand describe them as the most awe-inspiring events that nature can offer. People have traveled great distances just to experience those few precious moments of seeing the sun's corona chromosphere and prominences.

Nonetheless you might be under the impression regarding the Dec. 4 total eclipse that aside from those few scientists stationed at bases in Antarctica that nobody else will experience it. That might have been true 40 years ago. In fact a total solar eclipse that touched Antarctica back in November 1985 was probably only witnessed by a few lucky penguins on the flanks of Mount Sabine.

But believe it or not there actually are more than just a hardy few that are willing to make the trek down to the South Polar Region to observe this weekend's eclipse. There is at least a half dozen cruise ships that will sail into zone of totality somewhere between the South Orkney Islands and the Weddel Sea in hopes of getting a view of totality.

And I will be on one of those ships.

I have been asked to serve on the team of naturalist guides and onboard scientists on Ponant Cruise Lines' newest expedition ship Le Commandant-Charcot a hybrid-electric polar-class vessel. Guests will disembark onto the ice pack to witness the solar eclipse as the moon passes between Earth and the sun. I am hoping to file a story for Space.com readers about our ""Voyage into Darkness"" and our attempt to rendezvous with the shadow of the moon. So stay tuned!

NASA says the DART mission is also testing several new technologies. One of them is a propulsion system that gets power from the sun. The technology is called solar electric propulsion.

Since the system uses solar power instead of fuel-based engines it does not need large heavy fuel tanks. If the technology is successful it could help power a new generation of spacecraft.

NASA officials have said solar electric propulsion can be important to the agency’s plans for future exploration. This could include planned missions to take astronauts to the moon and Mars.

The solar-powered system included on the DART mission is known as NEXT-C. It was developed by NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Ohio and built by rocket maker Aerojet Rocketdyne.

The technology is based on systems used on NASA spacecraft in the past that carried out asteroid exploration missions. Scientists working on NEXT-C development said the new system is expected to be “about three times as powerful” as ones used in the past.

Most propulsion systems use fuels to produce chemical reactions to provide thrust moving the spacecraft. NEXT-C is a propulsion system that uses electricity to convert xenon gas into xenon ions. As the ions are released they provide the force to move the spacecraft. Large solar collectors produce electricity from sunlight.

NEXT-C is not the main propulsion system for DART. It was included in the mission to test its effectiveness. However the technology will be the main propulsion system for the upcoming NASA mission called Psyche.

The Psyche spacecraft will travel to a metal asteroid orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter. NASA says it expects to launch Psyche in August. The spacecraft is to travel about 2.4 billion kilometers over three-and-a-half years to reach the asteroid.

Once in orbit the mission team will examine data gathered by Psyche’s science instruments. Scientists believe the asteroid may be part of the metallic core of an early planet. They say the asteroid could have separated during violent crashes that happened during our solar system’s early formation.

NASA says once Psyche separates from its launch vehicle it will depend on solar electric propulsion to reach its target. The spacecraft is also expected to get a gravitational push when it passes by Mars.

The space agency says Psyche will be the first spacecraft to use the solar propulsion thrusters beyond the orbit of our moon. NASA describes the thrust as “gentle” but strong enough to propel the spacecraft on its long trip.

NASA said testing has shown that the system is highly effective. Scientists estimate that Psyche’s thrusters “could operate for years without running out of fuel.”

Lindy Elkins-Tanton of Arizona State University is a NASA investigator and leads the Psyche mission. “Even in the beginning when we were first designing the mission in 2012 we were talking about solar electric propulsion as part of the plan” she said in a statement. “Without it we wouldn’t have the Psyche mission.”

Paulo Lozano directs the space propulsion laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He told MIT Technology Review that he thinks Psyche can help create a path to new solar-powered space exploration. The technology could permit longer and less costly missions. “It actually opens up the possibility to explore and to commercialize space in a way that we haven’t seen before” Lozano said.

A Solar eclipse happens when the Moon blocks sunlight from reaching the Earth by coming in a position between the Earth and the Sun. Even though the Sun is approximately 400 times larger than the moon it is also 400 times further away making it possible for the Moon to cover the Sun.

While a total solar eclipse occurs when the Sun Moon and Earth align directly a partial Solar Eclipse occurs when a partial shadow of the Moon comes over the Sun covering it partially and leaving a part of the Sun visible. According to NASA a total solar eclipse is visible only when the Moon covers more than 90 percent of the Sun.

A maximum of 5 solar eclipses can occur in a year and this includes all partial annular and total eclipses.

This total solar eclipse that will occur today Saturday comes two weeks after the partial lunar eclipse of 19 November.

Strah who began his career as a meter reader in 1984 replaced fired FirstEnergy Corp. CEO Chuck Jones while the Akron-based company faced a criminal investigation revealed in an astonishing indictment of five people in July 2020. Senior vice presidents Mike Dowling and Dennis Chack also were fired.

Strah said the company needed to make major changes after it was accused of paying $61 million in bribes to put then Republican House Speaker Larry Householder and his team into power and then pass a bailout bill worth $1.3 billion to FirstEnergy and other utilities. The cash was also used to defend House Bill 6 from a referendum.

Special report:How the FBI claims Larry Householder corruptly parlayed $60M into a $1.3B energy bailout

In his first extensive interview as CEO Strah explained why the company agreed to pay $536 million in fines and refunds as part of a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice and discussed FirstEnergy's effort to impose new ethics and compliance rules and training.

""Where I think we're at is there were a number of items that occurred with a group of folks who are no longer with our company. During that process of review and discovery we learned things had to change here significantly"" Strah said from his office at 76. S. Main St. in downtown Akron.

""Obviously there were fundamental things that had to be corrected"" Strah said.

While he answered most questions Strah said he can't and shouldn't talk or speculate on any ongoing discussions and investigation. With Householder's federal charges pending the deferred prosecution agreement also limits comments by FirstEnergy.

""I certainly don't want to comment on a process because I want to respect that process and really make sure it can run its course"" he said. ""And we're going to be right there in an open nature to work with it. Very difficult to speculate at this point. But we're engaged.""

Strah declined to say if he had any role in the drafting and passage of House Bill 6 saying the deferred prosecution agreement speaks to the issue with the conclusions of the company and the Department of Justice. ""It does speak for itself"" he said.

FirstEnergy HB 6 investigations continue

FirstEnergy still faces multiple shareholder lawsuits an investigation by the Securities & Exchange Commission an audit by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and multiple lines of inquiry by PUCO.

In the prosecution agreement announced in July FirstEnergy admitted it conspired to pay millions of dollars to public officials to benefit the utility. The agreement signed by Strah imposes remedial actions FirstEnergy needs to take as part of a new corporate compliance program.

Terms include: continued cooperation payment of a $230 million fine — money it can’t try to recoup from customers or seek a tax deduction forfeit $6.3 million in a dark money account publish on its website political and dark money contributions made in 2021 and going forward and continue improving its ethics and compliance program.

The fine coupled with giving Ohio customers a $306 million refund in upcoming years actually signals significant progress for the company Strah said.

""While I want to stay focused on our future the events of the past year have been very humbling for our company it's been humbling for our management team"" he said. ""But what I think is essential is that we have learned from a number of those issues in that we apply lessons forward at this point and we've done that. Even though we've had to do some very difficult things along the way.""

The core of FirstEnergy's business is a renewed focus on ethics compliance and accountability Strah said.

""The investment community had the instincts to kind of bake in potential impacts"" of the investigations and potential settlements Strah said.

""What they are looking for is certainty"" he said. ""Even though it was a challenging yet fair process we were able to get the deferred prosecution agreement completed. That added certainty for all stakeholders.""

Strah declined to say whether the $230 million settlement with the Department of Justice was negotiated down from a larger figure. He called the fine ""significant. And I understand its significance.""

""It was an effort by our company to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice"" he said. ""And I think that was well received. Therefore we were able to reach the agreement. ... I think the agreement at the end speaks for itself. It really does. ... It was a very open and collaborative process. At the end it was fair.""

""We thought it was important to place that chapter behind us. And very fortunately we were able to do that"" he said.

Moving FirstEnergy forward

FirstEnergy is doing a significant amount of work in the ethics and compliance area Strah said.

""Where we want to be as a company with regard to ethics and compliance is best in class"" he said.

The changes include adding new directors to the board who provide fresh perspectives as well as hiring new top level executives to oversee legal issues ethics and compliance risk rates and regulatory affairs and auditing he said. They are working through key policies and practices and strengthening them he said.

""That sets a new tone for our company. I'm setting a new tone for the company in terms of openness and being collaborative"" he said. ""We are focused as a company all the way to every individual in this organization to simply just do the right thing. ... The only obligation you have is to raise your hand and speak up.""

The result should be not top executives holding employees accountable but employees holding each other accountable and be able to raise their hands in an open environment if they see something that doesn't look or feel right Strah said.

Political contributions limited

Beyond the Householder payments in November 2020 FirstEnergy disclosed to the Securities & Exchange Commission that it paid $4.3 million in January 2019 to someone who went on to be an Ohio utility regulator. Days later FBI agents executed a search warrant at the Columbus condo of attorney Sam Randazzo who was chair of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.

Strah said the company also has thoroughly reviewed how it makes political contributions.

""I think what you're going to find is that we will limit our involvement to a smaller portion of that arena. And it will be directly germane to those initiatives we need to move forward on from a customer or company view"" Strah said. ""I should be able to sit at a customer's kitchen table and explain why we are involved in an issue. ... We have also elevated our transparency in terms of our reporting.""

In particular in Ohio all employees felt the impact of the scandal and investigations involving FirstEnergy Strah said.

""There was really a sense of deep disappointment"" he said. ""It promoted tremendous uncertainty. ... Eventually you have to be patient enough to understand a number of matters were under investigation and you couldn't really tell employees exactly what was going on just for the sanctity of the investigation and not getting out in front of anything which would be a breach of that trust and confidence.""

FirstEnergy needed to demonstrate a significant and rapid pathway to the future of the company Strah said.

""I think the employee mindset now is one of ongoing excitement to go out and embrace the future and not necessarily let the future come to us"" Strah said.

Significant issues in 'rearview mirror'

When he became CEO in the early part of the scandal he and FirstEnergy's management team and board needed to understand the circumstances they were in what transpired and how they would deal with it Strah said. ""Our board of directors were very active participants in the process"" and worked hard and fairly to investigate he said.

""At the time I was president of the company So I was running the operation"" Strah said. ""Even as things transpired I quickly flipped to understand that we had to keep the company moving ahead and develop our renewed plan for the future. That's what we've done and that's what we're fully focused on.""

He's largely focused on the future not House Bill 6.

""I really view that with all respect to be something that's behind us in our rearview mirror"" Strah said. ""We're moving ahead in a very good way as a company the things that we've had to do to rebuild trust and confidence the things that we're doing to make our company more efficient moving forward. ...

In December of 2020 Major League Baseball contracted and consolidated its affiliations with minor league baseball franchises. Reading was offered a license which maintained its affiliation with the Philadelphia Phillies MLB franchise. As part of the new Minor League Baseball license agreements improvements made to stadium facilities at all minor league baseball venues within the next two years.

Improvements needed at FirstEnergy Stadium include among other things the construction of home and away team clubhouses and new player practice and training facilities.

Sen. Judy Schwank (D-11th district) Rep. Mark Rozzi (D-126th) and Rep. Manny Guzman (D-127th) have applauded the funding by Governor Wolf and the Pennsylvania Office of the Budget in support of the renovations.

“Losing the Reading Fightin Phils was never an option and keeping the team in Reading has been one of my top economic development priorities” Schwank said. “Officials from the state county and local level were all on the same page and acted quickly and with urgency to find funding. We really worked together and across party lines to get this done. The R-Phils have a storied history in Berks County as the longest-running minor league affiliate in professional baseball. People who grew up going to games now take their own kids to the ballpark. We would have lost a piece of our heritage our identity as a community and sustained a significant hit to our regional economy. I’m deeply grateful to Gov. Wolf for understanding this team’s role as a crucial driver of economic activity and a source of community identity. Team Owner Craig Stein General Manager Scott Hunsicker the entire R-Phils staff deserve a lot of credit for working tirelessly to ensure that baseball town continues to have a hometown team.”

Funding is expected to be used to construct a three-story structure at FirstEnergy Stadium for the home and visiting clubhouses women’s locker room batting tunnels weight room team laundry equipment storage an indoor event space and other enhancements.

“My priority has always been to protect the legacy and tradition of the Reading Phillies” Rozzi said. “I am proud to bring home the funding necessary to support our mission of preserving FirstEnergy Stadium as the premier minor league ballpark in the country. It is my honor to keep one of the greatest organizations the Fightin Phils right where it belongs here in Reading.”

Guzman added “Like the pinstripes on their jerseys the Reading Phillies are stitched into the fabric of our community. Generations of families have made it a tradition to visit this historic ballpark and root for their home team. I am so grateful this tradition and the memories that come with it will remain steadfast here in Reading.”

Funding from the state is in conjunction with dollars put forward by Fightin Phils ownership and funding promised by the County of Berks and the City of Reading. Addition details about the plans for the stadium renovations is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.",,,,,,,,,

One of the spectators sitting in the back row of tables was former television play-by-play voice Jim Paschke who found it odd he was asked to attend.

Once it appeared all the basketball-related questions were asked there appeared to be one more from the back of the room.

Bucks vice president of communications Dan Smyczek called on club president Peter Feigin and Budenholzer quipped “You’re not asking a question are you?”

“I was going to ask are we ready to get on with the one of the real purposes we’re here for?” Feigin replied.

“Hell yeah!” Budenholzer shouted. “C’mon!”

And with that general manager Jon Horst also took to the podium to join Budenholzer and Feigin in dedicating the room to Paschke who sat stunned as it unfolded.

Paschke retired after 35 seasons behind the microphone following last year’s championship.

“It’s incredibly humbling to be honored like this” he said afterward as he battled his emotions. “It was a great surprise. I don’t know what you say on a night like this or on an event like this. It’s something you never think about. I can’t wait 'til my son (Mike) can come back to Milwaukee and I can bring him in here and let him see it. Very humbling. Very humbling.”

Feigin said Budenholzer was one of the spearheads behind the dedication and the coach quipped he would have to step his game up now that Paschke’s name was on the room. The coach also apologized for breaking NBA decorum for his exclamation.

Paschke’s longtime television partner and 1971 Bucks title winner Jon McGlocklin was in attendance along with many other front office members and current TV and radio broadcasters.

Paschke was presented a framed copy of the Journal Sentinel’s retirement story and another framed copy was hung outside the room along with a plaque that reads in part “In his 35-year award-winning career Jim brought Bucks basketball to television viewers across the state with his familiar silky smooth voice and distinctive style. His extensive preparation professionalism passion humor and inimitable ability to describe the game made him a fan favorite and a Wisconsin treasure. The Bucks sincerely thank Jim for all that he did for the organization.”

Heading into this matchup the Cavs were wanted by the law for indecent exposure due to streaking winning their last four. Well the Jazz are the cops as they brought Cleveland’s streak to an end defeating the Cavs 109-108.

This game was a slugfest and it’s a testament to how the Cavs are able to hang with the league’s elite this time being the Jazz. The game was close heading into halftime with Utah leading 60-55 but when the second half began all hell broke loose for Cleveland.

The Jazz outscored the Cavs 31-27 in the third quarter and it felt like all momentum was in Utah’s corner heading into the fourth. But for whatever reason this Cleveland team just simply will not give up. Darius Garland poured it on scoring 9 of his 31 points in the final period. Rookie big man Evan Mobley meanwhile had a key block on Donovan Mitchell to give Cleveland one final chance to win the game.

Unfortunately the Jazz defended Garland well as his three-point attempt just missed and Utah was able to squeak by with a win. Overall this was a fun game and hopefully a sign of things to come as Cleveland continues to look to play through another brutal stretch in their schedule this week.

Tonight’s game might be just another regular season matchup between the Milwaukee Bucks and Miami Heat – two teams that don’t care for each other – but it’s also the first time that NBA champion forward PJ Tucker returns to Fiserv Forum and will receive his championship ring for his contributions to the team’s title-wing effort last season.

Where We’re At

The basketball game itself that will follow the ring ceremony still matters I suppose. The Bucks just had their 8-game win streak snapped in Toronto and will be looking to start another one tonight. Milwaukee will be similarly short-handed as they were on Thursday with Giannis Antetokounmpo listed as doubtful joining the trio of inactives (Semi Ojeleye Donte DiVincenzo and Brook Lopez). DeMarcus Cousins who was held out for “return to competition conditioning” will hopefully return.

Bucks injury report for Saturday night against the Heat:

- Lopez DiVincenzo and Ojeleye are OUT.

- Giannis Antetokounmpo is doubtful (right calf soreness).

- DeMarcus Cousins (left foot soreness) and George Hill (right knee hyperextension) are probable. — Eric Nehm (@eric_nehm) December 4 2021

Miami will also be short-handed this evening as Jimmy Butler did not make the trip for the Heat’s game against the Pacers last night joining Markieff Morris Victor Oladipo and Bam Adebayo (who just underwent thumb surgery) on the inactive list. Expect heavy doses of Kyle Lowry Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro this evening and expect a lot of small ball lineups from Miami; the tallest available player in their regular rotation after DeWayne Dedmon (7’0”) is Duncan Robinson (6’7”) which means that the front court pair of Bobby Portis and the still-acclimating Boogie Cousins should have a major advantage on the boards.

Player To Watch

Obviously it’s Buck-for-life PJ Tucker! If you haven’t already be sure to read this Journal Sentinel piece from beat writer Jim Owczarski which reflects just how much fondness Tucker holds for the city and hopefully shows the same for Bucks fans and PJ.

P.J. Tucker speaks from the heart on his return to Fiserv Forum: 'I’ll love the people of Milwaukee forever.'

On the court though the 36-year old Tucker has been putting in major minutes. He’s started all 22 games and has logged an average of 27.9 minutes per contest something only exceeded in Miami by Robinson. Out of necessity Tucker will play major minutes again tonight and it will be interesting to see how much effort he puts forth considering how thin the Heat rotation is currently and how overmatched they should be with the nearly-full strength Bucks.

Milwaukee has now won nine of its last 10 to improve to 15-9 while Miami dropped to 14-10 in losing three of four (all without Butler).

Antetokounmpo missed his second straight game with right calf soreness after being a late scratch against Toronto on Thursday. Listed as probable to play on the off day the 26-year-old was downgraded to doubtful following the Bucks’ shootaround Saturday morning. Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer reiterated pre-game that the hope is it a short-term injury.

Starting guard Grayson Allen (illness) also was ruled out for the Bucks while Adebayo had thumb surgery and Butler suffered a tailbone contusion to take them out of action for the Heat.

All those significant absences left the stage open for Milwaukee all-stars Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday and the Heat backcourt of Kyle Lowry and Whitnall High School alumnus Tyler Herro.

And it was Middleton and Holiday who very quickly stole the spotlight as the duo made plays all over the court from the opening tip to allow the Bucks to ease into a victory. Middleton broke out of an extended shooting slump and made 9 of his 18 shots to score 22 points.

“I think I’ve been getting great looks throughout this season even when I came back (from the NBA health and safety protocol)” Middleton said. “Now it’s just about making ‘em be able to have a good base be able to shoot with confidence not hesitate too much. I feel like I’m heading in the right direction as far as makes and being aggressive. Just keeping my foot on the pedal with it.”

He also handed out nine assists while pulling down six rebounds.

Holiday was dominant early and steady throughout scoring 16 points on 6-of-14 shooting. He also got his teammates involved with seven assists.

“I thought he was great” Budenholzer said. “Some of the shots he made we needed that burst out of the gate I think. We got a little bit of separation in the first quarter which tonight I thought was important. Played him a lot in the first quarter and he had a great run there. We needed it.”

Pat Connaughton tied a season-high with 23 points and Bobby Portis recorded his eighth double-double of the season with 19 points and a season-high 16 rebounds.

The Bucks improved to 5-9 when at least one of their “big three” of Antetokounmpo Middleton or Holiday do not play.

“I think it’s different each game because obviously when Giannis isn’t out there you don’t have a freak right?” Connaughton said. “When Khris isn’t out there you don’t have a guy that can make really difficult shots. When Jrue isn’t out there you don’t have somebody that can really compose everybody and get everyone into their spots.

""So you would think you could get comfortable knowing what’s missing but then defenses change and they throw different stuff at you. I think it’s about getting acclimated during the game and then understanding at the end of the day our foundation is playing together right?

""So moving the ball trying to get open looks fire it when you’re open try and get into the paint doing those type of little things. When we flow like that we can play well and score points with anybody regardless of who’s on the floor I believe. I thought we did a lot better of a job tonight of that than we did in Toronto.”

Lowry and Herro were physically harangued all night as the Bucks made sure to not let the pair get their team in the game. Lowry’s night was done with 2 minutes 44 seconds to go in the third quarter after scoring 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting. He was just 1 fo -7 from behind the three-point line but he did have seven assists.

Herro played 33 minutes but he also made just four shots on 17 attempts including just 1 for 6 from three-point range. He made six of his eight free throws to score 15 points on the night to go with nine rebounds and six assists.

“Tried to keep them in front of us as much as possible” Middleton said of the defensive effort on the Heat backcourt. “They’re great players who know how to get downhill create fouls and that creates their rhythm for their jumpshots and what not. It’s just trying to stay in front on the pick and rolls.

""I think our bigs did a great job not necessarily trapping but making them a little bit uncomfortable and going backwards instead of forwards into their spots.”

Max Strus led the Heat with 25 points off the bench.

The outcome was also a bit of rebuttal to the Heat’s 42-point victory in Miami back on Oct. 21 as the Bucks led by as many as 31 when the starters were on the floor. The Bucks scored 26 points off 19 offensive rebounds and out-scored the Heat 48-26 in the paint.

The two teams will play again in Miami on Dec. 9.

Milwaukee was up 105-76 to start the fourth quarter but despite a four-turnover start by the Bucks the Heat were not able to string together enough points quick enough to truly challenge the large lead.

The Bucks used a flurry of offensive rebounds and three-points to key a 16-6 run early in the third quarter that allowed them to stretch their advantage to 85-62 halfway through the period. From there they gradually worked the lead to 30 on late threes by Javonte Smart and Wesley Matthews.

Holiday and Middleton combined for 31 points and eight assists in the first half to stake the Bucks a 69-52 lead at the break. Middleton put a punctuation mark on the effort with a three-pointer with 28.8 seconds left giving the Bucks their largest lead of the opening half.

Holiday set the table for such an advantage by scoring 12 points in the first nine minutes of the game and then DeMarcus Cousins scored six points and had an assist in the final three to help the Bucks to a 34-23 lead after one.

The Heat cut the lead to 43-37 on Lowry’s first basket of the game at the 8:33 mark of the second quarter but then Connaughton scored eight straight points to put the Bucks up 51-37. From there the Bucks led anywhere from 11 to 17 points the rest of the half.

Connaughton had 11 in the half and made three three-pointers. Portis pulled down 10 rebounds.

Lowry went 1 for 7 in the half while Herro was 3 for 11 though he did help get Cousins off the court (four fouls in seven minutes) by driving on the Bucks’ big man.

Even without Antetokounmpo and Cousins in foul trouble Milwaukee outscored Miami 30-14 in the paint.

Rookie Sandro Mamukelashvili (20 minutes five points seven rebounds) made his first career start for the Bucks while Matthews (three points) played 12 minutes in his debut a day after signing.

In his first game back in Milwaukee since helping the Bucks win the NBA championship Heat forward P.J. Tucker had three fouls two points and one rebound in 17 minutes. He received his championship ring before the game following a video tribute and thanked the crowd in a short speech.",,,

No the Raptor doesn’t have a V8 and that’s one knock on it by some. Although my take is it doesn’t really need it as it has ample power and is faster than a regular F-150 by a lot.

Ford’s high output V6 engine does amazing work of propelling the Raptor down the highway off the line and over rugged terrain. The 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 EcoBoost engine yields 450 horsepower and 510 lb.-ft. of torque. Those numbers may look small compared to its main competitor the Ram TRX which has more than 700 horsepower.

But the Raptor drives bigger and badder than the numbers might indicate and there’s even a nice tuned growl emitting from the tail pipe. From a performance standpoint the Raptor is unlike any other Ford truck on the road. For 2022 Ford will produce a V8-power Raptor called the Raptor R.

For 2021 the Raptor boasts new looks that fall in line with the rest of the 14th-gen F-150. But the Raptor has graphics and aesthetics that are exclusive to it including on the hood graphics and over the fenders. Also the Raptor has its own mean aggressive-looking grille. The Raptor logo is emblazoned on the hood scoop as well as the tail gate. Slick decals cover the hood and there’s a Ford Performance emblem along with an American flag near the rear wheel. All in all it’s a well assembled and completed look that shows this isn’t just an F-150 but a truck that oozes machismo.

Inside the special Raptor touches continue with the logo prominently displayed on the interior. The best thing about this 2021 Raptor that is so much better than the 2017 is that it gets all the great upgrades that the regular F-150 gets too including a fold-flat work surface. The gear shift retracts with the push of a button and a compartment from the center console folds up and over to create a flat workspace perfect for laptops and paperwork.

A 12-inch touchscreen runs Ford’s brand-new Sync 4 system which makes it one of the best infotainment systems in the industry now. There is under seat storage in the massive second row too.

Another small feature that might go unnoticed are the adjustable pedals. This helps the driver get into the perfect driving position so they can go flying down the road or traverse down a rocky hillside. The Raptor is all things it hopes to be in that regard.

The Raptor has a starting price of $65840 which makes it significantly more expensive than most F-150 trims. The Raptor with its four-wheel drive high-performance engine and 10-speed automatic transmissions tries hard to improve upon fuel economy and it does versus the 2017 version (just barely). As such the EPA rating for the 2021 F-150 Raptor is 14 mpg/city and 18 mpg/highway. Even with high fuel prices you just don’t care about how much gas you’re consuming because this truck is just so much fun.

Even if you’re not a truck person the Raptor is a pickup that will always be memorable and enjoyable. I thought the 2017 was the best pickup truck I’ve ever driven and now the 2021 version is making me reconsider that.

How Much Does a Ford Extended Warranty Cost?

Your Ford extended warranty cost will depend on your vehicle’s model age and mileage. Ford does not publish costs online but we were able to find prices reported by drivers and determined that the average cost of a Ford extended warranty is about $2960. This price is fair compared to industry-leading third-party providers. Here’s how that average breaks down:

However your Ford extended warranty cost may differ from these quotes. The price of coverage will vary depending on many factors including:

Level of coverage you choose

Age and mileage of your vehicle

Type of Ford you drive

Deductible you choose

Ford extended warranties come with the choice of a $0 $50 $100 or $200 deductible. Keep in mind that you may be able to negotiate a lower Ford extended warranty cost if you purchase coverage at a dealership.

Ford Extended Warranty Benefits

All Ford extended warranties from the dealer include the following benefits:

Towing: Up to $100 per occurrence

Up to $100 per occurrence Trip interruption coverage: Maximum of $500 total for up to three days of lodging and meals

Maximum of $500 total for up to three days of lodging and meals Destination assistance: Up to $75

Rental car benefits: Up to 10 days of coverage

All plans can be canceled at any time and are fully transferable which can make your car more attractive to potential buyers if you plan on selling in the future.

Is the Ford Extended Warranty Cost Worth It?

When trying to decide if the Ford extended warranty cost is worth it it’s smart to try to predict what kind of coverage your car will need. All new Fords come with the following vehicle protection plans:

Bumper-to-bumper new vehicle limited warranty: 3 years/36000 miles

3 years/36000 miles Powertrain warranty: 5 years/60000 miles

5 years/60000 miles Safety restraint warranty: 5 years/60000 miles

Corrosion protection: 5 years/unlimited miles

Emissions coverage: 8 years/80000 miles

You should also honestly assess your finances and see if they could withstand the blow of one of these major breakdowns commonly reported to RepairPal by Ford owners:

Spark plug replacement: $121 to $238

$121 to $238 Head gasket replacement: $1765 to $2870

$1765 to $2870 Alternator replacement: $512 to $1047

$628 to $1004 Valve cover replacement: $164 to $899

$164 to $899 Heater core replacement: $726 to $1478

While you may not encounter all of these repairs during your vehicle’s lifetime a Ford extended warranty can give you peace of mind to know you won’t be stuck paying out of pocket when issues do arise. Vehicle reliability is another thing to consider when deciding whether the Ford extended warranty cost is worth it. These fast facts from RepairPal may help you get a better sense of Ford’s reliability:

Ford placed 21st out of 32 car brands in RepairPal’s most recent reliability rankings which means the manufacturer is below average in terms of reliability.

The average annual repair cost for a Ford is $775 which is higher than the industry-wide average of $652.

Fords need about 0.3 visits to the repair shop per year compared to the industry standard of 0.4 meaning Ford owners may encounter fewer issues than average per year.

Across all Ford models the likelihood of a repair being severe is 15 percent which is 3 percent higher than the industry average. RepairPal classifies severe repairs as those costing more than 3 times the average annual repair cost.

Based on the short factory warranty terms low reliability and high average repair expenses the Ford extended warranty cost may be well worth it for many drivers.

Benefits of a Third-Party Warranty Company

If you’re considering a Ford extended warranty or if your vehicle is no longer eligible for Ford coverage you should look into third-party alternatives. While Ford extended warranty costs and plan options from the dealer may fit your needs and budget getting coverage independent of a dealership can give drivers more flexibility in terms of coverage options monthly payment plans added perks repair facility requirements and more.

Described by Time as the sharpest idea man in Detroit the product manager that gave us the original Bronco in 1965 for the 1966 model year worked together with Lee Iacocca to bring the Mustang to market. As you can tell from these monikers both models are strongly connected to one another.

Iacocca was instrumental in designing the Mustang which had been pursued by Frey with equal determination after Henry Ford II had rejected the idea a whopping four times. In an article from 2004 published by Northwestern  Frey also credits his kids for making the Mustang happen.“I clearly remember sitting around the dining room table and my kids saying ‘Dad your cars stink. They're terrible. There's no pizzazz.' That started the whole thing.” If you browse through a brochure of the 1960 lineup you’ll understand why Fords were regarded that way in that era.Amid the incredible commercial success of the Mustang pony car that sold a million examples within two years of its launch both Frey and Iacocca were looking to enter the off-road vehicle market to steal customers away from the Jeep CJ-5 and International Scout 80. They also wanted to attract a plethora of buyers that wouldn’t have considered such a vehicle in the first place which is why the first-generation Bronco had to break the mold.Contrary to current trends in the automotive industry it’s utmost necessary to mention that utility vehicles were the exact opposite of popular back then. Jeep and International didn’t sell too many CJ-5s and Scouts in the early ‘60s but Ford’s power duo wasn’t disheartened by these circumstances.Come 1962 the Dearborn-based automaker extensively surveyed CJ-5 and Scout owners to understand what they like and loathe about their off-roaders. A memo dated July 11th 1963 noted that both had poor comfort rode pretty rough and thewas unsatisfactory. That’s all Frey and Iacocca needed to start working on the Bronco which sweetened the deal with gorgeous exterior styling and a powerful name just like the ‘Stang.October 23rd 1963 is when the Product Planning Committee received the recommendation for a brand-new utility vehicle codenamed Bronco. Just a week later the G.O.A.T. acronym that stands for Goes Over All Terrain was used in an internal memo to indicate the newcomer’s off-road prowess.McKinley Thompson the first African American automobile designer working for the Ford Motor Company is credited with penning the earliest sketches of the Bronco in July 1963. Don Frey describes the Bronco as “neither a conventional car nor a truck but as a vehicle which combines the best of both worlds. It can serve as a family sedan as sports roadster as a snowplow or as a farm or civil defense vehicle.” Coincidence or not the boxy Bronco rolled out for the 1966 model year in 1965 with three body styles.Wagon is how the Blue Oval marketed the utility vehicle Sports Utility Vehicle referred to the half-cab truck and the open-air version was called Roadster. Although it sounds fairly exotic the Roadster was the least expensive Bronco because the doors and roof were optional extras. The spartan configuration translated to abysmal sales totaling 5000 units in three years of production making the Roadster an extremely desirable blue-chip collectible.The second-rarest body style is the pickup with 17262 units while the two-door wagon survived until 1977 with precisely 203535 units to its name. These body styles are also called U14 for the half-cab truck and U15 for the utility vehicle while the Roadster features a VIN that begins with U13.Developed on a dedicated chassis not shared with any other Ford Lincoln or Mercury model the Bronco offered four-wheel drive as standard to simplify production. The attached brochure for the 1966 model year notes 32.1 cubic feet (909 liters) of cargo capacity Mono-Beam front suspension a 33.6-foot turning radius and a wheelbase of 92 inches (233.68 centimeters).Two engines were available in the first year of production a 170-cubic-inch sixer with 105 gross horsepower on deck and a 289-cubic-inch V8 with 200 ponies. Both were complemented by a synchronized three-speed manual transmission a Dana 20 shift-on-the-fly transfer case a Dana 30 front axle and a Ford 9.0-inch rear axle. The front axle was replaced by the Dana 44 in 1971 and the front drum brakes were utilized until 1976 when a pair of rotors became available as an option. In addition the steering box was upgraded with a quicker ratio (3.8 turns instead of 5.3 turns).Ford enlarged the 289 engine to 302 cubic inches for the 1969 model year and for 1973 the base 170 engine was replaced by a 200 straight-six. 1973 is also the year the Ford Motor Company offered a three-speed automatic transmission a change that was best seen in the sales figures for 1974.The Bronco was never the same again with the introduction of the second generation in 1977 for the 1978 model year on F-100 underpinnings instead of a unique platform. Ford had to make the transition to the full-sizesegment because of the Chevrolet K5 Blazer. The Bronco soldiered on with F-Series bits and pieces until 1996 when the nameplate was dropped in favor of the Expedition to better compete with the Suburban and GMC Yukon.Revived for the 2021 model year the sixth-generation Bronco features the T6.2 platform that also underpins the 2023 Ranger mid-size workhorse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nL2ZvcmRzLWJsdWUtb3ZhbC1jaXR5LXByb2plY3QtcmVjcnVpdC10aG91c2FuZHMtd29ya2Vycy1ydXJhbC10ZW5u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford's Blue Oval City project has big task: Recruit workers to rural Tenn.,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/fords-blue-oval-city-project-recruit-thousands-workers-rural-tenn on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nL2ZvcmRzLWJsdWUtb3ZhbC1jaXR5LXByb2plY3QtcmVjcnVpdC10aG91c2FuZHMtd29ya2Vycy1ydXJhbC10ZW5u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZXVyb3dlZWtseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvZm9yZC12YWxlbmNpYS11bmRlci10aHJlYXQtb2YtY2xvc3VyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford Valencia under threat of closure « Euro Weekly News,"By Peter McLaren-Kennedy • Published: 05 Dec 2021 • 10:50

Sourc e https://2.bp.blogspot.com

Ford Motor Company is well known for its internal bidding model whereby their factories around the world are required to compete to build the company’s vehicles. This year is somewhat different with the pandemic having changed the sector and placing the Ford Valencia under threat.

The Almussafes plant just outside Valencia City is amongst the largest operations run by the company outside of the United States employing 7000 workers and producing 450000 vehicles a year. Currently Ford manufacture the Mondeo Galaxy Kuga Transit Connect Tourneo Connect and S-Max models at the plant.

For Ford costs are an issue

The motor industry is struggling with competition rife not only amongst brands but also internally amongst manufacturing plants. Ford is no different and is looking for its manufacturing hubs to reduce costs having proposed wage cuts in several of its European plants. The plant that is unable to meet the Detroit based company’s request will most likely disappear with the winner likely to build Ford’s new passenger and electric models for the European market.

The Valencian plant is having discussions with the Saarbrücker Zeitung and the Saarlouis plants in an effort to find common ground in dealing with the issue.

Union discussing the closure

Discussions are ongoing in Valencia between the management and the unions who both understand that the Ford Valencia plant is under threat and that they need to find cost savings. Currently the two parties are far apart with time running out. Sources from the works council say that “If we say that we lower our salary a few percent they will lower it by another 0.5%”.

Key dates for Ford Valencia

Plants are required to submit their proposals on cost savings and public aid by the end of January with the the head office of the company issuing by no later than the June 30th.

Impact of Ford Valencia Closure

Should the plant not be successful in their efforts to reduce costs and in the process lose out in the bidding war the possible closure of the facility would be a major blow for the region. Not only would the 7000 directly employed in the plant lose their job it would have major impact on other local businesses supplying the plant and on the operation of the port.

Everyone in the region should be concerned that the Ford Valencia is under threat.

This month we’ll be highlighting some of the year’s most exciting international films. First up: Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s heightened ""Memoria"" and another fascinating collaboration between Pedro Almodóvar and Penélope Cruz.

""Memoria"" review: Tilda Swinton captivates despite a disappointing twist

Photo: NEON.

Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s films are a test of patience and ""Memoria"" continues the Thai filmmaker’s fondness for unconventionality and immersion. His short film ""Night Colonies"" in the anthology film ""The Year of the Everlasting Storm"" involved only a few elements—a light a swarm of bugs and the camera filming their movements—but through its abstraction communicated the push-pull nature of attraction and repulsion. ""Memoria"" is a far broader effort but the attempt it makes to understand some integral component of human behavior and some shared sort of universal history evokes that short film.

Tilda Swinton stars as Scottish ex-pat Jessica who lives in Medellin selling flowers travels to Bogotá to visit her ill sister and one night hears a loud booming sound. Jessica has never heard anything like it before and commits herself to tracking down what it could be. Her wandering quest takes her into refrigerator stores and public parks a hospital morgue and a skeleton-excavation project a recording studio and the jungle.

""Memoria"" demands attention as Swinton moves in real-time through spaces places and even time to find this sound that seems like it’s ""from the core of the Earth"" and this role plays to the actress’s stillness and carefully controlled reactions. But as the film’s final third becomes a series of unfurling monologues between Swinton and scene partner Elkin Díaz the explanation offered for the sound is so self-serious that it actually becomes quite silly.

The impact of the bond Swinton and Díaz develop over the film’s last half-hour might mitigate the explanation for some and there is an argument to be made that perhaps the sound itself is irrelevant. But ""Memoria"" disappoints with that narrative twist which threatens to overshadow the carefully controlled stillness and rawness from Swinton and the film’s other actors.

Not rated. 136 minutes. Dir: Apichatpong Weerasethakul. Language: English Spanish. Featuring: Tilda Swinton Elkin Díaz Jeanne Balibar Juan Pablo Urrego Daniel Giménez Cacho. In limited theaters Dec. 26.

""Parallel Mothers"" review: Pedro Almodóvar’s latest must-see embraces the complexity of the human heart

Photo: Sony Pictures Classics.

Pedro Almodóvar always knows exactly what he’s doing. In playing with tone and form Almodóvar consistently manages to merge camp and melancholy into pointed explorations of the past and imaginations of the future. His eye for production design (those luxe yet lived-in home interiors!) is as immaculate as his understanding of the emotional storms waging in us as we navigate love experience loss grow older and honor the ghosts of our ancestors.

Repeat collaborator Penélope Cruz stars in his latest must-see ""Parallel Mothers"" as Janis a successful editorial photographer who becomes pregnant after a passionate tryst with forensic anthropologist Arturo (Israel Elejalde). While in the hospital to give birth Janis befriends the younger Ana (Milena Smit) who is having her child without much support from her own mother.

After Janis and Ana are discharged they fall out of touch but reconnect months later to forge a relationship that showcases the variability of women’s lives. Friend sister mother daughter lover survivor—are all of our identities tied up in our responsibilities to others or is there something about individual identity that exists outside of those bonds and bounds?

""Parallel Mothers"" leads us down one narrative path with purposeful melodrama and kitsch generating an endless stream of gasping shock and then incorporates a deliberate humane nod toward the lingering and devastating impact of Spain’s Civil War. We all live with wounds but ""Parallel Mothers"" makes clear how they are just one part of a body and Cruz leads a uniformly excellent ensemble that shows us the complexity of the human heart.

Rated R. 123 minutes. Dir: Pedro Almodóvar. Language: Spanish. Featuring: Penélope Cruz Israel Elejalde Milena Smit Rossy de Palma Aitana Sánchez-Gijón. In select theaters Dec. 24.

""Memoria"" and ""Parallel Mothers"" were reviewed out of the 2021 Virginia Film Festival.

This month we’ll be highlighting some of the year’s most exciting international films. First up: Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s heightened ""Memoria"" and another fascinating collaboration between Pedro Almodóvar and Penélope Cruz.

""Memoria"" review: Tilda Swinton captivates despite a disappointing twist

Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s films are a test of patience and ""Memoria"" continues the Thai filmmaker’s fondness for unconventionality and immersion. His short film ""Night Colonies"" in the anthology film ""The Year of the Everlasting Storm"" involved only a few elements—a light a swarm of bugs and the camera filming their movements—but through its abstraction communicated the push-pull nature of attraction and repulsion. ""Memoria"" is a far broader effort but the attempt it makes to understand some integral component of human behavior and some shared sort of universal history evokes that short film.

Tilda Swinton stars as Scottish ex-pat Jessica who lives in Medellin selling flowers travels to Bogotá to visit her ill sister and one night hears a loud booming sound. Jessica has never heard anything like it before and commits herself to tracking down what it could be. Her wandering quest takes her into refrigerator stores and public parks a hospital morgue and a skeleton-excavation project a recording studio and the jungle.

""Memoria"" demands attention as Swinton moves in real-time through spaces places and even time to find this sound that seems like it’s ""from the core of the Earth"" and this role plays to the actress’s stillness and carefully controlled reactions. But as the film’s final third becomes a series of unfurling monologues between Swinton and scene partner Elkin Díaz the explanation offered for the sound is so self-serious that it actually becomes quite silly.

The impact of the bond Swinton and Díaz develop over the film’s last half-hour might mitigate the explanation for some and there is an argument to be made that perhaps the sound itself is irrelevant. But ""Memoria"" disappoints with that narrative twist which threatens to overshadow the carefully controlled stillness and rawness from Swinton and the film’s other actors.

Not rated. 136 minutes. Dir: Apichatpong Weerasethakul. Language: English Spanish. Featuring: Tilda Swinton Elkin Díaz Jeanne Balibar Juan Pablo Urrego Daniel Giménez Cacho. In limited theaters Dec. 26.

""Parallel Mothers"" review: Pedro Almodóvar’s latest must-see embraces the complexity of the human heart

Photo: Sony Pictures Classics.

Pedro Almodóvar always knows exactly what he’s doing. In playing with tone and form Almodóvar consistently manages to merge camp and melancholy into pointed explorations of the past and imaginations of the future. His eye for production design (those luxe yet lived-in home interiors!) is as immaculate as his understanding of the emotional storms waging in us as we navigate love experience loss grow older and honor the ghosts of our ancestors.

Repeat collaborator Penélope Cruz stars in his latest must-see ""Parallel Mothers"" as Janis a successful editorial photographer who becomes pregnant after a passionate tryst with forensic anthropologist Arturo (Israel Elejalde). While in the hospital to give birth Janis befriends the younger Ana (Milena Smit) who is having her child without much support from her own mother.

After Janis and Ana are discharged they fall out of touch but reconnect months later to forge a relationship that showcases the variability of women’s lives. Friend sister mother daughter lover survivor—are all of our identities tied up in our responsibilities to others or is there something about individual identity that exists outside of those bonds and bounds?

""Parallel Mothers"" leads us down one narrative path with purposeful melodrama and kitsch generating an endless stream of gasping shock and then incorporates a deliberate humane nod toward the lingering and devastating impact of Spain’s Civil War. We all live with wounds but ""Parallel Mothers"" makes clear how they are just one part of a body and Cruz leads a uniformly excellent ensemble that shows us the complexity of the human heart.

Rated R. 123 minutes. Dir: Pedro Almodóvar. Language: Spanish. Featuring: Penélope Cruz Israel Elejalde Milena Smit Rossy de Palma Aitana Sánchez-Gijón. In select theaters Dec. 24.

""Memoria"" and ""Parallel Mothers"" were reviewed out of the 2021 Virginia Film Festival.

Your guide to Garmin watches for swimming,"If you like to spend your exercise time on land and in the water having a watch or fitness tracker that can survive a dip in the pool is likely to be something quite high up on your features wish list.

The good news is that if you’re casting your eye over a Garmin the wearable maker does a pretty good job of making sure its collection of devices are fit for the water.

Whether that’s letting you it’s for weekly swim workouts or getting in the sea for some open water action Garmin applies a water rating to all of its latest devices. These ratings dictate how water resistant or waterproof they are and what activities they’re actually most suitable for.

If you’re looking for the one that can really go the distance we’ve detailed each watch and what they’re capable of when it’s time to grab your goggles.

Which Garmins are water resistant?

Garmin Fenix 6 Series | water resistance rating: 100 meters The Fenix 6 is Garmin’s flagship 'adventure' watch and each model in the series is suitable for pool swimming and heading into the open water. All of the Fenix 6 models offer dedicated modes for pool open water and swimrun activities along with dedicated pool-based workouts to put an extra training edge on your swim sessions.

Garmin Instinct Series | water resistance rating: 100 meters The Instinct is another rugged outdoor watch from Garmin. While it doesn’t quite match the Fenix for features it does offer the same water resistant rating of up to 100 meters. It also includes swim tracking modes for pool and open water swimming offering a variety of metrics to analyze during or after your workout.

Garmin Venu | water resistance rating: 50 meters The Venu was the first Garmin watch to feature an AMOLED colour display and you can take it to up to 50 meters underwater. It offers a pool swim tracking mode only (nothing for outdoor swimmers) but it can track lengths track Swolf efficiency scores and recognize stroke type all of which you can review in Garmin’s Connect app post-swim.

Garmin Vivoactive 4/4S | water resistance rating: 50 meters Both versions of the Garmin Vivoactive 4 are equipped to be submerged in water of up to 50 meters. There’s also support for tracking pool swimming sessions letting you set up time and distance alerts. There’s the promise of measuring heart rate to assess effort levels when you’re powering through your front crawl too.

Garmin Vivomove | water resistance rating: 50 meters The Vivomove is Garmin’s hybrid analog/digital smartwatch and all models in the family are suitable for swimming or jumping in the shower with. Tracking what you do in the pool is bit more basic than other Garmin watches but it still gives you some data to pore over when you’ve dried off.

Garmin Vivofit Jr 2 | water resistance rating: 50 meters Garmin’s kids' fitness tracker is suitable to be submerged in water up to 50 meters even if it’s highly unlikely your little ones will anywhere near water that deep. You won’t find any specific swim tracking features here but the water resistance does at least make it a more durable wearable for them to live with.

Garmin Forerunner 945 | water resistance rating: 50 meters The 945 is designed for triathletes so it’s no surprise to find it’s fit to live in the water up to 50 meters depth. It offers dedicated swim tracking modes for the pool open water and swimrun including a host of metrics and the ability to pair it up with an external heart rate monitor for more reliable effort insights.

Garmin Forerunner 245/245 Music | water resistance rating: 50 meters The follow-up to the very popular 235 the 245 (with or without music storage) offers the same water resistance rating but adds a pool swimming mode giving you a bigger hit of swim tracking data including pace stroke count and the ability to follow swim-based workouts.

Garmin Forerunner 45/45s | water resistance rating: 50 meters The Forerunner 45 and 45s are watches predominantly designed for runners and cyclists but they do carry a 5ATM water rating. That does mean it’s safe to get in the water wearing one even if you’re not able to track specific swim metrics with it.

Garmin Approach S62 | water resistance rating: 50 meters The Approach S62 is a golf watch and it’s fit for water hazards as well as the putting green. It’s safe to be submerged up to 50 meters and includes a pool swim tracking profile offering metrics like average pace stroke count and Swolf efficiency scores.

Garmin Vivosmart 4 | water resistance rating: 50 meters Garmin’s super slim fitness tracker is water resistant up to 50 meters and keeps things basic in terms of what you can track. You’ll be able set up a simple rest timer and record swim intervals and pool lengths to look over when you’re done.

Garmin Swim 2 | water resistance rating: 50 meters It’s no surprise that the Swim 2 is fit for the water. The follow-up to the Swim has tracking profiles for pool and open water swimming and includes all the usual metrics. It also offers an auto rest mode for when you need to take a breather between lengths and sets and a countdown start to let you get into swimming position.

Garmin Vivosport | water resistance rating: 50 meters The Vivosport is the only Garmin fitness band with built-in GPS and also carries a 50 meter water resistance rating. It lacks a dedicated swim tracking profile but it is safe to shower and take in the water when you’re cooling off from the activities it's capable of tracking.

Garmin Vivofit 4 | water resistance rating: 50 meters The Vivofit 4 is Garmin’s budget fitness tracker which can offer a year’s worth of battery life and during that time is safe to be submerged in water up to 50 meters depth. Despite its low price it offers a rest timer for pool swimming to make it more useful when you jump into the water.

Garmin Marq Collection | water resistance rating: 100 meters Garmin’s luxury watch collection all come with the same water rating which makes them safe to live in water up to 100 meters deep. It matches Garmin’s Fenix range for swimming features and if you opt for the Marq Captain you’ll get a host of modes that make it a great sailing companion too.

What do Garmin's water ratings mean?

Garmin notes on its website that it rigorously tests its devices to make sure they're suitable for the kind of water-based activities they’re designed for. It also lists what each water rating means and determines what activities it can handle to make sure your wearable remains fully functioning after it’s had a watery encounter.

Those two water ratings feature an IP rating or in the case of most of Garmin’s wearables these days an ATM rating. When talking about IP or Ingress Protection ratings we're referring to a standard created by the International Electrotechnical Commission. This commission is used to determine how well sealed electrical devices are to withstand moisture and things like dirt.

Some older non-wearable Garmin devices include an IPX7 water rating. This is defined as something that is able to withstand incidental exposure to water up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes. That means it’s something that’s good for splashes rain snow and showering. A device with an IPX6 rating is protected against powerful jets of water and is the kind of device suitable for a driving rain or outdoor use in rough sea conditions.

As we said most Garmin watches and trackers adopt the ATM (atmosphere) water rating which determines that it has been tested in laboratory to withstand static pressure for a short period of time at a certain depth.

So if you see a Garmin watch or tracker with a 5ATM or 'Swim' rating this is something that able to withstand pressures equivalent to a depth of 50 meters. It doesn’t really mean that it’s suitable for diving at those depths more being suitable for shallow water activities. That means splashes rain snow showering swimming diving into water and even snorkelling.

A Garmin with a 10ATM water rating is defined as something that can withstand pressure to a depth of 100 meters offering all the same situations where a 5ATM rated device is suitable as well as offer as well being a good fit for high-speed water sports.

Most Garmin wearables offer a 5ATM rating at the very least or a 10ATM rating for something that’s designed to spend more time in the water. Garmin outlines what all of its water ratings mean on its website if you’re still unsure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGVzcGxpdC5jb20vbWVldHMvNDM5MzgxLWdhcm1pbi1ydW5uaW5nbGFuZS1jcm9zcy1jb3VudHJ5LWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcHMtMjAyMS9waG90b3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin RunningLane Cross Country Championships 2021 - Photo Albums,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1bm5lcnNwYWNlLmNvbS9ncHJvZmlsZS5waHA_bWdyb3VwX2lkPTQ0NTMxJmRvPW5ld3MmbmV3c19pZD02MzAxODLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DyeStat.com - News - Newbury Park Makes Historic Statement at Garmin RunningLane XC Championships,"Colin Sahlman Leo Young Lex Young Run To 1-2-3 Finish In Alabama With Spectacular 5000m Times

By Doug Binder DyeStat Editor

Newbury Park's flair for the incomparable went to a new level Saturday in a festive atmosphere at the Garmin RunningLane Championships at John Hunt Park in Huntsville Ala.

Running on a fast course that produced hundreds – if not thousands – of PR performances across a slate of events the US#1 Newbury Park guys lived up to every bit of the hype and delivered a race for the ages.

1. Colin Sahlman 14:03.39

2. Leo Young 14:05.07

3. Lex Young 14:05.49

The three teammates all ran faster than Dathan Ritzenhein's celebrated boys high school cross country 5000-meter best of 14:10.4 set at the 2000 Michigan state championships.

Fourth man Aaron Sahlman finished sixth in 14:14.38 and fifth runner Daniel Appleford was 42nd overall (18th in the team scoring) at 14:44.92.

The super-quick times at John Hunt Park were expected but still the numbers on the board were impressive. The leaders went through the first mile in 4:29-4:30 slowed a bit in the tougher second mile and then Sahlman closed in 4:21.9 for a final mile with the Young twins just a second behind him.

""I've never seen a group of guys that was so willing to hurt together"" Leo Young said. ""We were all in agony together but it was so much fun. The results came from that. That's what we've been working for all season.""

Newbury Park XC won the team championship with an unthinkable score of 29 points. REAL Training COS (Cheyenne Mountain CO) was second with 121 points and Stumptown XC (Jesuit OR) was third with 187. That order went to form.

""I think we're all feeling pretty good right now"" Colin Sahlman said. ""We all gave it 100 percent out here on the course like we wanted to. It was the last race of the season so we just gave it our all today.""

The only two runners to break up Newbury Park's top four were NIWOT's Zane Bergen (14:09.91) and Michigan and Eastbay Midwest champion Riley Hough (14:10.56).

In the girls gold race Natalie Cook of Flower Mound TX the Eastbay South region winner last week showed dominance as she approached Jenna Hutchins' course record and national best from 2020 with a winning time of 16:03.93. Hutchins won the inaugural RunningLane meet last year in 15:58.42 and became the first girl to run under 16 minutes in 5000-meter cross country race in the U.S.

NIWOT of Colorado won the girls championship with 112 points led by Eva Klingbeil's seventh-place finish overall (16:44.69). The team was helped by the addition of Sierra Parks who had been forced to sit out all fall and finished fifth for the group Saturday.

""The whole time I was thinking about my teammates"" Klingbeil said. ""I knew everyone was running so hard for each other and knowing that we all wanted it so much.""

Buchanan XC followed its victory at the California Division 1 state meet last week with a second-place finish with 139 points. Arap Distance (Arapahoe CO) was third with 209 points and Kroy (York IL) was fourth with 212.

Cook moved to an eight-second lead between the first and second mile ahead of Indiana state champion Lily Cridge California Division 2 state champion Dalia Frias (of Beach Cities) and Colorado 5A state champion Riley Stewart (Colorado Bruins).

Cridge finished 19 seconds behind Cook in second in 16:22.81. Stewart was third in 16:28.38 Jenna Mulhern (unattached/Pennsylvania) was fourth in 16:29.51 and Frias took fifth (16:37.20).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGVzcGxpdC5jb20vdmlkZW9zLzUwOTc5NC9ydWJlbi1iZXRhbnpvcy10eC1wb3N0LXJhY2UtaW50ZXJ2aWV30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ruben Betanzos (TX) post race interview | Garmin RunningLane Cross Country Championships,"Folders

At AXA France Vie – Reinsurance Branch in India the company maintained its traditional way of budgeting even after the pandemic but it reviews its quarterly forecasts every month now compared to once in two months before the pandemic.

""Flexibility is a core element; you cannot fix something for the future and say that it is going to be the result"" said Gaurav Jain FCMA CGMA the CFO of AXA India. ""There will be changes based on the actual performance of the organisation [and] there are a lot of factors that affect it.""

Jain added that what used to be a once-a-year process through email to prepare for the following year's budget is now more collaborative and discussion-based and happens throughout the year with more departments involved.

""We ask teams to have more regular meetings with us so we understand where the numbers are going and whether their assumptions earlier still stand"" he said.

Such frequent discussions helped the finance department provide recommendations and enabled the business to give feedback on the budgeted resources Jain said. The regular forecast reviews also help finance ensure that each department receives the necessary resources to achieve numbers in the budget.

""If you don't remain flexible and do it [budgeting and forecasting] once a year then you almost lose a year [when budgets go off]"" Jain said. ""With this improvement I think people have become more serious about budgeting and forecasting and teams understand the necessity for a regular review and flexibility in the budget.""

SMEs more concerned with rebuilding revenue

Small businesses have a different view when it comes to forecasting. Many small and medium enterprises do not have the resources and time to spend on budgeting and forecasting said Paul Gardner ACMA CGMA founder and CEO of Fresh Accounting a Hong Kong-based accounting firm. Rather SMEs have an approximation of the revenue costs and profit to expect he said.

""With the ongoing supply chain challenges in Hong Kong and China most SMEs will say they don't have the time to budget"" said Gardner whose firm provides monthly accounting business planning and financial review and audit and tax services to SMEs in the region. ""We're just trying to survive.""

But Gardner said that for small businesses to succeed in the long term it is critical for them to have the financial discipline to forecast and have a better understanding of financial tools. For SMEs an improvement in forecasting could be as simple as reviewing their budgets more frequently and making small changes when needed.

Gardner said companies need to continuously review their incremental costs as revenues grow giving the example of the rising shipping costs resulting from a global backlog of container shipments.

And there are increasingly more accounting tools designed for SMEs to help the forecasting and review process Gardner said. Cloud accounting and cash flow forecasting software have become more accessible for smaller companies and they help business owners gain a clearer view of their financial numbers.

As for priorities small businesses are focusing more resources on rebuilding relationships partnerships and their revenue base.

""This is where SMEs differ from a multinational firm in that SMEs don't have the full finance team in house"" he said. ""For most businesses the priority is to hustle. They want a new deal or to sell something today.""

Even with uncertainties and the inherent difficulty in pinning down exact numbers for a budget in 2022 Gardner said that SMEs still prefer having a budget and try to set a revenue target based on past performance.

""We know 2020 was a really tough year and we know it could be better"" he said. ""For our clients they would still want to use that as the base and build back up.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vbWFraW5nLXRoZS10b2JhY2NvLWluZHVzdHJ5LXBheS1mb3ItY2lnYXJldHRlLWxpdHRlci1jb3VsZC1zdG9wLTQtNS1iaWxsaW9uLWJ1dHRzLXBvbGx1dGluZy10aGUtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC0xNzE4MzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Making the tobacco industry pay for cigarette litter could stop 4.5 billion butts polluting the Australian environment,"Cigarette butts with filters are the most commonly littered item worldwide with a staggering 4.5 trillion of them tossed into the environment each year. This is a huge problem; many end up on beaches and in the ocean and the tar from burnt tobacco in the filter can be toxic to wildlife.

Fixing the problem has focused on changing the behaviour of people who smoke but a new report shows making the tobacco industry responsible for the litter with a mandatory product stewardship scheme is likely to have a much greater impact.

In Australia alone it’s estimated up to 8.9 billion butts are littered each year. Under the proposed scheme we could potentially reduce this by 4.45 billion a year.

So how can it be done in practice? And what would the benefits be from a policy like this?

Social and environmental costs

Cigarette filters are made of a bioplastic called cellulose acetate and they typically take years to break down. Smoked cigarette filters are infused with the same chemicals and heavy metals in the tar that harm humans when they smoke.

Research from 2019 found adding cigarette butts to soil reduces the germination of grass and clover seeds and the length of their shoots. Seaworms exposed to used filters have DNA damage and reduced growth.

And exposure to cigarette filters (even unsmoked ones) are toxic to fish – research with two fish species found adding two to four smoked cigarette filters per litre of water could kill them.

Currently the tobacco industry does not have to pay for the clean-up of cigarette butts polluting the environment. Rather the community bears the cost. Cigarette litter and its management costs the Australian economy an estimated A$73 million per year.

Local councils in particular spend large amounts of money cleaning it up. The City of Sydney for example has estimated their cleaning crews sweep up 15000 cigarette butts daily from city streets.

And volunteers spend countless hours picking up cigarette butts from parks streets and beaches. In its 2020 Rubbish Report Clean Up Australia Day found cigarette butts accounted for 16% of all recorded items.

Current strategies are ineffective

The tobacco industry response to product waste has been to focus responsibility on the consumer. Tobacco companies have created public education campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the butt litter problem supplied consumers and cities worldwide with public ashtrays and funded anti-litter groups.

But given the amount of cigarettes that continue to be littered it’s clear these strategies on their own have been ineffective. Many around the world are now calling for stronger industry regulation.

There have also been calls to ban cigarette filters completely. For example lawmakers in California and New York have attempted to ban the sale of cigarettes with filters and New Zealand is finalising their Smokefree Aotearoa Action Plan which may include a cigarette filter ban.

Many jurisdictions in Australia and worldwide are starting to ban single-use plastics such as straws and takeaway containers and have been criticised for not including cigarette filters in these laws.

If filters were banned cigarette butt litter would remain but without the plastic filter. Although a recent trial of cigarettes without filters found that people smoked fewer of these than when they were given the same cigarettes with filters. More research is needed on the health impact of smoking filterless cigarettes and the environmental impact of filterless cigarette butts.

What would a stewardship scheme look like?

The federal government’s National Plastics Plan released in March this year committed to initiate a stewardship taskforce that would reduce cigarette butt litter in Australia and would consider a potential stewardship scheme. However they proposed the stewardship taskforce be industry led.

Product stewardship schemes can be voluntary or written into law. For example waste from product packaging is managed through a voluntary scheme the Australian Packaging Covenant which sets targets for reducing packaging waste that aren’t written into law. On the other hand there is a law in Australia requiring companies who manufacture TVs or computers to pay some of the costs for recycling these products.

The new research commissioned by World Wildlife Fund for Nature Australia considered four regulatory approaches: business as usual a ban on plastic filters a voluntary industry product stewardship scheme and a mandatory product stewardship scheme led by the federal government.

Each of these options were ranked according to factors such as the regulatory effort required to implement them their cost consumer participation and the extent to which they would reduce environmental impacts on land and waterways.

A ban on plastic cigarette filters and a mandatory product stewardship scheme were assessed as having the greatest potential environmental benefit. While uncertainties remain about a filter ban there is no such barrier to implementing a mandatory product stewardship scheme on cigarette waste.

This scheme could involve a tax that would pay for the recovery and processing costs associated with cigarette butt litter. The study suggested introducing a levy of A$0.004 – less than half a cent – on each smoked cigarette to manage the waste. Other studies from overseas however show this cost would need to be higher.

We can look to the UK for an example of where to start. The UK is currently considering implementing an extended producer responsibility scheme to address cigarette litter. In November this year it released a consultation document on different options.

They proposed a mandatory scheme where the tobacco industry would pay for the full costs of cleaning up and processing cigarette waste. Other costs they might be made to pay are for gathering and reporting data on tobacco product waste provision of bins for cigarette butts and campaigns to promote responsible disposal by consumers.

It is time for the federal and state governments in Australia to make the tobacco industry pay for the mess they create.",,,,,,,,,

The demonstration occurred on December 1 as part of a scheduled flight from Chicago’s O’Hare to Washington’s Reagan National Airport with 115 passengers aboard including United CEO Scott Kirby and GE Aviation CEO John Slattery. The LEAP-1B engines were developed by CFM International which is a 50-50 partnership of GE and Safran Aircraft Engines.

SAFs are intended as a substitute for conventional aviation fuels and use plant- or animal-based fats and oils solid domestic or commercial wastes food scraps packaging materials algae carbon dioxide and similar items rather than petroleum as the basic raw material. In this way net carbon emissions can be reduced while providing the kind of energy-dense fuels required for long-distance air travel.

The United flight had one engine running on only sustainable fuel GE Aviation

Under standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in normal operations SAFs are only allowed in a blend of up to 50 percent mixed with conventional aviation fuel. However the SAF used in the demonstration flight was almost chemically identical with Jet A and Jet A-1 fuel.

For the flight one tank was filled with 500 gal (1893 L) of SAF and the other with conventional fuel. The goal is to produce an SAF that can be used in current jet engines without any modifications to them or the airframe. However this is a regulatory as well as an engineering problem so standardized industry specifications are needed to okay 100-percent SAF.

GE Aviation is currently working with Emirates Airlines to test a commercial craft using only SAF next year.

""Today’s SAF flight is not only a significant milestone for efforts to decarbonize our industry but when combined with the surge in industry commitments to produce and purchase alternative fuels we’re demonstrating the scalable and impactful way companies can join together and play a role in addressing the biggest challenge of our lifetimes"" says Kirby.

A new locally developed engine with international assistance for its indigenous fighters is now on the cards in addition to existing ‘Make in India’ programs.

While the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) is currently powered by an imported engine the Government informed Parliament on November 29 that it plans to develop indigenous engines for LCA variants and the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) in collaboration with a global manufacturer in the future reported The Hindu.

“The Flight Operational Clearance (FOC) configuration of the LCA Tejas requires more thrust than the proposed domestic engine can provide. As a result the Kaveri cannot be integrated into the current architecture. A modified engine version is necessary to induct with LCA Tejas” India’s junior defense minister Ajay Bhatt said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha the upper house of Parliament.

Kaveri is the name of the indigenous engine project that was commissioned 30 years ago and is now in the trial stage.

On the projected engine development in the future the Defense secretary emphasized that the technological capabilities gained through the Kaveri engine project will be of significant utility. However this official statement means that the Kaveri project is not going to power India’s ambitious advanced combat fighter development.

The Development Of Kaveri

The indigenous Kaveri engine project was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) in 1989. The project which cost Rs 2035.56 crore and lasted 30 years resulted in the production of nine full prototype engines and four core engines.

The engine was tested for a total of 3217 hours and it also passed altitude tests and trials on the Flying Test Bed (FTB) The Hindu report said.

Despite this the Kaveri’s thrust is only about 65 Kilo Newtons (KN) far less than the 95 KN produced by its main competitors the Eurojet EJ200 and the General Electric GE-F414.

As of now the GE-F404 engines power the LCA FOC version and the Mk-1A while the other Tejas variant LCA-Mk2 and the AMCA will be powered by the more powerful GE-F414 engines in the future.

Even though the former is a reliable engine that has been used on American F/A-18 Hornet fighters and the Mk-1A LCA variant the more advanced versions to be manufactured domestically are believed to require a more powerful engine with more thrust capacity. This is where the GE-F414 comes into the picture.

Multiple Options To Choose From

Earlier this year India’s state-run aerospace company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) sealed a $716 million deal with GE Aviation of the United States for 99 F404 aircraft engines and related services to power the indigenous Tejas LCA Mk-1A.

The Defense Ministry had signed a ₹48000 crore deal with HAL to supply 83 LCA-Mk1A to the Indian Air Force in February this year.

HAL had then mentioned that the collaboration would be bolstered by the production of GE F414 engines in India for the forthcoming LCA Mk-2 program. According to the statement the F404 family of engines has accumulated over 14 million engine flight hours and powered 15 different commercial and prototype aircraft.

The recent announcement made in Parliament hints that GE could be picked to help India produce engines for LCA and AMCA domestically. This will achieve the twin objective of securing a more advanced engine for the fighters while also giving a fillip to India’s ‘Make in India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India) initiatives.

British engine maker Rolls-Royce had also expressed keen interest in collaborating with India to co-develop and manufacture engines for the country’s AMCA fifth-generation fighter aircraft program in September this year. This goes on to prove that India has more than just one option to choose from.

Going Indigenous Is The Mantra?

India’s local defense manufacturing ecosystem has recently been making concerted efforts to indigenously produce engines for aircraft.

In May this year using its unique 2000 MT isothermal forge press the state-run “Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) established near-isothermal forging technology to make all five stages of high-pressure compressor (HPC) discs out of difficult-to-deform titanium alloy” announced the Ministry of Defense.

The Hyderabad-based Defense Metallurgical Research Laboratory of DRDO accomplished this technological achievement by producing complicated titanium and nickel-based alloys that can endure temperatures of over 1000 degrees Celsius (DMRL).

These were sent to HAL’s Bengaluru Engine Division for installation in the Adour 804/811 and 871 engines that power the Indian Air Force’s Jaguar/Hawk aircraft.

With this breakthrough India joined a select group of worldwide engine developers who are capable of producing such crucial aircraft engines.

India has been trying to further indigenization through domestic innovation and collaboration with foreign giants. This is the flagship agenda of the present Indian dispensation and both LCA Tejas and the AMCA program are at the center of it.",,,

Offering uncompromised clinical capabilities the new Revolution Apex platform helps radiology departments stay ahead of the technology curve with a modular design that offers a seamless path to continuous hardware and software scalability and upgradability that will extend the lives of CT systems into the future.

Today’s radiology departments are under pressure like never before. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic steadily growing patient volumes a rapid rise in the number of images generated and increasingly complex image reviews are straining CT departments to their limits. What’s more departments are facing these challenges as they attempt to battle industry-wide staff shortages and burnout.

Twenty years ago new CT technologies were introduced every four-to-five years; however today we see new solutions introduced annually. This is largely due to the pace of innovation which has greatly accelerated due to the speed and growth of modern engineering artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. Because of these advancements CT technology is becoming obsolete more quickly than ever before resulting in 44% of facilities expressing challenges during their attempts to keep systems up to date.

“I have to look to how to spend money in the right way. It's quite important to make good decisions to get the most advanced technology” said Johan de Mey M.D. Ph.D. chair of radiology at University Hospital Brussels in Belgium. As chair of the department and a member of the board of directors for the hospital de Mey is tasked with planning capital expenditures for the entire radiology department.

With this challenge in mind GE Healthcare developed a new modular CT system design that enables hardware scalability so radiology departments and healthcare facilities can add service lines to accommodate evolving patient needs. Revolution Apex platform’s Gemstone Clarity Detector is the foundation of this approach enabling users to update their service line from a 40 mm detector and 0.28 second rotation speed up to a 160 mm detector and 0.23 second per rotation speed—the world’s fastest gantry speed. This enables healthcare facilities to keep up with the latest technology while minimizing technology obsolescence and optimizing clinical capabilities now and in the future. This also helps streamline fleet management allowing facilities to minimize overall operating costs and address budget constraints.

“In the past we kept machines as long as possible and we upgraded them with software. But if the hardware was obsolete we removed it from the hospital. With the Apex we have a platform with the latest technology and can easily upgrade as our clinical practice evolves” added de Mey. “Additionally if you have a machine that’s upgradable you already know how to use it. You can immediately start doing exams on a higher level. And if you're on the edge of research this is huge. Being able to upgrade and work on the same platform and technology is much faster. For us it's a big win”

The Revolution Apex platform was also developed with operational efficiency in mind. Studying radiology departments’ entire workflows and identifying opportunities to simplify and streamline processes GE Healthcare developed Effortless Workflow which utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to automate much of the workflow from pre-scan to post-scan helping to reduce clicks save time and achieve exceptional efficiency and consistency in imaging.

“Workflow efficiency is critical” said Ricardo Cury M.D. chair of radiology Baptist Health. “We have seen that by mapping our process we can identify our pain points and subsequently automate processes and decrease errors as well as provide better standardization and less variability for our clinicians and techs.”

The Revolution Apex platform is also designed to produce high quality CT images at the lowest possible radiation dose through TrueFidelity deep learning image reconstruction. TrueFidelity is GE Healthcare’s exceptional image reconstruction technology that uses a dedicated Deep Neural Network to generate high-definition low-noise CT images. Fully integrated with both single-energy and dual-energy imaging TrueFidelity produces images with exceptional sharpness low-contrast performance and preferred noise texture even with low dose.

Furthermore the Revolution Apex platform is equipped with GE Healthcare’s patented Quantix X-ray tube—a powerful tube designed to provide the output necessary to comfortably image all anatomies regardless of patient size without compromising image quality. A key application of this technology is next-generation Gemstone Spectral Imaging which reduces image noise in low energy monochromatic images to detect and assess small lesions.

The Revolution Apex platform is also built to seamlessly upgrade. After installation facilities can stay ahead of evolving technological advancements with regular software upgrades that include new capabilities and workflow enhancements as well as image quality dose management cybersecurity and service tools all without learning a new user interface. The Revolution Apex platform also provides the industry’s first subscription-based service for CT applications Smart Subscription which enables easy access to the latest technology so radiologists can continue to deliver high-quality patient care.

“Given the volatility of today’s healthcare environment it makes sense to have a system that is scalable to meet today and tomorrow’s evolving CT needs” said Jean-Luc Procaccini president and CEO Molecular Imaging and Computed Tomography GE Healthcare. “Understanding that healthcare systems are challenged to keep up to date with the latest cutting-edge CT technologies we developed a new modular solution that can grow with healthcare systems—so they have what they need when they need it. Altogether we are incredibly proud of our Revolution Apex platform and are thrilled with the feedback we have received on its performance and usefulness.”

The people on the upper end of that demographic – defined by Pew Research as those born between 1981 and 1996 – are now pushing 40. They’re the dominant part of the workforce. But that dominance is quickly – and naturally – eroding to the next class of workplace warriors. That would be the members of Generation Z or those born (according to the same Pew report) from 1997 and after.

A 2018 study from Deloitte says that Gen Zers (they define this generation as born in 1995 so there’s overlap with Pew above) are already about 24% of the US population so it’s clear that they will become the majority of workers within the next decade. By that time many of the older class of business owners – mostly my class – will have retired or moved on. The millennials who were once the anti-establishment will be the establishment the managers the owners.

Gen Zers are entering the workforce with knowledge and a confidence that my generation couldn’t dream of. They understand more about the economy technology and the world than I ever did at that age.

This is a generation that’s not only more diverse but one that embraces diversity. According to the above research: “Gen Z is the most ethnically and racially diverse generation in history: one in four is Hispanic 14% are African-American and 6% are Asian. And their views on gender and identity are unprecedented and untraditional: Gen Z refuses to turn ethnicity and race into checkboxes on a survey form.”

Gen Z want to work for – and have equity in – companies that have sound principles and exist to truly make the world a better place. These workers are quick to criticize their own employers when their actions contradict their social or moral beliefs.

Gen Zers bring with them not only a lifelong experience with the cloud social media and mobile technology but – because they’ve known and adapted to this stuff since birth – are also open to more technology more changes more adaptations. They expect their employers to embrace the latest if it will help them be productive independent and better balance their work and personal lives. They’re on the forefront of augmented reality green tech and mental health platforms. Like all generations they’ll be pushed by the generation before them on this but probably not as hard because this generation has so much technological momentum already.

All of this is great. But even with all of this – the confidence the diversity the activism the technological intelligence – Gen Zers lack a critical thing that employers cannot ignore. And that critical thing is the secret to managing them. It’s experience. This generation are still just kids and let’s not forget that. They may not like to admit it but they know it. And they want our help. There is already much being written about how to manage this up-and-coming group. But in the end knowing this secret is the most important thing.

Like any young person looking to impress Gen Zers want to appear that they know the answers. And having that self-confidence is good. But we as employers should know better. We should understand that underneath that façade is someone who is not as confident as they appear. We should recognize that it is our job to weigh all the good things that this generation brings to the workplace with the secret that they don’t know very much about the realities of running a business.

What realities?

For starters it’s that more sales are made and more ideas are formed when people spend more time face-to-face rather than working from home. Or that too much software technology and AI takes away a manager’s ability to make judgments that only humans can make. Or that sometimes – but not always – it makes more business sense to hire an experienced middle-aged salesperson over an inexperienced younger person.

We will have to help this generation understand that in order to earn more money and be entitled to greater benefits one must work for a while to gain the confidence trust and experience of their employer. We will need to take pains to help younger workers accept the fact that they are indeed on the lowest rung of ladder which may require them working odd hours or doing tasks that no one else wants to do.

With all the great things Gen Z brings to the workplace there’s an even greater thing that we as employers can give back to them. We can help them survive their 20s and emerge with the knowledge and experience that’s needed to make profits and build value so that their generation – and future generations – can have jobs and opportunities that sustain their families.

Understanding that for all their many assets they still lack experience is truly the secret to successfully managing this generation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcHBpLmNvbS9jb250ZW50cy92aWV3X2JyZWFraW5nLW5ld3MvMjAyMS0wNC0xMi9lcm5vLWxhc3psby1hcHBvaW50cy1nZW5lcmFsLW1hbmFnZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Skin Care Brand Erno Laszlo Appoints General Manager,The award-winning Canadian skincare brand will use the additional funding to further expand in the US market.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9zaG91bGQteW91LW92ZXJjbG9jay15b3VyLXBjcy1wcm9jZXNzb3Iv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5kcy5jb20vY29tcHV0aW5nL3Nob3VsZC15b3Utb3ZlcmNsb2NrLXlvdXItcGNzLXByb2Nlc3Nvci8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should you overclock your CPU?,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.

What is overclocking?

Overclocking refers to pushing the clock speed of your processor past its rated limit. Clock speed is the number of cycles your CPU can complete in a second and it’s measured in hertz. So a 4GHz processor can complete 4 billion clock cycles per second.

Although clock speed doesn’t directly show how many instructions your CPU is executing it gives you an idea of the relative number of instructions. All things being equal a 4GHz processor can complete more instructions than a 3.5GHz one for example. Due to things like processor architecture age and manufacturer though that’s not always the case but it’s a good general rule of thumb and it makes the purpose of overclocking simple. You can overclock to achieve higher clock speeds which in turn allows your processor to complete more instructions each second.

Overclocking typically involves the primary processor though you can also overclock a discrete GPU for a boost in graphics processing. There is no one rule in how fast you can speed up a processor and every overclocking project produces different results. That makes your decision to overclock rather difficult.

Is overclocking worth it? Yes — and no.

Overclocking: Do you need it?

Overclocking can be time-consuming and expensive especially if you have little experience tinkering with PC components. In addition to changing your multiplier you may need to alter voltage settings fan rotation speeds and other important fragile fundamentals.

So when you really get down to it do you need to overclock?

Like most things it depends. Gaming is a big reason to overclock and depending on the game it can make a big difference. In games the CPU is best known for handling A.I. and NPCs making a fast processor key for grand strategy titles like Civilization VI and simulation sandboxes like Hitman 3.

Your CPU handles more than A.I. though. Spare cores often go to handling simulations from cloth to explosions and some games even offload audio processing to the CPU. This division of labor is becoming increasingly common especially as core counts push higher on consumer processors.

In CPU intensive games like Hitman 3 overclocking can make a big difference but that doesn’t mean it will. The greatest benefits in games show at lower resolutions where the GPU isn’t strained as much. As resolutions go higher games become GPU-bound and show little performance gains from overclocking. Similarly games that favor more cores over faster cores such as Cyberpunk 2077 show less of an improvement with an overclocked CPU.

Outside of gaming overclocking can boost performance in 3D modeling video editing and image editing applications to name a few. Basically any application that demands a lot from your CPU will benefit if only slightly from an overclock.

As with gaming the same rules apply to other applications. Certain software favors more cores over faster ones so your mileage will vary from application to application.

With so much variance it’s easy to question if overclocking is worth it at all. And for many it’s not. A moderate overclock one that you can run all day every day will boost your PC’s performance across the board but it might not be worth the hassle. With high-end components moderate overclocks produce marginal performance gains in most cases.

But it’s basically free performance. If you have a processor that can run 5% faster you might as well set it up to take advantage of that extra power. Furthermore if you play a lot of CPU-intensive games or use applications like HandBrake overclocking can give you a significant performance uplift even at moderate settings.

In short you don’t need overclocking but if you’re running applications that benefit from it there’s no reason to leave the extra performance on the table. You shouldn’t go too far though. Extreme overclocking can shorten your component’s lifespan and decrease system stability.

It may void your warranty too. Some manufacturers such as EVGA cover overclocking under the standard warranty. Others such as Intel offer optional protection plans that cover overclocking. We don’t want to sound alarmist since moderate overclocking really isn’t all that scary but be aware that it will likely void any warranties you have.

How much faster are we talking?

Modern processors “overclock” themselves. Intel and AMD spec their CPUs to operate within a range of clock speeds from the base clock to the boost clock. DIY overclocking pushes processors past their spec so the sky is really the limit when it comes to how much faster you can make your CPU.

Given ideal circumstances that is. Heat is the enemy and as you push your clock speed higher your CPU will get hotter. There’s a direct connection to how cool you can keep your CPU and how far you can push the overclock. Pushing the 2.9GHz Threadripper 3990X to 4.5GHz is within the realm of possibility for an overclocker using a dedicated setup and actively cooling the processor with liquid nitrogen. Results with a consumer chip inside of a case with an off-the-shelf cooler will be let’s call them more reasonable.

Each processor is a little different so there’s no hard rule for how far you can push yours. However the improvements should be marginal if you plan on using the overclock every day. In most cases that usually means between 100Hz to 300Hz faster with adequate cooling. Not sure which CPU is the best? Check out our AMD vs. Intel guide.

What do I need?

What sort of overclocking do you want to try? How in-depth are you willing to go? Here are some important tools so you can judge the work level for yourself.

The right computer or CPU: You should invest in a CPU — like one of Intel’s K-series or any of AMD’s latest Ryzen CPUs — that supports overclocking. An overclock-friendly motherboard is also important so don’t go by the processor alone. The newest mod-friendly CPUs and motherboards often come with software that replaces some of the tools listed below. Finally if you’re buying a pre-built PC check the system specs before assuming it supports overclocking.

How long will it take

Most importantly the overclocking process depends on how much time you are willing to spend to do it correctly. You can do a quick and janky overclock procedure just by downloading the right software and changing a few settings. However this may cause a lot more trouble than it’s worth.

A proper and safe overclock requires research beforehand. You may even need to order additional parts such as a bigger cooler.

After the proper prep work start implementing basic tests download the right stress test and make CPU alterations — these are all relatively quick steps which may only take an hour. Running the stress test which you should do after every alteration should take a few hours as it monitors temperature and activity for stability.

The goal isn’t to get the overclock just an overclock. It’s a process and you’ll likely spend multiple days nailing everything down. The goal is to get a stable overclock and from there push the component higher if you want/can. For some a moderate overclock is a project that takes no more than a few hours. For others it may take multiple sessions over the course of weeks or months.

Alternatively if you have an AMD CPU you can opt to use an automated overclocking tool like the 1usmus Clock Tuner to cut down overclocking time significantly.

It’s about how deep you want to go. Although research and planning is essential for anyone you don’t have to continue pushing your processor after you’ve achieved a stable overclock.

Final word: To overclock or not

Overclocking is considerably less risky than it used to be. Still it takes substantial knowledge and a lot of patience — and it’s not an exact science either. Your results can vary widely depending on your skill level materials and hardware.

While all this added performance can come with some risk for those that like to push the edge of performance the world of overclocking can add some fun and excitement to your computing life. Once you learn how to tweak your systems settings and run the necessary stability tests you may find the overclocking well worth the effort.

Overclocking is exciting but dangerous as you could brick your processor. Consider your system and budget before overclocking and learn about the right tools and hardware management to take on such a project.

Overclocking won’t completely transform your CPU’s performance. The main reason to overclock is to improve applications that take up a lot of computing speed.

Alas both dine-in and takeaway slots to eat at this cafe are already fully booked and all within hours when the slots were made available. However you can still check out our guide to book a slot here and continue to try your luck to see if someone has released their booking slot. The Genshin Impact theme for the HoYo FEST starts on Dec 3 and ends on Dec 14.

Arriving at the place visitors will be greeted by lifesize posters of some characters from the popular RPG game Genshin Impact. You can also see Aether and Paimon as you enter the door as well as some live sketches and other Genshin artwork as well. After entering the first thing you will see is a photo-taking area where there are photo opportunities with Diluc Venti and Klee standees with the artwork of more photo characters as the backdrop.

The ambience

Entering the cafe you can see the place is decked out with Genshin themed art everywhere which is likely the main draw for fans. The most impressive art there would be on the main pillar near the center of the cafe where there is a back-lit canvas featuring some of the latest characters from the Inazuma region. Fans will appreciate several digital galleries of high resolution artworks and voice artist announcements.

A curated list of relaxing background music from the game was played at the cafe to brighten up the ambience. Soundtracks such as the Liyue Harbor theme and Another Hopeful Tomorrow by Genshin Impact’s music composer Yu-Peng Chen can be heard playing in the cafe’s background with the volume tuned just right as it was loud enough to be heard yet it doesn’t overpower the conversations you have with your friends eating with you.

There is also a character standee on each table which would be useful to accompany any lone diners eating at the cafe. The energy from the cafe patrons was very good as you can see some of the customers wore Genshin themed outfits and accessories.

One can also grab a post-it and sketch a Genshin character to put on the notice board while waiting for your food. We spotted some interesting art pieces there too. It was also heartwarming to know that you are eating with fellow gamers of the game. It was a nice sight to see tables of 4 and 5 people eating there as the pandemic restrictions had finally relaxed.

The food

The Genshin themed menu for HoYo FEST was designed to resemble the food featured in the game. The main menu items such as Mora Meat Chicken Skewers Rice Bowl Emergency Food and Tea Break pancakes look very close to the in-game version of the food. For the dessert it was surprising that Xiao’s favourite food the Almond Tofu which was a fan favourite and pretty easy to make was not on the menu.

However the Sugar Coated Slime and Tea Break Pancake are still great menu items which were accurate (and more palatable) food renditions for the game. If you are curious the Slime items are actually made using jelly and mochi and are perfectly safe to eat.

The Mora Meat was very tasty it has a resemblance to the traditional Chinese Rougamo but westernised. It uses chicken grilled with BBQ sauce instead of pulled pork as the cafe does not use pork or lard in their kitchen. Attention to detail to keep this food item in theme was also there as there is a mora symbol stamped with BBQ sauce on the bun just like how it looks in the game.

For the Emergency Food it was inspired by a combination of two dishes from the game the Fisherman’s toast and Teyvat fried eggs. The dish was the most visually appealing food item on the menu as it has the most splashes of colours on it.

When the dish arrived it was pepperoni pizza toast with a fried egg with a side of salad. To make the dish even more in theme they could have sprinkled some dried italian herbs on it just like the game but that’s a small detail. Tastewise the dish was alright especially it is hard to go wrong with pizza toast.

However while the toast was thick and satisfying the pepperoni slices felt pretty thin. Thus it felt more like a snack instead of a full main meal. If you need something meatier and filling one can try the Chicken Skewers Rice Bowl or Mora Meat instead.

Drinks-wise the Dalgona latte and Slime Milk tea tasted light but it could be due to the ice melted as photos were taken of the food. Interestingly the dessert was served before the mains and it might be a good idea to request with the cafe if they can serve the dessert after the mains.

The Everlasting Boulder Parfait is more of a chocolate-based dessert topped with cookie crumbles custard and a brownie at the bottom. With its rocky and brown look and feel with the yellow hues the look and feel of the desert resonates the Geo theme well.

The desert didn’t disappoint and was actually pretty good too. The Anemo themed Intertwined Winds Parfait is something recommended. This parfait has pineapple biscuits and cornflakes in it giving the dessert a very local flavour with a nice crunch.

The merchandise

But as all fans know the highlight of the HoYo FEST is not the food but the sale of the licensed Genshin merchandise. While there was feedback that there was not enough merchandise for sale for the Honkai Impact 3 and Tears of Themis version of the cafe this was not the case for Genshin Impact.

At the time of the visit from 2pm to 3pm on a weekend there was an ample supply of the HoYo FEST event-exclusive standee Genshin character acrylic standees and badges there.

It was also a pleasant surprise to see that the merchandise was very reasonably priced. Acrylic standees were sold at $12 and each can badge was sold for $3. In normal retail shops here the acrylic standees can go up to $25 and the can badge was sold for about $6 -10.

Some rare items were spotted there too such as the fried chicken-themed Diluc acrylic standee and the Noelle fried chicken-themed badge which was created for China’s KFC event.

Also customers who order food for $14 and above will be rewarded with a set of postcards stickers and a coaster. There are actually 3 different designs of the coasters which might encourage multiple visits to the cafe if fans are hardcore enough to try to collect all three.

Alas some merchandise such as the shikishis (art boards) were sold out already but one can still preorder them. One fun thing to note here is that some of the staff at the cafe actually play Genshin too and had signboards with messages with fun puns related to the game. For example Zhongli’s iconic catchphrase for his Ultimate move was rewritten to “I will have a Pre-Order!” to inform customers that they can preorder some of the sold out event exclusive merch.

All in all fans of Genshin Impact are very fortunate to have such an awesome themed cafe to hang out eat and purchase merchandise with their gaming buddies. Hopefully this event will return again next year on a bigger scale especially since there is proven interest from the Genshin fanbase here in Singapore and the game features lots of different food to replicate in real life.

Norwich - Janice ""Jan"" Stewart 83 yrs old entered eternal life on December 1 2021 with her family at her side. Jan was born in Burlington Kansas to the late Bert and Maude Decker and graduated from Burlington High School. She was employed at Southwestern Bell Telephone Co in Topeka Kansas where she met her beloved husband Ray who was serving in the Air Force and stationed at Forbes Air Force Base in Topeka. After their marriage in Burlington they moved to various locations including California New Mexico Louisiana and Norwich Connecticut due to her husband's employment with General Dynamics. She worked as a Credit Officer at Bank of America in San Diego substituted in the Norwich Pre-School program but later decided to be an ""at home mom"" volunteering at their children's schools. She attended numerous colleges in Connecticut. In 1975 she began her career with the Norwich (Rose City) Senior Center located adjacent to Otis Library in a one-room store front. Jan was appointed Senior Affairs Director in 1977 and moved to the Buckingham Memorial Bldg. With the assistance of Senator Kenneth Prsybysz state funds were obtained and a new Senior Center was built on Mahan Drive in 1994. Because of Jan's love for working with the elderly she received many awards for new innovative and outstanding programs from the CT Association of Senior Center Personnel. She was the first recipient of the Dr. Singer Award from Prevent Blindness Connecticut and the Board of Education & Services for the Blind. She received the President's Volunteer Action Award from President Ronald Reagan; the Congressional Record by U.S. Representative Sam Gejdenson and a Citation from State Senator James J. Murphy for the Senior Citizen Job Bank. Following her retirement in 2000 she continued her commitments to organizations such as the Woman's City Club of Norwich where she served on the Board of Directors as President Program Chairperson and Financial Chairperson; Backus Hospital Board of Directors & Trustees Backus Hospital Auxiliary Board of Directors as President and Recording Secretary; UCFS Eldercare Advisory Committee; Senior Affairs Commission; Monday Study Club; AARP #1004 as Treasurer and Greater Norwich Area Chamber of Commerce.

Last month the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition Technology and Logistics Dr. Bruce Jette canceled one of the Army's most important modernization programs the competition to build the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV). This decision must be seen as something of a blow for the newly established Army Futures Command (AFC) and for the Army's broader effort to streamline and speed up its ponderous acquisition system. While the Army has promised that the program will be restarted after an ""operational pause"" the problems with the OMFV procurement suggest that reforming Army acquisition maybe even harder than anyone expected. Underscoring this concern is the possibility that the Army is on the verge of repeating the OMFV experience in its effort to design and develop a new turret for its Stryker wheeled infantry vehicle that can carry a 30mm cannon. This is a vital lethality upgrade for the Stryker fleet. A second acquisition failure could prove highly damaging for Army modernization efforts.

The OMFV was one of AFC's signature programs and the top priority for the Next-Generation Combat Vehicle Cross Functional Team. The new platform was intended to replace the Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle which was first produced in 1981. Despite multiple upgrades the Bradley has reached the end of the road when it comes to improvements. The Army wanted a new platform to carry infantry into combat that would be more lethal and survivable than the Bradley could generate greater amounts of electric power be easier to maintain have lots of room to grow and add capabilities and as the name suggests be capable of operating remotely or even autonomously. In addition the Army wanted the new vehicle fast with up to two development contracts awarded in early calendar 2020 a downselect made in 2023 and the first unit equipped fielded in 2026.

The immediate reason for Dr. Jette’s decision to halt the OMFV effort was that only one company General Dynamics Land Systems had submitted a proposal and the required sample vehicle. A second competitor a team of Raytheon and Rheinmetall had failed to meet the Army’s deadline for delivery of its prototype vehicle. But in what perhaps should have been seen as a portent of what was to come a number of major armored vehicle manufacturers had chosen not to participate apparently concerned about the interplay between the program’s aggressive schedule and complex requirements. Dr. Jette acknowledged this dilemma in announcing his decision:

Despite an unprecedented number of industry days and engagements to include a draft request for proposal over the course of nearly two years -- all of which allowed industry to help shape this competition -- it is clear a combination of requirements and schedule overwhelmed industry's ability to respond within the Army's timeline.

A similar situation appears to be occurring in the Army’s program to upgun some of its Stryker wheeled infantry vehicles. Officially called the Stryker Medium Caliber Weapon System (MCWS) the program is to design and develop a turret that can support a 30mm cannon. In 2018 responding to an operational needs statement from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment stationed in Europe for a more capable gun to arm its Stryker vehicles the Army rapidly fielded an interim solution on 83 Strykers.

Based on the experience of operating these modified vehicles the Army sought an improved solution in the MCWS. The processes the Army followed for the MCWS procurement mirrored many of the new acquisition approaches being pioneered by AFC for a streamlined faster approach to acquisition. In May 2019 following a full and open competition the Army awarded a number of relatively small quick turnaround design integration study contracts for a better turret that would equip at least three Stryker brigade combat teams. In a second phase of this effort the participating companies were required to provide by June 2020 a bid sample consisting of their turret mounted on a basic Stryker vehicle and XM813 30mm cannon both provided by the government.

Between May 2019 and February 2020 while the companies worked on their designs the Stryker Program Office proceeded with the development of a final Request for Proposal (RFP) for the MCWS. The current plan is to release the RFP later this year to those companies that successfully complete the design phase. As currently understood the RFP will be for a single contract awardto produce and integrate a MCWS based on the XM813 onto some 269 Stryker Double V-Hull Infantry Carrier Vehicles.

Many of the problems contractors experienced with the OMFV solicitation appear to also be “infecting” the RFP for the MCWS. While the Program Office had initially assured the competing companies that the core requirements for the MCWS would not change in fact they have been revised repeatedly. Also evaluation criteria have been changed in ways that create uncertainty for the companies.

The number of requirements has ballooned many of which have nothing to do with the basic performance of the MCWS. For example each competitor is now required to self-certify that the modified vehicle meets more than 100 technical performance specifications. But a number of potential competitors do not have access to the Stryker technical specifications required for a meaningful certification. In addition a few months ago the Program Office added a requirement that each competitor in the design phase add armor coupons to their June 2020 submission. An armor coupon is representative material of the integrated turret that could undergo parallel blast testing to validate the integrity of the material used. By the time this requirement was levied the companies had already acquired the parts for their turrets. This means that there is no way they can provide armor coupons made from the same batch of steel as the turret. Once again requirements and schedule are in conflict.

This effort is in danger of repeating the OMFV experience. Industry sources have reported that at least one company has pulled out of the competition and others are seriously considering not bidding on the MCWS RFP. Come September 2020 there might only be one or even zero companies willing to provide the Army its new Stryker turret. Can Army acquisition afford two back-to-back failed combat vehicle modernization efforts?

More than 250 million people worldwide have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 usually after a diagnostic nose swab. Those swabs aren’t trash once they’ve delivered their positive result though. For scientists like us they carry additional valuable information about the coronavirus. Leftover material from swabs can help us uncover hidden aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using what are called phylodynamic methods that can track a pathogen’s travels via changes in its genes researchers are able to pinpoint factors like where and when outbreaks start the number of undetected infections and common routes of transmission. Phylodynamics can also aid in understanding and tracking the spread of new pathogen variants such as the recently detected omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2.

What’s in a swab?

Pathogens just like people each have a genome. This is RNA or DNA that contains an organism’s genetic code – its instructions for life and the information necessary for reproduction.

It’s now relatively fast and cheap to sequence a pathogen’s genome. In Switzerland a consortium of government and academic scientists that we’re a part of as already extracted viral genome sequences from almost 80000 SARS-CoV-2 positive swab tests.

By lining up genetic sequences obtained from different patients scientists can see which positions in the sequence differ. These differences represent mutations small errors incorporated into the genome when the pathogen copies itself. We can use these mutational differences as clues to reconstruct chains of transmission and learn about epidemic dynamics along the way.

Phylodynamics: Piecing together genetic clues

Phylodynamic methods provide a way to describe how mutational differences relate to epidemic dynamics. These approaches allow researchers to get from the raw data about where mutations have occurred in the viral or bacterial genome to understanding all the implications. It might sound complicated but it’s actually pretty easy to give an intuitive idea of how it works.

Mutations in the pathogen genome get passed from person to person in a transmission chain. Many pathogens acquire lots of mutations over the course of an epidemic. Scientists can summarize these mutational similarities and differences using what’s essentially a family tree for the pathogen. Biologists call it a phylogenetic tree. Each branching point represents a transmission event when the pathogen moved from one person to another.

A phylogenetic tree is an approximation of the past transmission chain based on variations in the pathogen’s genetic sequence. Guinat Windels Nadeau CC BY-ND

The branch lengths are proportional to the number of differences between sequenced samples. Short branches mean little time between branching points – fast transmission from person to person. Studying the length of branches on this tree can tell us about pathogen spread in the past – maybe even before we knew an epidemic was on the horizon.

Pathogen genome sequences can be used to construct phylogenetic trees and estimate hidden epidemic dynamics. Shorter branches stand for quicker transmission. Guinat Windels Nadeau CC BY-ND

Mathematical models of disease dynamics

Models in general are simplifications of reality. They try to describe core real-life processes with mathematical equations. In phylodynamics these equations describe the relationship between epidemic processes and the phylogenetic tree.

Take for example tuberculosis. It’s the deadliest bacterial infection in the world and it is getting even more threatening because of the widespread evolution of antibiotic resistance. If you catch an antibiotic-resistant version of the tuberculosis bacterium treatment can take years.

To predict the future burden of resistant tuberculosis we want to estimate how fast it spreads.

Epidemiologists work to track infections as the pathogen moves through a population. Guinat Windels Nadeau CC BY-ND

To do this we need a model that captures two important processes. First there’s the course of infection and second there’s the development of antibiotic resistance. In real life infected people can infect others get treatment and in the end either be cured or in the worst case die from the infection. On top of this the pathogen can develop resistance.

Phylodynamic models capture real-life epidemiological processes into mathematical equations and parameters. Guinat Windels Nadeau CC BY-ND

We can translate these epidemiological processes into a mathematical model with two groups of patients – one group infected with normal tuberculosis and one with antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis. The important processes – transmission recovery and death – can happen at different rates for each group. Finally patients whose infection develops antibiotic resistance move from the first group to the second.

This model does ignore some aspects of tuberculosis outbreaks such as asymptomatic infections or relapses after treatment. Even so when applied to a set of tuberculosis genomes this model helps us estimate how fast resistant tuberculosis spreads.

Capturing hidden aspects of epidemics

Uniquely phylodynamic approaches can help researchers answer questions in situations where diagnosed cases do not give the full picture. For example what about the number of undetected cases or the source of a new epidemic?

A good example of this type of genome-based investigation is our recent work on highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 in Europe. This epidemic spread to poultry farms and wild birds across 30 European countries in 2016. In the end tens of millions of birds were culled devastating the poultry industry.

But were poultry farms or wild birds the real driver of spread? Obviously we cannot ask the birds themselves. Instead phylodynamic modeling based on H5N8 genomes sampled from poultry farms and wild birds helped us get an answer. It turns out that in some countries the pathogen mainly spread from farm to farm while in others it spread from wild birds to farms.

In the case of HPAI H5N8 we helped animal health authorities focus control efforts. In some countries this meant limiting transmission between poultry farms while in others limiting contact between domestic and wild birds.

More recently phylodynamic analyses helped evaluate the impact of control strategies for SARS-CoV-2 including the first border closures and strict early lockdowns. A big advantage of phylodynamic modeling is that it can account for undetected cases. The models can even describe early stages of the outbreak in the absence of samples from that time period.

Phylodynamic models are under intensive development continuously expanding the field to new applications and larger datasets. However there are still challenges in extending genome sequencing efforts to undersampled species and regions and upholding rapid public data sharing. Ultimately these data and models will help everyone gain new insights on epidemics and how to control them.

~

Back in November 2019 several months before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic a Prior Information Notice (PIN) entitled Operational Ration Packs 2022 was published but subsequent events put the procurement on temporary hold until 14th June 2021 when a new PIN entitled Operational Ration Packs 2023 was published; for an extract see the foot of this page. The 24-hour GP (General Pack) ORP featured here which I was given in late summer was packed in April of this year and therefore represents quite a late example from the Operational Ration Packs 2019 procurement batch.

When I last looked at the bagged UK 24-hour ORP I opted to try a Halal C&E (Cultural & Ethnic) variant ~ see FR46 ~ packed in May 2018 rather than the much more numerous GP or General Pack but in essence both versions were virtually identical other than some of the menu items in the C&E pack catered specifically for religious requirements and ethnic tastes. Although I did not sample a GP ORP at this time though I did try both the 24-hour Enhanced Ration Pack and the 8-hour Single Meal Ration from the same contract at DSEI 2019 I was given copies of the then current Box Menu Sheets so I have a full list of typical GP contents to compare against. The April 2021 Menu 3 has different meal pouches from the original 2017 version but other than this there is no substantial variation.

From a personal taste perspective I liked the Beef Burrito Style Filling With Rice though I couldn’t quite work out what the difference was between this and Chilli Con Carne and I found the Steak Vegetables and Dumplings (in 2017 this retort pouch was in Menu 5) to be a bit bland and stodgy. The Cinnamon Cake from Jomipsa really hit the spot for me but I am not a fan of the 50g Sesame Bar though as it is high in energy (267kcal) with 15g of Fat and 16g of Sugars plus Fibre Protein and Salt it needs to be consumed (as do the entire edible ORP contents) to maintain a balanced diet if soldiering in the field. Biscuits Brown are just brown biscuits though these days they are much better and no doubt healthier too than those issued in the Cold War era and the Chilli Peanuts tickled my tastebuds. Unfortunately my Spicy Red Chilli Sauce was missing.

The pandemic had other plans for the Minnesota company.

It's now a familiar story: COVID-19's immediate impact on lives jobs and businesses. But the pandemic's long tail continues to whip.

Minnesota's smaller food producers are facing the same supply chain troubles as the big companies — labor and material shortages cost increases and transportation delays — but without the same tools as the state's largest retailers and consumer-goods companies have: cash and leverage.

As a result products have vanished and new brands are taking longer to reach store shelves.

Twin Cities-based D'Avocado survived blow after blow in 2020. First it lost a major funding round in March 2020 as investors backed away from deals nationwide. Then one of its key manufacturing partners could no longer make its spreads shifting production to pandemic supplies like hand sanitizer.

D'Avocado disappeared from stores.

Determined company founder Greg D'Alessandro opened his own production line in Loretto Minn. with plans to get the product back on shelves this fall.

Then the price of the plastic cups that D'Avocado needs to keep its product fresh went from around 3 cents to about 10 cents per cup. That seems like a minor increase until the cost of a minimum order for those cups comes into focus: $500000.

""Bigger companies could take that hit but that about folds my business"" D'Alessandro said. ""These supply chain issues are forcing me to find a partner that has the scale to help me withstand this.""

The damage to small companies could be lasting said Greg Hoyt managing partner at food-business investment firm Gather Venture Group. Whenever the supply-chain traffic jam clears up retailers will have already made decisions about what brands they carry.

""And who is going to be hurting the most? These formerly emerging young brands"" Hoyt said.

But businesses have adapted including these smaller companies knowing consumer demand remains at record levels; it's just a matter of figuring out how to get products in their hands.

""I hope I look back on this as a good problem to have"" said D'Alessandro who is developing other avocado-based products while pitching his company to potential buyers. ""It's forcing us to look at the bigger picture.""

In October Americans were spending 23% more on food than they were in the first few pre-pandemic months of 2020 according to U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. While some of that increase can be attributed to inflation it largely reflects greater demand.

""Consumers have money"" said Mike Boland a University of Minnesota agricultural economics professor. ""Part of it is people have cut back and reduced other expenses and part is eating at home more.""

Innovation on hold

On the Wednesday before Thanksgiving Kyle Hogan was driving around the metro dropping off packages of Livia's Seasoning Salt to keep retailers stocked for a busy shopping weekend.

""Going the extra mile is the new standard"" the chief executive of the 20-year-old company said by phone from the parking lot of Northern Fire Grilling & BBQ Supply in Minnetonka. ""It's not all doomsday you just need to be ready to shift and make changes.""

This unprecedented demand for at-home products and food is exacerbating the labor shortage seen across the supply chain — retailers distributors and warehouses trucking and production — and frustrating consumers and businesses.

""Here I am dealing with salt one of the oldest things in the world and it's unbelievable the complications for something so basic so simple"" Hogan said. ""If you're trying to launch a whole line of goods right now it's hard. It's really hard.""

For Pearson's Candy Co. the century-old St. Paul company behind the famous Salted Nut Roll suppliers have told them to stop innovating.

""We've had major suppliers tell us: Don't create any new products that require our components in 2022 because we can't guarantee supply"" said Nick Davis Pearson's vice president of procurement and supply chain.

Beyond the cost and availability of commodities like peanuts warehouse and packaging costs have risen space on trucks is hard to come by labor remains constrained and computer chip and equipment backlogs mean month-long waits to replace basic parts on the production line.

""We have our team salvaging electronics off of Ebay as one way to keep things running and MacGyver-ing things right in the plant"" Davis said.

The upside: This is all caused by consumer demand that is helping drive growth for Pearson's and other food producers. The downside is the cost of making and shipping those products could eat into those gains and prompt price increases which Pearson's will pass on to customers starting in January.

""I'd say near-term relief is not in sight"" Davis said. ""As long as consumer demand remains high we will continue to see price pressures on all fronts.""

Shelf life

Throughout the pandemic retailers have been reducing the raw number of products they carry to streamline supply chains according to national Advantage Sales surveys. That shelf space lockdown may be softening as just a third of retailers said this fall they would be accepting fewer new items compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Still it left little room for the maker of Flackers an organic flax-based cracker brand to get a new product on shelves earlier this year.

""We had a unique new item we developed that we delayed a bit and kind of soft-launched"" said Donn Kelly president of Dr. In The Kitchen maker of the Flackers brand. ""What's hard for a smaller company like us is we sell mainly to distributors. But it was more about retailers accepting new items.""

Hoyt at Gather Venture Group said there needs to be a ""reckoning"" as products from startups and small brands become harder to find.

""That reckoning has to come from consumers who will say 'Well wait what's left on shelves now are these national brands who have some leverage over distributors'"" he said adding that retailers and consumers will both need to demand: ""We want smaller brands.""

Kelly said sales of Flackers overall have been up this year. And a reliable supplier relationship protected the company from the price of flax more than doubling over the past year.

But hiring remains difficult as it is everywhere and being able to grow will depend on being able to find more people to work more shifts.

Small food manufacturers face cash flow employee and distribution challenges in the best of times he said and COVID-19 "" just added another layer of uncertainty and unpredictability.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVucXVlZW4uY29tLmhrL2dlbi16LWZvb2QtZGVzdHJveWluZy1wbGFuZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More Than 60% of Gen-Z Want a More Sustainable Food System Report Finds,"3 Mins Read

Two-thirds of Gen Z believe that food production needs to be more sustainable. The findings have been revealed in an EIT Food-commissioned study. More than 2000 individuals were polled each being aged between 18-24. Participants were from the UK France Germany Poland and Spain.

Data released from Belgium-based EIT’s Gen Z survey shows that young adults see food production as a major cause of the climate crisis. Seventy-eight percent of those polled agreed that food needs to be more sustainable with 61 percent identifying processes as having gotten less earth-friendly in recent years. Most notably 66 percent of those asked agree that food consumption and production trends are: “destroying the planet and that the situation is only getting worse.”

Next generation voices

Looking at generational attitudes Gen Z appears to consider itself more cognisant with 65 percent thinking older people care less about food. 64 percent claimed to use sustainability credentials more in the past 12 months when choosing what to buy.

Imported foods were deemed generally unsustainable by 50 percent of the group while 74 percent felt locally produced items are amongst the best choices. Organic farming and plant-based foods also faired positively in Gen Z perceptions gaining 72 and 70 percent sustainability approval ratings respectively.

These statistics align with the idea that this is a generation of climate activists.

Planning for the future

The findings have been revealed in support of EIT’s The Menu for Change. A pseudo-manifesto designed to improve sustainability in agrifood systems it showcases young voices. 10 Gen Z ‘thought leaders’ have given their opinions and are in place to ensure that Gen Z is presented to food industry stakeholders.

The Menu for Change has included targets for the agrifoods industry. It has set an ambitious goal of 25 percent of land to be managed regeneratively by 2030. It also calls for uniform labelling throughout the EU and food production to be taught as part of school curriculums. Food waste in supermarkets has been highlighted with a particular focus on bio-based packaging.

“In a crucial year for global climate talks we need the next generation who will be most affected by the climate crisis to have a seat at the table in shaping a future-fit food system. We know that the world cannot achieve its goal of limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees [Celsius] without addressing global food systems yet food could have been more prominent on the agenda at COP26. That is why [EIT Food has] brought together 10 young FutureFoodMakers to represent young people across Europe and make their views needs and recommendations known” said EIT Food CEO Andy Zynga.

Food production on the menu

Speaking before the COP26 event UN Food Systems Summit Special Envoy Dr. Agnes Kalibata said: ‘We have learnt that people around the world are ready for this and are willing to mobilise. To this end we have together set off on the right track with great momentum. A better future for this generation the next and those to come is within reach if the world seizes the opportunity and transforms food systems for the better.”



While the study findings confirm that Gen Z is onboard and ‘willing to mobilise’ with implementing sustainable food practices COP26 proved a disappointment to many.

Credit: VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland

People in Finland drink a lot of coffee. Finns consume on average 12 kg of coffee per person per year while Americans’ average consumption is 4.4 kg each year. But the harsh Finnish climate makes it difficult to grow the beloved beverage close to consumers. Instead coffee-growing countries like Costa Rica and Kenya export their crop to Finland and the rest of the world. But as environmental changes threaten coffee-growing regions and the global community becomes more concerned with sustainability new technologies are popping up in places like Finland where interest is brewing in bioreactor-grown coffee.

A research team at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland began making bioreactor coffee as a test case not because of their home country’s thirst for the drink. The team found success with other cellular agriculture projects such as egg white protein but wanted to work on “a recognizable product everybody can relate to” team lead Heiko Rischer tells Newscripts. The cell culture can come from any part of the coffee plant as opposed to regular brewing which traditionally requires coffee beans. The cells are first grown in nutrient media and then transferred to bioreactors. The team harvests the biomass which Rischer describes as “smoothie type of stuff.” Once filtered and dried the resulting product is a whitish powder which is then roasted.

The powder can then be brewed and filtered. The result? “A hundred percent coffee” says Rischer.

Still the process by which the coffee was cultivated makes it a “novel food” to regulatory authorities in Europe and this designation complicated the taste-testing process. A trained sensory panel was permitted to taste but not swallow the coffee. Chemical analysis confirmed the presence of coffee’s components including critical caffeine. Flavor compounds were detected using gas chromatography-olfactometry. The team hopes to publish a life cycle analysis soon to see exactly how sustainable their product is.

Suspect sprinkles

Not all sprinkles are created equal. And depending on where you’re baking some may be illegal. That’s what a baker in England discovered when his cookies were banned by West Yorkshire Trading Standards. The red sprinkles used in Get Baked’s cookies contained the food dye erythrosine or E127 as it’s known in much of Europe. It is not permitted for use in the UK except in cocktail and candied cherries.

In the US however E127 is known by a different name—FD&C Red #3—and is permitted in food products.

There’s plenty of nuance in food-dye rules explains Winston Boyd vice president of technology and manufacturing at FoodRGB a natural food-color manufacturer. In the US food colorants synthesized from chemical feedstocks are certified by the Food and Drug Administration and receive the FD&C label whereas colorants produced from things such as fruit juices are considered natural colorants and are exempt from that certification. FD&C Red #3 is permitted in the US but Red #2 is not. Both are permitted in Canada.

Differences in food additive regulations between countries can be a headache for manufacturers but using natural dyes isn’t necessarily the pain relief they seek. Some natural dyes can be unstable over a range of time and conditions and this instability could challenge their shelf life. “The synthetic colorants are really chemically quite stable compounds” Boyd tells Newscripts. “They’re very predictable and compared to natural colors they’re cheap as dirt.”

And consumers have strong preferences for certain colors. Take Trix cereal which briefly switched the colorants for its puffed balls to dyes from radishes purple carrots and turmeric. Customer complaints eventually led parent company General Mills to relaunch its traditional cereal with its original synthetic bright reds blues and greens.

With the overall consumer push toward clean labels the extra cost and consideration may be worth a company’s while. Taste-wise the Newscripts gang isn’t sure if we would be able to tell the difference but we would be glad to sample some cupcakes to find out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzE4NjAxLWxvc3Mtb2YtZ2lybC1zY291dC1jb29raWUtc2FsZXMtZHJhZ3MtZG93bi13ZXN0b27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Loss of Girl Scout cookie sales drags down Weston,"TORONTO — The resurgence of COVID-19 in many parts of North America in the last month of the fourth quarter had a residual impact on first-quarter results at Weston Foods particularly in retail celebratory categories such as cakes sit-down restaurants and Girl Scout cookies. But renewed signs of strength emerged later in the first quarter the company said.

Operating income in the Weston Foods segment of George Weston Ltd. was a nominal loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 ended March 27 which compared with income of C$1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The decrease reflected a decline in the underlying operating performance of C$20 million including an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by the favorable year-over-year net impact of adjusting items totaling C$19 million. Adjusted EBITDA meanwhile fell 35% to C$34 million ($28 million) from C$52 million. Sales decreased 12% to C$472 million ($390.4 million) from C$535 million with Girl Scout cookies accounting for about half the decline the company said.

Richard Dufresne president and chief financial officer of George Weston Ltd. said during a May 11 conference call with analysts that the company expects to launch the sale process for Weston Foods next week.

“We’re launching the sale process next week which essentially means that that’s when we’re going to start contacting the potential people who’ve shown us interest in the business” Mr. Dufresne said. “So this will be a normal M&A process though where we’re going to be sending materials for them to review. They’re going to send us indications of interest and then we’re going to review those. So I suspect that it’s probably going to take four five months before we’re ready to announce something.”

He added that the company plans to use proceeds from the sale to return to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. The company also will consider using the proceeds if it finds opportunities in its existing business he said.

Overall George Weston sustained a loss of C$62 million in the first quarter which compared with income of C$582 million a year ago. George Weston said the loss mainly was attributable to an unfavorable year-over-year impact of adjusted items totaling C$648 million including the impact of the fair value adjustment of the Trust Unit liability. Sales increased narrowly to C$12.35 billion from C$12.33 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbWlubmVzb3Rhc25ld2NvdW50cnkuY29tL2thcHJpem92LWdldHMtc2hvb3RvdXQtd2lubmVyLXdpbGQtYmVhdC1tYXBsZS1sZWFmcy00LTMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kaprizov Gets Shootout Winner; Wild Beat Maple Leafs 4-3,"ST.

Formerly known as Detroit-Hamtramck the plant was built in 1985 and has manufactured more than 3 million vehicles over the years. Today it’s been transformed into Factory ZERO. Some of the first vehicles built at the plant will be the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV the Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup truck and the Cruise Origin a purpose-built electric self-driving shared vehicle.

The plant’s updates include:

Renovating and retooling the general assembly area

Constructing a brand-new automated storage building addition for GM’s Ultium battery assembly

Upgrading battery assembly with new contemporary tooling

Modernizing and adding enhanced tooling to the paint shop

Renewing and refurbishing the body shop

In November 2020 Factory ZERO became the first U.S. automotive plant to install Verizon’s 5G Ultra-Wideband technology GM says. Key benefits of 5G in a manufacturing plant include reliability speed and sheer scale. 5G’s massive bandwidth offers the possibility to manage thousands of devices across Factory ZERO’s footprint with ample capacity to support emerging technologies.

Factory ZERO will help contribute to GM’s commitment to source 100% of its U.S. facilities with renewable energy by 2030. In fact all DTE-supplied GM facilities in southeast Michigan including Factory ZERO will be powered by renewable energy by 2023. The factory also features a 30-kilowatt solar carport and 516-kilowatt solar array from DTE.

During the plant’s physical transition concrete waste was repurposed to create temporary roadways. Factory ZERO is also a certified wildlife habitat site featuring pollinator grasslands and formal native-plant gardens that are home to species such as monarchs foxes and turkeys.

Today the internet of things is transforming manufacturing plants like Factory ZERO enabling connected devices to deliver important benefits to quality and safety GM says. Countless systems and equipment rely on connectivity such as robotics sensors and the Automated Guided Vehicles that deliver materials across the factory floor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9nbS1sYXVuY2hlcy1jaGV2cm9sZXQtc3VwZXJjYXItZG93bi11bmRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Launches Chevrolet Supercar Down Under,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9nbS1sYXVuY2hlcy1jaGV2cm9sZXQtc3VwZXJjYXItZG93bi11bmRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzA1L3NpdC1kb3duLXN0cmlrZXMtcmV2b2x1dGlvbml6ZWQtdGhlLWxhYm9yLW1vdmVtZW50LS1jb3VsZC1pdC1oYXBwZW4tYWdhaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sit-down strikes revolutionized the labor movement — could it happen again?,"Joe Biden frequently says that he wants to emulate Franklin D. Roosevelt the president most revered among American liberals (along with John F. Kennedy and latterly Barack Obama). In one way he no doubt laments Biden has indeed emulated FDR — by seeing a pair of ""centrists"" from his own party (in this case Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema) undermine his agenda. Roosevelt faced some of his fiercest opposition from conservative Democrats including his own vice president John Nance Garner whose nickname really was ""Cactus Jack.""

Somewhat like Manchin and Sinema Garner mouthed platitudes about tradition and limited government to mask his allegiance to what today would be dubbed ""the one percent."" For most of Roosevelt's first term Garner watched in silent dismay as FDR sloughed off the Democratic Party's ideologically muddled history and moved sharply to the left at least on economic policy. Garner had initially supported Roosevelt for the reasons many conservatives did because he believed that saving democracy depended on easing the social unrest caused by the Great Depression. Once the immediate national distress began to ease Garner reverted to being as dogmatically pro-business as any modern-day Republican.

In the months after Roosevelt's landslide re-election in 1936 however Garner reached his breaking point. There was an issue where FDR took a stand that Garner saw as completely unacceptable and that ruptured their relationship permanently. Not only was Cactus Jack off the ticket when FDR sought (and won) an unprecedented third term in 1940 Garner actually ran against Roosevelt for the Democratic nomination.

RELATED: A short history of the filibuster: Rarely a tool for good — and never a tool of democracy

What was the issue? Roosevelt refused to take a strong stand against the ""sit-down strike"" a controversial labor tactic that posed a direct challenge to major industrial employers. In a sit-down strike workers would literally (if only temporarily) seize the means of production ""sitting down"" in a factory for example and refusing to budge. This made it almost impossible for employers to replace the strikers with scab workers or remove the equipment at least not without resorting to physical force. Any strike that physically prevents employers from producing or marketing commodities without literally going through their workers could be described as a sit-down strike but the term is generally used in factories or other large industrial facilities.

The U.S. experienced a wave of sit-down strikes in the 1930s but the concept seems to have emerged in France where in June 1936 many workers occupied their factories. This inspired American organized labor as well and Georgetown history professor Joseph A. McCartin explained by email that a turning point came on Dec. 30 1936 when workers at General Motors seized control of their complex in Flint Michigan:

The activists used the tactic in Flint because they knew it was the crucial node in the GM system and they believed they had enough organization in the plants there to pull it off. Everyone was excited by FDR's recent landslide reelection which seemed to ratify public support of the Wagner Act [a landmark 1935 labor law] and other New Deal measures. And organizers were growing impatient with GM's constant stalling and resistance to unionization. So they decided to force the company's hand.

Conservatives like Garner were intimidated because the strikes both challenged the core concept of industrial capitalism — the sacred character of private property — but also got results. FDR refused to order the workers removed from the Flint plant by force and the strikers ultimately achieved their primary goal: a union at GM. McCartin again:

Without the Flint sit-down strike it might have taken many more years to unionize General Motors and the entire industrial union movement might have failed to mature. The breakthrough boosted the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) and helped make other victories possible. Indeed U.S. Steel decided to voluntarily recognize the CIO's Steelworker Organizing Committee (SWOC) in hopes of avoiding the kind of disruption GM had experienced. Both GM and USS capitulated to the CIO before anyone even knew whether the [Supreme Court] would uphold the constitutionality of the NLRA (Wagner Act) which it later did on April 12 1937. This was a testament to how [much] leverage the sit-down strike gave workers.

The Flint sit-down strike McCartin concluded ""was certainly the single most pivotal strike of the era.""

Those were heady times for American labor but they didn't last long. By 1939 the political tide had begun to turn against Roosevelt and the Supreme Court effectively declared sit-down strikes illegal. Internal conflicts among Democrats meant the party could not support a tactic that directly assaulted the private property of wealthy special interests. To use a phrase favored by Richard Wolff a retired economics professor at UMass Amherst they had become ""hostage to their donors.""

Garner was essentially the leader of the anti-union Democrats — United Mine Workers leader John L. Lewis famously described him as ""a labor-baiting poker-playing whiskey-drinking evil old man"" — but he was not alone. While moderate or conservative Democrats had varying views on FDR's policies overall they had zero patience for sit-down strikes describing them as agents of anarchy and tyranny redolent of Communist influence. Roosevelt himself was forced to back away remaining neutral during the ""Little Steel Strike"" of 1937 out of fear of dividing the party and alienating Democratic voters. (Around this time Garner also went to war over FDR's attempt to reform the reactionary Supreme Court which conservatives derided as ""court packing"" — and that history is a big part of the reason Biden is unwilling to alter the court.)

Sit-down strikes have largely disappeared from the labor movement partly because a dwindling proportion of Americans work in large industrial facilities. There are conceptual echoes of the tactic adjusted for the Zoom era in the current age of the Great Resignation which also challenges the implicit notion that workers must play by the rules of the game — as set by the owners of capital — and have no power to change them. Like sit-down strikes the Big Quit challenges the validity of that entire system which means that experts and pundits respond by pronouncing gravely that it's a terrible idea.

In an interview with Salon Wolff observed that the entire idea that there is something special or sacred about private property is ridiculous. Private property like every other aspect of economics is a concept created by human beings who can revise that concept and the social rules around it at any time. Culture and history have trained us to be horrified when workers seek to make fundamental changes in the rules regarding property relations — but Wolff says that the rich and powerful do that all the time.

""Private property is violated every single day here in the United States"" he said. ""It's only a question of who's violating it and for what purpose. When workers occupy a place and some yowling capitalist tells you about 'private property' [that's] a ploy. It's a way to try to solve a problem."" Practices like eminent domain — in which a person can be forced to sell private property if a government body declares it's needed for an alleged social purpose — have existed for centuries and are often manipulated by wealthy developers for instance.

Although it's unlikely the sit-down strikes of the 1930s will ever be repeated Wolff suggests those strikers may be remembered for pointing the way forward toward a more humane way to work. ""It was a very profound movement forward that these auto workers did in Michigan by sitting in"" he said. Whether they knew it or not they were fighting not just for their own employment rights but for something much larger which Wolff describes as ""a displacement of the employee system by a democratization of the workplace where workers run their own businesses."" Sit-down strikes he said were ""a transitory step from the one to the other.""

Nearly a century later we're not much closer to a full ""democratization of the workplace."" But workers of the decentered gig economy and the work-from-home COVID economy are arriving at the same realization industrial workers had during the Depression: It's possible to change the rules and maybe even the game.

The MoU was signed by Ankush Arora CEO Al Mansour Automotive Group and Luay Al-Shurafa President and Managing Director General Motors Africa and the Middle East; and it was attended by Steve Kiefer GM Senior Vice President and President of GM International; Mohamed Loutfy Mansour Chairman of Al-Mansour Automotive Group; Tarek Atta Chairman and Managing Director of General Motors Egypt and North Africa.

“Al Mansour Automotive has been in the forefront of the automotive industry in Egypt over the last 46 years and leading its growth” said Mohamed Mansour Chairman of Al-Mansour Automotive Group.

“As the global automotive industry is undergoing a major transformation supported by disruptive innovation the MoU signed with General Motors is a testament of our joint commitment to bolstering the Egyptian economy through its strong manufacturing history and supporting new startups & young entrepreneurs developing solutions for a better future” he added.

Steve Kiefer GM Senior Vice President and President GM International said the partnership between GM and Mansour Automotive continued to be one of GM’s most important strategic global relationships.

“Together we have delivered over 1 million vehicles to customers in the region and Chevrolet has led the Egypt market for 14 consecutive years since the inception of our joint venture” said Kiefer.

“GM is transforming into a platform innovator globally as we invest USD 35 billion through 2025 in electric and autonomous vehicles in pursuit of our vision of a world of Zero Crashes Zero Emissions and Zero Congestion” Kiefer added.

“Partnerships like those between our two companies are just so important to these key investments and others that are driving GM’s global growth strategy” Kiefer added.

The MoU signed today is a continuation of the partnership between the two companies spanning five decades dating back to the establishment of Mansour Automotive Company in 1975 the same year when it was appointed the official GM dealer in Egypt.

Within five years Al Mansour became one of the largest automotive dealers in Egypt. In 1983 GM and Al Mansour with other shareholders established a joint-stock company. Mansour was granted exclusive distribution rights for GM brands and products in Egypt and the companies’ customer network expanded to 46 showrooms and 34 service centers nationwide in 2001.

Today Al-Mansour Automotive Group has more than 1500 employees all of whom are working on achieving the company’s strategic goals including annual production plans market share and quality standards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmNvbXBsYWludHMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9nbS1kZXN0aW5hdGlvbi1jaGFyZ2UtbGF3c3VpdC1kaXNtaXNzZWQuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Destination Charge Lawsuit Dismissed | CarComplaints.com,"Judge rules a reasonable consumer isn't surprised that GM makes a profit from a delivery fee.

December 5 2021 — A GM destination charge lawsuit has been dismissed after two customers claimed General Motors makes a profit when vehicles are delivered to dealerships.

The destination charge lawsuit further alleges GM “misleads reasonable consumers into believing its ‘Destination Charge' reflects the actual cost of shipping its vehicles to their ‘destination' not the cost of shipping its vehicles plus profit.”

The destination charge class action lawsuit was filed by California plaintiff Robert Romoff who paid a $1195 destination charge for his vehicle and New Jersey plaintiff Joe Siciliano who paid a $995 destination charge.

According to the destination charge lawsuit GM added the delivery fees to the new vehicle window stickers but failed to disclose that GM made a profit from the destination charge.

This allegedly deceived consumers because the real cost to GM for delivering a new vehicle isn't reflected on the window sticker or what is called the Monroney label.

The class action lawsuit alleges GM window stickers “break out [a] Destination Charge separate and apart from the base MSRP and include it as an add-on.”

This disclosure is mandated by the Federal Automobile Information Disclosure Act which requires manufacturers to list “the amount charged to the dealer for the transportation of the car to the place of delivery.”

But the two plaintiffs argue GM's destination charge has little to do with getting the vehicle to its intended destination and instead is used as a “vessel for profit.”

The plaintiffs also allege GM has increased the amount of the destination charge but the increase doesn't have anything to do with the costs of shipping new vehicles.

Motion to Dismiss the GM Destination Charge Lawsuit

General Motors told the judge its conduct was not deceptive because the amount and existence of the destination charge and total vehicle price was fully disclosed prior to purchase.

GM contends it had no duty to disclose any additional information about the destination charge or whether profit is included. The automaker also argues the entire issue of profit in a destination charge ""is not a material fact to a reasonable or average consumer.""

Judge William Q. Hayes agreed and dismissed the entire GM destination charge lawsuit.

""Reasonable or average consumers would not be surprised to learn that the price of goods often includes profit for the seller. The term “Destination Charge” does not reasonably imply an absence of profit."" — Judge Hayes

While the two plaintiffs claim a reasonable or average consumer would not expect the GM destination charge to include a profit the judge ""concluded that a reasonable or average consumer would not expect the Destination Charge to exclude profit.""

The GM destination charge lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California: Romoff et al. v. General Motors LLC.

The plaintiffs are represented by Kaliel Gold PLLC and Kopelowitz Ostrow Ferguson Weiselberg Gilbert."

American biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences Inc. has issued a nationwide recall of two lots of its coronavirus treatment drug Remdesivir due to the “presence of glass particulates” the company said Friday.

Remdesivir known also by its brand name ""Veklury"" is normally used for adults and children over 12 requiring hospitalization for covid-19 and is normally given in a vein by intravenous (IV) infusion one time each day for up to 10 days.

""Gilead Sciences Inc. received a customer complaint confirmed by the firm's investigation of the presence of glass particulates"" it said in a statement.

""An injectable product that contains glass particulates may result in local irritation or swelling in response to the foreign material. If the glass particulate reaches the blood vessels it can travel to various organs and block blood vessels in the heart lungs or brain which can cause stroke and even lead to death"" it added.

But Gilead noted to date it had not yet ""received any reports of adverse events related to this recall.""

The California-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post late on Friday but company spokesman Chris Ridley told Bloomberg the recall involved some 55000 vials of the drug enough to treat 11000 hospitalized patients.

The drug is normally ""distributed in single dose clear glass vials in powder form and reconstituted at the site of use"" the company said. The vials being recalled were distributed nationwide in the United States beginning October 2021.

Remdesivir gained emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in May 2020 with the United States buying up much of its global supply. It was also administered to former president Donald Trump when he was sick with covid-19. In October 2020 the antiviral drug became the first treatment for covid-19 to receive full FDA approval.

The FDA has outlined its use for adult patients and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (about 88 pounds) and has said it should only be administered in a hospital or health care setting.

In its own study last year Gilead said its drug led to an ""improvement in clinical recovery"" from covid-19 and a 62 percent reduction in risk of death when compared with patients receiving standard medical care but said more clinical trials were needed.

Amid the new omicron coronavirus variant the company said this week it expected Remdesivir to ""continue to be active"" against the new variant and that it would be conducting laboratory testing to confirm that analysis.

His Boss Disagrees. (Published 2021),"SoftBank the Japanese conglomerate that became synonymous with freewheeling spending on unprofitable technology start-ups including WeWork and Uber is trying to spend less money — starting with one of its own top executives.

Marcelo Claure the firm’s chief operating officer and a close confidant of the SoftBank founder and chief executive Masayoshi Son is seeking roughly $2 billion in compensation over the next several years according to four people with knowledge of the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly on pay issues. Mr. Son and other senior SoftBank executives in Japan are seeking to pay Mr. Claure a much smaller sum — tens of millions of dollars at most.

The unusually large amount at stake reflects Mr. Claure’s singular role at SoftBank where he has been part Mr. Fixit and part ambassador — untangling messy investments scouting out lucrative opportunities and wooing start-up founders — since joining in 2017. He arrived after running the telecom company Sprint when asked to do so by Mr. Son.

Mr. Claure has insisted in private conversations with individuals inside and outside SoftBank that he was owed the $2 billion for various cleanup jobs including straightening out SoftBank’s investment in WeWork the office-space leasing giant that went public in October.

Home to some of the region’s oldest and largest lenders Qatar’s banking sector is central to its nonhydrocarbon economy. Today the authorities are betting on fintech to become one of the country’s biggest future growth engines.

The demographics of Qatar support that strategy. The country’s population of 2.7 million is 85% people ages 20 to 35 years old who are mainly expatriates and regularly transfer money home. It is also one of the world’s wealthiest countries with nearly $87000 GDP per capita in 2020 and one of the most connected with 99% internet penetration.

Unlike markets where fintech is geared toward reaching the underbanked Qatar has a robust banking system that embraces digital innovation as a tool to serve all clients. As a result lenders very much drive change from payments to wealth management.

BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE

The country’s overall digital transformation strategy is spearheaded by the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) with the support of the Qatar Development Bank (QDB) and Qatar Financial Centre (QFC). The trio invests in and adapts legal frameworks to create an ecosystem that will put the Gulf nation on the fintech map.

Qatar offers tax incentives and recently lifted all restrictions on foreign ownership of companies and repatriation of profits to attract foreign investment and innovation. It also facilitates access to funding through the QDB’s $100 million fund a network of venture capitalists and many family offices and high-net-worth individuals who look to invest outside of their core hydrocarbon-related businesses.

The QDB set up an incubator and an accelerator in 2020. According to organizers despite the pandemic the 12-week program has attracted more than 500 applications for only a dozen available spots each session. Along with training sessions and mentorship selected startups get a cash prize of $40000 (incubator) and $100000 (accelerator).

InvestSuite a Belgium-based provider of digital wealth management services to financial institutions worldwide participated in the second session. “We are growing rapidly and the Middle East has become a strategically important region for us in terms of our prospects and clients” says Jonathan Gane chief sales officer at InvestSuite. “We see Qatar as a very interesting jurisdiction with a lot happening. Many of the financial institutions there are looking at digital transformation. It is an excellent fit for us especially since our technology can be localized easily.”

So far the central bank’s approach to new technologies has been exceedingly bank-centered. However Qatar is building a global network of partnerships with fintech associations and universities to help foster further innovation.

New Licensing

The absence of regulation has somewhat restricted fintech development in Qatar compared to other countries in the region. The QFC has a fintech license but only for a limited list of B2B services. As a result companies that want to offer digital payments and B2C were simply not permitted to do so without a standard banking license.

But the regulation is about to change. The Central Bank is finalizing a regulatory sandbox and a payment service provider (PSP) license similar to those that Dubai Saudi Arabia and Bahrain already have. According to industry sources the regulator sent out a circular to all banks advising them to get their aggregators to submit for approval.

Twyla Technologies a Qatari company founded in 2019 that provides information systems and audio-visual solutions like e-invoicing and payment gateways is on the shortlist to receive one of the first licenses. “It will help us to work independently in the market and the region” says Nauman Gul Twyla’s CEO. “Being recognized by Qatar Central Bank we would be able to build a higher level of trust with our customers and be more competitive.”

PSP licenses should strengthen new players via à vis the banks. The new licenses are also expected to spur the need for new partnerships mergers and acquisitions.

“With the rise of an ecosystem model in the financial sector partnerships between banks and cross-sector players are required to discover new relationships and build innovative platforms” Abdulaziz Bin Nasser Al Khalifa CEO of QDB and chairman of the Qatar FinTech Hub said in a recent interview.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcmVkcGVwcGVyLmNvLnVnL2dvb2QtbW92ZS1jZW50ZW5hcnktYmFuay1sYXVuY2hlcy1tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLWRlYml0LWNhcmQvMTE0MTY5L9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vcmVkcGVwcGVyLmNvLnVnL2dvb2QtbW92ZS1jZW50ZW5hcnktYmFuay1sYXVuY2hlcy1tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLWRlYml0LWNhcmQvMTE0MTY5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Good move! Centenary Bank launches MasterCard Debit Card,"By Ambrose Gahene

While addressing the media Centenary Bank’s Managing Director Mr. Fabian Kasi revealed that the bank’s partnership with MasterCard is aimed at promoting convenience for its high net worth customers by offering them access to a legacy lifestyle where they will be able to make online purchases book hotels buy air tickets and pay for goods and services when they travel abroad using the MasterCard Platinum debit card.

Kasi remarked: “The partnership comes at a time when there is a fundamental shift in the banking industry and other sectors of the economy in relation to how services are consumed greatly influenced by the increasing rate of technology innovations and adoption through digitally driven platforms like MasterCard.”

According to the bank the High Net Worth customers will enjoy several benefits including higher transaction limits access to airport lounges discounts at selected local and global stores as well as online purchases and faster Visa application tracking among others. Customers will also have a dedicated Relationship Manager to support them.

Mr. Victor Ndlovu Country Business Development Lead East Africa at Mastercard said: “MasterCard is pleased to partner with one of the largest banks in Uganda serving a quarter of the banking population with a unique base of about 200000 customers who we believe are the right users of our card given our global footprint and the value addition that comes with using the Platinum Debit MasterCard.”

Ndlovu explained: “MasterCard provides a world beyond cash by integrating up to date technology with innovations that address the customers’ desired end result” adding that “Through several of our partners we provide great discounts on travel tour shipping luxury shopping and accommodation as well as giving higher card limits and daily weekly and monthly offers.”

“Safety and Security is a key feature of our card technology enabled with MasterCard Secure Code a one-time password system ensuring only transactions you approve are made as well as EMV (Chip Technology) MasterCard Identity Check and Wallet Protection Insurance with worldwide coverage and reimbursement under specific conditions” Ndlovu said.

According to the 2021 Global Payments Report by McKinsey & Company a global consulting firm global card payments are expected to rebound and grow to revenue of approximately $2.5 trillion by 2025 from a decline of $1.9 trillion in 2020. Globally 54 percent of banks cite card payments as very important to FinTech’s partnerships while 73 percent consider digital account opening as very important.

Such trends and the continued growth in uptake of digital financial services in Uganda have inspired Centenary Bank to continue investing in relevant products and services. Over the last five years the bank has enhanced its digital banking services offerings by rolling out solutions like Agency banking internet banking and adding new features it’s CenteMobile banking platform including CenteMobile Loans CenteXpress and more recently CenteOn the Go a service that enables users to open account for themselves using a smartphone.

(Purdue University photo/Jon Garcia)

WEST LAFAYETTE Ind. — In August Aron Lee took part in Purdue University Global commencement ceremonies having earned his Bachelor of Science degree in health and wellness.

On Saturday (Dec. 4) Lee was back on the graduation stage this time addressing more than 1700 Purdue Global graduates who took part in in-person and virtual ceremonies in Elliott Hall of Music on the Purdue West Lafayette campus. It marked Purdue Global’s 12th commencement since its formation in 2018 and the first in West Lafayette.

“We have only just begun” said Lee a master sergeant in the U.S. Air Force who has served for 22 years and graduated summa cum laude from Purdue Global. “All of those late-night discussion questions homework assignments quizzes group projects and end-of-term surveys got you right here: to the starting line. This is where your race starts. This is where the grind starts.

“You all will walk out of here with an awesome certificate by the decree of the chancellor that states you have the knowledge to do a thing. The grind is going out into the world and doing that thing with success in the face of adversity. Remembering why you are on this journey is going to help you. You are now a benchmark of success. You are at a level to which people want to achieve. Be that example of success. Leave a legacy. Encourage people.”

Two in-person ceremonies and a virtual one took place over the course of the day. Degrees were awarded from the schools of business and information technology education general education health sciences nursing social and behavioral sciences and Concord Law School. There were 769 bachelor’s degrees 601 graduate degrees 200 associate degrees 122 certificates and 23 doctoral degrees (16 Doctor of Nursing Practice four Juris Doctor and three Executive Juris Doctor).

The graduates reside in 49 states – including 305 Indiana residents – plus Washington D.C. and the U.S. Virgin Islands while nine additional countries were represented: Canada China Hong Kong Jamaica Japan Kuwait the Philippines Saudi Arabia and Turks and Caicos Islands. Thirty-eight employees of Purdue West Lafayette Purdue Fort Wayne Purdue Northwest and Purdue Global are among those who earned a Purdue Global degree or certificate via the Purdue Global education benefit.

The breadth of graduates includes several family connections:

A husband and wife from Williamsport Indiana – Jerry Culvahouse a steam utilities mechanic at the Bindley Bioscience Center in Discovery Park District at Purdue and Kim Culvahouse who has worked as a clerk and teacher aide at Purdue. Both earned their Bachelor of Business Administration through the education benefit program.

A husband and wife from Noblesville Indiana – Matthew Gualdoni who earned a Master of Business Administration and Jennifer Gualdoni who earned a Master of Science degree in instructional design and technology.

Siblings Joshua Singer (Bachelor of Science in legal support and services) of Indianapolis and Megan Singer (Bachelor of Science in psychology in applied behavior analysis) of Riverside California.

Chancellor Frank Dooley addressed the graduates – 814 of them in-person and 901 virtually.

“I'm thrilled that we were able to celebrate here on campus where the history of Purdue began over 150 years ago” Dooley said. “Can you believe that classes began with only six instructors and 39 students? Look at how far we have come. West Lafayette is a campus with 50000 students and Purdue Global has another 35000 students.

“We are grateful to provide a ceremony that brings us all together no matter where we are around the globe either virtually or here in Elliott Hall. ... I love that we can remain close through this institution as we commemorate your accomplishments today.”

Dooley noted that over 9000 Purdue Global students are affiliated with the military including nearly 5000 active duty National Guard and reserve members serving worldwide. Almost 50% are the first in their family to attend college and about 60% care for a child or other dependent.

“What you have done is so remarkable” Dooley said. “In addition to completing your education you dealt with everything else that life throws your way. And in the last year that added COVID to the mix.”

Two Purdue Global graduates performed the national anthem before their respective in-person ceremonies: Lisa Calderon from San Antonio Texas who graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in communication and Ellen McCullough from Highland Indiana who graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in cybersecurity.

In the days before commencement Purdue Global hosted various virtual celebratory events including a photo booth toast graduation “shout out” board and social media activities.

A total of 10924 Purdue Global students have graduated in the last year.

The next Purdue Global commencement is scheduled for May 21 and will take place at the Murat Theatre at Old National Centre in Indianapolis.

The family wanted to say a special thank you to the staff at Hillside Height's Rehabilitation Center for all the wonderful care over the past 4 years and to Kindred Hospice Care.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZGVuZ2xvYmVzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90aGUtd29yc3QtcGVyc29uLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC1ub3J3YXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Worst Person in the World (Norway),"Julie (Renate Reinsve) is a confused woman in her 20s. She has had a hard time picking her career path when she meets a 15-year older guy the graphic novelist Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie) and falls in love with him. They move in together start a life together but Julie is not quite satisfied and longs for something more.

“My dream was to try to make a film about big subjects” says director Joachim Trier about his film The Worst Person in the World. “I wanted to make an epic story of someone’s life but quite a normal life. Small events and nothing super dramatic.”

The film does exactly that: It deals with the small moments in Julie’s life that do however become epic in her life. It follows Julie as she discovers that the age difference between Aksel and her is an issue and that they are at different stages in their lives – and different career paths – which makes it hard for them to have a solid relationship. When socializing with Aksel’s friends who have families it is obvious that he wants kids and she doesn’t. Yet. She decides to leave him.

“I don’t know how many breakup scenes I’m doing in my life as a filmmaker” says Joachim Trier about some pivotal scenes in the film. “So when I do a big breakup scene in the middle of the film it mattered to me that it had a sense of stages of emotional development and authenticity.”

As Julie longs for excitement in life and Aksel longs for stability their relationship ends when she meets a younger man Eivind (Herbert Nordrum) and starts a relationship with him. However this relationship is not meant to be either and Julie beats herself up over her failure to make it work.

“Are you sure it’s Julie that’s the worst person in the world?” says Joachim Trier about the title of the film and who it refers to. “I think that all of them feel like they’re the worst person in the world. It’s meant as a self-deprecating statement. In Norway we say: “I failed on a personal level. I feel like the worst person in the world.” It’s not meant as a judgment on anyone. I feel that the film also falls on the side of sympathy with her not wanting to have a kid which I can relate to.”

The Norwegian director is known for films such as the psychodramas Oslo August 31st (2011) and Reprise (2006) as well as the horror film Thelma (2017) and the English language film Louder than Bombs (2015). His fifth film The Worst Person in the World premiered at the Cannes film festival where Renate Reinsve won as Best Actress.

“The film is written for Renate” says Joachim Trier. “She played a small part in Olso August 31st.” She had one line of dialogue which was something like “Let’s go to the party” or something. And I felt she was a brilliant actor. Ten years later I wrote this for her because she’s quite remarkable.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vbGlmZS9oZWFsdGgtYW5kLWZpdG5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS1wZXJzb25hbC10cmFpbmVycy1hcmUtZXZvbHZpbmctcGFzdC1maXRuZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Personal trainers are evolving past fitness,"It always intrigues me to learn the real reason why someone seeks my services. Sure on the surface it seems obvious – people hire trainers to help them “get in shape.” But what does that even mean really?

Some people want help learning proper technique because they’re new to exercise and they’ve been brainwashed to believe it’s a dangerous endeavour (it’s not or at least it doesn’t have to be). Others have highly stressful lives and they’re too tired at the end of the day to marshal their mental resources. These people simply want someone who knows what they’re talking about to tell them what to do. Lately I’ve been noticing a new trend one that’s becoming more visible as personal training continues to evolve from something ex-bodybuilders used to tinker with as a hobby into a legitimate profession open to anyone.

More and more people are looking for personal trainers with the ability to act as a sort of multi-faceted medical practitioner. They want someone who they can turn to with questions about fitness yes but also questions about deeper concerns issues like nutrition sleep and mental health. It’s not uncommon for clients to come to me with existential maladies to match their physical ones; and in fact I’ve had more than a few tell me I’ve been more helpful in addressing their woes than any doctor shrink or physiotherapist. (To be clear nobody should fire their family doctor or therapist in favour of a personal trainer. But the duties of a quality coach extend beyond fitness.)

“The mentality that trainers are just drill sergeants has significantly shifted” said Tim Jones CEO of Precision Nutrition (PN) during a phone call earlier this month. “Trainers are now being viewed more as coaches and health care providers.”

This is why it’s so important for trainers to have a broad skill set. Anyone with a clipboard and a whistle can structure a workout but how well can you address those deeper issues that lie just below the surface? Industry leaders like the brain trust at PN have played an important role in facilitating this paradigm shift. Since 2005 PN has been at the forefront of fitness and health education with their flagship nutrition certification now a standard requirement for every trainer worth their salt. This month they have launched a new Sleep Stress Management and Recovery Coaching Certification something Mr. Jones says will provide trainers with even more tools to help their clients.

“People develop very strong trusting relationships with their personal trainers. We want to help trainers feel more credible and confident when responding to these new questions their clients are asking. We want to change the way trainers view themselves and the level of impact they can have on their clients’ lives.”

If it sounds like a stretch to place personal trainers in the same category as doctors and nurses well chances are you haven’t worked with a high-level coach. The best of the best operate on an entirely different level than your stereotypical rep-counter. They view fitness and health through a clinical lens one that takes into view a complete and holistic perspective.

“We don’t really have the ability to have deep conversations with our doctors” said Mr. Jones. “You see your doctor you get your lab test you get your prescription then you go. There’s no space to have a dialogue about things you may have read things you may have heard. But you can have that with your personal trainer.”

Reaching this higher level of professional standing isn’t easy. The days when all a trainer needed to set-up shop was a jacked bod and the ability to count to 10 are long gone. The internet has made available all of the tips and techniques that were once considered trade secrets and social media offers a sense of personal connection that can make an onscreen avatar just as compelling and commanding as a flesh and blood coach. So what is it that separates pretenders and frauds from the real deal?

According to Mr. Jones it’s credibility and competence two factors that are only earned through education and experience.

“The opportunities for education in this industry have grown substantially over time. From functional movement and nutrition programs to behaviour change and health coaching there are so many options available to trainers to help them feel more confident in responding to these new questions consumers are asking.”

This isn’t to say every trainer needs to have a masters in kinesiology or a two-year college diploma. Most trainers understand the musculoskeletal system; they’re well-versed in anatomy 101 and how muscles function in relation to tendons and ligaments and bones. If what you’re looking for is to simply add a bit of muscle or lose a few pounds well just anyone can help with that. But as Mr. Jones points out there’s a lot more to a healthy lifestyle than sweating it out at the gym a few days a week.

“There are factors beyond nutrition and exercise that influence our health and well-being” he said. “It’s much more comprehensive than just pumping iron and eating chicken and vegetables.”

GUANGZHOU - December 4 2021 - Goldman Sachs and the International Finance Forum (IFF) announced today the launch of the Green Finance Working Group (Working Group) which will provide a platform for companies to exchange and develop ideas on how best to leverage green finance innovations and help advance the world’s transition to a low-carbon economy.

Co-chaired by John Waldron President and Chief Operating Officer of Goldman Sachs and Zhu Xian Vice President and Secretary-General of the IFF the Working Group will facilitate dialogue on climate action among senior executives from global corporations and researchers from leading institutions. It will also advise and work with policymakers to enhance green finance cooperation across the public and private sectors.

The Working Group will also have a special focus on China’s role in achieving sustainable outcomes. Research from Goldman Sachs estimates that China’s pursuit of Net Zero could generate USD 16 trillion in infrastructure investment opportunities by 2060 as well as 40 million net new jobs for the country while supporting robust economic growth.

“We need to move from the science of climate change to the business of climate change to deploying these technologies at scale and making it easier for consumers to seek out and opt for greener energy sources to power their daily lives” said Waldron. “Many of the companies that are joining us in the Working Group are some of the most important investors and users of energy worldwide—we need them to be active participants and supporters of the climate transition ahead. Their participation in this group will add momentum to global efforts already underway and help make those efforts more effective by sharing the lessons learned from their decades of business operations.”

“We share a common vision towards development of low carbon economies including promotion of a strong green financial market and strengthening the role of finance in driving the implementation of global sustainable development processes” said Zhu Xian. “ This Working Group will convene top level representatives of leading global companies including banks and financial institutions and other key sectors such as energy and transport and leading researchers from the U.S. E.U. U.K. and China in a solutions-focused dialogue on how best to leverage green finance and capital markets as key tools to mitigate climate change and transition to a low carbon economy.”

The launch of the Working Group was announced at the opening ceremony of the IFF 18th Annual Meeting in Guangzhou on December 4 2021.

And while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback had to wait much longer to hear his name called in the 2000 NFL Draft the savior of the Cincinnati Bengals became the first player chosen two decades later.

Of course nobody expected Roger Goodell to read Burrow’s name before anyone else’s before the 2020 college season began. But by undergoing a radical transformation and lighting it up at LSU the uber-talented signal-caller put himself in a position to become the face of a franchise that remains in search of its first Super Bowl title.

And with the way the Bengals have played thus far the Lombardi Trophy may finally make its way to Cincinnati sooner than expected.

Joe Burrow’s college career couldn’t have been more unconventional

Congratulations to Joe Burrow 2019 @HeismanTrophy winner (left) pictured here with GS' Jim McNamara (zero Heismans) during Joe’s time at our office. @Joe_Burrow10 is always welcome back but we think he may have some other plans post-graduation… pic.twitter.com/svJRtqB253 — Goldman Sachs (@GoldmanSachs) December 16 2019

Talk about a journey full of twists and turns.

Joe Burrow began his college career at Ohio State but he remained buried on the depth chart behind big names like J.T. Barrett and Dwayne Haskins. After attempting just 39 passes with the Buckeyes he took his talents to the SEC. And despite spending three years as a complete afterthought he achieved legend status by the time he left LSU.

Burrow’s magical senior season included a 76.3% completion rate 5671 passing yards and 60 passing touchdowns. Most importantly he led the Tigers to a national championship.

His ascension from overlooked backup to bonafide star had to surprise Buckeyes fans. After all Burrow didn’t even have plans to make a living as a pro athlete. He even did an internship at Goldman Sachs in 2016 — an experience you won’t find on most NFL players’ resumes.

“I was going to have to get a real-world job” he told NFL reporter Judy Battista. “But it turned out differently.”

The SEC legend-turned-NFL star has transformed the Bengals from a middling franchise into a dangerous team on the rise

The @Bengals swept the season series against the @steelers for the first time since 2009.



Led by @JoeyB they won by 30+ points on Sunday for only the third time in the 103-game history of the matchup. #RuleTheJungle pic.twitter.com/srio63QiBx — NFL Football Operations (@NFLFootballOps) December 3 2021

Luckily for Bengals fans Burrow underwent a major transformation over a five-year period that led to him becoming the No. 1 pick in the 2020 draft. And thankfully for them he’s overcome a brutal knee injury that ended his promising rookie campaign and put himself in the conversation for NFL MVP honors.

With a 69.3% completion rate 2835 passing yards and 22 passing touchdowns the 6-foot-4 221-pound quarterback has made it abundantly clear that he’ll be a force to be reckoned with for years to come. Showcasing excellent chemistry (no surprise there) with former LSU teammate and top draft pick Ja’Marr Chase Burrow has led the Bengals to a 7-4 record — a remarkable accomplishment considering they went 2-14 in 2019 and 4-11-1 a year ago.

While the second-year signal-caller has to cut down on his turnovers (12 interceptions and three fumbles) and get better about avoiding sacks it’s safe to say he’s completely changed the outlook in Cincinnati.

Just let his coach explain.

“He’s got a different mental makeup than the rest of us” Zac Taylor told Battista. “That’s why you’re the national champion Heisman Trophy-winning No. 1 pick in the draft. There’s a reason you do that and we don’t.”

Between Burrow and a much-improved roster Cincinnati has a chance to compete for Super Bowl titles for years to come

If he was starting a franchise today @danorlovsky7 would choose Joe Burrow over Justin Herbert ?



""I just think he's got that Aaron Rodgers in him that Tom Brady … There's guys that come into the NFL that have 'it' at a rare … level. And I think Joe Burrow has that."" pic.twitter.com/GsAC117vIU — First Take (@FirstTake) December 2 2021

Just over a year removed from tearing his ACL and MCL in his left knee Burrow seems more dangerous than ever. He has a rock-solid set of weapons that includes Chase (50 catches for 906 yards and eight touchdowns) 2020 second-round pick Tee Higgins (43/560/3) steady veteran Tyler Boyd (46/471/2) and underrated tight end C.J. Uzomah (30/331/5). Plus dynamic running back Joe Mixon (924 rushing yards 192 receiving yards 13 total touchdowns) has provided a formidable punch as a do-it-all playmaker.

Combine that with a defense that surprisingly ranks sixth in points allowed at 20.5 per game and the Bengals have the makings of a championship team. Not only do they boast balance (they’re also sixth in points scored at 28.1 per game) but they have a roster full of young players on the rise. This is a team that has the opportunity to take over an AFC North division that may look a lot different after the season.

The Pittsburgh Steelers seem to be trending in the wrong direction mostly because of their refusal to move on from Ben Roethlisberger. The Baltimore Ravens remain a playoff-caliber team but they have yet to take the next step with Lamar Jackson. And the Cleveland Browns continue to be the NFL’s biggest tease which has much to do with the up-and-down play of 2018 No. 1 overall pick Baker Mayfield.

As for the Bengals?

They clearly hit a home run by making Joe Burrow the first player off the board two years later. And as a late bloomer it’s scary to think what the future holds for someone who has the arm talent athleticism and attitude to win multiple Super Bowl titles.

CoinDesk never heard a rumour about proper investment bankers even glancing at Bitcoin that it didn’t rush to print. This week’s is that Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are looking at lending actual money using Bitcoin as collateral. [CoinDesk]

Goldman Sachs correctly considers Bitcoin trash. So they’re trying to construct a backing made of synthetic products — i.e. bets on the price such as CME Bitcoin futures which are bought in dollars and paid out in dollars — so that they do not at any stage risk touching a bitcoin. Squiddy* wants some slight protection if Bitcoin goes bad — say if BTC/USD drops 20% in a few minutes as it did last night — and the collateral is suddenly worthless. The regulators also have to go along with the specific product they come up with.

The real story is that the whales — “large institutional trading firms” per the article — want (or need) to realise the face value of their bitcoins and they can’t because there just aren’t enough actual dollars in the market. This is the same reason miners are keeping a “stockpile” of unsaleable bitcoins as I’ve noted previously.

So the whales are going to Goldman Sachs to ask for a loan backed by their unsaleable bitcoins even though the collateral can’t possibly cover for the value of the loan even if Bitcoin doesn’t crash. It’s a way for the whales to cash out and leave Squiddy holding the bag. I expect Squiddy is fully cognisant of this and this is the scenario they’re trying to construct a buffer against.

* Traders nicknamed Goldman Sachs “Squiddy” after Matt Taibbi called the bank “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity” in 2010. [Rolling Stone] I’m annoyed that I can’t find a Wikipedia-quality source for the fact that traders and finance nerds call Goldman Sachs “Squiddy” now.

The unofficial Wikipedia NFT

The money will be donated to free-culture charities. This won’t include Wikipedia — Jimmy is taking care to stress that the Wikimedia Foundation is not involved with this at all. [The Verge]

I’ve known Jimmy since Wikipedia’s early days — and he’s read my books and knows what I think of all things crypto. He went to Christie’s to auction off the iMac. Christie’s suggested doing an NFT and he asked what I thought. I advised against the plan — I thought it was a bad idea and would get a bad reaction from the Wikipedia community and from the general public for all the reasons NFTs are bad.

Christie’s were pretty sure the NFT could make quite a chunk of money — enough that even I was trying to think how we could do this without alienating the community and public.

But Jimmy decided on balance that it was worth going ahead buying a carbon offset for the NFT’s share of Ethereum mining and so on. So here’s to some money for the charities. At least the strawberry iMac is a legitimately cool souvenir item.

The other story here is that Christie’s is actively promoting NFTs to sufficiently famous customers. Which is not surprising as it’s free money for a cryptographic hash and they made millions from the $69 million JPEG that Beeple wash-traded with Metakovan.

Why Gaming NFTs Will Never Work. “I don’t want to spend too much time on our differences though and instead rally around our similarities — namely we all hate NFTs.” An excellent single-paragraph summary of what the heck an NFT is: [The Gamer]

A brief rundown of what an NFT is — it takes a picture on the internet (of which there are an infinite number) and arbitrarily attempts to limit the number available by selling digital ownership receipts. You can still right click and save for free but you won’t ‘own’ the image not without the receipt. Sound stupid? Great you’re all caught up. Oh and it’s also tremendously bad for the environment thanks to the huge energy drain caused by the underlying blockchain technology that powers it.

The NFT market is made of wash trading. The top 10% of traders have traded 97% of NFTs. 10% of buyer-seller pairs make up half the volume. The secondary market is a minority — “less than 10% are sold at least once within one week after the primary sale and only about 22% within 1 year.” [Scientific Reports; supplementary information PDF]

What happened to all the Chinese mining rigs? The Financial Times tracked the exodus. More than two million rigs left China. Of one sample of 432000 rigs most ended up in Russia (200000) Kazakhstan (87849) the US (87200) Canada (35000) Paraguay (15500) and Venezuela (7000).

Russian mining company BitRiver claims to be running 200000 ex-Chinese rigs. Roman Zabuga from BitRiver says “The focus of the market has shifted from a lack of equipment to a lack of space for its placement.” He said that BitRiver had turned down an offer of another one million rigs for lack of anywhere to put them.

About 700000 Chinese rigs went off and haven’t been switched back on — mostly S9-generation rigs which are all but unviable now. [FT paywalled]

After a massive crypto-based Ponzi scheme India tried banning crypto in its entirety by way of the Reserve Bank of India issuing a regulation that banks couldn’t serve crypto entities. The Supreme Court knocked down that regulation and said the government had to make a law.

The law has been in the works since and is close to being finalised. Regulated crypto trading may or may not be allowed but using crypto for payments definitely won’t be. Crypto firms can’t advertise either. It’s not clear who the regulator will be. The government may impose hefty capital gains and sales taxes. India likes the idea of a CBDC however. The final version is expected in two to three weeks. [Economic Times; Reuters]

Failson à la Mode

London fintech and not-a-bank Mode told the world that it was giving Bitcoin rewards to shoppers at UK retailers such as Boots Homebase and Ocado. Mode shares went up 15%!

Unfortunately Mode’s claims were denied by the retailers in question. Mode clarified its previous claims and the share price dropped back down. Mode is totally still launching its crypto cashback in 2022 and definitely has forty or more online retailers on board for sure. [FT paywalled]

Mode is the latest project of Jonathan Rowland large adult failson of former Conservative Party treasurer David “Spotty” Rowland money manager for and good friend of Prince Andrew. Jemima Kelly at FT has previously documented Rowland the Younger’s ten-year string of inept failed entrepreneurial initiatives funded by pater’s bankroll.

Things happen

Bitcoin crashed to $42000 last night! Someone sold 1500 BTC and that triggered a cascade of sales of burnt margin-traders’ collateral of another 4000 BTC. The Tether peg broke too. The surprising thing this time around is that all the crypto exchanges didn’t simultaneously need urgent scheduled maintence. [CoinDesk]

China still hates crypto. Three crypto media outlets — Chainnews ODaily and BlockBeats — have been shut down and several mining pools are now blocked by the Great Firewall. [The Block]

The IRS seized $3.5 billion from crypto-related fraud in fiscal 2021. [Yahoo! News; IRS PDF]

Vice wrote up the collapse of ConstitutionDAO in detail. Their token PEOPLE is being traded on Uniswap as a negligible-volume minor altcoin. [Vice; CoinTelegraph]

Bitcoin adoption in the enterprise is doing so incredibly well that insurers are no longer offering coverage against ransomware as costs are going through the roof. [Reuters]

John Kiff and Jonas Gross have written about retail CBDC considerations. CBDCs are mostly being floated in less-developed countries where commercial bank payment networks aren’t very good or aren’t up to the task — hence the Sand Dollar and eNaira. [CoinDesk]

Bitcoin and other cryptos have slumped after record highs. Is market manipulation the reason why? An interview with me by Euronews. This was two weeks ago before the crash last night. [Euronews]

Bloomberg News reported previously that the buyout firm has been informally discussing the idea of an IPO after the successful listings of Bridgepoint Group Plc and EQT AB though no decision has been made people familiar with the matter said at the time.

CVC has not mandated any banks and is not actively preparing a listing people familiar told Bloomberg News on Saturday. The firm continues to discuss internally the option of a listing and several banks have approached the firm with proposals but nothing has been decided the people said.

The buyout firm agreed in September to acquire secondary buyout specialist Glendower Capital and also lined up a minority stake sale to Blue Owl Capital Inc. at a $15 billion valuation. The fresh investor and acquisition were seen as CVC paving the way for a future IPO the people said.

Representatives for CVC and Goldman Sachs declined to comment on a potential IPO or mandates.

Established in 1981 as the European venture capital arm of New York-based banking giant Citicorp CVC describes itself as a private equity and credit firm with $125 billion of assets under management. Its investments in the past decade have ranged from Asian hospitals and European betting operations to a US pet supplier.

With Covid-19 crushing the finances of live sporting events CVC has moved heavily into seeking deals in cricket rugby volleyball tennis basketball and European football.

The firm tried and failed to strike deals with Italy’s Serie A and Germany’s Bundesliga the top football leagues in those countries. But its €2 billion injection into Spain's top two divisions in return for a long-term share of broadcasting revenues appears headed toward an approval vote on Friday despite opposition from the two largest and richest clubs.

In October CVC won an auction to buy one of two new franchises in India's Twenty20 cricket contest for €658 million. It followed that with agreeing to pay Unilever €4.5 billion for its tea division which includes the PG Tips and Lipton brands.

It is undeniable that one of the technologies which has found its way into various industries including the oil and gas sector is nanotechnology. As an interdisciplinary technology nanotechnology has attracted the attention of large oil and gas companies. A look at the current status of these companies indicates that depending on the significance they attach to nanotechnology they have dedicated a remarkable part of their innovations and inventions to this technology.

With the advent of nanotechnology numerous scientists predicted that this technology would penetrate varied areas and become one of the most vital tools to meet technological challenges. In this regard the oil and gas industry would be considered a key industry in the world the developments of which have tangible effects on other sectors.





This report aims to examine patents as one of the important indicators to study the degree of penetration and impact of nanotechnology in the oil and gas sector. To do so the statistics pertaining to nanotechnology patents of several large companies active in the field of oil and gas in the world have been scrutinized. The Forbes and Fortune websites have been used to compile a list of the top oil companies while the Orbit database has been employed to extract patent statistics for these companies. Forbes is a business company offering invaluable information in the fields of economics finance industry and market and Fortune is an American business magazine that works in the area of ranking various companies. The original companies have been used to extract the statistics whereas their subsidiaries which have different names from the main companies have not been examined.





Table 1 presents a list of the 25 largest oil companies with the most patents related to nanotechnology. These patents have been issued or registered in different years by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO). The table also outlines the number of nano patents issued by these companies by USPTO and EPO the number of patents in all fields of science and technology the share of nano patents from all the patents and the country where the companies are located. The entire number of patents issued by these top 25 companies in the field of nanotechnology amounts to about 5005 of which more than 84% have been published in the USPTO and about 16% in the EPO.





Of the 25 companies listed nine are owned by the United States and a total of around 58% of the nano patents issued by these 25 oil and gas companies are held by US companies. Among these companies are Baker Hughes Company and Halliburton which have issued 940 and 731 patents in the area of nanotechnology and are ranked first and third in this regard respectively. The second place belongs to the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) which has had a significant growth in the issuance of patents in the field of nanotechnology in the past few years. Another fact is the presence of three companies from Japan a country which possesses scarce oil and gas resources but has a serious presence in this field having registered 205 nano patents.

Table 1. The world's top oil and gas companies based on the number of patents and patent applications issued in the field of nanotechnology.

Studies reveal that in total the two continents of North America and Asia have the highest number of companies regarding nanotechnology patents in the oil and gas sector followed by Europe and South America. Figure 1 illustrates the share of different continents with regard to the top companies in this field.

Figure 1. Share of different continents with regard to the top companies active in the oil and gas sector in the dissemination of nano patents.

Figure 2 shows the patent release trends for the top 5 companies in this field between 2010 and 2020. One of the highlights of Figure 2 is the significant growth of nanotechnology patents by the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) from 2017 onwards. Between 2010 and 2013 Aramco published less than 10 inventions in the field of nanotechnology every year but in 2014 experiencing a noticeable growth it increased the number of inventions in the field of nanotechnology to over 10. However the most significant growth of this company started from 2017 onwards with the company registering the highest number of patents in the field of nanotechnology among all the top 5 companies in 2018 while it achieved the second position in nano patent issuance by November 2021.





The other top four companies issued similar numbers of patents in the field of nanotechnology in 2010 whereas Baker Hughes Company with an increase in patent numbers in this field in 2012 was able to widen the distance with the other companies taking the first place. In 2020 with the exception of the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) the other four companies faced a decline in patent releases a fact which is also observed in 2021. One of the reasons for this could be the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on the global economy including the oil and gas sector and companies active in this field which has led to a degeneration in research and development in these companies.

Figure 2. Number of patents issued in the field of nanotechnology by the top 5 companies in the oil and gas sector over the last 10 years.

One of the indicators proposed in this research is the ratio of patents in the field of nanotechnology to the total patents published in all fields of science and technology. This indicator shows the role of nanotechnology and its impact on the overall findings of a company. In this regard the highest share of nanotechnology patents in the total number of patents belongs to the Iranian Petroleum Industry Research Institute (RIPI) at 41.94%. Of course this company does not possess a significantly large number of patents with a total of 62 patents in the two offices in the United States and Europe. The second position according to this criterion is held by the Indian Oil Company with a share of 12.90% while SK Innovation ranks third having a share of about 11.37%. Among the companies with an American nationality Baker Hughes Company and Phillips 66 account for the largest share of nano patents with a total of more than 6%.





The Middle East is one of the richest oil and gas fields in the world and the countries in this region are among the most active countries that produce and export oil and gas. A review of the companies and patent registration trends for the countries in the region indicates that only two countries Saudi Arabia and Iran have companies which are among the top 25 oil and gas companies investing in nanotechnology. In recent years Saudi Arabia has expanded its patent-related efforts in the field of nanotechnology with the cooperation of other countries including the United States while taking advantage of international researchers in this field. Saudi Arabia's strategic planning for nanotechnology reveals the following as its oil and gas priorities: improving catalysts increasing corrosion resistance increasing yields increasing well productivity and developing well drilling equipment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bi1zZW50aW5lbC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8wNC9kYXlvbnRlLXJlc2lsZXMtbXVyZGVyLXRyaWFsLXNlY29uZC1kYXktb2YtanVyeS1kZWxpYmVyYXRpb25zLWVuZC1idXQtbm8tdmVyZGljdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jury ends day two with no verdict in Dayonte Resiles murder trial,"Jurors finished a second day of deliberations in the high-profile murder trial of Dayonte Resiles without reaching a verdict on Saturday evening.

The jury sequestered since late Friday will pick up its discussion at 9 a.m. Sunday. Late Saturday afternoon jurors requested testimony from the monthlong trial but learned that testimony would not be available until the morning.

Resiles 27 is accused of stabbing Jill Halliburton Su 59 to death in her Davie home in 2014. If convicted he could face the death penalty.

Testimony from the Broward Medical Examiner showed that Su sustained between 23 and 27 stab wounds and more than 20 “blunt force” wounds concluding that the death of Su was far from instantaneous.

Prosecutor Maria Schneider said she didn’t have to prove a motive for the crime although prosecutors believe Resiles killed Su because she could identify him once he broke into her home. His escape in 2016 from the Broward courthouse and his later effort to concoct an alibi showed the lengths to which he was willing to protect himself she said.

Defendant Dayonte Resiles and defense attorney Allari Dominguez listen to closing arguments by prosecutor Maria Schneider in his murder trial at the Broward County Courthouse on Friday December 3 2021 in Fort Lauderdale Fla.

In her closing argument Friday defense lawyer Allari Domínguez told jurors there was plenty of room for reasonable doubt and focused on the absence of Resiles’ DNA throughout most of the Su home. DNA was not on the murder weapon and Resiles’ fingerprints were nowhere to be found.

Resiles’ DNA was found on a glass door believed to be the point of entry and on a knife found on the front doormat – but that knife wasn’t the murder weapon.

“You can’t have it both ways” she said ridiculing the idea that Resiles could be so careful and sloppy at the same time.

Following the murder trial Resiles faces nearly 70 more charges stemming from a plot to escape the Broward County courthouse in July 2016. His escape in which he bolted from a fourth-floor courtroom raced down the stairwell and jumped into a waiting car outside led to a six-day manhunt that culminated in his capture in a motel room in Riviera Beach.",,,,,,

By Ronni Newton

Many of the runners in the Hartford Marathon Foundation’s Blue Back Mitten Run were able to shed their mittens by the time they crossed the finish line Sunday and in perfect running conditions a West Hartford man set a new record for the course.

Many were decked out in festive attire for the race – with a multitude Santas and elves as well as a group of Grinches as well as many dressed in “ugly” sweaters – taking to the streets of West Hartford for the 5K run.

Tommy O’Gorman 22 broke through the tape in 15:21 besting the Mitten Run course record of 15:27 previously set by Everett Hackett in December 2017.

O’Gorman had finished third in December 2019 the last time the Mitten Run was held. The event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and Sunday was the 12th running of what is traditionally the final race of HMF’s season. The 12Ks of Christmas holiday challenge which began Dec. 1 and can be completed as either a team or individual event is also taking place concurrently.

Ben Lanza 24 of Hartford was second in 15:43 and West Hartford resident Chris Angelo 26 – who had won the Mitten Run in 2018 and 2019 – took third Sunday in 15:52.

The first woman to cross the finish line was Nancy Montemerlo 25 of Hartford in a time of 17:50. Elizabeth Fengler 26 of Wallingford was the second woman in 18:32 followed by fellow Wallingford resident Katie Overstrum 23 who finished in 19:49.

Several hundred children ages 2-11 also participated in the HMF FitKids race and were given the opportunity to run distances of ½ mile or one mile. Some particularly the youngest were also accompanied by their parents during the event.

The Mitten Run also supported West Hartford’s Town That Cares Fund and bins full of new mittens gloves scarves and hats were collected as donations for needy residents.

Clint Barton and Kate Bishop seem like no-brainers for toys. And indeed via social media Hasbro just showed some early digital mock-ups of their upcoming action figures. Behold the first two TV-based Hawkeye Marvel Legends.

Before the inevitable cries of “Those don’t look anything like them!” bear in mind that these are early models. And at this stage they’re prior to the approved likenesses of Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld getting fully scanned and sculpted. One thing eagle-eyed collectors may notice is that Kate features pinless double-hinge elbows. This has not been typical of female Marvel Legends who normally have ball elbow joints to accommodate the slimmer arms. But it may allow for superior archery poses which look essential for this character.

Crucially missing is Lucky the Pizza Dog. But then again we still don’t have an Alligator Loki in Marvel Legends either…yet. And it’s probably safe to assume we’ll get Echo at some point and maybe Yelena Belova if she finally shows up as expected. As for Echo’s mysterious as-yet offscreen uncle who knows? If he’s who the speculation suggests he’d make a great build-a-figure.

Release date for these figures remains unannounced so far. But with no other Disney+ MCU shows completed yet except Moon Knight they seem unlikely to show up in a full TV-based wave.

Unfinished likenesses aside what do you think so far? Let us know in comments.

The American chocolate company’s marketing team has begun an interactive online campaign for a fictional Reese’s University which has a branded website Instagram page and a TikTok page that appears to be a work in progress.

In a press release issued on Wednesday the 127-year-old chocolate manufacturer shared quotes from fantasy university staff details about the university’s application process and 99.9% acceptance rate confection-based curriculum and athletics program.

HERSHEY’S UNVEILS 'WINTER MAKEOVER' OF KISSES AND NEW SELECTION OF CHRISTMAS CANDY

The fabricated release and website are complete with professional-grade photos and fully developed info sections that make Reese’s University look like the real deal. For example there are photos of orange diploma covers sports uniforms and students posing throughout the fictional campus.

""At REESE'S University students come first. Chocolate and peanut butter come second. Or maybe they’re all tied for first. It’s very close"" the website’s About Us section reads. ""The point is that it takes a diverse set of great minds from across academic disciplines to continue creating chocolatey peanut buttery awesomeness.""

REESE'S ANNOUNCES ALL PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE-FREE PEANUT BUTTER CUP

Class lists for the fantasy university are in the sweet art and sciences including a ""Make the World Orange"" drawing course an advanced peanut butter ratios course a linear ridge forces course and an introduction to cup structures course.

Moreover the university’s faux athletics team – the Fighting Cuppies – includes soccer rowing and cheerleading. A marching band mascot legendary rock and fictional Reese’s Cup Day festival are said to exist according to the website’s copy.

Under Reese’s University’s admissions section there’s a newsletter signup that’s under the guise of a university application. The website claims there are 375 H.B. Reese’s Scholars but it’s not immediately clear if it’s a part of the university’s lore.

REESE'S TO SELL NEW CANDY BAR SWEETENING PERMANENT LINEUP

While Reese’s fans won’t actually be able to attend the university in real-life the website’s school store tab says merchandise for Reese’s University will be ""coming soon"" sometime around January 2022.

Representatives at The Hershey Company did not immediately respond to FOX Business’ request for comment.

The chocolate company’s marketing initiative seemingly builds on the peanut butter candy’s cult following. In November 2021 Hershey debuted a Thanksgiving pie that sold out the same day. A month before that the company created a Reese’s pumpkin patch at Krochmal Farms near Salem Massachusetts for Halloween. The 93-year-old peanut butter candy also has a seasonal line of Reese’s Trees and Reese’s eggs for Christmas and Easter.

Typically fans have gotten their Reese’s merchandise fix at Hersheypark Hershey’s Chocolate World locations or licensed candy stores and retail partners.

A local Republican “community leader” based in Idaho was blasted recently for a racist since-deleted Tweet complaining about a commercial showing a Black family enjoying the holidays. The Daily Beast reported Lisa Leisy lost it on social media after seeing an old Hershey commercial depicting a Black family reveling in the holiday spirit.

Writer Tim Peacock said the incident was basically “the 2021 GOP in a nutshell.”

As of Sunday Leisy no longer had her affiliation with Idaho Lt. Gov Janice McGeachin’s gubernatorial campaign listed in her Twitter bio. Her tweets were also protected. She lists herself as anti-vaxx local leader. It is unclear if she is still affiliated with McGeachin’s campaign.

But given the stunts McGeachin has pulled this year alone it’s unclear if Leisy went too far for the gubernatorial candidate. Back in May McGeachin used a short stint as acting governor to issue an executive order banning mask mandates.

Leisy’s Instagram account god.and.patriotism was still public with a recent post sharing a statement from Donald Trump continuing the false narrative of “election fraud” during the 2020 election. Leisy seems to support extremist Republican candidates and party figures from her social media.

Twitter user Brett Storm encouraged followers to flood Leisy’s account with pictures of Black families celebrating the holidays.

https://twitter.com/BreckStorm/status/1467295837751595012?s=20

Another Twitter user posted what appeared to be screenshots of deleted Instagram posts complaining about the Hershey’s commercial and the new Annie in the NBC production of Annie Live! Wait until she finds out the talented Celina Smith isn’t the first Black Annie either! That honor belongs to the equally gifted Quvenzhané Wallis who starred in an Annie remake along with Jamie Foxx as Daddy Warbucks in 2014.

Her Instagram posts also suggest ardent support for Kyle Rittenhouse who was recently acquitted of murdering two people in Kenosha Wis. last year.

First reported by Boise State Public Radio the outlet noted that Leisy had a similar meltdown on her Instagram account over Apple “promoting” Juneteenth.

“Guess we’re on our way to be a black nation ahead” she wrote. “Welcome to the ‘new’ America.”

Pretty sure Leisy hasn’t had issues with commercials showing all white families enjoying the holidays or spending quality time together.

Disparities in representation in advertising isn’t a new issue. And as the U.S. population continues to diversify so should representation in media and advertising. A November blog post from Procter & Gamble’s Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard pointed to “new habits for multicultural growth.”

“According to the 2020 United States Census 100% of the population growth in the past decade came from increases in the Black Hispanic Asian Pacific Islander Native Indigenous multi-racial and multi-ethnic segments of the population” wrote Pritchard. “Multicultural buying power is now worth more than $5 trillion and has been THE driver of market growth for a decade.”

We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.

Hard disk drives (HDDs) are one of the major non-volatile memory storage devices often used in enterprise data centers and arrays.

They are mechanical devices read and written by floating heads and popular solutions for offline backup. Despite the prevailing discussion on solid-state drives (SSDs) in the data storage industry HDDs are still used prominently and they’re still undergoing improvements.

See below to learn about some of the top trends in the hard disk drive market:

HDD Trends

Also Read: HDD Market Outlook

1. Focus on Full Disk Encryption

Self-encrypting disks (SED) and full disk encryption (FDE) are more secure methods of storage encryption than software-based encryption which can be undone if an attacker steals credentials.

In full disk encryption processes the device’s CPU does not store the symmetric encryption key.

Hardware-based encryption for disk drives is more secure and makes data harder to reach. If a hard drive is encrypted and it’s offline attackers will not be able to read its data.

2. Leaning on Other Hardware Protection Technologies

Hard drives need intensive security controls to improve storage security environments according to Doron Youngerwood VP of marketing at Continuity Software.

Data protection in general needs to strengthen defenses against data-targeted theft such as ransomware too:

“Existing vulnerability management solutions do not cover storage and backup” Youngerwood said. “Many organizations are not aware of this major blind-spot.”

Enterprises need “new ways to harden the storage and backup services” he said

Although Youngerwood acknowledged that hard drive tech advancements won’t be enough to solve all the problems related to data protection and security there are a few that can improve security in storage environments.

“These include hardware support for data locking (immutable drives) that can help guarantee hackers will not be able to compromise data copies” Youngerwood said.

He also cited “hardware support for data encryption — with better integration with key management systems” and “support for protocol encryption (SATA Fibre Channel) — that can help further secure storage in sensitive environments.”

The market as a whole needs new ways to protect recovery copies of data and improve storage security he said.

3. Raising Ransomware Protection

All storage mediums need measures to protect stored data from cyber attacks particularly ransomware an insidious type of data theft that encrypts stolen data and requires a paid ransom to take the data back.

Cybersecurity vendor Sophos spearheaded a 2021 survey of 5400 businesses and 37% reported being hit by ransomware attacks.

“Enterprises are looking for answers to ransomware and insider threat prevention” said Ron Gula president at Gula Tech Adventures. “To do so they are deploying access control data solutions which leverage encryption authentication access control and user behavior monitoring where data is stored. Normally enterprises deploy these types of technologies at the network layer or agent layer.”

Racktop Systems he added has implemented access control in their Cyberstorage solution..

BrickStor Racktop’s ransomware detection and prevention solution uses both hard drives and solid-state drives in its arrays. Racktop partners with Seagate using its self-encrypting hard drives which can reset encryption keys and automatically lock themselves.

BrickStor also has the ability to block just one infected user or machine allowing the rest of the system to continue performance said Jonathan Halstuch co-founder and CTO of Racktop.

“We can actually detect even the data theft portion and block that user … or block the machine user that is infected with the ransomware virus” Halstuch said. “We allow the other [non-virulent] users to keep working.”

Hard drives are one of the best offline storage solutions for protecting data at rest from ransomware: they are less expensive than SSDs and they’re faster to access than tape.

4. Increasing Drive Capacity

Although global hard drive unit sales are decreasing the overall storage capacity of HDDs is increasing according to Horizon Technology.

“The HDD market crossed an impressive threshold in 2020 hitting one zettabyte (ZB) of shipped capacity. That’s the equivalent of one billion terabytes (TB) of fresh storage” Horizon says.

IDC reported high volumes of created data in 2020 partly due to people staying home more during the pandemic. And in a 2020 report done in partnership with IDC Seagate Technologies predicts that by 2025 data will increase exponentially to hit 175 created zettabytes.

Overall standard enterprise hard drives have greater capacity than solid-state drives. And though plenty of data center SSDs range into the multiple-terabyte size where HDDs win is their cost per capacity. Hard drives are still cheaper overall.

While SSDs are popular hard drive capacity continues to increase IDC expects that HDDs will remain the most common installed storage medium until at least 2024.

5. More Storage Arrays

Disk arrays don’t just hold hard drives: they include other features like redundancy tiering and drive-level encryption.

Storage arrays exist in multiple environments including data centers and edge deployments.

The size of an edge data center partially dictates the size of the HDD and SSD form factors and the storage arrays.

Many enterprise arrays support both HDDs and SSDs. Some enterprise storage arrays include:

Hewlett Packard Enterprise HP StorageWorks XP10000

Dell PowerVault ME4

Dell/EMC Disk Storage Array

Lenovo ThinkSystem DS4200

It was a year ago and Alexander was homeless in Santa Cruz.

It was a tough conversation.

Kaufman and her husband Tom Adza told their son that they would not continue providing him with grocery gift cards.

As painful as it was “I knew it was the right thing to do” she said.

“It was just enabling him."" They figured Alexander would either sell or barter the cards for drugs.

Alexander didn't react angrily. He didn't lash out.

He simply said ""OK” she remembered. Even though he suffered from PTSD mental health issues and drug addiction Alexander was a sweet and gentle man the kind of person “who always said please and thank you” she said.

Kaufman had no way of knowing it was the last time she’d speak to her son.

“We are devastated” said Kaufman. “We are heartsick in shock and the waves of pain and loss seem never-ending.”

This past Monday Kaufman and Adza drove to Napa from their home in the East Bay. They wanted to see where their son was found. They hoped to talk to anyone who knew or had seen Alexander.

His death has left them with many unanswered questions.

For one thing how did Alexander end up in Napa Kaufman wondered. What was his mental state? Was he alone?

“I would love to get some idea of where he might have lived what his health condition was whether or not he was psychotic whether he formed any relationships with people (or) whether he expressed any desire to kill himself?” said his mother. Was he dirty or groomed? Was he coherent? Did he have a tent or any belongings?

On Monday their first stop was at Napa's Home Depot to see exactly where Alexander’s body was found. A store manager and staff members greeted them and expressed their sympathies.

“The people at Home Depot were so kind” said Kaufman. They presented the couple with a poinsettia plant water and tissues.

Because Alexander loved plants and trees his parents think that he perhaps “chose” that spot to spend his final hours. The young man earned a degree in plant biology in 2015 from Evergreen College in Olympia Wash.

Did you see or meet Alexander? The Kaufman-Adza family would like to talk to anyone who met or saw Alexander. He sometimes went by Alex Zander or Z. Contact: jhuffman@napanews.com

Autopsy results haven’t yet been released but they wonder if Alexander purposely decided to overdose that night.

“I think that he didn’t want to live for drugs anymore"" said his mother.

It was a life that had changed dramatically from his youth — growing up in a middle-class suburb in the East Bay.

“He was a beautiful child and a gentle soul” Kaufman said. “He was such a sweet outgoing child that people were drawn to. He never said no to any activity play date or sport. He wanted to do it all.”

Alexander also excelled academically. “He had no difficulty getting A’s in school” she recalled.

But Alexander had been hiding a devastating secret.

“He told us he had been sexually abused at a sleep-away camp when he was 12” said Kaufman. He was also sexually abused by a trusted adult.

“He started retreating into quite a dark place when he was a teenager” she recalled. “I thought some of it was just being a teenager. But his friends changed and he was hanging out with more troubled kids and he started experimenting with drugs.” He was depressed she said.

By his senior year Alexander overdosed for the first time. He entered rehab and other programs but wasn’t able to maintain his sobriety.

“We tried everything imaginable to get him help” including rehab mental health treatment centers group homes and sober houses. “He didn't want to choose that path.”

By his early 20s “We believe he used hallucinogenics to the point where it pushed him into psychotic episodes and he began to express the negative attributes of schizophrenia.”

“Within the last few years it was the nitrous oxide use that really destroyed his brain"" she said. ""He chose drugs to disassociate from his pain. The more he did it the more he disappeared from reality.”

The only way to “follow” him in Santa Cruz and other cities was by checking the arrest records. Alexander was cited for violations such as being intoxicated in public possession of drug paraphernalia trespassing and minor vandalism.

“About four months ago I saw his most recent arrest was in Napa” she said. She has no idea of how or why he got to Napa.

The news of their son’s death is horrible and shocking yet “As a parent we’ve been bracing ourselves” for this possibility said Kaufman. “We almost felt like we’d be going through this roller coaster of uncertainty … for the rest of our lives.”

“We knew we had lost him.""

Kaufman knows that most people look down on those who are homeless. However that seemingly anonymous homeless person is someone’s son brother friend or companion she noted. And a member of the Napa community.

When she sees a homeless person especially someone around Alexander’s age “It breaks my heart. I look at them and I see my son.”

“I miss him so much but what I miss so much is the little boy that was there before the damage of this drug use.”

The couple plans to view Alexander’s body one last time before he’s cremated.

“We want to see him” she said. “We want to see that our boy is really gone.”

For the Star-Banner

Alex Rucci was shaking limbs checking shape and giving a good sniff as he sized up a Christmas tree for his family Tuesday at Home Depot in Ocala.

Rucci has shopped around every Christmas season for the past several years to find a memorable live tree for his wife Anita and their 11-year-old son Anthony.

""I wanted to get a real tree for Anthony. This one is nice and full and has (a limb) to place the star on the top"" Rucci said.

'Don't wait':Local Christmas tree retailers report high sales amid nationwide shortage

More than 1 million lights:World Equestrian Center goes big for its first holiday season

Rucci commented on the ""real smell"" of the 7-foot-plus Fraser fir he purchased for $75.

Rucci said he had looked around and found some local outlets to be ""bare"" of trees and he was having trouble finding ""icicle lights"" in the area.

Local shoppers like Rucci are hitting the big box stores seasonal businesses and tree farms searching for the perfect tree amid swirling reports of tree shortages and higher prices.

Indeed some local sellers report they can't get enough trees or additional shipments.

The National Christmas Tree Association (realchristmastrees.org) a 4000-member trade association says that upwards of 30 million ""real Christmas trees"" are sold annually in the U.S.

'We had to turn away (longtime) supporters'

Trinity Catholic High School Athletic Director and baseball coach Tommy Bond said the number of trees for this year’s 18th annual Christmas tree sale to support the Celtics baseball team was cut nearly in half because the supplier in Banner Elk North Carolina did not have enough inventory to fill the regular order.

“We usually sell 150 trees mostly presold to the same clients. This year we had 85 trees. We had to turn away (longtime) supporters” Bond said.

Bond said his supplier pointed to a smaller tree crop planting for the 2008-2009 season during the economic downturn along with other factors like fire and plant disease.

On Wednesday Hal Mix and Charles Sander were wrapping up a Shriners benefit Christmas tree sale at a tent adjacent to the Ocala Shriners Club building on Southeast Maricamp Road east of Southeast 36th Avenue.

""We opened the Wednesday before Thanksgiving with 240 trees and we have 18 left now"" Mix said.

Mix indicated the group could not obtain a second shipment.

'We blew through it'

Neil Hatten in management at the local Home Depot said a load of 400 trees came in from North Carolina during Thanksgiving week.

""We blew through it"" Hatten said. He said a second load of 600 trees came in and he foresees ""no problem"" with supply for the rest of the season.

Scott and Sue Ortengren of Oxford also picked out their tree at the Home Depot parking lot tent.

Sue Ortengren said this year's prices were ""absolutely"" higher than last year while Ed Forrest with the Brit Clinic of Ocala looked over the trees because a ""plastic (tree) just won't cut it.""

From three locations to two

Brad Helton operates The Christmas Tree Guy a seasonal Christmas tree sale business conducted out of multiple tent sites in the Ocala area for at least 35 years.

Helton said he had about 800 trees from North Carolina and Wisconsin on hand Wednesday at his southwest Ocala location. The business has a second location near County Road 326 and U.S. Highway 441.

He said his father started selling trees in Marion County in the 1980s and the Columbus Indiana family has had up to three seasonal business locations here including near Southeast 36th Avenue and Maricamp Road.

But this year he is operating only two tent locations; he doesn't have enough inventory to stock three.

Helton splits his time between here and Indiana. He said the smaller tree crop of 2008 has hurt supply while the increased number of people staying inside because of the pandemic has heightened demand.

Helton said prices on his trees start at around $54.

Sherri and Fred Rebmann formerly of Bonita Beach Florida now living in southeast Ocala picked out what they felt was a beautiful 8-foot Fraser at The Christmas Tree Guy location adjacent to Zaxby’s near the Paddock Mall in southwest Ocala.

Brandon Sawyer and J.T. Eisenmenger with The Christmas Tree Guy prepare trees for customers at the southwest Ocala location after Jessica Sawyer Brandon's wife and Amanda Foster handle their transactions at the register.

Helton said the crew jokes about Santa doing the white flocking treatment to the trees when he delivers them and the outfit has a “direct line” to Santa.

David Mullins accompanied his daughter Brandie Mullins an emergency room nurse at Ocala Regional Medical Center to the location to find the right tree for Brandie.

Tree aroma was a big factor in their choice.

Jason and Trish Sanders of Ocala wanted a live tree and found one on their first stop.

No nationwide shortage of live Christmas trees but there can be local shortages

Doug Hundley spokesman for the Colorado-based National Christmas Trees Association (realchristmastrees.org) said in a phone interview there is ""not a nationwide shortage of trees"" but there can be localized shortages.

Hundley said a shortfall can happen if a particular seller contracts with a grower who has fewer trees available this year. In some instances an order from a large retailer could get preferred treatment over an order from a smaller retailer.

""The supply of trees is tight. Less trees were planted in the 2008-2009 crop and the pandemic has added to the demand for trees"" he said.

Hundley expects the price of real trees to rise ""about 5 to 10 percent"" this year due to increased shipping costs and reduced supply.

""The bottom line is: Tree buyers (who encounter a seller who ran out) should shop around. There will be enough real Christmas trees for all who want one this season"" Hundley said.

A move back to real trees

Ann Murray has operated Nicholas’ Tree Farm in Summerfield for 30 years and sells an average of about 500 trees a season which begins for the farm the Friday after Thanksgiving.

The farm specializes in Southern Red cedar Florida Sand Pines and Carolina Sapphire trees.

Murray said the trees are sold at $8 per foot at the choose-and-cut facility which affords visitors an outdoor experience.

Michael Songer of Orange Park president of the Florida Christmas Tree Association wrote in an email that many families make tree farm visits a holiday tradition and families with younger children are “moving back to real trees.”

Songer who also operates a tree farm wrote: “(We) have had great sales the last few years and people began taking the smaller trees which reduces larger trees for the following years.”

He stated the tree farm industry is an “agricultural venture” and “we have had drought followed by too much rain” and fields hit by fungus.

“Most tree lots sell fir trees from the North that have been contracted for back in June or July. Not many lots have extra trees. I’ve had several calls wanting 20 to 100 trees for groups but they are not available this year. I think in about three years there will be extra trees again"" he said.

""It goes in cycles"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2hvd2FyZC1icmF4dG9uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxNzUzNjA50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Howard Braxton Obituary - Ely Funeral Home - Neptune - 2021,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/howard-braxton-obituary?id=31753609 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2hvd2FyZC1icmF4dG9uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxNzUzNjA50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maXJzdGNvYXN0bmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2NyaW1lL3doYXQteW91LW5lZWQtdG8ta25vdy1hYm91dC10aGUta2ltYmVybHkta2Vzc2xlci1tdXJkZXItdHJpYWwtbG9jYWwvNzctMWYxZjkxNmEtOTk2NS00MTQ1LWI2YmUtZmRmYTNjOWVjM2Nl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What you need to know about the Kimberly Kessler murder trial,"The high-profile trial of a woman accused of murdering Nassau County mother and hairstylist Joleen Cummings begins Monday morning.

Example video title will go here for this video

Example video title will go here for this video

YULEE Fla. — The trial of a woman accused of murdering 34-year-old Joleen Cummings begins Monday more than three and a half years after the Yulee hairstylist and mother of three vanished.

Cummings was reported missing in May 2018 and is presumed dead. Kimberly Kessler 53 is charged with first-degree murder. She has pleaded not guilty.

The case has drawn intense scrutiny and is the subject of both podcasts and an amateur sleuth group.

Here’s a look back at the timeline of the case and what to can expect during the weeklong trial:

May 12 2018 - Joleen Cummings 34 is last seen leaving work at Tangles Hair Salon in Yulee

May 13 2018 - Mother’s Day and Cummings’ birthday. (Surveillance camera video released later shows Kessler parking Cummings’ Ford Expedition in the Home Depot parking lot in Yulee in the early morning hours of May 13.)

May 14 2018 - Joleen Cummings is reported missing by her mother Anne Johnson. Cummings failed to pick her children up from her ex-husband’s house the day before but Jason Cummings didn’t notify police. He later said he assumed she was “on a bender somewhere.”

Police find Cummings' empty house in chaos the result of a domestic disturbance days earlier with her boyfriend Jason Gee in which police were called.

Both men were interviewed but eventually dismissed as suspects in the case.

May 15 2018 - Cummings’ vehicle is discovered in the Home Depot Parking lot

May 16 2018 - Kessler is located at a rest area in St. Johns County parked in her Black Kia Soul between two semis. It was later revealed she’d been living out of her car for some time using as many as 18 aliases while moving among 33 cities in 14 states.

May 17 2018 - Kessler is booked into the SJC Jail.

May 19 2018 - Kessler is booked into the Nassau County Jail.

May 22 2018 - Nassau Sheriff Bill Leeper names Kessler as a suspect in the Cummings case saying they have found evidence that “leads us to believe Joleen is not alive.”

Sept. 7 2018 - Kessler is charged with first-degree murder.

Sept. 25 2018 - Circuit Judge Robert Foster issues a gag order after defense attorneys complain Sheriff Bill Leeper and the Cummings family are influencing potential jurors by publicly calling Kessler ""evil"" and a ""violent killer.""

March 5 2019 - Defense attorneys say Kessler is mentally incompetent to stand trial.

July 3 2019 - Judge James Daniel declares Kessler mentally incompetent to stand trial based on the evaluation of doctors and sends her to Florida State Hospital for treatment. He would reverse that finding in March 2020 and has consistently maintained since then that she is capable of standing trial.

April 2020 - June 2020 - Kessler begins a hunger strike at the Duval County Jail (where she’d been moved because the victim’s stepfather Connie Johnson was director of the Nassau County Jail). In June the Duval County Jail declines to care for her any longer citing the need for near-daily hospitalizations due to her borderline starvation. Kessler’s weight drops from 196 pounds when first arrested to just 74 pounds.

October 2020 - Kessler begins to act out in court and in her jail cell. She begins screaming that her former public defender Jordan Beard is Joleen Cummings' cousin. Judge Daniel says he has investigated her claim and that it is without merit. Kessler receives additional charges for spreading feces around her cell and throwing feces at jail employees.

October 2021 - Judge denies several defense motions to suppress evidence in the case including shoes collected from Kessler’s storage facility with Cummings blood on them and scissors collected from Kessler’s car with Cummings’ blood on them.

November 2021- Defense lawyers file a flurry of motions to limit evidence in the case including Kessler’s phone search history (which includes hundreds of searches for ""Joleen Cummings"" after she was reported missing) witness testimony about scratches on Kessler's face and records showing that she purchased zip ties. Judge denies those requests.

The Judge also grants several defense motions to suppress including statements from Kessler’s ex-boyfriends Kessler's 17 aliases several wigs found in her storage unit and two machetes found in Cummings' SUV.

Nov. 29 2021 - Jury selection begins.

Dec. 1 2021 - A panel of 12 jurors and two alternates are chosen. The jury is composed of eight women and four men including four people of color. The alternate jurors include a white man and Black female.

Dec. 6 2021 - Trial begins. Jurors are told to report to the Nassau County Courthouse by 8 a.m. Court is expected to get underway at 8:30 a.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzaGlnaGVyZWR1Y2F0aW9uLmNvbS9ibG9nL3VuaXZlcnNpdGllcy1tdXN0LWFkZHJlc3MtZG93bnNpZGVzLWlubm92YXRpb24tZGlzdHJpY3Rz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Universities must address the downsides of innovation districts,"Over the past two and a half decades partnerships between universities and venture capitalists have transformed many urban areas into powerful innovation districts. These gleaming zones have spawned tech start-ups attracted high-paying jobs and grown biotech giants. Yet for all their many benefits universities need to reflect seriously on how they are transforming the neighbourhoods they call home.

Kendall Square in Boston Technology Square in Atlanta University City in Philadelphia and Aggie Square in Sacramento are just some examples of these university-anchored innovation districts co-created with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology the Georgia Institute of Technology Drexel University and the University of California Davis respectively. Even regional comprehensive universities in medium-sized cities have embraced similar strategies.

The aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis brought to the fore many concerns about the inner workings of colleges and universities with elected officials the media and the public criticising what they saw as inwardly focused institutions. A push for greater relevance by realigning higher education practices with wider social goals required universities to become more entrepreneurially minded which helped strengthen many existing initiatives while also leading to the creation of many new enterprises.

Innovation districts have already contributed to the fight against the global pandemic through research on vaccines and other healthcare needs. Consider that Pfizer operates a state-of-the-art R&D hub focusing on biotech that brings together 1000 employees in Kendall Square. (In fact the site’s laboratory facilities are leased from MIT.) The global headquarters of Moderna are also located there.

In Atlanta Tech Square has experienced significant expansion in the past decade leading to increased business diversification. Georgia Tech successfully attracted corporations to locate their innovation labs in the area. AT&T Boeing Coca-Cola Deloitte Delta and Home Depot are some of the companies now present there.

After making certain adjustments innovation districts should successfully weather many of the current challenges associated with Covid-19. Yet because of the increase in remote and hybrid employment options post-pandemic conditions may lead to more diversification in the office real estate market with existing commercial space subdivided to incorporate retail and even residential usage. This could allow previously priced-out entrepreneurs to operate there and in the process help increase the downtown residential population.

It is also worth mentioning that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 led to the creation of 8700 “opportunity zones” across the US with tax incentives to help finance initiatives in communities struggling with decline and disinvestment. The goal is to encourage activities leading to job creation by supporting small businesses.

Such opportunity zones have been designated near higher education and research centres in every state. In fact some campuses are themselves within opportunity zones. Some universities are already partnering with investors and developers are exploring projects that would benefit from this legislation. A Qualified Opportunity Fund eases the process by allowing investors to participate while deferring capital gains. Since universities are anchors for the commercialisation of knowledge they can seize the opportunity to create incubators and accelerators to support student start-ups and other entrepreneurial activities.

Yet we need to be aware of the unintended consequences that innovation districts can bring. There is no doubt that they place considerable pressure on low- and middle-income families often leading to greater social inequality. They certainly attract new residents with high incomes and education who are creative ambitious and entrepreneurial. This triggers infrastructure investment in housing and retail services aiding the regeneration of once ailing areas. But such developments can also lead to considerable gentrification and displacement often with a particular impact on minority communities.

It is critical for universities to be mindful of this and to work closely with local government and other organisations to manage the consequences. Strategies to ensure that existing residents are able to benefit from development of innovation districts include community-based engagement and collaborative partnerships; investment in affordable housing and primary/secondary education; and the provision of retraining opportunities. In this way universities can contribute to improving rather than disrupting the lives of their immediate neighbourhoods.

After the Second World War many urban colleges and universities erected walls using physical boundaries and strategically constructing facilities to isolate and protect themselves from the socio-economic challenges of their surroundings. This produced a form of separation for which they were understandably criticised.

Now there is a danger that new technology clusters may lead to similarly undesirable outcomes. The creation of monolithic cultural settings with largely high-income residents can easily fuel separation and isolation erecting a kind of invisible wall and once again keeping the university divorced from the realities of the city.

It is crucial therefore that universities and their corporate affiliates actively aim to balance the “innovation bubble” effect with community welfare initiatives.

Babcock Australasia aircrew duo awarded commendation: Two Babcock Australasia (Babcock) aircrew have been recognised for their recovery and first aid efforts to rescue a driver whose vehicle was driven into the Murray River in South Australia. Senior Base Pilot Adam Richter and Senior Base Aircrew Officer Sam Fielder were awarded the Commissioner’s Community Policing Commendation by South Australian Police (SAPOL) Deputy Commissioner Linda Williams at a ceremony at Babcock’s hangar at Adelaide Airport. During a SAPOL search operation near Bowhill in September Babcock’s aircrew together with two SAPOL Officers recovered the driver after his vehicle went off a cliff into the river. As the first responders to the incident Richter and Fielder provided immediate first aid before transporting the injured driver to a location where he could be treated by a SA Ambulance Service (SAAS) Special Operations Team Paramedic. They then transported the patient to the Royal Adelaide Hospital. SAPOL Officer in Charge Special Tasks and Rescue Group (STAR Group) Craig Wall said the Babcock aircrew are well deserving of this recognition. “The Commissioners Community Policing Commendation is in recognition of outstanding commitment and professionalism in assisting police as we saw from Adam and Sam in September” Wall said. “We’re pleased to see the teamwork and high level of aviation ability and initiative which exists between SAPOL and Babcock particularly when the safety of our community and police officers is at stake.”

RAS receives EASA Part 145 approval: RAS an aircraft interior exterior and completions company based at the UK’s Biggin Hill airport announced its receipt of EASA Part 145 approval.

As the Indian aviation and aerospace industry leapfrogs into a higher trajectory with burgeoning users both on the civil and defence side Air Works with its new brand identity is well-placed to cash in from these emerging opportunities.

But the factory of BAP Aerospace a chemical-processing firm in Tijuana hints at Mexico’s importance to global supply chains. These are components from tray tables to door parts for aircraft made by companies including Boeing Cessna and Lockheed Martin. BAP applies surface treatments to the pieces from submerging them in big vats of chemicals to meticulous work done by hand before shipping them north.

Mexico has long been a hub for manufacturing. Toyota a Japanese carmaker has had a plant in Tijuana since 2002. Honeywell an American industrial giant opened one in 2010. But increasingly the country is moving into higher-value processes. It now accounts for 3-4% of aerospace imports to the United States up from 1.5% in 2010. By contrast China’s share which was the same as Mexico’s a decade ago is now just 1%. American sanctions on China and tariffs on Chinese goods explain much of this change as well as rising wages in China and the difficulty of doing business there. The trend has accelerated recently.

Here's What You Need to Know: The MH-47G variant of the venerable Chinook helicopter is a highly sought-after platform.

In 2020 the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) received its first new MH-47G Block II Chinook helicopter.

The new MH-47G Chinooks will be flown by the expert hands of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment’s pilots. Also known as the Night Stalkers these are the best rotary-wing pilots in the world. In the past two decades alone they have flown some historic missions including the raids that killed Osama bin Laden the leader of Al-Qaeda and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the leader of the Islamic State.

The MH-47G Chinook is the main heavy-lift workhorse of the Night Stalkers. It’s primarily used for long-range insertions of special operations elements. The Block II upgrade includes a lighter but more rigid airframe and better rotor blades that allow for a 1500 lbs increase in lift capacity.

The MH-47G has a maximum speed of 196 miles courtesy of its powerful Honeywell T55-GA-714A engines that can produce 9387 horsepower (almost 62 times more than the average American car) and a maximum operational range of 391 miles (without taking into consideration mission-specific parameters).

Manufactured by Boeing the Chinook helicopter first entered service all the way back in the 1960s. According to Colonel Phil Ryan the commander of the U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command (USASOAC) there is an MH-47 currently serving that was delivered in 1966 has more than 11000 flight hours. The helicopter of course has gone under significant modernization multiple times.

Andy Builta Boeing vice president and H-47 program manager said in a press release that “This delivery marks a major step for the Chinook program. The new Chinook will give U.S. Special Operations Forces significantly more capability for extremely challenging missions and will enable them to conduct those missions on the future battlefield.”

The MH-47G variant of the venerable Chinook helicopter is a highly sought-after platform. In 2018 the British government requested the sale of 16 CH-47 Chinooks which is the standard version of the helicopter but also the parts necessary to turn the helicopters to the “M” special operations version. The U.S. State Department and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) approved the sale.

Additionally the Afghan Army’s Special Mission Wing an elite aviation unit will be receiving the CH-47 Chinook but presumably with the option to upgrade it to the MH-47G Chinook in the future.

A key difference between the special operations and conventional variants of the Chinook is weight. Due to several additional pieces of equipment the “M” version is considerably heavier than the conventional versions. Although that equipment is in place to ensure survivability and stealthiness they do slow down the “M” version.

The additional equipment includes extended-range fuel tanks the AN/AAQ-24 LAIRCM countermeasure system to fend off heat-seeking missiles improved GPS navigation systems better electro-optical/infrared sensor turrets radio-frequency countermeasure systems and infrared exhaust suppressors. Moreover the “M” variant comes with a healthy dose of firepower in the form of the M-134D-T mini guns and M240H machine guns.

The helicopters would have been delivered earlier if it weren’t for a brief halting of operations because of the Coronavirus pandemic.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

You mailed off that little black cartridge in an envelope and then about a week later negatives and prints were magically returned. With the rise of digital the inkjet printer promised instant gratification at low per print prices. What could possibly go wrong?

Well as it turned out plenty of things to the point that the industry is now seen as the proverbial used car salesman who sells you a thoroughbred on a promise and then delivers a turkey. Is it time to bin the inkjet before it metaphorically burns a hole in your pocket?

The rise of digital decimated the photo print industry. The Fujix DS-1P arrived in 1988 and ushered in a true end-to-end digital shooting experience however it took another decade for prices to tumble to the point that cameras became genuine mass-market products.

The 2000s were all about compact camera sales peaking at a lofty 120 million units by 2010. And with the rise of the digital camera came digital printing. While consumers were used to receiving C-type prints from a lab you couldn’t fit one of these in your home office; the humble inkjet printer stepped in to the breach as a low-cost high-quality solution for the print-at-home community.

Inkjet printing technology actually dates back to the 1950s where it was actively developed by both Canon and Hewlett Packard. By the 1970s digital printers were widely available but the SOHO (small office / home office) market didn’t kick off until the late 1980s.

I distinctly remember buying a dot matrix printer in 1990; laser printers were the top of the tree (the first desktop laser arrived in 1984 for the princely sum of $3500!) drum printers were great for text (useless for graphics) dot matrix could do both but with marginal quality while inkjets hit the sweet spot of quality and price. The output genuinely was good and I remember lusting after a Canon Bubblejet at the time but they were beyond my budget.

The trick to developing a successful desktop inkjet lay in solving the problem of spraying ink from a cartridge onto a sheet of paper. The ink print head and paper needed to be precisely controlled so that the droplets ended up in precisely the right part of the sheet without problems with blocked print heads.

Drop-on-demand systems became the favored solution using a thermal process to transfer the ink. A heating element in the ink chamber vaporized the ink which formed a bubble; this caused a pressure increase ink-side which shot a droplet onto the page. The first inkjet the Hewlett Packard DeskJet arrived in 1988 and cost $1000.

Where Did It All Go Wrong?

The inkjet printer offered the fullness of the promised land: a low-cost desktop unit low per print costs impeccable photo quality and (under the right conditions) archive quality output. Were you suckered in by the manufacturer’s hyperbole? Did you take marketing at face value? Well some thirty years later the bubble (of the bubblejet) is well and truly burst: inkjets are not fit for purpose when it comes to photo printing.

The fall from grace is so big that it has shattered the dream broken the promise. And perhaps inevitably it has been driven by greed. So why is the inkjet the bogeyman of photo printing?

Let’s start with the obvious problem: OEM inks are ridiculously expensive. I mean not just extraordinarily expensive but inordinately expensive. When it comes to expensive liquids there are two types: those that are truly eye-watering such as scorpion venom at $10 million per liter and then those that will just break the bank such as printer ink at $720 per liter. Note that this is more expensive than human blood and GHB!

The niggling question is: why is ink so expensive? While undoubtedly some R&D has gone into its formulation it’s actually because the manufacturer has a near-monopoly and can charge exorbitant amounts. The printers themselves are sold at a loss and the profit is made on the inks. This leads to some odd market behavior as a result.

The printers obviously need to produce good quality output but after that anything goes. For example there is a drive to make the hardware as cheap as possible regardless of the impact on functionality or longevity. They have become unrepairable – disposable – items that are lining landfill sites sold on the promise of cheap high quality printing.

Not only that but any development that can increase the volume of OEM ink (and paper) use as much as possible appears to be actively pursued. This might be through increasing the throughput of ink or restricting the use of third-party inks.

For example Hewlett Packard has an Instant Ink subscription program that costs a fixed amount per page regardless of whether you print letters or photos. That can be good value if want to print photos all day every day; you use the HP inks sent to you. However what is irritating is that the T&Cs block third-party inks forever regardless of your Instant Ink subscription. HP has got form here having previously used firmware “improvements” to block non-HP ink but rolled back after the backlash.

Meanwhile Brother has taken a different approach to the phrase “limited life” in the form of their MFC-J4410. As with other printers every time you switch it on it goes through a clean cycle to ensure the heads are clear which yes you guessed it uses up ink at a cost of $720 per liter! That’s kind of them to maintain the printer so meticulously.

Now what happens to the waste ink? It goes for collection to a waste tank which when full gives you an error message that prevents you from printing. If the tank isn’t really full (as is often the case) you may have success in using a reset code to switch the message off or might have to resort to third-party software to do the job. If the tank really is full then… you have to throw the printer away! I kid you not!

Now Brother isn’t the only culpable manufacturer here but the methods employed are like a sickness or disease among vendors.

Even a common scenario such as this is frustrating: you’ve successfully printed several photos and are embarking on another run of images. This time you get banding on your print so throw it away and start again. The same thing happens so you run a head cleaning routine to clear a blockage (which uses ink) then print again. There is still a problem so you run a print head alignment routine run a test sheet through and then print it again.

Success… finally.

Now I don’t wish to appear churlish and restrict all my criticism to inkjet printers so perhaps the final word can go to Amazon Reviewer Hugh Coles who commented on his brand new Polaroid Hi-Print dye-sublimation printer:

Straight out of the box the thing didn’t work! It got halfway through the first color cycle then jammed with the print half in and half out breaking a brand new printer cartridge because the ink roll was stuck between two colors. I reset the machine cleared the paper jam and installed a new paper and ink cartridge but now it won’t recognize any paper or ink despite resetting/reinstalling numerous times. Now I’m two ink cartridges down and left with a broken device.

This review more than anything I’ve seen sums up the frustrations that users have with inkjets. They promise so much and then break that promise and that’s before we’ve even got to the various nefarious marketing practices that manufacturers indulge in. We’ve all been tempted by the headline per page costs which are of the order 1-15 cents for color but really that’s just a finger in the air best case scenario. In reality you’ll never actually achieve that.

So what’s the answer? In this digitally connected internet age it really is simple. Send your photos to a specialist lab to print because they can do a better job at a lower price. Then buy yourself a laser printer for office printing because they produce better output and are cheaper to run.

No matter what you're looking for — protection docks or peripherals — here are the best accessories you can get for your convertible laptop.

If we're making a few suggestions

Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

If you have a new HP Spectre x360 13t and you're wondering how to improve your experience all of the above accessories can play an essential role. However you might still be wondering what to pick up first.

Thanks to Thunderbolt 3 ports on the Spectre x360 you can create a workstation with CalDigit's TS3 Plus dock. It has a durable compact aluminum chassis it brings 15 total ports to the mix and it will even charge your laptop while it's plugged in allowing you to detach and hit the road without worrying about battery life. If you often work at a desk and have multiple peripherals this accessory should prove to be a worthwhile investment.

One of the main issues with the otherwise stellar Spectre x360 13t is the use of Synaptics drivers instead of Precision drivers for its touchpad. In Executive Editor Daniel Rubino's review he says ""scrolling can be janky and pinch to zoom wildly inconsistent."" The solution? A quality external mouse like the recommended Logitech MX Master 2S should provide a seamless pointing experience and should help prevent joint pain thanks to its ergonomic design.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2FtZy12OHMtbGFzdC1odXJyYWgtdGhlLW1hbmhhcnQtY3ItNzAwLWlzbnQteW91ci1tb21zLXN0YXRpb24td2Fnb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMG V8's Last Hurrah!

Illuminare.

Significato del proverbio

Un pensiero filosofico che è anche un antico proverbio la luna se non riscalda illumina è volto a svelare che ogni cosa sulla terra è fatta ad uso e consumo dell’essere umano. Il sole riscalda ed è utile per i campi le piante e i fiori la luna con la sua freddezza non può riscaldare ma rischiara la strada al viandante e al condottiero facilitandogli il cammino.

Ognuno di noi è utile al prossimo perché come la luna ognuno di noi ha un suo grado di utilità i contadini lo sapevano bene e lo dimostravano ogni giorno nello scegliere con sapienza; la luna illuminava la terra quando il sole non poteva farlo e anche se non riusciva a riscaldarla restava una alleata illuminando il cammino e rendendo vane le eventuali rapine dei malfattori.

Proverbi simili a la luna se non riscalda illumina

Il senso di questo proverbio antico è che l’utilità dell’essere umano è presente in ognuno di noi dobbiamo solo riuscire a scoprire il contesto adatto. Come nel proverbio la luna non cura l’abbaiar dei cani dove è abbastanza esplicito il senso: non ci si deve far toccare dalle bassezze degli altri ma continuare il proprio cammino a testa alta.

Può sembrare strano ma il senso dell’utilità verso il prossimo passa anche attraverso l’impegno personale come ci insegna il proverbio antico la volontà tutto fa che ci incita ad impegnarci a fondo per raggiungere gli scopi che ci siamo prefissati che siano personali o di sostegno ad altri. Nel proverbio antico la necessità non ha legge invece si ravvisa la difficoltà di restare nel giusto o cadere nello sbagliato diventando a tutti gli effetti dei delinquenti. In questo caso è lampante quanto venga a mancare l’essere utili se non a sé stessi ma con scopi malfamati. La pianta si conosce dal frutto è invece quel genere di proverbio antico che la saggezza popolare ha saputo tramandare ai giorni nostri mantenendolo inalterato: il giudizio su una persona è dato in base alla sua moralità.

Significato

Tanti i proverbi che utilizzano la luna come metafora e tra questi c’è la luna se non riscalda illumina. Il proverbio la luna se non riscalda illumina viene utilizzata per evidenziare come ognuno abbia le proprie capacità i propri lati positivi e quanto ciascuno possa essere essenziale con il proprio impegno.

Origine

Tra i proverbi di origine antica c’è la luna se non riscalda illumina. Come tantissimi modi di dire si nota il legame con la tradizione contadina; gli insegnamenti sono infatti ricavati pensando alla natura e alle sue fasi per andare a raccontare una metafora differente. Il proverbio la luna se non riscalda illumina vuole raccontare come tutti si possa essere utili nella propria diversità.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlsZ2lvcm5hbGUuaXQvbmV3cy9zcGV0dGFjb2xpL2VkaXNvbi1pbGx1bWluYS1zY2FsYS1taWxhbm8tMTk5Mjg5NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Edison ""illumina"" la Prima della Scala di Milano","Insieme ancora una volta per un uso sostenibile delle risorse energetiche e in nome della cultura. Edison ha rinnovato la storica collaborazione con il Teatro alla Scala iniziata nel 2010 e illuminerà con la sua energia rinnovabile la serata del 7 dicembre. Non una serata come tutte le altre ma il giorno dove andrà in scena la Prima della Scala. Quest'anno la stagione di Opera e Balletto 2021-2022 verrà inaugurata con la presentazione al pubblico di una nuova produzione dell'opera di Macbeth di Giuseppe Verdi diretta da Riccardo Chailly con la regia di Davide Livermore.

Un legame storico

È un legame antichissimo quello che unisce Edison e il Teatro alla Scala di Milano. Da una parte la più antica società energetica in Europa nonché uno degli operatori leader del settore in Italia con oltre 135 anni di primati. Dall'altra uno dei teatri più prestigiosi al mondo che da 243 anni ospita i principali artisti nel campo internazionale del balletto della musica classica e dell'opera. Per capire l'importanza di una simile collaborazione bisogna risalire alle sue radici e da lì percorrere le fasi salienti di un rapporto storico.

Nel 1883 Edison per la prima volta in assoluto ha illuminato con l'energia elettrica il Teatro alla Scala. Lo ha fatto in un periodo particolare quando in Europa l'illuminazione artificiale veniva affidata alle luci ad olio con tutti i rischi del caso. Soltanto New York e Milano erano all'avanguardia e il capoluogo lombardo ha potuto esserlo proprio grazie alla visione della Edison che dette così il via alla graduale elettrificazione dell'Italia.

Nell’era della digitalizzazione e della transazione ecologica questo legame si è rinnovato nel segno dell’innovazione e della sostenibilità. Dal 2020 Edison è diventato Fondatore Sostenitore del Teatro mentre dall'aprile 2021 l'operatore è fornitore unico di energia elettrica green della stessa struttura (non solo del teatro ma anche delle altre sedi cittadine). Giusto per sottolineare alcuni dati se dal 2010 a oggi illuminando la Prima Edison ha evitato l’immissione in atmosfera di oltre 630 tonnellate di anidride carbonica da aprile 2021 Edison è fornitore unico di energia green del Teatro alla Scala evitando l’immissione nell’ambiente di 2.600 tonnellate di CO2 in un anno. Per capirsi la quantità assorbita da circa 90.000 piante.

Il contributo di Edison

Edison vende energia elettrica gas naturale e servizi energetici ed ambientali a molteplici clienti. È una società impegnata in prima linea nella sfida della transizione energetica mediante lo sviluppo di generazione low carbon servizi di efficienza energetica e mobilità sostenibile in piena sintonia con il Piano Nazionale Integrato Energia e Clima (PNIEC) e gli obiettivi definiti dal Green Deal europeo. L'azienda ha tuttavia anche un'area business dedicata a interventi di efficientamento energetico. In altre parole possiamo dire che Edison aiuta le imprese e altri soggetti a consumare energia in maniera green e sostenibile.

Il contributo di Edison nell'efficientamento del Teatro alla Scala è contornato da azioni concrete. Quest'anno ad esempio la collaborazione con la Fondazione si è arricchita con il progetto ""Scala Green"" che promuove il percorso di sostenibilità energetica e di decarbonizzazione della Fondazione. L'intero progetto è partito con lo sviluppo di una diagnosi energetica utile a delineare le prossime iniziative di un progressivo piano di transizione energetica della Fondazione in tutte le sue sedi cittadine.

Nel 2018 è stato realizzato il progetto di illuminazione del Museo Teatrale alla Scala. La diagnosi energetica e l’efficientamento energetico dei Laboratori della Scala del 2019 ha invece riguardato un’area di 20.000 metri quadrati. In seguito l’efficientamento dei globi che decorano la Sala “Piermarini” e del sistema di illuminazione interna dei palchi (interventi che hanno visto la sostituzione di oltre 600 lampade a incandescenza con altrettante lampade LED ad alta efficienza consentendo una riduzione dei consumi di energia elettrica superiore all'80% e di evitare l’emissione in atmosfera di 50 tonnellate di CO2 all’anno) sono altri interventi che Edison ha realizzato per rendere il Teatro alla Scala all’avanguardia.

Prima diffusa

Edison ha insomma messo a disposizione del Teatro – e quindi dell'intera comunità cittadina - le sue competenze per abbattere i consumi e trovare soluzioni sempre più sostenibili. Non solo: l'azienda da dieci anni a questa parte ha lanciato un progetto assieme al Comune di Milano e all'Assessorato alla Cultura. Si chiama Prima diffusa e il suo scopo consiste nel portare l’eccellenza artistica del Teatro alla Scala in tutti i municipi della città diffondendosi dal centro alle periferie e invitando le persone a seguire la Prima scaligera del 7 dicembre anche senza recarsi in Teatro.

Scendendo nei dettagli dalle Manifatture Tabacchi a Mare Culturale Urbano dalla Casa della Carità alla Santeria Toscana anche quest’anno Prima Diffusa accenderà tutti i quartieri di Milano offrendo un programma con oltre 80 eventi gratuiti e aperti a tutti. Inoltre la sera del 7 dicembre la Prima sarà trasmessa in diretta in 34 luoghi dei nove municipi raggiungendo persino il Teatro della Casa di Reclusione Milano Opera e il Teatro PuntoZero Beccaria presso l’Istituto Penale per minorenni Cesare Beccaria.

""Questo canta da Cristo"". ""È piccante da Cristo?"" ""No canta da Cristo"". A parlare fuori dal Biko Club di Milano in Barona sono due spettatori che hanno appena assistito alla seconda esibizione live in assoluto nel capoluogo lombardo di Il solito dandy cantautore torinese classe 1993 che vive stabilmente a Roma da qualche anno. Il Solito Dandy al secolo Fabrizio Longobardi ha aperto il concerto di Leo Pari cantautore romano in passato in orbita TheGiornalisti dopo l'uscita di Tommaso Paradiso scaldando il pubblico con cinque pezzi del suo repertorio alcuni dei quali non ancora editi.

Milano scopre un fenomeno: Il Solito Dandy

Scatenato sul palco Il Solito Dandy ha dato dimostrazione di saper intrattenere senza la necessità che gli ascoltatori conoscessero i suoi brani. Anche se il ritornello di ""Boh"" suo penultimo singolo resta impresso in testa fino al mattino seguente. Spigliato leggiadro naturale con una voce graffiante che ricorda il compianto Rino Gaetano. Per mezzora tra applausi e richieste di bis Fabrizio ha preparato il pubblico alla serata prima di mischiarsi tra gli spettatori e seguire il concerto di Leo Pari. Avvicinato al bancone del locale era visibilmente spiazzato dall'accoglienza riservatagli. Non ci credeva così come non credeva a chi tra cui chi vi scrive lo definiva un ""fuoriclasse"".

Il suo manager Giacomo Coveri è al lavoro per trovargli palchi sempre più importanti e dare una continuità live che con la pandemia è andata via via perdendosi. In attesa del suo primo lavoro ufficiale la cui uscita è prevista per i primi mesi del 2022 Il Solito Dandy avrà l'occasione di raccogliere ulteriori consensi in giro per l'Italia.

The Core i3 12100 is the baby of the 12th Gen Alder Lake range and according to the review could be more than a match for AMD's budget offerings today.

According to the leaked CPU-Z screenshot the Core i3 12100 features four Golden Cove Performance Cores with HyperThreading. There are no E-Cores present making it a 4C/8T processor. It comes with 12MB of L3 cache a 60W base TDP and a maximum turbo power of 77W. This means it will not stress budget coolers. As a non-F CPU it will include Intel’s Xe graphics. The CPU can reportedly clock up to 4.3 GHz though since we’re looking at an engineering sample CPU it’s important to remember that the final specifications can change.

XFastest compared the Core i3 12100 to AMD’s Zen 2 based Ryzen 3 3300X and 3100X. Both are quad core CPUs. AMD has yet to release any entry level Ryzen 3 based models to the retail market though we might find out more at CES on that front. The results show that the 12100 has a big lead in PCMark and productivity benchmarks and again in Cyberpunk 2077 and CS:GO. This points towards the 12100 being a powerful option for gamers on a budget particularly those who play popular e-sport titles where high-end CPUs are overkill.

The i3 12100 will definitely add a lot of grunt to entry level machines. Intel never released any budget Rocket Lake CPUs meaning the 12100 is a successor to the Comet Lake (aka Skylake +++) i3 10100. Users with older generation Intel quad cores that lacked hyperthreading would also see a big jump in multithreading performance.

The i3 12100 is expected to be released in Q1 of 2022 alongside more affordable H670 B660 and H610 motherboards. Pricing is unknown but given that the i3 10100 can be found for around $130 or less we can expect the 12100 to land at a similar price give or take a few dollars.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2ludGVsLXhlc3MtZXhwbGFpbmVkLTMwNjAxNTUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Intel XeSS? NVIDIA DLSS competitor explained,"Intel

Intel has traditionally been a CPU maker and has done more than its fair share of work on CPU hardware as well as software implementations that work to enhance the performance of its hardware. It has also had integrated graphics processors in its CPUs but it hasn’t been anything to write home about.

It now has a newfound focus on GPUs including a new Xe GPU architecture and its own brand of image supersampling and upscaling technology to go with the hardware — XeSS. Intel XeSS short for Intel Xe Super Sampling is Intel’s answer to NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR. Also read: What is NVIDIA DLSS? NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling explained

What is Intel XeSS and how does it work? Intel XeSS or Intel Xe Super Sampling is an image upscaling technology that uses both spatial and temporal data and relies on artificial intelligence to do it. Supersampling is an anti-aliasing technology that takes color samples of the pixels in an image at different instances. It then uses this color data and renders the image at a much higher resolution.

Supersampling has an advantage over the traditional anti-aliasing methods providing a much better quality high-resolution image with fewer apparent jagged edges and other artifacts that usually come with upscaling an image.

Intel XeSS uses a combination of spatial and temporal data i.e. both image data and motion data with respect to time to produce the output image. Like DLSS it passes this data through a trained neural network harnessing machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve image quality.

Intel

Intel is making XeSS use its new XMX matrix math units present in its new Xe-HPG graphics processors to do the heavy lifting for the AI processing on the hardware end. However it also has a version of XeSS in the pipeline which won’t rely on these units. This version will use the 4-element vector dot product (DP4a) instruction which has wider support making XeSS not limited to the latest Intel hardware.

Intel

Intel says you’ll get up to a 2x performance boost with Intel XeSS. It also says that it will let systems with weaker hardware limited to 1080p resolution and low settings run games at 4K. Also read: NVIDIA GPU guide: All NVIDIA GPUs explained and the best NVIDIA GPU for you

Intel XeSS vs NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 vs AMD FSR

Intel’s implementation is similar to NVIDIA DLSS 2.0. Both have a similar approach to supersampling. Intel XeSS uses spatial data which is the data from the surrounding pixels as well as temporal data which is the motion information from previous frames with regards to time. It then feeds this data to a neural network trained to upscale images quite like NVIDIA DLSS does.

NVIDIA DLSS however requires newer NVIDIA hardware to work. On the other hand Intel XeSS has two versions as mentioned before. Intel is using its hardware elements to make a higher-end XeSS but it’s not abandoning users with older hardware either. That sets it apart from NVIDIA DLSS even though the DP4a version of XeSS won’t perform as well as the XMX version.

That’s also where Intel XeSS stands similar to AMD FSR. AMD FSR doesn’t require you to use AMD hardware. However AMD FSR is also more of a run-of-the-mill spatial upscaling technology and doesn’t use the hybrid approach that makes DLSS as good as it is. Intel XeSS sounds like the best of both worlds and a balance between DLSS and FSR. We’re yet to get more details about real-world performance but the demos do look great.

Intel also eventually plans on open-sourcing the XeSS SDK and tools. Also read: What is AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution? AMD FSR explained

Intel XeSS supported GPUs and games

Intel XeSS is aiming at broad hardware support. The XMX version will support Intel Xe-HPG graphics processors. The DP4a version will support the Xe-LP GPU as well as the discrete GPUs from the past. The technology is still new and as such there isn’t much to go on about supported games.

We got a custom Unreal Engine demo at the unveiling at Intel Architecture Day. Since then Intel has put out a demo featuring Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker which are the two games confirmed to support Intel XeSS so far. It’s likely that a bunch of games will join the list even though Intel is yet to announce any strategic partnerships with game developers.

Intel XeSS SDK launched in August 2021. XeSS itself is expected to launch with the Intel Arc GPUs in Q1 2022. We can hope to see more demos and game support announcements in the coming weeks as Intel gears up to launch its GPU lineup.

The Core i3-12100 is yet to be released but early benchmarks prove that the entry-level Alder Lake-S processor has enough muscle to beat the AMD Ryzen 3 3300X and Ryzen 3 3100 in most benchmarks that too with reduced power consumption and thermals.

Intel recently launched the Alder Lake-S series of desktop processors. While the focus was generally on the top-rung chips such as the Core i9-12900K Core i7-12700K and Core i5-12600K along with their KF variants the low-end Core i3 variants were not made available so far. However Hong Kong-based publication XFastest managed to get their hands on a Core i3-12100 Alder Lake processor and compared its performance to that of the current leader in this segment the AMD Ryzen 3 3300X and also the Ryzen 3 3100.

The Core i3-12100 is a non-hybrid 4C/8T part that can apparently offer a 4.3 GHz boost on the single core with a PL1 of 60 W and a PL2 of 77 W. The CPU was tested on an ASRock Z690 Steel Legend motherboard and paired with 16 GB DDR4-3600 RAM and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. The AMD system was based on the ASRock X470 Taichi Ultimate.

According to XFastest's results the Core i3-12100 takes a good lead over the Ryzen 3 3100 and the Ryzen 3 3300X in various benchmarks. In PCMark the Core i3-12100 is about 5-20% faster than the Ryzen 3 3300X while being about 13-25% faster than the Ryzen 3 3100. In Cinebench R23 the Core i3-12100 once again scores a 26% and 40% better performance over the Ryzen 3 3300X and the Ryzen 3 3100 respectively while also correspondingly being 28% and 44% faster in single-core.

In PugetBench for Premiere Pro the Core i3-12100 is more than 80% faster than the Ryzen 3 3300X in Export and about 30% faster in Playback indicating that this is a very good option for editors on a budget.

When it comes to 3DMark and gaming the differences between the Alder Lake and Ryzen processors seem to narrow down somewhat. That is until DLSS is added to the mix in Cyberpunk 2077 during which the Intel CPU has a decent 15% advantage of the Ryzen 3 3300X. This difference reduces to ~8.5% in CS: GO at 4K High though a 1080p test would have been more appropriate since 4K is more limited by the GPU than the CPU.

The Core i3-12100 also seems to have an advantage when it comes to temperature and power consumption over its AMD rivals. In AIDA64 CPU the Core i3-12100 is shown to consume just 38 W of power at 43 °C compared to the 50 W / 50 °C requirement of the Ryzen 3 3300X though the AIDA64 FPU test shows the AMD chips to be slightly more economical.

Overall it seems like Intel may have a very efficient entry-level chip with the Core i3-12100 in the ~US$130 price range. The company is expected to reveal the rest of the Alder Lake lineup at CES 2022 in January so hopefully we will get to see more broader testing and final numbers soon.

Two Intel factories under construction in Arizona will run $10 billion apiece – each as much as a dozen NFL stadiums. Just a handful of companies in the world can afford to spend that much and some do it with considerable help from their governments.

Asian nations pour billions of dollars into their semiconductor industries and competitors in the United States and Europe say those tax breaks and government subsidies explain why those countries dominate chip manufacturing.

Now the domestic semiconductor industry wants U.S. taxpayers to chip in too.

Bipartisan legislation before Congress would direct $52 billion to subsidize construction of new factories across the country. The proposal known as the CHIPS Act also provides billions for American companies’ research into the semiconductor technologies of tomorrow.

“It’s a competition between companies as much as it is a competition between nations” said Al Thompson Intel’s vice president for government relations. He said the federal money would give the U.S. the opportunity to reassert technological leadership.

For Intel the need is all the more urgent as it commits tens of billions of dollars to build new factories – the industry calls them fabs – and overcome a decade of manufacturing failures. In addition to the two new Arizona factories Intel says it’s close to choosing sites for a factory in Europe and a site somewhere new in the U.S.

Intel expects to spend up to $28 billion on its fabs in 2022 up from around $19 billion this year as it races to expand with leading-edge facilities. The price tag has alarmed investors and Intel is counting on several billion dollars from the CHIPS Act to help offset its costs.

The comeback plan represents a bet-the-company moment for Intel and its new CEO Pat Gelsinger who will be in Portland on Monday to take up the cause at the Oregon Business Plan’s annual leadership summit. Oregon is home to Intel’s largest and most advanced operations but Monday’s talk will be the first time an Intel CEO has addressed a public audience in the state in more than a decade.

The CHIPS Act is a rarity in American politics a major piece of new spending that has broad support from both Democrats and Republicans who are united by concerns over the billions of dollars China is spending to create its own chip industry. Both the Trump and Biden administrations championed the legislation.

However after the Senate approved the money in June -- as part of a larger package aimed at making the U.S. more competitive technologically -- the legislation stalled in the House as the chamber wrestled over other priorities.

Political observers expect the subsidies will pass in some form either late this year or early in 2022. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and Samsung are building new fabs in Arizona and Texas respectively reflecting the confidence those companies have that the U.S. will help pay for them.

That could be evidence the CHIPS Act is having its intended effect even before it passes. Advocates say the money will help the semiconductor industry dig out of the acute chip shortage that has stalled production of everything from video game consoles to pickup trucks.

But skeptics worry the U.S. is committing too much money to aging technologies and fading companies while others worry about an expensive arms race as nations compete against one another to lure the most advanced technology.

OREGON’S MAIN EXPORT

While much of the technology supply chain has migrated to countries with low wages labor is a tiny component of a fab’s cost.

Manufacturing equipment is the primary expense. Sophisticated tools can be the size of a school bus and cost well over $100 million apiece. So equipping an advanced fab costs several billion dollars.

Partly as a result the chip industry has tended to coalesce in places with the most government support rather than the places with the lowest wages. Usually that’s Asian nations like Taiwan and South Korea. But sometimes it’s Israel Ireland or the United States.

Intel has saved $760 million in Oregon property taxes over the past five years including $173 million this year alone. Samsung won similar exemptions for a new Texas fab.

Seven big semiconductor manufacturers operate fabs in the Portland area among them Intel Qorvo ON Semiconductor and TSMC. Other businesses employ thousands of Oregonians supplying those factories with the raw materials and equipment to make their computer chips.

Oregon doesn’t appear positioned for more fabs in the near future at least partly because the state doesn’t have huge parcels of readily available industrial land. Nonetheless the state’s economy is tightly linked to the chip industry’s fortunes.

Oregon exported more than $13 billion in electronics chiefly computer chips in the first nine months of this year. Electronics accounted for nearly two-thirds of all the state’s exports.

That’s mostly thanks to Intel. The company engineers and manufactures each new generation of computer chips at its Ronler Acres campus near Hillsboro Stadium. It then precisely replicates that manufacturing process at fabs in Arizona Israel and Ireland.

Intel has 21000 employees at its Washington County campuses and is hiring hundreds more as it wraps up a $3 billion expansion of its D1X research fab which it expects to complete early next year. That’s roughly a fifth of Intel’s global workforce and more than it employs anywhere else.

In recent years though Intel has sought to keep a low profile in Oregon. Two prior CEOs – Brian Krzanich and Bob Swan – never spoke in Oregon other than to Intel employees. No Intel CEO has appeared publicly in the state since Paul Otellini in 2011 who spoke at an event in Portland with former Energy Secretary Steven Chu.

Neither Krzanich nor Swan were comfortable in front of the camera. But the new CEO Gelsinger has taken a very different approach since Intel hired him in January.

On “60 Minutes” and on CNBC at meetings in the White House and in Brussels Gelsinger has been touring the world and touting the need for American and European governments to open their wallets to bolster his industry.

The Semiconductor Industry Association says the U.S. share of global chip production has fallen from 37% in 1990 to just 12%.

Ann Kelleher Intel’s vice president in charge of technology development testified at a congressional hearing Thursday that it is 30% cheaper to build a fab in Asia than in the U.S. where Intel makes most of its chips. She said that’s primarily because of the government support companies receive overseas.

“We’re at a fundamental disadvantage compared to some of the Asian countries when it comes to basically developing and manufacturing our chips” said Kelleher who is one of Intel’s top Oregon executives. “So if we lose our ability to actually continue to maintain that leading-edge manufacturing it means as a supply chain we’re completely reliant on the rest of the world and I don’t believe that’s a good place for the United States to be.”

Intel is in an especially precarious spot having already ceded its leading-edge capacity. The company the only advanced chip manufacturer based in the U.S. is now embarking on an ambitious and expensive turnaround plan.

Intel lost its technological lead after a series of manufacturing failures led to delays in three successive generations of new chip technologies. That prompted Intel to flirt with the idea of outsourcing its most advanced production to rivals in Taiwan and South Korea.

Instead Intel hired Gelsinger and bought into his plan to spend tens of billions of dollars to rebuild the company’s manufacturing and research organizations and expand into contract manufacturing. Intel lost $26 billion in market value on one day in October after Gelsinger priced out his plan for investors.

The fortune Intel plans to spend next year on its factories is just the starting point. The company said those costs will rise in future years. So Intel wants government support to sell investors on Gelsinger’s agenda.

MAKING SAUSAGE

That explains why Gelsinger will be in Portland on Monday. The CHIPS Act and its $52 billion in potential funding are far less straightforward.

The Senate bundled the semiconductor subsidies into a larger bill called the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act which passed in June. That $250 billion package hasn’t had its day in the House yet though Democratic leadership in each chamber agreed last month to begin negotiating a package for approval.

Oregon’s congressional delegation supports the CHIPS funding and continued pushing for its passage this week. Both of the state’s U.S. senators will attend Gelsinger’s talk Monday.

“It is clear that we have a lot of work to do to expand and preserve the role of the United States as a global leader in semiconductors” Rep. Suzanne Bonamici D-Beaverton said in a congressional hearing Thursday. “It is also clear that we must swiftly provide funding through the CHIPS Act which will help reinvigorate our nation’s semiconductor industry.”

The bill that passed the Senate allocates about two-thirds of the CHIPS Act’s money to fund manufacturing a popular provision that could bring jobs to the U.S. and high-profile new factories -- projects politicians love to trumpet. The rest of the money would go to fund research a long-term investment whose benefits play less well on a podium.

Those priorities should be reversed according to Bryan Clark a senior fellow with the Hudson Institute a conservative think tank in Washington D.C. He said the industry should seek more private investment for new fabs while the federal government should emphasize new technologies that could help the U.S. recapture the technological lead.

“Giving money to Intel who has not proven the ability to do it seems like a way to guarantee manufacturing at the current node size” Clark said.

“The U.S. is not going to regain an advantage in this industry unless it goes to the next generation of technologies” he said. “There’s just no way to beat TSMC and Samsung on the current generation.”

Intel wins either way since its manufacturing and research are tightly integrated. But it will have to compete for whatever research dollars come out of the CHIPS Act with many other companies from AMD to NVIDIA which have large U.S. research organizations but outsource their manufacturing to Asia.

The chip industry is notoriously cyclical in part because it takes years to build each new fab. By the time new projects are complete the economy may have cooled and demand may have evaporated.

While semiconductors are in extremely short supply now severely exacerbating to the global supply chain tangle a flood of government money could spur a building boom – potentially creating a new problem.

Research firm IDC projected in September that the chip industry could be facing a glut as soon as early 2023 which could drive down prices and jeopardize companies’ ability to invest in new fabs.

Such worries notwithstanding observers are confident the CHIPS Act will advance – they’re just not sure how.

It’s been six months since the funding passed through the Senate and some in Congress have floated the idea of bundling it into the annual defense spending authorization bill a must-pass piece of legislation.

Complicating matters other countries are already maneuvering to respond to the CHIPS Act with their own funding. Bloomberg reported last month that Japan is positioning itself to pay up to half the cost of new fabs aiming to lure some of the same manufacturers the U.S. hopes to attract.

The Semiconductor Industry Association says South Korea has spent at least $7 billion subsidizing its chips industry over the past 20 years. Israel has spent $2.5 billion during that span with much of the money going to Intel which is that country’s largest private employer.

Europe is planning its own version of the CHIPS Act and industry estimates say China has put $50 billion into its semiconductor industry over the past 20 years.

To critics that’s a sign of an escalating cycle of corporate subsidies the U.S. shouldn’t join. To Intel and the chip industry though it’s a signal of a technological race the U.S. can’t afford to lose.

“The funding coming from the CHIPS Act will start helping to turn the tide” Intel’s Kelleher said Thursday “and start eliminating the erosion of the manufacturing going off site and start bringing it back on site to the U.S.”

The 24-inch iMac with Apple's M1 processor

A Mac with Apple Silicon inside isn't just noticeably faster than their Intel counterparts; it's capable of a few other exclusive features too. Here is what an Apple Silicon-based Mac can do that the Intel Macs can't.

Intel machines still exist

At the moment Apple sells a mix of Intel-based machines and an ever-increasing number of Apple Silicon-based Macs. Apple is amid a two-year transition to run its Mac lines entirely on Apple Silicon but until then there are existing machines available in the current lineup on the second-hand market and on sale as last-gen devices that use Intel chips.

This inevitably brings up the question of what are the differences — other than pure performance — between an Apple processor and an Intel one.

At the time of publication there are currently three Apple processors on the market. There is the M1 the M1 Pro and the M1 Max. Over time this list will undoubtedly expand.

Apple's processors have plenty of benefits in terms of performance but as Apple can control every facet of these chips there is currently a subset of Mac features exclusive only to Apple's chipsets.

Sets Apple Silicon apart

As Apple has integrated its image signal processor into M1 series processors it has afforded improved performance of the built-in FaceTime camera. Notably users can enable Portrait Mode on a Mac running Apple Silicon.

Portrait Mode on FaceTime

Users can create an artificial bokeh over their background by going to Control Center and clicking video effects while on a FaceTime call. This elevated look helps give a more high-end appearance to video calls and can take away from perhaps otherwise untidy rooms.

Some cities in Apple Maps have more details on Apple Silicon

In Maps an interactive glove view is only available on Apple Silicon in which users can spin the globe and seamlessly zoom in and out. Some cities — i.e. San Fransisco Los Angeles New York and London — have much more detail as well with trees roads crosswalks landmarks and more viewable when zoomed in.

Apple's Neural Engine aids a few speech features too. Apple Silicon machines have on-device dictation which doesn't require uploading the audio to the cloud for analysis and therefore doesn't need an internet connection.

There is also text-to-speech support for additional languages — Danish Finnish Norwegian and Swedish.

With Apple Silicon Apple no longer needed the T2 chip found in its Intel machines. Apple baked all of the T2 security and performance features directly into the processor and then some.

This is what enabled Apple Silicon machines to work with Apple's wireless Magic Keyboard with Touch ID.

Magic Keyboard with Touch ID

The Magic Keyboard with Touch ID can be used on Intel Macs but only as a keyboard. The Touch ID authentication won't work.

Finally since the M1-series processors are based on the same framework as Apple's A-series processors primarily used in iPhone and iPad iOS and iPadOS apps run are able to run natively on Macs with Apple Silicon.

Eve Home for Mac

Apps for iOS and iPadOS can run on Intel Macs when packaged via Catalyst but this isn't necessary for Apple Silicon. This means more iOS and iPadOS apps are available on Apple Silicon Macs than on Intel such as Eve's Home app.

This is just the beginning

Apple isn't shunning Intel chips in a shameless ploy to push its chips but by having such tight control over the processor it can do some cool things."

Didi Chuxing a $39 billion company that is China’s answer to Uber said on Friday that it would delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange. Just six months ago Didi was a Wall Street darling raising billions of dollars from American pension funds and international investors in a splashy New York initial public offering.

Those sorts of deals once fueled a three-decade relationship that helped reshape the global political and financial landscape. China generated heaps of money for Wall Street by hiring banks to manage deals like I.P.O.s. In return Wall Street gave China access to the halls of global finance and political power especially when it came to introductions in Washington.

Didi’s abrupt decision to leave brings home a stark truth for Wall Street: China doesn’t need it anymore. The world’s No. 2 economy has plenty of its own money and few problems attracting more from elsewhere. China’s friends on Wall Street have lost their sway in Washington at a time when mistrust of Beijing’s intentions is running high. And China’s leaders would rather keep tight control of its companies than open them up to investors on American markets.

Now Wall Street has become the latest area in which leaders on both sides are trying to weaken the extensive and complicated ties between the world’s two largest economies. And just as the alliance of China and Wall Street helped shape business in the past the way the two sides disentangle those ties could reshape its future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGxvb2tpbmRpYS5jb20vbWlzY2VsbGFuZW91cy9jaGluYXMtZGlkaS10by1sZWF2ZS11cy1zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtYW1pZC10ZWNoLWNyYWNrZG93bi1uZXdzLTQwMzgyONIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGxvb2tpbmRpYS5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L21pc2NlbGxhbmVvdXMvY2hpbmFzLWRpZGktdG8tbGVhdmUtdXMtc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWFtaWQtdGVjaC1jcmFja2Rvd24tbmV3cy00MDM4Mjg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China’s Didi to leave US stock market amid tech crackdown,It expanded abroad in 2018 by acquiring Brazil’s 99 Taxis and set up operations in Mexico.

Only five months transpired between Didi's going public in New York in June and word Friday that it will prepare a Hong Kong listing. During that time its market value has fallen by 63 percent.

Didi's move comes in the wake of a sweeping Chinese regulatory crackdown in the past year that has clipped the wings of major internet firms wielding huge influence on consumers' lives -- including Alibaba and Tencent.

After Friday's announcement heavyweight Chinese online retailers whose stocks are sold on the New York exchange such as Alibaba JD.com and Pinduoduo dropped sharply.

Shares in Alibaba -- whose arrival on Wall Street in 2014 to a loud fanfare kicked off the parade of Chinese firms listing in the Big Apple -- fell to their lowest level in nearly five years as rumors circulated that after Didi leaves Alibaba might be next.

Technically even as Didi Chuxing moves its listing to Hong Kong holders of its shares in New York retain those stakes. Their investment does not simply vanish.

But ""people are very fearful about regulations and the Chinese government"" said Kevin Carter portfolio manager at EMQQ. ""And that has really really affected sentiment. People are scared.""

Coincidentally on Thursday US market regulators announced the adoption of a rule allowing them to delist foreign companies if they fail to provide information to auditors.

The move is aimed primarily at Chinese firms and requires them to disclose whether they are ""owned or controlled"" by a government.

""While more than 50 jurisdictions have worked... to allow the required inspections two historically have not: China and Hong Kong"" Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler said.

'Sensitive data'

The Global Times a newspaper close to the Chinese Communist Party criticized the new US regulation in an opinion piece Friday.

""If the US sets unequal conditions on national security for competition between the two countries by demanding Chinese listed companies hand over audits for inspection so as to spy on China's internal situation and store huge amounts of sensitive data acquired by Chinese companies China won't accept that"" the unsigned piece said.

Many of these New York-listed shares are held not by private citizens but rather by institutional investors.

""Some funds can only have shares that are traded on US markets"" said Gregori Volokhine president of Meeschaert Financial Services. ""This is what is putting pressure on shares.""

And for many market watchers Didi described as China's answer to Uber will not be the last Chinese tech giant to delist from New York.

""It is not specific to Didi because for months we have seen the communist party's grip on companies tighten"" said Volokhine.

Shortly after Didi went public in New York the reservation platform Full Truck Alliance and the job-search site Kanzhun were investigated by China's cybersecurity watchdog.

The Chinese government has also tightened regulations on companies that offer families private tutoring. This has hurt companies listed in New York.

According to figures in May from a US government agency a total of 248 Chinese companies are listed in the United States with a combined market capitalization of 2.1 trillion dollars.

""After an active start to the year Chinese companies have largely stopped tapping the US IPO market since June due to regulatory and policy roadblocks in both countries"" said Matthew Kennedy a strategist with Renaissance Capital.

This week Spark Education a big Chinese online small-class teaching firm withdrew its planned IPO in the US.

""The way things are one can say there will be no more new Chinese IPOs and the ones in the pipeline will be withdrawn one by one"" Volokhine said. Renaissance Capital says there are 35 companies in that pipeline.

In leaving the US market Chinese companies are giving up an investor base like no other in the world -- with $52.5 trillion in assets under management compared to $7.1 trillion in China according to a study last year by McKinsey and Company a management consulting firm.

Carter said this political pressure on Chinese companies creates an odd situation in which the stars of the Chinese tech world are plummeting on the stock market but not because of their earnings reports.

""And these companies are still making profits. And then those profits are still growing"" he said.

""The revenue growth for the year is over 30 percent. Not for every company but a bit collectively. No matter where the stock is no matter where the stocks trade that's still the case"" he said.",,,,,,

Then it disappeared.

""When you have something that is such a standard in your community you don't expect it to go away"" said Tricia Heibel president of the International Falls Area Chamber of Commerce. Residents were ""shocked"" Heibel said when the hedge fund Alden Global Capital owner of the International Falls Journal shut down the paper in June.

""Everybody went into a panic"" she said. In ""the Falls"" a remote city with poor broadband many people don't have access to the internet. They depended on the printed newspaper for community news event listings funeral notices and legal announcements. The library and the museum wondered how they would maintain information for historical purposes.

They didn't have to wonder long. Before a month was up another newspaper had launched. The Rainy Lake Gazette published its first issue on July 16 and has come out every Friday since.

The new paper is owned by New Jersey-based CherryRoad Media which publishes about 25 other papers around the country including the Cook County News-Herald in Grand Marais. Brian Larsen editor of the News-Herald said CherryRoad Media inquired about buying the Journal but was rebuffed by its owners who said it would be easier to simply close it.

Jeremy Gulban CherryRoad's chief executive then met with community leaders in International Falls and told them he'd like to start up a new paper. Some in the community had discussed creating some kind of publication whether online or otherwise but they quickly saw the advantages of working with an established publisher.

""When Jeremy came in and already had structure behind him and experience then the other people supported that"" Heibel said.

Larsen was the point man in getting the new publication going. With a tight timeline in addition to his regular duties in Grand Marais ""the whole summer was a blur"" he said. Two experienced advertising and business representatives from the Journal joined the new paper and eventually the Journal's final editor Laurel Beager came on board as well.

The response from the community was ""tremendous"" Larsen said. After the paper launched he said he got about a dozen calls a day from Falls residents saying how glad they were to have a newspaper again.

""It's hard to get work done when you're on the phone all day"" he said with a laugh. In a statement Gulban called the weeks leading to the launch ""the most rewarding of my career. To see how the community in International Falls has rallied together to help us get this initiative off the ground validates the importance of community newspapers.

""In speaking with people in the community over the last several weeks a common theme has been a sense of regret that they took for granted the previous paper would always be there.""

The Rainy Lake Gazette is running ahead of projections with about 1500 subscribers Larsen said. International Falls has a population of about 6500 and Koochiching County has a population of about 12000. The Gazette also mailed out free issues to about 6000 homes during its first month of operation.

The new paper has been well received Heibel said.

""People like it a lot. There seems to be a lot more color and people enjoy that"" she said. ""They're pleased to see the content back.

""In a small community like ours I think people understand the importance and are much more engaged now that it's come back. They realize it could go away.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGNoZXpkZW1vY3JhdC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8wNS90aGUtZGFydC1uYXRjaGV6aWFuLWZpbmRzLWhpcy1taXNzaW9uLWluLWZlZWRpbmctcGVvcGxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Dart: Natchezian finds his mission in feeding people - Mississippi's Best Community Newspaper | Mississippi's ...,"The Dart: Natchezian finds his mission in feeding people Published 5:31 am Sunday December 5 2021

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

NATCHEZ — Natchezian Anthony “Scoop” White stepped out of his food truck Wangz and Thangz on Martin Luther King Jr. Road where The Dart landed with a grin on his face.

White graduated from Natchez High School in 2003 and after a brief stint in college decided that wasn’t for him. His father Johnny White Sr. told him he could quit college when he found a job. In his dorm room he received a call telling him he had been hired for an off-shore oil job working on a line boat.

He left for five years before coming home to work as a correctional officer for 10 years. It was working at a prison where he learned a lot of lessons he said.

“I was troubled at an early age but I was blessed enough where I never got a felony charge” White said. “A convict in the prison I worked at told me this. ‘When you come in and you are doing life you aren’t a convict until you have 20 years under your belt.’ He said ‘this is no place for you.’ It stuck with me. I thought there must be a reason God sent me here. I felt there was a reason He put me in that position like He was saying ‘I spared you go do my work.’”

White set out to God’s work through cooking a passion he learned from his father. Johnny White Sr. was a chef before he went to work at the International Paper Company.

Each day Anthony would take care of the family’s horses before he walked to the school bus stop. When he came home he had to cook dinner by the time his father got in. Dinner was at 10 p.m. he said.

A year ago he purchased a food truck trailer and began getting it ready to feed people in the local community. He is grateful to Ricky Gray who owns a nearby business and provided the location for the food truck for his mentorship and welcoming him with open arms.

Hot Wangz and Thangz has a wide variety of food from Funnel Cakes to deep Fried Oreos to hamburgers and hot wings with more than 20 different sauces.

“I fell in love with cooking and it became a passion of mine. I’m not here for the money but I like to see the smile on people’s faces when they see our burgers” Anthony said. “There is nowhere in this area to get a good home-style cheeseburger. We are bringing this to feed the locals.”

About two years ago White said he struggled with his personal identity. People told him he was too soft and open hearted and he needed to toughen up he said. Instead he thought about giving love to the community by feeding them.

Ultimately he would like to grow the food truck business by adding a bigger truck. Another goal of his is to create jobs to give young kids in Natchez something to do because he is concerned about them turning to violence.

Leaving college was a mistake he said. Now he explains the importance of education to his son Jai’Marion White who is 9.

“My son is smarter than his daddy and I thank God for that” he said.

They have a close bond. Usually they spend their time together watching sports or going bowling. Anthony said he wears two of his most-prized possessions. A medallion hangs around his neck on a necklace. It was a gift from his fiancé Martha White and his son Jai’Marion. On his left middle finger is a golden ring which belonged to his father.

“I’m a big giver. I don’t receive much so my family got together and got me this medallion” Anthony said. “It says on it ‘I hope you believe in yourself as much as I believe in you. To my King never forget I love you forever.’ Every day I pray over it. Every day I kiss my father’s ring and kiss this medallion and I thank God.”

It was his prayer to God to open the food truck and now it is a family venture. The food truck is open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day but Sunday.

“If you don’t have any money and you are hungry and honest I will feed you” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ldHJvd2VzdGRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyLzA0L3NvdXRoYm9yb3VnaC1yb3RhcnktY2x1Yi1kb25hdGVzLXBhcGVyLW1pY3Jvc2NvcGVzLWVjdWFkb3IvODc2ODg3NTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The eyes have it. Southborough Rotary donates paper microscopes to Ecuador students,"SOUTHBOROUGH — To reach schools in the communities surrounding the city of Puyo deep in the tropical rainforest of eastern Ecuador visitors from the capital of Quito have to travel all day by car and boat.

Volunteers from the Rotary Club of the Ecuadorian city of Ambato in cooperation with the Foundation for the Conservation of Aquatic and Terrestrial Biodiversity (FUCOBI) completed that difficult journey on Oct.1 to deliver 21 foldscopes — microscopes made of paper — donated by Southborough Rotary Club.

“There are no science labs in Ecuador” said Dr. Acacia Warren president of the Southborough Rotary Club. “Children (in Ecuador) are not exposed to any classes on science and there’s just a lack of educational opportunity to do hands-on scientific research.”

Warren an immunobiologist and a veterinary doctor born and raised in Chone Ecuador has been active in keeping in touch with her native country.

In 2010 she organized a scientific expedition with her students at Tufts University along the western coast of Ecuador to study the congenital consequences of exposure to toxic materials.

She has since built a long-lasting relationship with FUCOBI through which she wants to help Ecuadorian communities that continue to be threatened by poor environmental conditions.

Warren first heard of foldscopes in October 2020 and immediately realized the benefit of Ecuadorian communities using them.

Foldscopes are made entirely of paper. They incur a manufacturing cost of about $1 sell on the retail market for $3.50 weigh less than two nickels and work as well as a lab microscope with a magnification of about 140 times according to Foldscopes Instruments Inc's website.

Once the pieces are assembled users insert sample slides to get their science on.

Three thousand miles from Southborough Iris Hernandez executive director at FUCOBI received the first package of foldscopes in September and on Oct. 1 she set out on a trek with volunteers toward the Amazon.

Three schools have received the first foldscopes — U.E.I. Rogers Mc. Cully and U.E.I.B. Gabriel López schools in Arajuno and CECIB Río Aguarico in Shiwakucha.

Each school consists of 10 to 30 students ranging from 9 to 17 years old who have shown great interest in the foldscopes according to Hernandez.

Based in Baños de Agua Santa four hours from the schools Hernandez said students have mostly used the foldscopes to observe insects — but the benefits go beyond the classes.

Since their newly installed water pump they have also been taught by teachers to examine water droplets to judge the drinkability the water.

""We cried with the students when we received them because nobody was expecting them"" said Hernandez. ""With the foldscopes students can now see if they actually can drink the water pumped since mid-October from the Arajuno River when before they would walk to collect water.""

Designed at Stanford University by Manu Prakash and Jim Cybulski foldscopes were made available in 2017 with the goal of making scientific observations without the costly and bulky inconveniences of a regular microscope according to Foldscope Instruments which is headquartered in Palo Alto California — the same community as Stanford.

More than 1.3 million foldscopes have been delivered to more than 140 countries with the purpose of making the evaluation of water quality much easier according to Ken Ta a Foldscope Instruments representative who was excited to hear about the Rotary Club’s contribution.

“It's truly inspiring” he said. “As a social mission-driven company we are thrilled to see our products being used as it was intended — to make science and STEM (science technology engineering and mathematics) education equitable and accessible for everyone.”

One hundred more foldscopes were delivered last month but they are stuck in a process stalled by COVID-19 said Hernandez.

In the future she also hopes to supply 100 foldscopes per province along the coast of Ecuador but also the north along the border with Colombia even though the latter suffers the dangers of guerrilla control.

""With some areas it's kind of hard because they're not safe"" said Hernandez. ""I'm also a mom of a son who's 1 year and almost 5 months who goes with us everywhere we go.""

At the Southborough Rotary Club members including Carl Guyer are collecting bottles and cans to raise money for foldscopes that will be sent to Ecuador in the future.

“I can still remember when I was a sophomore in high school walking into biology class looking into a microscope and seeing a living organism — a paramecium” said Guyer. “I understand how these things can change and inspire people and we have to make this bigger because it has a really big impact.""

Since the delivery students in Ecuador have shown their appreciation through a Nov. 16 video.

“Ecuadorian kids just smile and dance and they are just so happy” said Warren. “I am so proud of being a Rotary member.”

The Southborough organization is one of 46000 such clubs that are part of an international membership that comes to the aid of communities in need all over the world according to the Rotary Club website.

Their work aims to “unite and take action to create lasting change — across the globe in our communities and in ourselves.”

A strong believer in education as a means to escape poverty Warren said the foldscopes will open a window for younger people in Ecuador especially those more vulnerable to COVID-19.

She hopes to send 350 more.

“I only hope that I can help the children from Chone where I was born but they are not in line yet — we need to go to the more serious areas” said Warren. “I really want us to continue this effort.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMTEyLzEyNDA3MTYuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abuses malaises of US democracy exposed in China’s report,"Messy and chaotic practices of US democracy.

Lü Xiang a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences described the recent moves as ""timely"" and ""to the point"" as China has been relatively reserved in the world's political debates.Facing the US' tactics and propaganda campaign China should explain its stance properly telling people who lack sufficient understanding of China about the country's democratic system and its achievements.

The report released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry makes it clearer to all countries that US democracy is not only failing to deliver a good life for their people but even creating more problems and disastrous consequences for the world.Diao Daming an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing noted that the two documents do not mean to deny Western democracy or engage in confrontation with the US but to set the facts straight and tell the international community what is right and wrong.""China is also on behalf of the international community to expose the US' actions: facing the chaos of democracy at home the US seeks hegemony in the international arena under the guise of democracy.

It is based on the ""efficacy of treatment"" on the historical development status path and construction needs of any country. It should meet the needs of the people and can effectively respond to the people the expert said.""How to run a democracy summit when your own democracy is dying"" the US magazine The National Interest asked in an article published on Thursday saying that ""democratic standards should apply to everyone and are not just a vocabulary that the powerful use to lecture the weak.""At Saturday's press conference Xu Lin Vice Minister of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee and director of the State Council Information Office said the US-manipulated so-called summit for democracy is a joke as it is using democracy as a banner to crack down on countries with different systems and development models. He made the remarks in response to a question on whether China and the US are battling over the narrative of democracy.The US has ineffective domestic governance while imposing hegemony in its foreign policy. Isn't it ridiculous such a country claims itself to be a model of world democracy or a beacon of democracy? Xu asked.Fan Peng a research fellow at the Institute of Political Sciences Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said the so-called democracy summit exactly reflects the US' decline in power and influence.""The US can't show to the world more staunch democratic ethics and moral standards neither can it provide public goods for global security and stability thus it can only hope to stand on the so-called moral high ground to identify and unite which countries will follow it and use the ideology to stigmatize its opponents.""

It is based on the ""efficacy of treatment"" on the historical development status path and construction needs of any country. It should meet the needs of the people and can effectively respond to the people the expert said.""How to run a democracy summit when your own democracy is dying"" the US magazine The National Interest asked in an article published on Thursday saying that ""democratic standards should apply to everyone and are not just a vocabulary that the powerful use to lecture the weak.""At Saturday's press conference Xu Lin Vice Minister of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee and director of the State Council Information Office said the US-manipulated so-called summit for democracy is a joke as it is using democracy as a banner to crack down on countries with different systems and development models. He made the remarks in response to a question on whether China and the US are battling over the narrative of democracy.The US has ineffective domestic governance while imposing hegemony in its foreign policy. Isn't it ridiculous such a country claims itself to be a model of world democracy or a beacon of democracy? Xu asked.Fan Peng a research fellow at the Institute of Political Sciences Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said the so-called democracy summit exactly reflects the US' decline in power and influence.""The US can't show to the world more staunch democratic ethics and moral standards neither can it provide public goods for global security and stability thus it can only hope to stand on the so-called moral high ground to identify and unite which countries will follow it and use the ideology to stigmatize its opponents.""",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,100 foreign students of Kurukshetra University to present research papers at International Gita Seminar,CHANDIGARH: In the International Gita Mahotsava-2021 as many as 100 foreign students of Kurukshetra University will present their research papers on the holy book Gita.

INTU,Intuit,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8wNS9ob3ctY3JlZGl0LWthcm1hLWFjcXVpcmVkLWFtaWQtY292aWQtY2hhb3MtZmFyZWQtaW4taXRzLWZpcnN0LXllYXItdW5kZXItaW50dWl0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Credit Karma acquired amid COVID chaos fared in its first year under Intuit,"February 24 2020 is a day Ken Lin will never forget. The Credit Karma CEO was about to announce that the company he founded 13 years earlier was about to be acquired for more than $7 billion. Meanwhile the stock market was in free fall.

“I remember waking up and the Dow futures were down something like 600 points because the COVID pieces were starting to hit the market” Lin said. “I’m up at 5 o’clock in the morning the Dow is flashing red … and we’re all like ‘Are we going to do this?’”

Markets were getting jittery as it became clear the coronavirus had spread beyond China’s borders as case numbers were multiplying in Italy and South Korea. The S&P 500 fell 3.5% that day and kicked off a weeklong sell-off in global securities as the WHO warned COVID-19 could soon become a global pandemic.

“Needless to say we all agreed that it was the right decision [to move forward] and that all the externalities and unknowns at that point were immaterial” Lin said. “So we pushed forward with it and we got the deal signed and announced.”

By the time the deal closed — on December 3 one year ago — Credit Karma had seen its business impacted by a tightening of the credit markets and had been forced to divest its tax business after a Justice Department review.

But in the 12 months since Credit Karma which operates as a mostly independent unit within Intuit has seen a dramatic rebound in its business thanks in part to a reversal in the financial markets but also due to commercial adoption of its Lightbox decision-making engine and acceleration of consumer interest from integrations with Intuit products.

Weathering the storm

To say that COVID-19 was not kind to Credit Karma’s business is an understatement. According to those inside the company revenue dried up virtually overnight in the early days of the pandemic.

Credit Karma primarily makes money by connecting banks and other lenders to qualified borrowers who might want to open a new credit card take out a personal loan or refinance their mortgage and it earns a referral fee in the process. So when credit markets dried up amid pandemic uncertainty and banks stopped lending Credit Karma’s business took a direct hit.

That was something neither side accounted for when they signed on to do the deal.

“We probably lost 60% of our revenue during that first COVID moment” Lin said. “What had been a very profitable business for a very long time is all of a sudden very unprofitable because you can’t pivot on a dime. We had a lot of decisions to make.”

Those decisions were complicated by covenants in the acquisition agreement Credit Karma signed which said the company couldn’t dramatically alter its business while the deal was undergoing regulatory review.

“Those covenants are written in such a way that our lawyers are looking at us and our board is calling me to say we should be really careful. Technically if you pull back from marketing … what happened to our revenue [could be considered] breaches in the contract” Lin said.

Colleen McCreary Credit Karma’s chief people officer was tasked with helping to navigate the impact on employees.

“I was the only person on the management team who had ever executed layoffs before” McCreary told me. “I had created a list of three paths. … But if we want to choose the layoff path let me tell you about the carnage that it leaves behind. I really pushed the case that we can’t be taking people’s jobs.”

Instead of job cuts Credit Karma issued pay cuts. It stopped recruiting stopped trying to backfill jobs and turned off any paid marketing. At the same time the organization worked hard to reassign employees whose jobs were not in demand or necessary during the slowdown — including those in human resources and talent acquisition.

“We announced pay cuts and we actually moved people around” McCreary said. “When we shut down recruiting I had 40 people in recruiting — and recruiting in particular was one of the places that got completely massacred during that time frame. So we moved them into product and business development and legal operations we moved them into copywriting wherever I could put people. We did whatever we could to save jobs.”

Credit Karma also offered exit packages to employees who didn’t want to stick around. “If this is not for you and you want to quit now we’ll pay you for the next two months. You should just quit today. Get off the bus get out go do your thing” McCreary said arguing it was a better strategy than “to just have a drip of people quitting.”

At the same time the company reprioritized resources in ways that reflected the reality of where most growth would come from during the early months of the pandemic. They moved employees from two of their biggest businesses — credit cards and personal loans — and moved them to focus on home and auto lending which at the time were small teams customers would still need.

From an employee retention standpoint the strategy paid off; when the deal was announced employee headcount was around 1300 and when the deal closed it stood at 1290.

A taxing decision

Even before the DOJ review Credit Karma and Intuit knew the overlap in tax products would be a problem for regulators. Intuit’s TurboTax had been the clear market leader for tax preparation software for years before Credit Karma entered the market with its own free online tax product in 2017.

“We knew they would have a question because we’re in the tax business and [Credit Karma] had just gotten into the tax business” Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi told me. “But we were not acquiring them because of the tax business. It was frankly so infinitesimal that we knew it would raise a flag with the DOJ but we also knew that our intent was always about creating a consumer platform far beyond taxes.”

According to Goodarzi part of the reason the DOJ review took so long was that the agency was really trying to understand how the two companies fit together and what it would mean for consumers specifically in the tax area. Ultimately the Justice Department ruled the companies would have to divest Credit Karma Tax to move forward with the acquisition.

“We never thought this Intuit-Credit Karma thing was about the tax business” Lin said. “They already had the biggest tax product and we were just getting started.”

In the press release announcing Square’s acquisition of the business the company said Credit Karma Tax helped more than 2 million filers process their tax return in the prior year. That’s compared with nearly 40 million returns prepared with TurboTax in the same period.

According to Lin in a financial space that is all about scale the most important part of the acquisition was combining its consumer credit data with the large amount of income and asset data that Intuit had collected.

“Credit Karma historically has always had the credit side of a consumer’s financial life but Intuit has always had the assets income and all the other pieces” he said. “When you put those two pieces together … you can get into some really interesting products when it comes to helping consumers understand the landscape and what’s available to them.”

A LinkedIn model for management

There were clear synergies between the Credit Karma and Intuit operations but there was also a recognition that tightly integrating the companies and running Credit Karma products under the Intuit umbrella might not be the best way to get the most out of their strengths.

“Integration [is] just a euphemism for slowing things down. So we talked a lot about how we are not going to integrate Credit Karma we’re going to accelerate Credit Karma” Lin said.

To do that they modeled the org structure in part on Microsoft’s purchase of LinkedIn and the independence that unit was afforded after the acquisition closed. Former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner sits on the Intuit board and was instrumental in helping design a playbook under which Credit Karma would operate mostly independently from the rest of the Intuit business.

“The thing that we learned from Jeff and how they structured the deal with Satya and Microsoft was that [they] aligned on objectives and aligned on priorities to achieve those objectives” Goodarzi said. But otherwise for LinkedIn “There was complete autonomy end to end.”

Of course there are some areas where the companies must integrate as part of a publicly traded company — like anything that includes financial controls or compliance — but for most people at Credit Karma little has changed over the past year.

According to Rich Franks who is the head of Credit Karma’s Lightbox group “99% of people that I interact with do not feel the presence of Intuit at all. I think other than the leadership level we’re all heading the same direction which is always going to be the case. Operationally nothing has happened differently because of that.”

Opportunities for acceleration

While the acquisition didn’t result in a change in organizational structure or a combined workforce both sides were opportunistic about finding ways in which their products could accelerate growth between them.

“First and foremost Ken and I align on objectives both short and long term align on strategy and key priorities. Then we have a set within priorities what we call acceleration priorities where we are putting platforms together” Goodarzi said.

In practice that has resulted in work to accelerate growth of the Credit Karma and Credit Karma Money products as well as the exchange of data (with customer consent) that will improve the unit’s ability to suggest credit products that consumers will likely be approved for.

One of the first examples of this acceleration happened during tax season earlier this year when the teams connected Credit Karma Money to TurboTax in a way that enabled customers to access their tax refund more quickly. This effort was a huge push from both teams as they worked post-close to integrate the products in time for tax season just a few months later.

“A tax refund tends to be the biggest paycheck for consumers each and every year. To be able to use Credit Karma money as a conduit to get you your money faster is important” Lin said.

He added that each year TurboTax sees roughly $100 billion in tax refunds which amounts to a huge opportunity to grow the Credit Karma user base. Already in the first year TurboTax and Turbo customers accounted for 40% of new Credit Karma members.

Another area in which the companies have accelerated development is less visible to users but might be more impactful — and that’s the way it’s using TurboTax data to improve its machine learning engine Lightbox.

Lightbox helps lenders find qualified borrowers by allowing them to specify certain underwriting criteria and then connect them with Credit Karma users who have a high likelihood of being approved for a new credit product.

Prior to the Intuit acquisition Credit Karma made most of those matches based on data it knew about a consumer’s credit history. But over time lenders have become more sophisticated in their underwriting algorithms in some cases using hundreds of data points to score potential borrowers. Having a more complete picture of the customer’s financial life therefore helps Credit Karma offer better products to its users.

“We knew that credit was roughly 70% of the underwriting decision but income assets and the ability to pay are the other 30%” Lin said. “Now with consumer consent we have this full picture of the consumer’s financial life that powers more certainty in the space.”

A return to growth

For Credit Karma 2020 was a challenging year. But after a year at Intuit it’s reporting record results again.

During the most recent quarter — Intuit’s fiscal Q1 2022 — Credit Karma contributed $418 million in revenue. That’s compared to just $144 million and $316 million in its first two quarters as part of Intuit. That growth was driven by strength in personal loans and credit cards as lending in those areas continues to pick up.

The company expects that growth to continue as it revised full-year revenue guidance for the unit to $1.540 billion to $1.565 billion up from $1.345 billion to $1.380 billion.

With another tax season ahead in which the groups can apply lessons from the previous year as well as improvement in products like Lightbox and Credit Karma Money the team is poised to capitalize on Intuit’s investment in the business. And as long as it does Intuit will continue to let it operate autonomously.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9pZG5vdGlmedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IDnotify identity theft protection review,"IDnotify is an interesting product. It’s quite similar to Experian IdentityWorks although the features pricing and plans are slightly different. If you happen to use Intuit TurboTax this Identity Theft protection app is included for free with the Plus Max and Premium bundles. There’s nothing “extra” included and IDnotify really only covers the basics but it’s a solid and well-designed product nonetheless.

Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.

Our series on identity theft protection apps will evaluate the features pricing options competition and also the overall value of using each app. However these are not full hands-on reviews since evaluating identity theft protection apps is almost impossible. It would require several months of testing purposefully hacking accounts to see if the protection app works handing over personally identifiable information performing multiple credit checks and risking exposure of the reviewer’s personally identifiable information.

For those who are interested in protecting their online identity here’s a quick tip. There are quite a few apps available ranging from the most powerful (Norton LifeLock and IdentityForce) to the most simplistic. Most of these apps offer very similar features including credit reporting and a credit score alerts related to identity theft and identity theft insurance. Picking the app you want comes down to two main factors - quality and price. If you want the best app and price is no option then Norton LifeLock or IdentityForce are solid picks. Most of us strongly consider the second factor - the monthly price. It’s a bit deceiving when you choose a pricing plan that costs $25 per month and think that’s fairly inexpensive then realize the total yearly fee is $300.

IDnotify is a strange hybrid. It’s not the best identity theft protection service but is also far from the worst. The IDnotify Premier plan costs $25.99 per month even though it’s remarkably similar to the Experian IdentityWorks Premium plan that costs $19.99 per month. (Experian is behind both products in case that is still a mystery. Note that in our Experian IdentityWorks review we explained how the company experienced a massive data breach a while ago.) Yet if you use Intuit TurboTax and sign up for the Plus Max or Premium plans then IDnotify is included as part of those bundles. Somewhere in between all of these pricing options is the fact that the product itself is a worthy contender and one of our top picks overall.

IDnotify offers three paid plans to choose from (Image credit: IDnotify)

Plans and pricing

One reason we like IDnotify is that it’s fairly affordable compared to the best of the best identity theft apps even if you are not a TurboTax user. The Essential plan costs $9.99 per month but doesn’t include credit reporting or credit scores. Rather it is a pared down feature set with a mere four features: internet surveillance social network monitoring identity restoration and lost wallet services. There is no discount offered for paying annually.

Moving up a notch is the middle tiered Select plan that costs $17.99 per month and includes one credit report. That seems like a hefty price increase but realize that additional features include change of address monitoring court records and booking monitoring and identity theft insurance.

At the top of the tiers is the Premier plan costs $25.99 per month and includes three credit reporting agencies along with VantageScore sex offender monitoring and financial account monitoring. Even for that top plan that’s still cheaper than Norton LifeLock’s Ultimate plan which costs $29.99 per month. You can add a child to your plan for $5.99 per month. Oddly pricing for Experian IdentityWorks uses a different strategy where you pick a family plan you want and can protect up to 10 children for $5 more per month (instead of per child fees).

It’s worth mentioning one of the most compelling reasons to consider IDnotify however. If you sign up for TurboTax and choose the Plus Max or Premium plans  then IDnotify is included for free for the entire year - a big savings from the monthly pricing plans. There is a caveat in that the window for adding these plans is not quite open yet - as TurboTax will likely offer IDnotify again as part of the 2021 tax year. We recommend checking the TurboTax site to see if that’s the case and if IDnotify is part of the bundles.

Interface

Any technical user who looks below the surface of IDnotify and IdentityWorks will find that both products likely use the same codebase. They function about the same although IDnotify has a friendlier lighter look with more white space and a spacious look and feel. You can find the basics easily enough in tabs along the top. Maybe it’s even the exact same product but the cleaner interface with IDnotify is our preference and makes it easier to use than IdentityWorks.

IDnotify provides all of the features you'd expect from an identity theft protection service (Image credit: IDnotify)

Features

We’re not breaking any new ground here in terms of features but what is expected for this type of service is certainly here. We consider the lowest tier Essential plan as somewhat paltry but the upper tiers of IDnotify includes all of the basics such as credit reporting and credit scores identity theft insurance up to $1 million in reimbursements (included only in the Select and Premier plans) alerts for when a sex offender moves into your area and notifications about fraud and someone stealing your identity. The Select and Premier plans do add some more advanced functionality with alerts for changes to your court records a social security number trace.

You can reach IDnotify by phone email or by mail but you won't find a knowledgebase or any other resources on its site (Image credit: IDnotify)

Support

Sooner or later a user is likely to need some support with their identity theft service and this a selling point for IDNotify. We take note that there is a toll free phone number with availability 24/7 every day of the year which is ideal as you never know when an ID theft situation can arise and you need some assistance. Furthermore additional options include a direct email (which we generally prefer to the contact portal approach) and finally a snail mail address. There are no further support options such as a chat box or self-serve info such as a FAQ or predone articles or videos but the basics are well covered here.

The competition

We didn’t find a single unique feature with IDnotify especially compared to Experian IdentityWorks and some of the other leaders in the identity theft protection field. We would have liked something “extra” like the fact that Allstate Identity Protection can alert you about a social media account being hacked or how Norton LifeLock uses wizards and status indicators to show the progress you’ve made on protecting your online identity. That left us with a feeling that this is more of a ‘No frills’ or generic offering than we would have liked.

Final verdict

What this means is that IDnotify falls somewhere in the middle or top of the pack depending on how you pay for it and what you are looking for. It’s not the best or cheapest identity theft app and it doesn’t really compare favorably to a top pick such as Norton LifeLock.

Overall we liked the interface and the pricing is certainly not exorbitant. The real question is whether you use TurboTax and choose one of the extra plans that lets you adjust your taxes or recover from an audit. It might make perfect sense to pay a little extra for the added bundle in TurboTax and can then start using IDnotify for the entire tax year for no added monthly fees which can get you IDNotify at a bargain- that’s a great deal and worth considering. However on a stand alone subscription IDNotify is significantly less compelling.

ISRG,Intuitive Surgical,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd2V4bmVybWVkaWNhbC5vc3UuZWR1L2RlcGFydG1lbnRzL2lubm92YXRpb25zL29ydGhvcGVkaWNzLzNkLWhvbG9ncmFtc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3D holograms give orthopedic surgeons real-time data for more accurate shoulder replacement surgeries | Ohio State ...,"Intuitive digital mixed-reality system takes surgery to the next level at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center

A new 3D hologram system lets orthopedic surgeons at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center be more precise when performing shoulder replacement surgery.

Stryker’s Blueprint mixed-reality technology uploads a digital 3D holographic view of a patient’s pre-operative plan onto headset glasses worn by the surgeon.

“It feels like you are Iron Man moving and referencing the virtual images” Gregory Cvetanovich MD an orthopedic surgeon and shoulder specialist at the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center says.

Surgeons can put that holographic image right next to the patient’s shoulder as they position implants during surgery. The technology provides a way to more closely personalize shoulder replacement surgery based on each patient’s unique anatomy.

“You can move the hologram around you can click right next to the patient’s shoulder you can compare and contrast and we can really make sure that we give them the best replacement that we can” Cvetanovich says.

He performed the first shoulder arthroplasty mixed-reality procedure at Ohio State in April 2021. The Blueprint system is in use at just 15 sites nationwide under a limited release.

“The system is very intuitive to use and takes very little practice” Cvetanovich says. “I practiced on a model shoulder in the lab and felt comfortable to start using it in surgery.”

Using technology to optimize surgical options

In a regular shoulder replacement doctors use the results of a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the patient’s shoulder to choose the replacement implant. These details are entered into a computer program to create the preoperative plan. During surgery doctors typically consult the pre-op plan on a flat 2D computer screen or a printout affixed to the wall.

The hologram system turns those plans into a 3D image which can help surgeons better prepare for surgery. The digital 3D image comes to life in the operating room. It provides more precision and reduces the chance of human error. That’s because doctors can manipulate the hologram in real time during surgery adjusting and making changes as needed based on what they see within the patient’s native anatomy.

Surgeons use hand gestures and voice commands to optimize the position of the 3D models as they work to replicate the pre-operative plan as closely as possible during surgery.

“Technology like mixed reality gives us an opportunity to significantly reduce variability in the way surgery is performed which can help reduce complications and improve overall patient outcomes” Cvetanovich says.

About 53000 people in the U.S. have shoulder replacement surgery each year according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Advancements that mixed-reality 3D holograms provide include:

Ability to place a 3D image next to 3D surgical field

Access to patient medical records and the implant’s technique manual during surgery

Exact positioning of implants through real-time 3D imaging

Meaningful information about surgical options without the surgeon needing to complete manual measurements

Transforming surgical education training and outcomes

Mixed reality is likely to transform shoulder arthroplasty and orthopedic procedures where precision is critically important like spine surgery and joint replacements says Cvetanovich especially “as future developments allow guidance calibrated with instruments to ensure ideal placement of the arthroplasty components.”

The 3D holographic image shows what the surgeon can’t see inside the body. This helps improve surgical accuracy and can significantly reduce surgeries where the implant is placed way out of line.

The technology also allows surgical staff residents and patients to view the planned operation from the surgeon’s vantage point. This helps everyone better understand the operation Cvetanovich says. The surgical team and trainees also can view the procedure in real time.

Cvetanovich expects mixed reality to change how surgeons are trained affect how patients understand the procedure and improve shoulder spine and other joint replacement surgeries overall.

Work continues on the Spring Creek Trail which will connect the Thunder Chicken Trail head on Silent Grove Road and the J.B. and Johnelle Hunt Family Ozark Highlands Nature Center of the Arkansas Game & Fish Commission on North 40th Street.

Work also continues on the Shiloh Trail which will link the bicycle tracks at the Jones Center with the Fitzgerald Mountain trails in the city's northeast.

Trailblazers + Ethic will gift the Shiloh Trail to the city when completed as it did with the Fitzgerald Mountain trails. Trailblazers + Ethic (Equitable Trails Healthy Infrastructure Community) is a recent merger of Bike NWA and the NWA Trailblazers. The Walton Family Foundation backs both groups.

The Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission in 2015 adopted the Bicycle and Pedestrian Trail Plan and the planning staff are working to update that plan said Tim Conklin assistant director of the regional commission. The project of making connections throughout Northwest Arkansas is ongoing and is nowhere near completion Conklin noted. The region has 30 cities with trail plans for connection he said.

Patsy Christie director of the city's Planning Department said the city's comprehensive trail plan also was introduced in 2015 and city planners are working to make updates.

The Walton Family Foundation in 2018 released the results of a study that found bicycling provided $137 million to the Northwest Arkansas economy including $86 million in total health benefits.

A 2020 update of the foundation's study listed 484 miles of trails in Northwest Arkansas; it listed Lake Springdale Trail in J.B. Hunt Park on Pump Station Road as the second most-used trail for pedestrians in Northwest Arkansas. The Lake Springdale Trail is just east of the Thunder Chicken Trail head and connects to the Spring Creek Trail.

Dean's Trail

The proposed tunnel under a busy U.S. highway marks the second phase of construction of Dean's Trail.

The first phase is open for use from East Emma Avenue to East Robinson Avenue. Dean's Trail begins at The Jones Center in downtown Springdale and ultimately will run south for 5 miles and connect with trails built by the city of Fayetteville at Lake Fayetteville.

Benchmark construction crews if their bid is approved will build the approaches for the Dean's Trail tunnel from where the trail currently ends west of Thrush Street on the north and along Sara Ford Avenue at J.O. Kelly Middle School to the south said Ryan Carr assistant director of the city's Engineering Department. Work should start in about a month he said.

Two transportation alternatives grants from the Arkansas Department of Transportation will provide $1 million for the project. The Walton Family Foundation will add another $1 million. The remainder will come from $1 million the city budgets each year for trails.

Because Robinson also holds the designation of U.S. 412 the Transportation Department also was involved in the planning and issued its own requirements including a four-phase traffic control plan Carr said.

Construction will require closure of lanes on Robinson to install the concrete boxes the trail's users will pass through he explained.

Several utility companies have infrastructure that also must move said Brad Baldwin the city's director of the Engineering and Public Works departments.

The City Council in May voted to pay $125000 for construction of Dean's Trail Phase 3A with $500000 from the transportation alternatives grant program and $1 million from the Walton Family Foundation.

Phase 3A will run south from Sara Ford Avenue to the Springdale Animal Shelter on East Don Tyson Parkway Carr said. The city is working on acquiring land for the route he noted.

Phase 3B would take Dean's Trail to the trails at Lake Fayetteville. That part of the trail is under design with the route not decided Carr said. The route will include a tunnel under Crossover Road he added. Phase 3B has not received money for construction Baldwin said.

Spring Creek

The Spring Creek Trail also is moving along.

Two bridges are in place Baldwin reported. Crews still have to lay concrete on them and add landscaping he said.

The cost to build the trail is $2.3 million. Spring Creek Trail will benefit from $250000 in federal money through the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission and $380000 from the Walton Family Foundation. The city will pay the rest.

The trail should open in late winter Carr said.

And work has begun on the western portion of the Spring Creek Trail north of the Hunt nature center Carr said. The trail extension will end across the street from the center. The connection to the center will be completed when the city makes improvements to North 40th Street from Falcon Road to the Spring Creek bridge.

Road work will start Monday Carr said. The new part of 40th will include two lanes of traffic and one turn lane in the center Carr said.

Sidewalks will line both sides of the street with the western sidewalk a 12-foot path that will become part of the city's trail system and connect to the Razorback Greenway.

The city contracted with APAC-Central for $7593824 to improve about a mile of 40th. The city will use funds from the 2018 bond issue to pay for the new road.

Completion of 40th is expected in summer of 2023 Carr said.

Shiloh Trail

The Shiloh Trail will provide mountain bikers on the Fitzgerald Mountain trails access to downtown Springdale the Jones Center and its pump track.

""It needs to be fun and engaging"" Erin Rushing the executive director of the former NWA Trailblazers said in a September 2020 meeting with the Springdale Public Facilities Board. ""The asphalt trail with option features will undoubtedly create a fun factor between these highly unique experiences.""

The trail's plan includes a boardwalk across the undeveloped land to keep riders and hikers above a swampy area.

The trail also will rely on the natural 3% grade of the mountain to provide the fun at the north end of the trail according to Rushing. Boulders for mountain bike-style jumps will dot the 2-mile trail said Hogan Koesis soft-surface project manager with Trailblazers + Ethic.

Koesis explained why the trail was designed with a hard surface rather than the soft surfaces usually used for mountain bikes.

""It's more maintenance friendly than a soft-surface trail. But it connects with a soft surface"" he said.

Shiloh Trail's northern terminus will be the southwest end of Onyx Avenue in the neighborhood around Bayyari Elementary School and park. Its designers dream of buying backyard space from homes in the neighborhood to bring Shiloh Trail directly to the Fitzgerald Trail head near the historic Fitzgerald Station stagecoach stop Koesis said.

""You can take us to a trail and point us in the opposite direction and we will find the way for a trail"" he said of his group. ""There are lots of creative things you can do along a trail. And we always are looking for an opportunity to enhance or expand a trail -- but only if it makes sense.""

Future projects in Springdale might include adding beginner trails to Thunder Chicken to better serve residents living near the trail.

""Sometimes we are stigmatized because we just build bicycle trails"" Koesis said. ""But we are trying to focus on everyone whether you're a runner a hiker or a dog walker. It's human nature to be active and we just want to get everybody moving just get them out.""

Road Ahead

Christie said the city next will look to connect the neighborhoods schools and other city amenities with the trails built over the last decade.

The City Council on Friday heard about a new active transportation planner position in the Planning Department's 2022 budget proposal. Christie said Mayor Doug Sprouse wanted the planner in that position to work on trail and sidewalk planning.

The Razorback Greenway which opened in 2015 acts as the spine of the trails system running north to south throughout Northwest Arkansas Christie explained.

Springdale has added east-west trail corridors to connect with the Greenway including Dean's Trail and Spring Creek Trail she added.

Conklin of the regional planning group said the newly opened railroad crossing on Maple Avenue added another.

The overall vision for the regional trails system is to connect Northwest Arkansas communities together with origins and destinations Conklin said.

He noted those connections might not be the 12-foot paths of pavement seen in the current trails; rather they might be neighborhood streets or sidewalks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vdGFsa2J1c2luZXNzLm5ldC8yMDIxLzEyL3JlYWwtZGVhbHMtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1ncm91cC1jb21wbGV0ZXMtNC05NW0tc3ByaW5nZGFsZS1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Real Deals: Investment group completes $4.95M Springdale industrial acquisition,"A nearly 100000-square-foot industrial property along southbound Interstate 49 in Springdale sold recently for $4.95 million.

(NASDAQ:JKHY) After Its Third-Quarter ...,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) shareholders because the company has just released its latest quarterly results and the shares gained 4.0% to US$169. It was a credible result overall with revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 both in line with analyst estimates showing that Jack Henry & Associates is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

Check out our latest analysis for Jack Henry & Associates

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a solid 8.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 11% to US$5.75. Before this earnings report the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$181 showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Jack Henry & Associates analyst has a price target of US$200 per share while the most pessimistic values it at US$170. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting Jack Henry & Associates is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 6.7% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 3.6% per year. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady in line with previous estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$181 with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.

Josh Jacobs isn’t the Raiders’ most vocal leader so his words tend to carry plenty of weight in the locker room.

The running back decided it was time to speak up Sunday after the team continued to exhibit many of the bad habits that led to a three-game losing streak last month and have had a crippling impact on its playoff hopes.

“It was before the game during the game halftime. A little bit whenever I felt like we needed it” Jacobs said of when he voiced his concerns during the Washington Football Team’s 17-15 win at Allegiant Stadium. “Sometimes I feel like you can’t always walk hand-in-hand with people. Sometimes you have to push them.”

Jacobs said it was more motivational than antagonistic but he thought a message needed to be delivered after another slow start more struggles on third down and another week of failing to establish the tone in a winnable game.

“It’s very frustrating” he said. “It’s annoying really. Starting slow every week I feel like and taking too long to be who we are. It’s definitely frustrating and I voiced that a little bit today.

“I feel like I have the respect of the guys so when I say something it’s not coming from a negative standpoint. I don’t really cuss at them and stuff like that I just try to motivate them.”

Jacobs ran for 52 yards on 13 carries caught nine passes for 38 yards and scored the Raiders’ only touchdown. But he wasn’t excluding himself from the laundry list of problems.

“I went the wrong way on three plays” he said. “I ran the wrong route or went the wrong way. They weren’t major plays that really made a difference in the game and I still gained yards on one of the runs but it’s just little details. That’s really the only plays I have on my mind right now.”

Jacobs said part of his message was expressing a belief that the Raiders have played down to the level of the opposition and put themselves in positions to lose winnable games. It’s a new experience for Jacobs who played for a dominant collegiate program at Alabama.

“I’ve never been a part of it so I don’t really know the answer to it” he said.

The issues are plentiful and long-term solutions are likely to take time but Jacobs thinks the answers might be simple.

“I would say practice but we work at practice” he said. “I think it’s just coming in confident in the game and not trying to be out of your character but really just executing the plays and whatever is called. … I think we just coast a little too much and that’s definitely frustrating.”

Even though the Raiders lost for the fourth time in five games Jacobs doesn’t think his message fell on deaf ears. He pointed to a better offensive line performance in the second half and hopes it can be something to build on though he admitted pointing out flaws is easier than fixing them.

Jacobs didn’t blame the play-calling of offensive coordinator Greg Olson but he didn’t necessarily endorse it either.

“All I know is I can control what I can control” he said. “I can control how I lead the guys. I’m not out there making play calls. It’s my job whatever he calls to make it work. That’s what I try to do. But like I said I feel like the guys come out slow and that’s everybody including me.”

Far too often he thinks the team has waited for something good to happen before getting amped up. And he’s sick of waiting.

“We have to have some juice or some energy or some type of swag to us” he said. “I feel like we come in stiff and dull in games sometimes and I don’t feel like it should take someone making a big play for everyone to take to that mindset of wanting to be on that. So that’s kind of where I was at with it.”

I don’t mean the literal mask he uncharacteristically wore at prime minister’s questions last week. I mean the metaphorical one behind it. It needs new metaphorical elastic because it’s been slipping and then being hastily put back for a couple of years now.

People don’t seem to notice though because the mask is so off-putting like a Hitler mask. Not Hitler that’s not fair. He’s never worn a Hitler mask. Neither has he in any broader sense pretended to be Hitler. As far as we know. If he has the footage is yet to emerge. He’s much nicer than Hitler. I mean that. He can quote me on it in his campaign literature if he likes. I think he should – it would be funny.

What I mean is that the image Rees-Mogg effortfully projects is deliberately repellent. He presents for most leftwingers and centrists and also a significant number of fellow Conservatives a nightmarish vision of Tory privilege. Not Hitler but still a massive turn-off. He proclaims himself to be a posh old fashioned entitled obsessively religious weedy nerdy rich know-all. Who would disguise themselves as that? So people conclude that it must be what he’s really like.

This is clever because it means that once they’ve got used to his eerie aesthetic they start to assume he’s honest. The very fact that he seems not to have bothered to come across as likable starts to come across as trustworthy. And then likable. What they first took to be a contemptuous demeanour gradually morphs into an aura of integrity. These positive feelings are all the more resilient for the fact that Rees-Mogg apparently hasn’t sought them. Unlike most politicians he hasn’t tried to make people approve of him so any approval you find yourself experiencing feels more genuine.

My attitude certainly shifted in this way particularly when comparing him with other members of the government. It became difficult not to feel that there was something more wholesome and decent about Rees-Mogg than say Dominic Raab or Grant Shapps or Liz Truss. I found myself tempted into the murky self-defeating realms of: “I may not agree with him but he’s all right really.”

Then in the autumn of 2019 he was on LBC talking about the Grenfell Tower disaster when something dislodged his mask for a moment. “I think if either of us were in a fire” he told Nick Ferrari “whatever the fire brigade said we would leave the burning building. It just seems the commonsense thing to do.” The implication that those killed in the fire lacked common sense for not defying the firm instructions of the emergency services during an emergency caused great offence and led Rees-Mogg to clarify: “What I meant to say is that I would have also listened to the fire brigade’s advice to stay and wait at the time.”

Rees-Mogg puts forward quite extreme positions in such calm and measured tones it’s almost impossible not to fall asleep

Is that what he meant to say? I have no doubt it’s what he wished he’d said but that’s not the same thing. He’s claiming he meant to say the precise opposite of what he actually said. I reckon he’s lying. Which makes it two slips of the mask: first revealing a pitiless contempt for people who’ve been killed and second showing the standard squirming dishonesty of a politician in trouble. Neither fits the profile of the paternalistic fogey whose heart is in the right place. Suddenly he’s just a spiteful liar with a creepy manner.

It happened again last week. In response to the startling fact that all five living ex-cabinet secretaries – top civil servants who served every prime minister from Margaret Thatcher to the current incumbent – wrote an open letter calling on Boris Johnson to strengthen the rules governing parliamentarians’ conduct Rees-Mogg was all scorn. “How many of those went off to take jobs in the private sector? How many of those got quite nice jobs once they’d left being cabinet secretary well-paid from merchant banks etcetera etcetera?”

He actually essayed a mild impression of Yul Brynner in The King and I while doing the etceteras such was his disdain for these former public servants’ gall in seeking further employment after leaving the civil service. I know this because I heard him say it on episode 68 of The Moggcast a podcast he does for Conservative Home. It takes the form of Rees-Mogg putting forward quite extreme political positions in such calm and measured tones that it’s almost impossible not to fall asleep.

It’s not reasonable to imply that former civil servants are hypocrites to question MPs for taking second jobs merely because they themselves took other jobs after leaving the civil service. It’s just not a fair comparison and there’s no way he’s stupid enough to believe it is. But throughout the podcast he is deeply sceptical about any institutions reining in MPs’ behaviour apart from “one great large independent body that judges whether what is done is right or wrong and that’s the British people”. So it is only to voters he contends that MPs and governments should be accountable. For the Tories that’s a convenient system. Keep 40% of the electorate on side and they’re guaranteed a big majority and can do whatever they want for five years.

Later though slipping the mask back on he piously opined that “this is in many ways a matter of honour as much as of regulation… I think politicians should want to of their own volition avoid those grey area conflicts”. But of course! We all think they should want to! But what if they don’t want to? Do we just hope that there are enough voters who hate sleaze more than they love tax breaks to stop a bunch of self-interested crooks commanding 40% of the vote? How do we feel that’s going?

Last week it emerged that the Commons standards commissioner Kathryn Stone was investigating Rees-Mogg himself. This apparently relates to £6m that he lent himself from a company he owns in order to do up his Westminster home. He says it’s fine. Labour isn’t so sure. But it’s another mask slip. It’s far too wheeler-dealery for the bumbling aristocratic image. More Philip Green than Lord Grantham. Nadine Dorries says he’s a fuckwit.

Editor's Notes: Heaven by Marc Jacobs has a monstrously cute fix for your holiday gifting woes.

The Marc Jacobs sub-label beloved by Gen Z partnered with luxury toy company Steiff to bring Heaven's instantly recognizable logo — a double-headed teddy bear — to life.

The result is a huggable two-headed bear embroidered with the Heaven logo on the right paw pad. Dressed in a purple tartan bow the collectible stuffed animal is complete with Steiff's signature ""button-in-ear"" tag.

If limited-edition toys aren't your thing the bear is accompanied by a T-shirt printed with the furry creation. A crewneck pullover features Heaven's spell-out emblem alongside text reading ""An animal by Steiff and Marc Jacobs. Forever yours.""

Heaven has quickly become a hot-commodity among plugged-in Millennials and Gen Z'ers who fervently buy and sell the brand's graphic-heavy pieces on platforms such as Depop and eBay.

In fact among younger customers Heaven's appeal has outstripped that of Marc Jacobs' mainline label.

Mining a slew of cult-y references including Sofia Coppola's Virgin Suicides and Gregg Araki's Totally F**ked Heaven is a brand for those who remember (or at least wish they remembered) the golden age of tumblr.

Names on Heaven's roster of recent collaborators include British boot giant Dr. Martens luxury shoe imprint Nodaleto and artist Katherine Bernhardt.

An Arizona woman accused of attempting to kill her husband by poisoning his coffee has been sentenced to three years probation.

Melody Felicano Johnson was initially charged with attempted first-degree murder and pleaded guilty to two counts of the lesser felony charge of adding poison or a harmful substance to food or drink in April.

Johnson could have faced a maximum of 2 years in prison for each count.

Her attorney requested the sentence be time served saying Johnson had already been in custody for nearly a year due to her inability to post a $250000 bond. Her sentence also included mental health treatment.

Judge Javier Chon-Lopez noted even the victim her estranged husband Roby Johnson had told the court he did not want Johnson to end up in prison.

The defendant’s husband told investigators he “believes she was trying to kill him to collect death benefits” according to a criminal report obtained last year by CNN affiliate KVOA. Roby Johnson said he first noticed a foul taste to his coffee in March 2023 while he was an airman stationed in Germany the document says.

The Johnsons were still living together with their child but were in the process of getting divorced. Roby and Melody Johnson’s divorce is still pending her attorney said.

Roby Johnson told detectives he used pool testing strips to determine his coffee pot “showed high levels of chlorine” and set up hidden cameras that reportedly caught Melody Johnson pouring bleach into a container and pouring the contents of that container into the coffee maker investigators said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d0b3AuY29tL2xvY2FsLXNwb3J0cy8yMDI0LzA1L2luY3JlZGlibHktc3BlY2lhbC1yYXJlLTE5MjAtamVyc2V5LXdvcm4tYnktd2FsdGVyLWpvaG5zb24td2hlbi10aGUtc2VuYXRvcnMtYmVhdC1iYWJlLXJ1dGgtaXMtbm93LXVwLWZvci1hdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Incredibly special’: Rare 1920 jersey worn by Walter Johnson when the Senators beat Babe Ruth is now up for auction,"A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up…

A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up its value.

A game-worn jersey that belonged to Washington Senators pitcher and Baseball Hall of Famer Walter Johnson is currently at auction. Heritage House which is hosting the auction says the unique uniform is over a century old and valued at $3 million.

Production Manager Mike Provenzale told WTOP in the 20 years he’s worked for Heritage House Johnson’s jersey ranks at the top of all the items they’ve ever sold.

“It’s one of the most impressive items we’ve ever offered” he said calling the right-hander “one of the greatest sportsmen of all time.”

Using photo-matching the auction house traced the jersey back to April 29 1920 when the Washington Senators defeated the New York Yankees 2-1 at the Polo Grounds. It was the first time Johnson faced legendary hitter Babe Ruth. According to Provenzale Johnson earned his 299th career win while Ruth was only able to get a an RBI off a sacrifice fly.

“Through that photo-matching you’re able to identify the exact moment he was wearing it and when you can do that and it’s an important game with a lot of significant notes like that that just really piques the interest of high level collectors” he said.

This jersey was gifted by Johnson to teammate Eric “Swat” Erickson as a retirement gift after the 1920 season. Provenzale said Erickson brought a ranch in New York and had a barn where he kept all his sports collectibles including Johnson’s jersey.

“Decades later his granddaughter discovered it in the barn” Provenzale said adding that she was the one who initially sold it to a private seller.

Johnson’s legacy added an additional element that makes the jersey extremely valuable.

Known as “The Big Train” Johnson helped the Senators win its only World Series championship in 1924. He spent his entire 20-year playing career in Washington earning a record of 417-279 with a 2.17 ERA. For more than 50 years his 3509 strikeouts were the most thrown by a pitcher in the majors. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1936 prior to his death 10 years later.

“He was the most dominant pitcher. He holds numerous records. He has the most scoreless games the most consecutive years leading the league in strikeouts” Provenzale said. “Essentially it’s him and Cy Young who are considered … the greatest pitchers of all time.”

Unlike modern jerseys which teams and players hold on to due to their value at the time uniforms were not seen with much significance other than being work clothes. The fact that Johnson’s gift survived is “a miracle” Provenzale said.

“Jerseys in that era were considered disposable” he said. “They were worn and worn and repaired until they could no longer be repaired.”

There is only one other known jersey worn by Johnson that exists and it is sitting in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown New York. Combined with the disposable nature of uniforms in the past it is unlikely that another game-worn Johnson jersey will surface Provenzale said.

“So if you’re interested” he said. “This is the opportunity to get it”

The auction ends on May 17.

Speaking on the second second season of the Netflix series ""Full Swing"" Johnson believes those golfers who were handed tens and some hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund are the ones who ""took the risk."" One reason is the criticism those golfers received from joining a league financed by a country with atrocious human rights violations.

Johnson who lives in Jupiter also wonders why those who remained on the tour — many turning down those multimillions — should be compensated if the two sides one day unite.

""No I don't"" Johnson said on the episode when asked whether PGA Tour players were owed compensation if LIV players returned to the tour.

""The guys that went to LIV we took a lot of criticism. We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously if this merger comes along there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.""

With no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.

PGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises' equity share plan. Large as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth according to the The Telegraph.

When it comes to legacy reputation and their safety Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.

Paulina Gretzky Johnson's wife revealed that the couple received death threats after her husband joined LIV.

""People sending death threats and awful awful awful things"" she said. ""People were aggressive that’s for sure. But that’s when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don’t need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.”

But financially … Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV while Johnson Phil Mickelson Bryson DeChambeau Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.

And many others will earn tens of millions such as Tyrrell Hatton who reportedly signed for around $65 million.

A seemingly ever-present topic of conversation in the MMA world is the topic of fighter pay in the UFC. But while that conversation primarily focuses on fighters’ show money win money bonuses and pay-per-view points there are other instances that don’t immediately jump to mind like likeness rights. And while UFC is primarily a fight promotion the company also has a longstanding licensing deal with EA Games to produce the UFC video game series. So how does that work for the fighters?

Well Johnson recently described the entire thing on his YouTube channel.

“One day I’m at home I’m playing video games and I get an email stating that ‘Hey since your likeness is being used a lot in the video game we are sending you a check’” Johnson said. “Now the very first check I got for being in the UFC video game was $25000. A lot of you guys are like ‘That was it?’ Guys think about this $25000 to just be in a video game. I don’t think Ryu [or] Ken has ever gotten a check for $25000. [It’s] $25000 for not getting punched in the face $25000 for just being in a video game because you people love using me as a character. So I was ecstatic.

“How do they dictate how much money you’re going to get paid? I can’t dictate it. You guys actually dictate how much I get paid by how often you guys use me in the game. When you log onto your game let’s say you’re playing offline mode or you’re playing online mode each character you pick it does a little tick and sends the data to the mainframe computer. That’s how they keep track of it. ... They do it for all the games out there because they want to see what characters are being played the most and what game modes you like the most. They’re always tracking your data and keeping all the analytics.

“I think that’s fair. It’s based on your popularity in the game. So if everybody and their mom keeps playing me I will get a bigger check.”

Johnson is widely considered to be one of the greatest fighters in UFC history so it’s not surprising that he’s a popular character choice for fans. In fact Johnson was so popular that he also served as the cover athlete for a specialty edition of EA UFC 3 which “Mighty Mouse” explained came with a little extra money for him.

“So let’s fast forward: The next one that came out was UFC 3 and for this bad boy the next check that I ended up getting was $12500” Johnson said. “Now it’s a little bit lower but I was OK with that because the timeframe of the checks was coming every year or quarter. I wasn’t too worried about it because once again it’s free money just coming to me.

“Now after I did something after my Ray Borg fight they offered me the opportunity to be on the front cover. That’s when they came out with the Icon Edition with me on the front. ... So in order for me to be on the cover I signed an agreement to be on the front cover and with me signing I got a whopping $10000 — $10000 to be on the front cover and it’s pretty dope. I love every bit of it.”

There are currently five iterations of the EA Sports UFC titles with the most recent released this past October. Johnson has been in all of them aside from the first even after leaving the promotion in 2018. Johnson said he has yet to receive his check from the latest edition but for the three version of the game he has been in including his time as a cover athlete “Mighty Mouse” revealed his grand total of payouts comes to just under $75000.

“Let’s fast forward: UFC 4 comes out” Johnson said. “I leave the UFC I’m not part of the company anymore but my character is still in the game and you guys are playing as my character. The next check I get in the mail is another whopping $25000. For being in a game! And it’s absolutely amazing because to me it’s something where your likeness is being used and I think it’s cool where the UFC or EA keeps on paying the athletes for their likeness and that people are using me.

“Now after all that from the first iteration of me being in the game in 2014 all the way to 2024 the total money I have made is a whopping $72500. I think it’s absolutely amazing for me to make that type of money without getting punched in the face.

Johnson was placed on the 15-day injured list during the last road trip due to elbow inflammation.

Pierce Johnson is doing well Brian Snitker said. He was scheduled to throw a touch-and-feel off the bullpen mound today.



No update on Tyler Matzek. He’s been shut down from throwing for a brief period. — Justin Toscano (@JustinCToscano) May 10 2024

Brian Snitker had previously said that they didn’t think the situation with Johnson’s elbow was serious but they wanted to get ahead of it. Johnson has been a key piece of the Braves’ bullpen since he was acquired at the trade deadline last season. Johnson has appeared in 13 games and has a 3.00 ERA and a 2.83 FIP in 12 innings.

Per Toscano there was no update on Tyler Matzek who was also placed on the 15-day injured list with his own bout of elbow inflammation. Matzek has been shut down from throwing.

Matzek missed all of the 2022 season while recovering from Tommy John surgery. There was initially talk of him beginning the season on the injured list but he showed enough during the spring to earn a spot on the Opening Day roster. Things haven’t gone well for Matzek though as he has allowed 11 runs in 10 innings across 11 appearances. He’s been hit particularly hard of late allowing six earned runs in his last three innings."

JPM,JPMorgan Chase,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNpYWwtcGxhbm5pbmcuY29tL25ld3MvaHVuZ2VyLWdhbWVzLW9uLXdhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWotcC1tb3JnYW4tZmluYW5jaWFsLWFkdmlzb3JzLWJyYXdsLXdpdGgtcHJpdmF0ZS1iYW5rZXJzLW92ZXItdWx0cmEtcmljaC1jbGllbnRzLWxhd3N1aXQtYWxsZWdlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hunger Games on Wall Street: J.P. Morgan advisors battle private bankers for rich clients including A-Rod lawsuit ...,"Wall Street banks compete ferociously with each other to entice star wealth managers with ultra-rich clients to jump ship and work for them. JPMorgan Chase allegedly brings that warfare in-house pitting its own financial advisors against its own private bankers in a Hunger Games-style competition for control over lucrative clients a new lawsuit claims.

Over nearly two years the bank wooed Gwen Campbell  a veteran advisor who managed $1.1 billion in assets for famous writers financiers and professional athletes at Merrill Lynch in San Francisco. One of her elite clients is Alexander Rodriguez who retired as an infielder for The New York Yankees in 2016 the Financial Times reported on Dec. 3.

But soon after Campbell arrived at the San Francisco branch of J.P. Morgan Securities now known as J.P. Morgan Advisors with her trophy roster in October 2020 she alleged she had to fend off behind-the-scenes attempts by J. P. Morgan private bankers to poach her customers who include professional athletes a Forbes 400 billionaire and the family trust of the billionaire founder of a private equity firm.

Campbell’s lawsuit filed on Dec. 2 in federal district court in San Francisco alleged breach of contract fraudulent misrepresentation and violation of labor and anti-discrimination laws among other claims. Court documents said she would “in the near future” begin mandatory arbitration as required by her employment contract. Campbell who still works at J. P. Morgan also filed for a temporary restraining order to prevent the bank from moving client assets out of her clients’ portfolios without her knowledge or consent.

Her lawsuit aims to pull back the curtain on alleged squabbling and back-stabbing inside one of Wall Street’s most storied banks as it tries to build a first-class wealth management team for the mega-rich. Campbell’s filing alleged an institutionalized “shark tank” in which more than 2600 private bankers  often through the bank’s secretive “23 Wall” unit tip-toe backstage to poach A-list clients managed by lodestar recruits to other bank units like Campbell. The efforts the complaint alleges end up cannibalizing what is touted as the company’s “ One Firm ” mission.

‘Hire and poach’

The complaint alleged that Campbell is “a victim of a hire-and-poach ‘Playbook’ that is known within J.P. Morgan to be a consequence of the internal conflict between” J.P. Morgan Advisors (Campbell’s unit) and the private bank. Private bankers the lawsuit alleged would solicit advisors’ clients with cheaper loans and insider access to deals and “siphon off” assets managed by advisors. J.P. Morgan Advisors is a tiny part of the bank’s wealth management division which includes roughly 4000 brokers at bank branches. It grew out of the old Bear Stearns wealth management unit that CEO Jamie Dimon acquired when he bought the fallen securities firm during the financial crisis.

Campbell’s lawsuit said that despite “explicit contractual promises” by J. P. Morgan that her clients “would not be poached by other groups” at the company the private bank began “ruthlessly soliciting her clients disparaging her” and redirecting her clients’ assets to the private bank.

J. P. Morgan quickly fired back. In a legal filing on Dec. 3 it denied that it had promised never to pitch private bank services to Campbell’s clients. “Maintaining the nature of a relationship is not the same as a promise to never engage with clients on new business” the bank’s Dec. 3 filing said. Campbell it said “shows no evidence that any of her clients have affirmatively requested to be excluded from any opportunities that the Private Bank or other divisions of J. P. Morgan may offer.”

In its filing the bank accused Campbell of trying “to extort a settlement.” Campbell it said had not lost any clients or net assets under her management and continues to “quarterback” investments for her star pro athlete client identified by the FT as Rodriguez. The bank called Campbell’s “frequent unresponsiveness to her J. P. Morgan colleagues” the source of “much of her frustration and confusion.”

J. P. Morgan spokeswoman Veronica Navarro Espinoza said in an emailed statement Sunday that Campbell’s claims “have no merit and we look forward to presenting the facts to the Court.” She added that Campbell “did not lose any clients while working here” and that “all our clients have access to our world class solutions platform and the choice of the advisor they want to work with.“

The 2020 Super Bowl party

What’s clear is that J.P. Morgan’s private bank makes concerted efforts to woo highly-paid athletes and celebrities wherever they are.

One technique according to Campbell’s lawsuit: Pay a star professional athlete to speak at conferences sponsored by the private bank’s sports financing group  and make payment of those $1.7 million in fees conditional upon the athlete opening an account at the private bank to receive them. Another method: Host a Super Bowl 2020 party (the San Francisco 49ers lost to the Kansas City Chiefs) at a star athlete’s home even though the athlete’s advisor — Campbell — is still at Merrill Lynch. The athlete whose name isn’t revealed invited Campbell to the event.

Jennifer Selendy a lawyer for Campbell in New York said in a written statement on Sunday that J. P. Morgan “recruited (Campbell) from Merrill Lynch last year under false pretenses froze her out of deals defamed her to clients and has been cannibalizing the $1.1 billion in assets under her control in violation of her employment contract.” Selendy added that “in the complaint Ms. Campbell describes an environment in which senior leaders at J.P. Morgan lure advisors like Campbell who have billion-dollar portfolios and bold-name clients with promises to support and grow their business only to systemically poach clients and move their assets over to the private bank.” Advisors Selendy wrote “have little recourse to fight back.”

Channel conflict on steroids?

Most Wall Street banks are plagued by so-called “channel conflict” in which different divisions of advisors (brokers) and private bankers all compete for the same customers even if they’re already clients.

J.P. Morgan’s private bank offers many services that overlap with those offered by the advisors’ group namely investment advisory and lending services. Because of the different ways in which J. P. Morgan compensates advisors and private bankers the latter have incentives to try to wrestle clients’ assets away from advisors and to the private bank.

J. P. Morgan typically pays advisors a salary plus commissions or share of revenue based on the products and transactions they arrange for their clients along with bonuses. Advisors who spend years cultivating relationships and building trust and goodwill with their clients receive commissions or shares of the revenues based on the financial products that they sell or transactions they arrange for their clients. Like its competitors J. P. Morgan expects its advisors to join with their own roster of customers.

In contrast private bankers aren’t expected to generate their own business from scratch. They’re typically paid less than advisors but can earn bonuses by bringing new clients into the private bank.

“Channel conflicts are really hard to mitigate because you have very large organizations where oftentimes the hand doesn’t know what the foot is doing” said Louis Diamond the president of Diamond Consultants a financial advisor recruiting and M&A advisory firm in Morristown New Jersey. “When you have professionals incentivized to do their jobs that’s what’s going to prevail.”

Phil Sieg  the head of JP Morgan Wealth Advisors which oversees the 450-strong advisory unit where Campbell works said last October that his division was overhauling what he called an “outdated 20-year old compensation plan” to resemble that of other brokerages. The changes include linking an advisor’s monthly payout to revenue over the prior 12 months instead of during a calendar year; doling out restricted stock to high performers and a new “teamwork inventive” that puts all advisors who work on a specific team on the same pay grid as the team’s most profitable advisor.

Wooing a star advisor

Campbell a Harvard Business School graduate began her career at Goldman Sachs and stayed for 13 years but left for UBS in 2004 to become a senior vice president. The lawsuit said she left because she disliked what she called Goldman Sachs’ “home cooking” approach to its advisory business which emphasized selling only Goldman-sponsored investment products to clients and not funds run by outside managers. At UBS Campbell built her business to nearly $900 million in assets. Campbell became pregnant with her first child in 2004 but because UBS tied maternity leave to disability leave she could either take four sick days or file for six week’s disability under California laws. And UBS’s internal rules banned employees from emailing or talking to clients or colleagues during those six weeks according to Campbell’s lawsuit.

In mid-2008 a fed-up Campbell bailed on UBS to join Merrill Lynch as a managing director in its elite private banking and investment group. The timing was horrid: Three weeks after she joined the company Merrill Lynch nearly collapsed due to the financial crisis and was bought by Bank of America. Still Campbell stayed at the bank for a decade and flourished with John Thiel then the bank’s head of wealth management installing her on the powerful “advisory council to management.” Her book of business grew to 40 trophy clients with 400 accounts holding $1.1 billion. Her team generated annual revenues of more than $4 million Barrons wrote on Oct. 21 2020.

J. P. Morgan whose Gilded Age namesake founder was 19th-century industrial and financial baron John Pierpont Morgan took notice.

By July 2019 the bank’s San Francisco regional director Steve McCashin persuaded Campbell to take all-day meetings in New York with senior J. P. Morgan executives including the head of banking and lending at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management (the division under which advisors sat) and David Frame the current CEO of the private bank. Campbell wanted to make sure that Frame’s private bankers wouldn’t try to poach her clients. McCashin reassured her telling Campbell that while private bankers “are often fueled by the prestige and power within the firm of having ‘ownership over relationships with high-profile individuals'” that conflict wouldn’t happen with her according to the complaint.

The courting increased. At the 2020 Super Bowl party Campbell met Mary Erdoes one of J. P. Morgan’s highest-ranking executives who encouraged her to ditch Merrill Lynch and come over. Erdoes is widely considered a potential successor to CEO Dimon.

It took more than a year for Campbell a single mother to decide to leave Merrill Lynch. She wanted rock-solid guarantees of no poaching. Her young son had health issues requiring frequent blood transfusions and home schooling and her young daughter was hearing impaired. Her Merrill Lynch retirement package based on 180–200% of her more than $4 million in annual revenues would fully vest in just two more years. The COVID pandemic had exploded in early 2020.

A ‘comedy of errors’

By June 2020 J. P. Morgan began sending her draft employment contracts. Campbell’s lawsuit alleged that it took the bank several stabs to get basic factual details correct including her start date and a “side letter” that Campbell insisted upon regarding no poaching and working from home. But when she started her new job as a managing director on Oct. 21 2020 her onboarding was “a comedy of errors” according to the complaint.

Her lawsuit said that the bank required that her signed offer letter be notarized something that didn’t happen until eight months later. A seven-figure forgivable personal loan — Wall Street’s golden handcuffs — that the bank gave her had incorrect dates. Still McCashin her direct manager was ecstatic. Campbell had brought over her tiny Merrill Lynch team and nearly all of her clients — an immediate infusion of $1.1 billion in assets and $270 million of loans. Kristin Lemkau the CEO of J.P. Morgan Wealth Management told Campbell that with her move she had brought in more assets in a week than all other roughly 450 advisors combined the complaint said. Rodriguez known as A-Rod made more money playing Major League Baseball player than any other player around $455 million according to spotrac.

Back at its Madison Avenue headquarters in New York CEO Jamie Dimon praised Campbell’s hiring as “important” for the financial institution which lags behind UBS Credit Suisse Morgan Stanley and Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch in managing money for the super affluent the lawsuit alleged. Still other senior executives including Sieg and Lemkau who oversees Sieg’s division said they were powerless or unwilling to stop the private bank’s incursions because they didn’t want to “risk the political fight” the lawsuit asserted.

‘Surreptitious pilfering of assets’

On December 15 2020 Campbell alleged that the private bank emailed one of Campbell’s star clients a pitch book of private equity funds. She said she wasn’t cc’d on the email.

The private bank continued what Campbell alleged were “high-pressure sales tactics” with Vince La Padula the global head of lending deposits and custody telling one of Campbell’s clients identified in the complaint as ""Pro Athlete Client"" and by the FT as Rodriguez that he should “drop Campbell’ and move his money to the private bank. La Padula separately told Campbell that she was “a no-one” and would have a “bad outcome” at the firm if she tried to arrange a loan for Rodriquez without “partnering” with the private bank the complaint alleged.

Upset and confused according to the lawsuit the client told Campbell about the “back channel efforts.” When Campbell tried to arrange a $50 million loan for a pro athlete client last May she alleged that she was shut down by unnamed executives. Meanwhile the private bank sent the client a loan term sheet. When the private bank’s sports finance group finally issued the loan last June it was weeks late and had forced the client to scramble to sell stock to meet a deadline to buy a minority stake in a sports franchise for which he needed the loan. Also bad: the loan was secured by assets under Campbell’s management. Campbell alleged that she had no idea what the loan’s rate or terms were because the private bank refused to tell her. In its Dec. 3 filing J. P. Morgan said that although Campbell did not work on the loan the bank nonetheless awarded her a 0.1% commission or $5 million on it — a figure Campbell alleged was low.

Advisors like Campbell are typically paid a chunk of the revenues sometimes as much as 50% on loans they originate for clients. Campbell’s complaint alleged the private bank would make nearly 50 times that amount on the annual interest of loan to the client.

Campbell alleged that she had complained to top executives about private bankers and Erdoes meeting with her clients. But she alleged she was told by one senior executive that Erdoes was “simply too powerful and the plan for J. P. Morgan Advisors was to try to survive until she was gone.”

It’s not a fun work environment right now for Campbell for sure. The irony: According to J. P. Morgan’s Dec. 3 court filing the last two months have been Campbell’s “best for revenue generation in her entire tenure with the bank.”

Didi Chuxing a $39 billion company that is China’s answer to Uber said on Friday that it would delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange. Just six months ago Didi was a Wall Street darling raising billions of dollars from American pension funds and international investors in a splashy New York initial public offering.

Those sorts of deals once fueled a three-decade relationship that helped reshape the global political and financial landscape. China generated heaps of money for Wall Street by hiring banks to manage deals like I.P.O.s. In return Wall Street gave China access to the halls of global finance and political power especially when it came to introductions in Washington.

Didi’s abrupt decision to leave brings home a stark truth for Wall Street: China doesn’t need it anymore. The world’s No. 2 economy has plenty of its own money and few problems attracting more from elsewhere. China’s friends on Wall Street have lost their sway in Washington at a time when mistrust of Beijing’s intentions is running high. And China’s leaders would rather keep tight control of its companies than open them up to investors on American markets.

Now Wall Street has become the latest area in which leaders on both sides are trying to weaken the extensive and complicated ties between the world’s two largest economies. And just as the alliance of China and Wall Street helped shape business in the past the way the two sides disentangle those ties could reshape its future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTEyLTA1L2hrZXgtdG8tb3Blbi1uZXcteW9yay1vZmZpY2UtdG8tYm9sc3Rlci1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXByZXNlbmNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HK Exchange Sets Up New York Office Amid Doubts of Hub Prospect,"Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. plans to establish a representative office in New York to market its offerings in the U.S. amid increasing doubts over the former British colony’s status as a financial hub.

Speaking at a reception in Lagos U.S. Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard celebrated the contributions of the private sector to the U.S.-Nigeria Commercial and Investment Dialogue (CID) in elevating the business climate for improved trade relations.

“The Nigerian and U.S. Governments use the Commercial Investment Dialogue as a framework for engagement with businesses and one another” the Ambassador said. “And while the initial round of CID talks has come to a close the principles of cooperation and dialogue remain strong between our two countries.”

Ambassador Leonard applauded the efforts of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission the Foreign Commercial Service of the U.S. Mission and the American Business Council for their concerted efforts in making the CID a reality.

“By listening to thoughtful and practical feedback from those engaged in the private sector our respective governments will continue to identify substantive and concrete areas where we can adjust policy for the benefit of businesses and the citizens who depend upon them” she added.

Participants of the CID focused on five priorities areas key to improving trade and investments ties between the United States and Nigeria: infrastructure agriculture digital economy investment and regulatory reform. Each priority area was co-chaired by Nigerian and U.S. business representatives who together led the policy discussions.

U.S. and Nigeria companies at the event included: Visa MainOne American Tower Corporation Coca-Cola Zenith Bank Kimberly-Clark Capital Alliance U.S. Soybean Council and General Electric.

The CID is a bilateral policy instrument focused on trade and investment between Nigeria and the United States. The first round of the CID commenced in 2017 with a signing of a memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and the Minister of Industry Trade and Investment at that time.

A ministerial-level meeting has held in Washington DC on February 4 2020 where the participating company representatives presented challenges opportunities and recommendations to improve the business climate.

NEW YORK -- Supply chain issues have plagued the United States for months causing scarcities of everything from cars to running shoes.

Now New York's bagel purveyors are starting to feel the impacts in a sudden and surprising development that has left them scrambling to find and hoard as much cream cheese as they can. All over the city bagel makers say a schmear shortage is threatening one of the most treasured local delicacies: a fresh bagel with cream cheese.

""This is bad. This is very bad"" said Pedro Aguilar a manager at the Pick-a-Bagel chain which has several Manhattan locations. On Friday afternoon Aguilar said he had only enough cream cheese to last until Monday.

New York bagel sellers go through thousands of pounds of cream cheese every few weeks.

The recipe for the beloved spread which according to The Kraft Heinz Co. originated in New York sometime in the 1870s is fairly simple: lactic acid pasteurized milk and cream. Many shops start their mixes with Philadelphia Cream Cheese a Kraft Heinz brand which arrives on huge pallets.

The pallets are not filled with the Philadelphia cream cheese found on most grocery store shelves: The raw product that goes to bagel shops is unprocessed and unwhipped said bagel makers who use it as a base for their own creations.

Without that base they said the spreads just won't taste or feel the same and customers will notice. But for about three weeks now dairy suppliers said the cream cheese orders they have placed with manufacturers have come up short.

""I've never been out of cream cheese for 30 years"" said Joseph Yemma owner of F&H Dairies in Brooklyn a dairy product distributor for many of the city's bagel shops. ""There's no end in sight.""

In interviews with owners and workers at about 20 bagel shops and delis across the city many said they were frazzled frustrated and rushing to find cream cheese after learning about the shortage in the past few days.

The first cracks in the supply chain started showing several months ago some shop owners said when they started to run low on items such as deli wrappers Gatorade and coffee-cup lids.

""It's been very weird things and always the same story"" said Christopher Pugliese owner of Tompkins Square Bagels in the East Village. ""All of us behind the scenes when you go into the shops we're all struggling to patch things together.""

Pugliese said he had gotten a call from his dairy supplier Thursday night telling him that the 800-pound order he was expecting Friday would not be arriving.

""I was like 'What am I going to do this weekend?'"" Pugliese said. ""Four people just told me they can't get me cream cheese.""

After calling four other distributors he said he finally got his hands on a case -- except that instead of the usual giant bag of cream cheese the box was full of individually wrapped 3-pound sticks.

Some bagel shop owners are taking their cream cheese scavenging across state lines. On Friday afternoon Frank Mattera an owner of Bagelsmith in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood said he planned to drive to New Jersey to pick up 2000 pounds of cream cheese himself.

Phil Pizzano a sales representative at Fischer Foods one of the largest food distributors in New York state said he had gotten hundreds of calls from panicked bagel shop owners over the past few weeks asking whether there was any cream cheese left for them to sell.

He has struggled to understand why the Philadelphia cream cheese coffers have suddenly run dry.

""You get answers across the board from every manufacturer"" he said.

Problems have popped up at every point along the supply chain that brings cream cheese from factories to the morning bagel Pizzano said including a labor shortage in the manufacturing sector that began at the height of the coronavirus pandemic a lack of truck drivers because of resistance to vaccine mandates and a scarcity of packaging supplies.

It remains to be seen whether the shortage will translate into higher prices or limits on orders several shop owners said. But distributors said they did not anticipate the problem resolving itself anytime soon.

According to Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones the robbery happened around 11 a.m. at the Kroger on Old Oxford State Road in Lemon Township.

Jones said that 58-year-old Derek Vauhn of Middletown attempted to take 87-year-old Pat Goins’ purse.

Goins said she was walking down an aisle to pick up one last thing when Vauhn suddenly approached her.

“He stole my purse out of the cart” Goins explained.

Goins said there must have been 10 or 15 people who ran after Vauhn into the parking lot. One of those who chased after the alleged purse thief was Deshawn Pressley.

“And he [Vauhn] ran right past me and I chased him down” Pressley explained. “He got to his car and everything but I grabbed him held him to the floor got him down. Did what I had to do until the police arrived.”

Goins said Vauhn never touched her and he just wanted the $60 she had in her purse.

The crowd made sure he apologized to the 87-year-old.

“They [the crowd] told him he better apologize to me. He said he was sorry he said he was sorry” Goins said.

Vauhn was arrested and charged with robbery and theft.

The sheriff stated his appreciation for Pressley and the civilians who stepped up and intervened.

Deshawn Pressley 27 was shopping with his family at a local Kroger around 11 a.m. when he heard screaming from the next aisle over.

An elderly woman yelled that her purse was taken and a man was running out of the store.

Pressley says his instincts just kicked in.

“I seen him run right past me and after I seen him run past me I ran after him” Pressley said. “God wasn’t letting me let this guy get away.”

Pressley tackled the suspect in the parking lot just before the would-be thief reached a running car and then Pressley held him down until police arrived.

The suspect 58-year-old Derek Vaughn spent the night in the Middletown City Jail and made his first court appearance facing two felony charges on Monday.

He was held on a $55000 cash bond for third-degree robbery.



His charges carry a possible prison sentence of six years total.

Pressley says he was raised by his grandmother Grace so it was second nature to come to the aid of an elderly woman in need.

“Elderly people like I have all respect for” Pressley said.

Pressley said he walked away with some minor scratches on his arms but that it was worth it.

Butler County Sheriff’s Deputy James Davenport arrested Vaughn. He says Pressley was incredibly brave since he did not know if the suspect had a knife or a gun.

“He’s a hero there especially this time the time we’re living in here” Davenport said. “He’s a hero there to get involved like he did.”

Davenport’s own grandmother died shortly after Thanksgiving. So he drove the victim home and took in her groceries.

Choking back tears he said the case had a special meaning for him.

“This kind of hit home. I was glad that we were able to get him off the streets” Davenport said. “So it was my duty to actually make sure she got home safely.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvd2FsdGVybG9lYi8yMDIxLzEyLzA1L3Nob3BpYy1qb2lucy10aGUtcmFjZS10by1kZXZlbG9wLXNtYXJ0LXNob3BwaW5nLWNhcnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shopic Joins The Race To Develop Smart Shopping Carts,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2021/12/05/shopic-joins-the-race-to-develop-smart-shopping-carts/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvd2FsdGVybG9lYi8yMDIxLzEyLzA1L3Nob3BpYy1qb2lucy10aGUtcmFjZS10by1kZXZlbG9wLXNtYXJ0LXNob3BwaW5nLWNhcnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVyLWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC8yMDIxLzEyLzA0L2toc2FhLWZvb3RiYWxsLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1yZWFjdHMtc3QteGF2aWVycy11cHNldC13aW4tb3Zlci1tYWxlLzg4NDkzOTcwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Social media reacts to St. Xavier's upset win over Male in Class 6A state football championship,"LEXINGTON Ky. — When No. 2 St. Xavier scored a 31-21 upset of previously undefeated and top-ranked Male in Saturday night's Class 6A state football championship game at Kroger Field it not only touched off a raucous celebration at midfield from St. X players coaches and fans it also put social media in a bit of a tizzy as well.

Male came into the game having not truly been tested for most of the season. In fact it was St. X that delivered the Bulldogs its most closely contested game in a 28-21 loss early in the season. But in that game Male went up 28-7 early and St. X scratched and clawed its way back to make it respectable — not necessarily a convincing foreshadowing of what could unfold Saturday night.

What a game! How St. Xavier rallied back to stun Male in the Class 6A State Championship

After that Sept. 3 contest Male went on to defeat its next 10 opponents by a whopping combined score of 420-65 while St. X had to eek out a few close wins here and there. That's the reason why few outside of St. X's players coaches and fans thought the Tigers stood a chance. In fact Male was such a heavy favorite that even some of St. X's own alumni were shocked at the win.

That wasn't the only social media reaction triggered by St. X's first state crown in 12 years. Take a look at what else we found in the Twittersphere.

Hundreds of fans could be found whipping out their cell phone cameras to record the St. X celebration.

More disbelief from Kentucky high school football fans.

That last play even dropped the jaw of our veteran reporter Jason Frakes.

And now the discussion shifts from ""can St. X beat Male"" to ""who's more deserving of Coach of the Year accolades?""

Of course whenever a private school beats a public school it triggers another well-worn discussion.

Jack Sivori walked away with Player of the Game honors and rightfully so. But this spectator's assessment of the element of the game that truly put St. X over the top is not wrong.

Gotta love some of the sentiment from the other side of the coin too. It's no secret that usually efficient and unflappable Male quarterback Nic Schutte was playing with an exceptionally heavy heart Saturday after his father passed away unexpectedly last week.

Schutte had a tough night finishing 11-of-19 passing for 250 yards and two scores but also two interceptions. He was sacked twice and fumbled twice recovering one of them. No doubt he won't use his personal tragedy as an excuse. But other on-lookers were more than willing to give the senior the benefit of doubt.

“When you get in games like this there are plays that you draw up on the board and they look pretty and all that stuff but it never fails these games come down to guys making plays and our guys made plays in big situations when they had to” said Coach Brandon Smith.

They certainly did.

WKU commit Caden Veltkamp passed for 295 yards and three scores including two TDs to Tyler Snell to propel the Spartans to victory. Snell who also led the Spartans in tackles was named the player of the Game.

Now that you know the player of the game let’s discuss the play of the game. It happened when South Warren turned a 3rd and 2 into a game sealing touchdown with 2:09 remaining. Veltkamp fumbled the snap but had the presence of mind to quickly find wide open Snell for a 31-yard TD. The 2-point conversion was good extending the South Warren lead to 32-19.

“I was pretty excited” Veltkamp said. “I knew it was a touchdown before we snapped the ball so I was excited to the ball in my hands. I picked it up threw it to Snell. Snell made a great play. A great catch and that really sealed it”

The matchup featured two of the top teams in the state. South Warren came in ranked 3rd in the state regardless of class while Frederick Douglass came in ranked 7th in our rankings. South Warren capped off an undefeated season against Kentucky teams with their only loss coming to Hendersonville (TN) early in the season while Frederick Douglass suffered only one loss a 31-7 defeat in the regular season finale against 4A state champion Boyle County.

South Warren (14-1) was coming off an impressive victory over previously undefeated Woodford County in the semifinals where the Spartans forced a first half running clock and Douglass (13-2) was coming off an easy 35-7 victory over Owensboro.

On the opening drive South Warren had a 35-yard pass from Veltkamp to Snell to the Bronco 22. The drive stalled on a tipped 3rd down pass leading to a short Eldar Dervisevic field goal.

Douglass answered with a methodical touchdown drive capped off by a 9-yard TJ Horton score. Horton had a 22-yard run and Samuel Cornett hit Jakari Cowherd for a 24-yard pass to help set up the score.

Veltkamp connected with Luke Burton who made the safety miss for a 49-yard touchdown to put South Warren back on top. The Spartans ran the same play last week against Woodford County with continued success.

The Spartans got constant pressure on Cornett during the next possession eventually forcing an errant throw on 3rd and 11 forcing the Broncos to punt.

Douglass delivered a big hit and Isaiah Kenney recovered Spartan fumble to set the Broncos up at the South Warren 37 but the Broncos were forced to punt after some deep shots came up empty. Kenney punted a beauty though to the Spartan 4-yard line.

Veltkamp engineered a 96-yard scoring drive highlighted by a 56-yard pass to fellow WKU commit Arvin Bell. After recovering two of their own fumbles the Spartans converted a 3rd and 20 on a 26-yard screen pass to Kobe Martin. That set up a 21-yard scoring pass as Veltkamp stood tall in the pocket and completed the pass to Tyler Snell who took a lick but held on.

UK commit Dane Key countered with a 73-yard touchdown reception on a short pass from Cornett to cut the Spartan lead to 17-12. The two-point conversion was no good.

Douglass forced a South Warren punt but the Bronco drive stalled on an offensive pass interference call going into halftime.

Veltkamp finished the first half 13-for-17 for 241 yards and 2 scores. The Spartans only had 4 yards on the ground in the half. They held the Broncos to 143 first half yards with more than half of them coming on the 73-yard scoring play to Key. The Spartans got the rushing game going in the second half though to the tune of 126 yards.

Ty Bryant returned the 2nd half kickoff to the Bronco 45 but the Spartan defense allowed no yards. Kenney tried a fake punt on 4th and long but the Spartans easily snuffed it out taking over at the Bronco 45.

The Spartans converted two fourth downs one coming via a controversial pass interference penalty. The drive was capped off by a Burton 1-yard 4th and goal TD run. That extended the Spartan lead to 24-12.

Another fake punt at their own 41 was stopped by the Spartans but Douglass stopped a fake punt by South Warren to take back over at their own 35.

After several defensive stands Cornett passed to Cam Dunn for 47 yards. That set up a short TD pass to Key to pull Douglass to within 24-19.

That’s when Veltkamp and Snell converted the crucial 3rd and 2 to go up 32-19 with 2:09 remaining. It capped off an 8 play 80-yard drive that featured an 18-yard Veltkamp to Bell pass.

Douglass quickly responded with a 53-yard pass to Key and a 27-yard scoring strike to Dunn. But the onside quick was recovered by Drew Givens for South Warren.

Burton rushed for a touchdown on 4th and 1 with 20 seconds left to make the final margin 38-26. The extra point was no good.

Douglass has ranked 2nd in the class for most of the season. The Broncos who defeated Owensboro 35-7 were seeking their first state championship in the school’s young history. The talented Broncos who have produced a pipeline of division 1 athletes (including several on the current roster) have suffered several near misses in their quest for a title. They lost to Covington Catholic 14-7 in their only other finals appearance back in 2019. Michael Mayer who now stars at Notre Dame was too much for the Bronco defense that year.

Last year the Broncos suffered a tough loss to Owensboro in the semifinals. After falling behind early they battled back behind Key but missed a short field goal in the final minute. That Owensboro team who was led by current Rutgers QB Gavin Wimsatt went on to lose to Bowling Green 17-7 in the finals.

“Really proud of our team” Bronco Coach Nathan McPeek said. “We had a great year. Our kids did not give up in some moments in the game today. They fought.”

The Spartans came into the season highly regarded. They held a 2020 regular season victory over last year’s 5A champion Bowling Green. The Purples won the playoff matchup last season because of several Spartan turnovers but South Warren brought almost all of their key players back from that team while Bowling Green graduated most of their main guys including Veltkamp and UK target Christian Conyer. The Spartans who have been ranked at the top of the Class 5A KSR Rankings virtually all season are certainly deserving champions.

South Warren a relatively new school who only started playing varsity football in 2011 now has three state titles. They won Class 4A in 2015 with a 36-6 victory over Johnson Central and defeated Covington Catholic in 2018 to win Class 5A. Steve Spurrier’s grandson Gavin was the quarterback of the 2018 title team. After taking a backseat to county rival Bowling Green (who won state titles in 2011 2012 2013 2015 2016 2020) South Warren is now the 5A team to be reckoned with not only in the city of Bowling Green but in the entire state.

“There is really good football out there (in Warren County)” Smith said. “I think that district is the toughest district in the state. I think that consistently the last four or five years you know two of the top teams in the entire state are in that district and it is a battle to get out of there.”

Smith was head coach for all three Spartan titles and also won two as the starting quarterback at Boyle County while playing for his father the legendary Chuck Smith who joined the Spartan staff as an assistant this season.

“He still has the most energy on the field” Brandon said about his father. “He has been a huge help. I don’t think we would have won it if he hadn’t decided to help us out this year.”

“We have all dreamed about this” Snell said. “Our senior year coming out with a state title and it happened.”

In a statement released Saturday morning the Tribe’s spokesperson confirmed the temporary suspension of the gamblinging app which will no longer any new bets accounts or deposits from Floridians as a result of an appellate court ruling made Friday.

“As a result of yesterday’s Appeals Court decision denying a temporary stay of the District Court’s decision on the 2021 Compact Hard Rock Sportsbook will temporarily suspend operations of its mobile app in Florida” Gary Bitner spokesperson for the Seminole Tribe said in a statement. “Account balances for all current players will be refunded as requested.”

On Friday an appeals court denied the Tribe’s emergency motion for a stay pending appeal in the sports betting case.

That came a week after a federal judge in Washington threw out the entirety of the 2021 Gaming Compact between Florida and the Seminole Tribe an unexpected move that brought the Tribe’s sportsbook operation to a halt. The compact effectively legalized sports betting in Florida both through casinos and online run by the Seminole Tribe and the deal allowed for new casinos to be built.

Bitner added that the Tribe will continue to work to appeal the ruling.

“Despite the decision the Seminole Tribe looks forward to working with the State of Florida and the U.S. Department of Justice to aggressively defend the validity of the 2021 Compact before the Appeals Court which has yet to rule on the merits of the 2021 Compact” Bitner said in a statement. “The Seminole Tribe of Florida the State of Florida and the United States have all taken the position that the 2021 Compact is legal.”

The Tribe is also facing a lawsuit from Las Vegas Sands which accuses the Tribe of “tortious interference with business relationships” including paying off petition gatherers who are part of the casino company’s gaming amendment campaign.

Sen. Jeff Brandes called for an investigation into the Seminole Tribe and its vendors on Friday after accusations it is trying to strongarm its way to blocking rival constitutional amendments. He issued his call after reports that the Tribe and its allies were paying operatives to bully intimidate and harass Florida voters in an attempt to stymie ballot initiatives against gaming expansion. POLITICO first reported the “gaming turf war” on Monday.

Christina Pushaw Gov. Ron DeSantis’ spokesperson said the Governor’s office is “… reviewing the Court’s perplexing ruling which certainly contains appealable issues. Because neither the Seminole Tribe nor the State of Florida are parties to the case it is unclear what if any immediate impact the ruling has in Florida. We look forward to working with the Tribe to ensure the future success of the Compact. We are of the position that the Compact is legal and we are subject to no court order applicable to the state of Florida at this time.”

She continued “I also want to highlight that the Seminole Tribe spokesperson said on Saturday: ‘The Seminole Tribe looks forward to working with the State of Florida and the U.S. Department of Justice to aggressively defend the validity of the 2021 Compact before the Appeals Court which has yet to rule on the merits of the 2021 Compact. The Seminole Tribe of Florida the State of Florida and the United States have all taken the position that the 2021 Compact is legal.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyb3RoZXJzLWJyaWNrLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzA0L2xlZ28tYXJjaGl0ZWN0dXJlLTIxMDU3LXNpbmdhcG9yZS1yZXZpZXcv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJvdGhlcnMtYnJpY2suY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMDQvbGVnby1hcmNoaXRlY3R1cmUtMjEwNTctc2luZ2Fwb3JlLXJldmlldy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LEGO Architecture 21057 Singapore Skyline [Review],"The official LEGO Architecture series since its launch in 2008 with a total of at least 54 sets continues to delight us after over a decade. The latest showcase is the continuation of the skyline series and a revisit to representing the Republic of Singapore with an expanded view of the city since the release of the Marina Bay Sands landmark building showcase. The set was built by Senior Designer Rok Zgalin Kobe and features prominent locations in Singapore from the iconic Marina Bay Sands OCBC Centre One Raffles Place Lau Pa Sat Gardens by the Bay Boat Quay and The Fullerton Hotel. With a landmass area of only 710 Km2 (270 sq. miles) and one of the most densely populated countries in the world Singapore hosts and a wide variety of unique architectures that reflect a spectrum of modern and century-old buildings. The LEGO Architecture 21057 Singapore skyline set comes with 827 pieces and will be available on January 1st 2022 for US $59.99 | CAN $79.99 | UK £54.99.

The LEGO Group provided The Brothers Brick with an early copy of this set for review. Providing TBB with products for review guarantees neither coverage nor positive reviews.Singapore is one of 3 city-states in the world. It has its appeal as a business hub and a city that never sleeps is clean green and one of the safest cities to live in the world. It’s an extremely connected country that has direct international flights to (almost) any major city in the world. The LEGO Architecture series is a theme that has a unique appeal to the residents of a given country and for travellers who have visited the location.

The unboxing experience

The Architecture series always had a serious undertone in terms of box design with the plain colours and dark backgrounds. This is the second set in the series to be released in the new theme layout after the Taj Mahal in adapting to the new brick motif template at the bottom. The light blue scheme matches the colour in parts of the building windows and brings it a bit more life and colour to the muted undertones of the previous designs. With the part count age and set number now as part of the templated design the designers have free play to inject a bit more designer fonts to adapt to the theme in this case a slightly more creative font rather than the standard block-ish looking text.

The top of the box is decorated with the outline of the skyline in bricks and a quote from the designer. The back covers an overview of the seven locations featured with photographs of the actual location by which it’s inspired.

There was a hint of disappointment when I realised that the box has now been redesigned as a perforated push tab which will surely ruin the box it was to be opened as intended. For the more serious collectors the ol’ sharp blade ninja slice the glue bits trick will do. I do stress the need to have a very sharp blade and a lot of patience. LEGO Architecture sets have always had a premium box feel just like the LEGO Ideas sets which had proper box flaps that allowed the sets to be taken apart and stored properly. It’s quite safe to assume that this will be a thing of the past and we can look forwards to more push tab boxes.

Five bags and the instruction manual are packed snugly within the box. I did notice that while typically bags in any given LEGO box are randomly shoved into the box this particular set that I received had everything neatly stacked and arranged leaving the crisp plastic bags almost in pristine condition.

The instruction booklet has a slightly thicker cover and back while the pages with a high gloss finish.

The first few pages turn to feature snippets and facts of the selected locations featured in Singapore.

The build experience

The base platform is uniquely shaped as opposed to the very familiar squared-off perimeter line when featuring a single building.

The flat placement of the base is nothing unusual yet a few unique pieces placed in the upper right corner left me curious about what’s to come. I’m calling out specifically at the 1×1 Round Plate with a horizontal shaft and the round plate with the bar handle. The rounded 1×2 plates are strategically used to hold the shafts at a 45-degree angle. One can be quite used to simple technics being used for angled buildings but these new approaches create an interesting build experience for architecture fans.

The plate is then levelled with various grey and green tiles and plates to provide the concrete base but leaving a single line of alternating blue hues with transparent tiles to recreate the Singapore River.

Printed Parts

This set will be unique indeed and something that fans will treasure with these printed textures to represent the facade of the buildings. The 3×2 tan bricks and the 1×2 are the parts that left me with some concern as the printed boxes do not seem symmetrical. Although the offset may be visually negligible here it can and will affect the visual tiling alignment of these parts especially when placed side by side to represent a taller structure. A quick glance at the 1×2 white brick at the top right shows that the print rolls off to the left edge whereas the other piece at the bottom right does not print to the edge and yet still not centred. Less obvious are the square prints on of the tan tiles.

OCBC Centre

The Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Centre (OCBC) is a 52 storey building designed by I.M. Pei has a unique build approach which instead of the typical stacking is built using a sideways approach. The innards shown below give a sense of the different approaches taken to achieve the curved sides of the structure. Two clips at the bottom of the build will eventually hold it in place on the platform built earlier.

The facade is complete once the printed plates are in place. The square-shaped windows and protruding button-like effect in the actual building led to it being known as the Calculator building in Singapore.

Boat Quay

The 1×1 plates stacked with the 1×1 slope and double slope represent the various buildings at upstream of the Singapore River as depicted by the transparent blue tiles. The printed squares are perfect to represent the entrance and doors or windows of the structures.

The Fullerton Hotel and Lau Pa Sat

The Fullerton Hotel is put together with the 1×1 plates and the 1×2 printed bricks. Lau Pa Sat is built in a hexagonal structural shape with the modified 2×2 facet tiles. The construct of these two buildings is uneventful. The Fullerton Hotel is ranked as a five-star luxury hotel today but was once the General Post Office and even a makeshift hospital during World War II. The LEGO representation for such a landmark monument is underwhelming and yet understandably at this scale there is simply no way to capture the desired details. From an aerial view Lau Pa Sat somewhat accurately shaped but once again the detailing is left to be desired. In 1824 when it first opened it served as a fish market. Today it hosts a wide variety of food stalls with a large variety of local cuisine to tickle your tastebuds and fill your belly. Not many would argue and some even stand proudly to say that eating is a national past-time in Singapore. Lau Pa Sat is one place to visit in the city centre that’s close to all the other featured architectures while enjoying a hearty meal.

One Raffles Place

The white building with frosted windows hosting commercial offices is built using a different yet same approach of a sideways built. Similar to the OCBC Tower two clips at the underside of the building holds it in place on the platform. One Raffles Place at 60 storeys and over 280 meters tall and situated in the heart of Singapore’s commercial district. It was the once tallest building outside of the United States when it was first built in 1986.

The clips slot into the round plate with the bar handle and stay secured and firm.

An unmarked building in white at the far right utilising the same 1×2 printed bricks for the Fullerton Hotel stands behind the shophouses at Boat Quay. This building is home to The Riverwalk private Apartments built in 1985. It stands about 103m tall and serves as a backdrop and silhouette to Boat Quay and is not called out specifically in any literature in this set.

Marina Bay Sands

The highlight of the skyline is none other than the Marina Bay Sands resort owned by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. The construct of the 3 towers is highlighted by the transparent blue tiles.

The build is constructed in a sandwiched approach with a selected piece of choice used to support the inner columns. The tower hosts two blasters at the top and bottom. It’s placed at a 45-degree angle to potentially strengthen the plates from having too much sideways misalignment. Once the two pieces come together.

Slightly repetitive the three towers share a similar construct with 1×2 grilled tiles at the back facade.

The top of the tower features 3 segments angled to fit the curve of the rebuilding. The blue bits represent the infinity swimming pool at the edge of the platform lengthwise.

Gardens by the Bay

The Supertrees are a showcase of the Gardens by the Bay featuring a horticultural attraction. These Supertrees harvest solar energy featuring sustainable vertical gardens and standing at the tallest tree is about the height of a 16-storey building. The final remaining parts are the re-colour hubcaps representing the Supertrees.

While the hub-caps representation of the Gardens is a clever approach it represents a structure that’s hard to imagine without any context if one has not visited Singapore. The actual imagery below depicts the actual Supertrees at Gardens by the Bay.

The completed build

The completed build is a colourful skyline is that should appeal to not only the masses but especially for LEGO fans in Singapore and LEGO Architecture aficionados.

The back facade of the set isn’t fantastic but it’s clean and presentable.

The imperfections

The printed parts do show some misalignment if you are extremely particular and seek absolute perfection.

The alignment also affects the printed tiles on the OCBC Centre. If you squint your eyes a little you’ll notice a faint line separating the bottom windows (on the left) whereas the panels on the right line up perfectly. There’s some visual testing and swapping of printed tiles needed for me to get this looking decently. I suspect depending on the prints you have you may or may not have these same challenges.

One frequent comment that I received from local Singaporeans and residents were about the particularity of the arrangements. Why are the Gardens of the bay placed in front of the Marina Bay Sands building? While in general the other builds showcased are spread out across the city centre in actuality the Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands are practically next to each other (separated by an expressway) and the gardens are located behind Marina Bay Sands and not in front as the LEGO representation. Not a deal-breaker but just feels odd if you’re familiar with the geography.

Summary

As someone who lives in Singapore it was a joy to see this set released and with the level of details presented in an Architecture skyline set. If you’re a local these are great as souvenirs for visiting friends or if you’ve been to Singapore and want to have something to remember the city by this is a perfect gift choice.

The build experience was unique with the new techniques used for the angles and shapes. While there were several imperfections on the prints it is somewhat acceptable when viewed from a given distance. These sets are typically displayed on a shelf or on an office desk after all. The colours and layout were well thought out at the given scale and the selected buildings and locations were instantly recognisable.

If you’re ever in Singapore the selected landmarks are a perfect way to get your itinerary planned out as places to visit so all in all the LEGO Architecture Singapore set is a winner!

21057 Singapore has 827 pieces and will be available on January 1st 2022 for US $59.99 | CAN $79.99 | UK £54.99.

That’s really calling a spade a spade since all forms of gambling (except the state lottery and horse racing on specified courses) have been punishable since 1935. Global gambling corporations and consultancies which include the international Las Vegas Sands and Szilaghi feel confident that the first legal casino will open in Thailand within the next two years.







The pro-gambling lobby in Thailand believes it’s a case of third time lucky. After the disastrous 2004 tsunami then prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra proposed legalizing politely-named “entertainment complexes” as a way of reviving the economy. But he was shouted down and had to admit it was a busted flush. In 2012 his sister premier Yingluck Shinawatra tried the same but to no avail. Relevantly His Majesty King Rama IX was believed to be strongly anti-gambling in sentiment.

What’s different this time is the Ace up your sleeve: the dreaded Covid pandemic which scares the living daylights out of government ministers and economists charged with raising revenue over the next five years. None the less opponents will throw the book at the idea of legalized gambling. Their arguments will include Buddhist moral principles institutional corruption the threat of family violence and even the possibility of catching coronavirus whilst coughing at the Blackjack table. The debate will be fierce and likely to go down to the wire.





Assuming the gambling optimists are right the first moves will be minor. Legal entry to casinos will be restricted – at first – to foreign passport holders as it is already in Cambodia whose ruling elite often holds dual nationality anyway. Not that the rule prevents ordinary Cambodians from getting in provided they grease the right palms on admission. Moreover the notion that legalizing casinos will abolish police corruption and close down back-street gambling dens is believed only by those totally ignorant of how these things work.

Even though thousands of women and men are fined every year for betting – usually for card games such as Pok Deng a form of Poker with many wild cards – gambling is well-nigh universal. Online casinos such as Lucky Niki and King Billy proclaim that there are no specific Thai laws against internet gambling and they have no problem accepting Thai baht via use of a credit or debit card. Police action is limited largely to raiding safe-houses and arresting the operators who are often Chinese nationals.







There are longstanding street rumors that certain hotels in Pattaya Bangkok and elsewhere already have fully-equipped casinos in secret rooms ready to remove the dust covers as soon as the starting gun is fired. Unlikely. The first casinos will be huge entertainment complexes – as Thaksin predicted 20 years ago – with luxurious accommodation cabarets gourmet restaurants and expensive non-gambling diversions to boot. Gambling in the 2020s has to be integrated and aimed at the rich. But what about alcoholic drinks being served if the pesky virus persists? The world’s only teetotal casino in the United States went bankrupt in less than a week.

With restaurants breweries and even an ice rink lining Water Street downtown Henderson has started to move past its well sleepy past.

Now one of the biggest homebuilders in the nation is looking to get in on the action.

Lennar Corp. filed plans for a 25-unit townhouse project on a 1.6-acre plot along Water Street between Basic Road and Ocean Avenue Henderson city records show.

Home construction sites can be found all over Southern Nevada. But this is the first time in recent memory that a national homebuilder has ventured to downtown Henderson signaling that at least one heavyweight housing developer is willing to gamble albeit with a relatively small project that people want to live in the burgeoning commercial corridor.

Downtown has gained momentum and the townhouses would be built by a big-name company Home Builders Research President Andrew Smith pointed out.

“It’s definitely a unique thing” said Smith who noted the World War II-era homes in the area are some of the oldest in the valley.

TSK Architects owner Windom Kimsey whose firm is on Water Street said he is “very enthusiastic” about Lennar’s project which would be built across from a small mixed-use development of his own.

His project Southend Lofts will feature three apartments and some commercial space.

Kimsey said downtown needs more housing which he believes could spark other businesses to set up shop in the area. He also noted that most developers downtown are smaller independent firms and that he has seen plenty of project plans come and go over the years.

“They’ll get it done” he said of Lennar.

Lennar’s project site is currently owned by the city. After the Review-Journal asked to speak with a city official about the project Henderson spokeswoman Kathleen Richards replied that an interview “would be premature” at this time.

Richards confirmed that the land sale is in negotiations.

She noted the developer is seeking a concept plan review which she described as a “courtesy staff review to provide applicants with feedback at a very early stage in their planning process.”

Miami-based Lennar closed more than 53000 home sales last year according to Builder magazine.

Lennar representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

Henderson officials have long sought to revitalize the city’s downtown where over the years foot traffic has been light and ground-up real estate projects have for the most part been relatively small.

But new restaurants have opened downtown other ventures have taken shape and more people have been heading to Water Street.

Lifeguard Arena the practice rink for the Silver Knights minor-league hockey team opened last fall and a seven-story mixed-use project is being built across the street.

Your guess is as good as mine whether other big builders follow Lennar to Water Street. Still for a corridor that long needed some commerce landing one is big enough.

He looks back fondly but she takes a more critical look at the ""doomed"" relationship.

After a tumultuous relationship with longtime boyfriend Lindsey Buckingham Stevie Nicks began a relationship with another member of Fleetwood Mac. She and drummer Mick Fleetwood — both in relationships at the time — began an affair. Looking back Nicks categorizes the whole thing as a mistake. Fleetwood however has a softer view.

Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood had an affair

When Nicks and Fleetwood met he initially didn’t want her to join Fleetwood Mac. He only wanted Buckingham for his guitar skills. Nicks however was part of a package deal and the former couple joined together.

While Buckingham and Nicks were still dating Buckingham briefly expressed concern that something was going on between Nicks and Fleetwood. Fleetwood said he had never considered it but the pair would become romantically involved a few years later. At the time Fleetwood was married to Jenny Boyd and Nicks was in a relationship with Don Henley.

“Eventually I fell in love with her and it was chaotic it was on the road and it was a crazy love affair that went on longer than any of us really remember — probably several years by the end of it” Fleetwood wrote in his book Play On.

Given the fact that both were in relationships the affair began on crumbling ground. Nicks knew it.

“I loved these people” she said of Fleetwood’s family in the book Stevie Nicks: Visions Dreams and Rumours by Zoë Howe. “It couldn’t possibly have worked out and it didn’t.”

They have different feelings about it

Eventually as Nicks predicted the relationship between her and Fleetwood fell apart. While reflecting in Play On Fleetwood wondered what would have happened if they’d made a better attempt.

“I wonder if Stevie and I could have made a commitment to each other and if our love would have grown or if it would have been torn asunder by the circumstances.”

He added that it will always be an “unfulfilled love” because they didn’t try to “make a go of it.” Still Fleetwood retains that love for Nicks.

“In terms of our relationship with each other we still have the same connection to this day; we just love each other in the true sense of the word which transcends passion. I will take my love for her as a person to my grave because Stevie Nicks is the kind of woman who inspires that devotion.”

Nicks does believe that Fleetwood was one of her great loves but she doesn’t think the relationship ever would have happened without cocaine and alcohol. She has a few more regrets about the affair.

“Mick and I would never have had an affair had we not had a party and all been completely drunk and messed up and coked out and you know ended up being the last two people at the party” she said for Oprah’s Master Class. “So guess what? It’s not hard to figure out what happened — and what happened wasn’t a good thing. It was doomed. It was a doomed thing caused a lot of pain for everybody led to nothing.”

Today Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood are friendly

Years after Fleetwood ended the affair he and Nicks are on good terms. She refers to Harry Styles as their “love child” and he worries about her spending too much time alone. They’ve managed to remain bandmates for decades. Though the affair was doomed it’s clear that the love between them still lingers.",,,

Will they be better than their predecessors?,"A new era of space stations is about to kick off. NASA has announced three commercial space station proposals for development joining an earlier proposal by Axiom Space.

These proposals are the first attempts to create places for humans to live and work in space outside the framework of government space agencies. They’re part of what has been called “Space 4.0” where space technology is driven by commercial opportunities. Many believe this is what it will take to get humans to Mars and beyond.

There are currently two occupied space stations in low Earth orbit (less than 2000km above Earth’s surface) both belonging to space agencies. The International Space Station (ISS) has been occupied since November 2000 with a typical population of seven crew members. The first module of the Chinese station Tiangong was launched in April 2021 and is intermittently occupied by three crew.

The ISS however is slated to retire at the end of the decade after nearly 30 years in orbit. It has been an important symbol of international cooperation following the “space race” rivalry of the Cold War and the first truly long-term space habitat.

Plans for multiple private space stations represent a major shift in how space will be used. But will these stations change the way people live in space or replicate the traditions of earlier space habitats?

NASA

Commercialising life in space

The change is driven by NASA’s support for commercialising space. This emphasis really started about a decade ago with the development of private cargo services to supply the ISS like SpaceX’s Cargo Dragon and private vehicles to deliver astronauts to orbit and the Moon such as SpaceX’s Crew Dragon Boeing’s Starliner and Lockheed Martin’s Orion capsules.

Start-up Axiom Space was awarded a $140 million contract by NASA in February 2020 for a private module to be attached to the ISS. Axiom announced Philippe Starck will design a luxurious interior.

Starck compares it to “a nest a comfortable and friendly egg”. There’s also a huge viewing area with two-metre-high windows for tourists to look out at Earth and space.

The first module is due to be delivered to the ISS in 2024 or 2025 with others following each year. By the time the ISS is decommissioned around 2030 Axiom’s modules will become a free-flying station.

Axiom has signed a contract with French-Italian contractor Thales Alenia Space which built close to 50% of the ISS’s habitable volume for NASA and the European Space Agency to produce its habitat.

But there’s more. Three other groups have just been selected for the first phase of NASA’s Commercial LEO Destinations competition to build free-flying space stations to replace ISS.

First a group composed of Nanoracks Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin proposed a station called Starlab to provide research manufacturing and tourism opportunities. This was almost immediately followed by a competing project called Orbital Reef by Blue Origin Sierra Space and Boeing. A third project by Northrop Grumman will be made of modules based on its existing Cygnus cargo vehicle.

But how are space stations actually used?

Less clear is whether the private space stations will be more liveable than earlier generations of space stations like Salyut Mir and ISS.

Typically older space stations were designed to meet engineering constraints rather than starting with crew comfort. What lessons have been learned to make life better in space?

Until recently there was little research that focused on the lived experience of astronauts on space stations. That’s where social science approaches such as the ones we are using in the International Space Station Archaeological Project come in.

Since 2015 we have developed new data-driven understandings of how ISS crew adapt to life in a context of confinement isolation and microgravity. We observe and measure their interactions with built spaces and the objects surrounding them. What are the patterns of usage of different spaces and items?

Asking these kinds of questions reveals information never considered in habitat design before. It turns out the crew don’t necessarily use the spaces inside the ISS the way they were designed - for example they personalise different areas with visual displays of items that reflect their beliefs interests and identity.

The crew also doesn’t use all spaces inside ISS equally. People from different genders nationalities and space agencies appear in some modules more than others among the 16 that make up the station. These patterns are related to the way work is divided up between crews and agencies as well as the layout of the modules themselves.

One big challenge of life in orbit is the lack of gravity. Objects like handrails Velcro bungee cords and resealable plastic bags act as “gravity surrogates” by fixing objects in place while everything else floats around. Our research is mapping how crew adapt these gravity surrogates to make their activities more efficient and how the placement of the surrogates changes the way different spaces are used.

Society and culture in space

Even with added luxury features like large windows designers and engineers have a long way to go to make space stations efficient comfortable and welcoming especially for the predicted space tourism market.

The plans for privately-owned and -operated space stations are undeniably ambitious and could transform how humans live in this environment. But it’s likely that the companies working on them don’t yet know what they don’t know about how people actually use space habitats.

Only by turning towards new kinds of questions and research from a social and cultural perspective will they be able to make real changes that can improve mission success and crew well-being.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvbWVldC1wcmVjdXJzb3Itc3ItNzEtYmxhY2tiaXJkLWxvY2toZWVkLXlmLTEyLTE5NzM4N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the Precursor to the SR-71 Blackbird: The Lockheed YF-12,"During its nine years of existence the YF-12 had slightly less than 300 flights of a total of about 450 flight hours. And it was thought to be one of the fastest jets ever to fly.

Here's What You Need to Remember: ""The YF-12 allowed NASA researchers at all four of the agency's aeronautical centers (Langley Lewis [now Glenn] and Ames as well as the Flight Research Center) to study the thermal structural and aerodynamic effects of sustained high-altitude Mach 3 flight.""

Before the famous SR-71 there was the YF-12 which emerged from Lockheed Martin in the 1960s. It had a short life and was never actually used operationally by the military but it did form the basis for the SR-71 which had a much longer life.

Only three of the planes were built. Two of the YF-12s were flown as part of a joint Air Force-NASA research program throughout the 1970s while a third one was lost in a fire in 1971 according to NASA’s website.

The jet was developed under Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson Lockheed Martin's vice president for Advanced Development Projects as part of the company’s famous Skunkworks.

“The project didn't begin entirely from scratch however” we wrote of the plane earlier this year. “In actuality the YF-12 was the twin-seat version of the top-secret single-seat Lockheed Martin A-12 and its design became the forerunner of the highly sophisticated SR-71 Blackbird strategic reconnaissance aircraft. Unlike the unarmed Blackbird which used speed in its defense the YF-12 was armed with three air-to-air missiles.

“The YF-12 allowed NASA researchers at all four of the agency's aeronautical centers (Langley Lewis [now Glenn] and Ames as well as the Flight Research Center) to study the thermal structural and aerodynamic effects of sustained high-altitude Mach 3 flight” the site said.

“Painted flat black the YF-12 was fabricated primarily from titanium alloy which enabled it to withstand skin temperatures of over 500º F.

During its nine years of existence the YF-12 had slightly less than 300 flights of a total of about 450 flight hours. And it was thought to be one of the fastest jets ever to fly. The plane claims a speed record of 2070.101 mph and an altitude record of 80257.65 feet both of which were surpassed by the SR-71 later.

“NASA and the Air Force announced joint involvement in a YF-12 research program. The agendas differed with the Air Force focusing on combat research and NASA engineers initially focusing on a study of flight loads and structural heating” NASA said on its website. “Much of the NASA research was concerned with the viability and development of supersonic cruise aircraft. Two YF-12As (tail numbers 935 and 936) were removed from Air Force storage for the program. On December 11 1969 935 successfully made its first flight as a NASA-USAF research plane and inaugurated the program. On June 24 1971 936 experienced the fuel line failure described above.”

The only surviving YF-12 is housed at the U.S. Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

But the factory of BAP Aerospace a chemical-processing firm in Tijuana hints at Mexico’s importance to global supply chains. These are components from tray tables to door parts for aircraft made by companies including Boeing Cessna and Lockheed Martin. BAP applies surface treatments to the pieces from submerging them in big vats of chemicals to meticulous work done by hand before shipping them north.

Mexico has long been a hub for manufacturing. Toyota a Japanese carmaker has had a plant in Tijuana since 2002. Honeywell an American industrial giant opened one in 2010. But increasingly the country is moving into higher-value processes. It now accounts for 3-4% of aerospace imports to the United States up from 1.5% in 2010. By contrast China’s share which was the same as Mexico’s a decade ago is now just 1%. American sanctions on China and tariffs on Chinese goods explain much of this change as well as rising wages in China and the difficulty of doing business there. The trend has accelerated recently. Pandemic-induced border closures increased freight costs and consumers’ demands for instant gratification have all nudged firms around the world to consider shortening their supply chains."

Janet Elaine Lowe affectionately known as a little ray of sunshine passed away at the age of 52 following her heroic 5 year fight against cancer.

Janet was one of nine children born to Ken and Norma Lowe in New Hartford New York. The family relocated to Florida and Daytona Beach became home for Janet as she raised her daughter and two sons. As a single mother Janet was determined to provide a good life for her children working extremely hard to do just that even if it meant at times to walk several miles to work each day. People were drawn to her kind and friendly nature and beautiful smile. Her years of working in the garden center at Lowe's was a perfect place for her to nurture her love of nature and gardening while helping others do the same. If she was given a choice she always preferred to be outdoors whether it be to cut the grass or carve her Halloween pumpkin.

Janet will be deeply missed by her loving family which include her mother Norma; daughter Sarah(Warren) Evans; sons Bristol Bouten and Jesse Jenkins; sister Lisa Biddix; brothers Christopher Marty Steven Douglas Bradley and Curtis Lowe and her devoted partner of 9 years Carmelo J. Laboy. Janet was preceded in death by her father Ken and brother Greg.

Rebecca Lynne Lowe beloved partner mother grandmother foster mother Montessori guide and scholar bird watcher found-object artist and finder of tremendous delight in any and all who had the good fortune to know her stepped into the great unknown on October 18 2021.

A lifelong Texan Rebecca distinguished herself early on as the president of the Pasadena Beatles Fan Club and as Pasadena High's Miss Personality Plus with a wicked first step as a drill team member. She arrived in the promised land of Central Texas for college and being a sensible sort stayed for much of the rest of her life. After studying art at Southwestern and education at UT she studied poetry with the Beats at Naropa. She was a smoothie queen at the 29th St. Good Food Store and a telephone operator and an apple picker. She was a middle school reading teacher at Murchison.

Rebecca became intrigued by the Montessori philosophy and practice while working as a bus driver and janitor for Austin Montessori School. After training as a guide at Texas Montessori Institute she led classrooms in Georgetown for over 25 years at Community Montessori School lovingly shepherding hundreds of children on their own learning journeys. Her career was honored with a dedicated scholarship and a proclamation from the Governor of Texas.

When Rebecca saw a need she met it. She established Catechesis programs in two local churches using Montessori methods to explore spiritual questions with children. She helped start the Samaritan Sandwich Brigade at Cedar Park's free medical clinic. More recently she was instrumental in starting the Windsor Park Neighborhood Association Scholarships. From a modest beginning of 4 recipients in 2016 this scholarship was awarded to 16 local students last year including many first-generation college students.

Through the years Rebecca found many friends: parents of her students decades-long book clubbers colleagues church members other dedicated daughters driving nonagenarian fathers to the Kingsland Senior Center Inside Books volunteers forty-year neighbors in her treasured Fisher Hollow the merry Ukeladies and more. A beloved dog once trekked across Houston to find her again: a miracle but not a surprise. Rebecca's heart was magnetic and generously sized and she was the welcoming center of a large chosen family. Each of us believed and are still convinced deep down that we were her favorite person. ""It's you!"" she would answer the phone and mean it every time.

She delighted in reading stamp collecting beach-walking and celebrating Fisher Hollow's cardinals chickadees bluejays frogs. She grew butterfly gardens and cacti in community gardens at home and in random front yards. She dawdled on walks to collect metal cast-offs from the side of the road later crafting them into unexpected and stunning/lovely assemblages. She had a gift for recognizing and sparking beauty in unlikely places. She was a light.

Rebecca is remembered and missed by husband Sam children Jesse and Cara stepdaughter Juniper and her husband Erik grandchildren Neko and Walter goddaughter Dana father Philip 'second son' Josh and a host of friends former students and admirers; as well as Buddy Willis who was without question her favorite dog.

The family would like to thank AGE BCRC and all those lovies who walked a ways on the path with her. We're grateful to Drs. Cline King Thatikonda and Dang; NPs Berry and Vu; and the kind staff at Texas Oncology and Hospice Austin/Christopher House for their care and guidance.

We will celebrate Rebecca on her December birthday and remember her forever.

Last month dozens of ski-mask wearing thieves swarmed a Nordstrom in tony Walnut Creek Calif. They blocked road access with their cars before proceeding to smash display cases and take whatever they could off of the racks then escaped to awaiting getaway cars all in matter of minutes. It was hardly an isolated occurrence for the upscale retailer: smaller scale organized ‘flash mob’ robberies hit two Nordstrom stores in the Los Angeles area a few days later. These came soon after similar thefts last month at Louis Vuitton Burberry and Bloomingdale’s stores in San Francisco’s upscale Union Square. Lululemon Athletica and Ulta Beauty have also been targeted by these groups while Walgreens has closed five stores in San Francisco because of the problem.

The incidents continued over the holiday weekend: Best Buy found itself in the crosshairs of ‘flash mobs’ at three stores in suburban Minneapolis over the Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday weekend the busiest of the year for retailers. The problem has led retail industry leaders to sound the alarm noting the threat to attracting and retaining the workers they desperately need to staff stores adequately as well as the feeling of safety essential to keep shoppers coming.

But the problem is not likely to go anyway anytime soon. The robberies are a tactic of well-established organized crime syndicates looking to replenish inventory of ‘hot’ goods they can sell on resale sites during the holiday season shopping rush.

“The people you see running out of the stores with their merchandise are actually people who are recruited by the criminal organizations profiting from this” said Ben Dugan president of the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail a trade group focused on fighting crimes committed at retailers. “There are tiers to it from soldiers to captains to crew leaders — the whole deal.” Just like the mob he added. The groups he leads has estimated that organized retail crime is responsible for around $45 billion in annual losses 50% more than a decade ago.

The crime syndicates typically recruit locally paying participants about $300 to $500 each in the case of the Nordstrom attack Dugan estimates. They might even provide them with the getaway cars. And reflecting the gravity of these crimes the ‘retail mob’ robberies are typically treated as felony crimes since they are planned events and involve the resale of stolen goods moving across state lines. In contrast someone independently shoplifting a tube of toothpaste for personal use is committing a misdemeanor.

And like everything else these days product shortages are playing a role in exacerbating the spate of retail flash mobs Dugan said. “I don’t think there’s any mistake that that happened before Black Friday and before Cyber Monday” he said. “I mean the criminal organizations that control the online markets needed product. And there’s a supply chain crisis right?”

A new source of worker anxiety

The problem has caught the attention of political leaders particularly on the West Coast where the attacks have been more concentrated and more brazen. “They’re not just stealing people’s products and impacting their livelihoods they’re stealing a sense of place and confidence” California Governor Gavin Newsom said while announcing an increase in funding to law enforcement to fight organized retail crime.

That sense of place and confidence is key to retailers in protecting stores which are increasingly important to supporting their e-commerce as they compete with Amazon. Target for instance relied on its stores for 95% of sales last quarter when including their roles in filling online orders be it a customer coming in to pick the order up or the store mailing an item to the customers.

“These mobs attacking stores suggest to people ‘I’m not going there.’ And if they were predisposed to shop online only this is a hell of a motivation to do that” said Columbia Business School retail professor Mark Cohen.

Retailers aren’t sitting idly by for the problem to go away. Target declined to quantify the potential hit to its business from organized theft or detail how it combats the problem but a spokesman told Fortune that “our security teams in every store are trained to maintain a safe shopping environment and protect against theft” and is in regular contact with law enforcement “on an ongoing basis to address organized retail crime.”

At Nordstrom a spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement that “we’re heightening our in-store security presence and implementing additional protective measures to keep everyone safe.” Best Buy’s Barry said last week that the retailer might put more items under lock much as drugstore giants CVS pharmacy and Walgreens do with items like razor blades. Columbia Business School’s Cohen however cautions retailers against turning their stores into fortresses or adding too many new hassles to shoppers who could easily shop online.

For CEO’s like Barry one of the biggest worries in this crisis has to do with attracting and keeping top retail talent. The attacks on the Best Buy stores sometimes involved people entering the stores armed with crowbars and guns Barry told reporters last week. That has frightened many workers who already had to deal with mask-adverse customers and the fear of being exposed to coronavirus. It’s all making it even harder for retailers to find and keep good workers amidst the great resignation and labor shortage.

“When we talk about why there are so many people looking for other jobs or switching careers this of course would be something that would play into my concerns for our people” Barry told reporters.

Best Buy has been just one of many large retailers in the last year to raise minimum wages in the war for front-line talent. (Macy’s last month raised its own lowest wage and sweetened the pot by promising employees it would help with college tuition and student debt.

“This has got to bring fear to both customers and store associates who basically don’t want to be in a position where they’re at risk for 15 bucks an hour” said Cohen.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Wes Ball’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes from 20th Century Studios the first Apes release under the Disney empire is looking at $21M-$22M today (which includes previews) for a what is looking like a $52M-$55M opening at 4075 theaters. Tracking saw it around $50M.

Also the opening is in the vicinity of the first and third chapter of the previous millennium trilogy: 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M Friday $54.8M 3-day) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M Friday $56.2M 3-day). RT Audience sentiment is still at 82%.

The rest of the top five is as follows:

2.) Fall Guy (Uni) 4008 theaters Fri $3.6M 3-day $14.5M -48% Total $50.5M/Wk 2

3.) Challengers (AMZ) 2609 theaters Fri $1.55M 3-day $5M -34% Total $38.3M/Wk 3

4.) Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Fri $1M 3-day $3.4M -48% Total $12M/Wk 2

5.) Godzilla x Kong (WB/Leg) 2531 theaters Fri $700K 3-day $3M -34% Total $192.3M/Wk 7

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3MvdmEtaW1wcm9wZXJseS1hcHByb3ZlZC0xMW0tYm9udXNlcy1zZW5pb3ItZXhlY3V0aXZlcy13YXRjaGRvZy9zdG9yeT9pZD0xMTAwODE1NjnSAXRodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9Qb2xpdGljcy92YS1pbXByb3Blcmx5LWFwcHJvdmVkLTExbS1ib251c2VzLXNlbmlvci1leGVjdXRpdmVzLXdhdGNoZG9nL3N0b3J5P2lkPTExMDA4MTU2OQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VA improperly approved almost $11M in bonuses to senior executives watchdog says,"Some have challenged having to pay the money back an inspector general said.

VA improperly approved almost $11M in bonuses to senior executives watchdog says

Department of Veterans Affairs officials improperly approved nearly $11 million in bonuses to senior executives intended for other workers a department watchdog said in a new report.

The money was recently allocated by Congress and intended to be used to recruit ""critical skill"" employees but ended up in the hands of senior executives in the VA's central Washington office according to an inspector general's report posted Thursday.

The funds authorized by the Pact Act were meant to be incentives in hiring and retaining specialists needed to process billion in new benefits for veterans dealing with health issues from being exposed to burn pits. Agent Orange and other toxic hazards.

The IG report said the money was paid instead as bonuses to more than 180 senior executives last year with several taking home more than $100000.

The average bonus paid out was over $55000 the report said.

The Washington Post first reported the results of the inspector general's investigation.

The IG said the improperly approved bonuses were due in part to breakdowns in leadership and controls at multiple levels of the VA.

The IG recommended the ""Secretary of Veterans Affairs or his designee takes appropriate action to determine whether individuals involved in the decision-making process ... had any actual or apparent conflicts of interest and develop a process to ensure all decision-makers are free from conflicts when awarding future incentives.""

When Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough in September ordered the executives to return the money most did or agreed to do so but 19 have challenged having to repay the bonuses the IG report said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YWxsYWhhc3NlZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL2ZhbXUtdG9sZC1ibHVlcHJpbnQtMTVtLW5vdC1uZWVkZWQtZm9yLWJyYWdnLWFmdGVyLTIzN20tZG9uYXRpb24vNzM2MzU4MTcwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FAMU told Blueprint $15M not needed for Bragg after $237M donation,"Two days after Florida A&M University announced it received an eye-popping $237 million donation President Larry Robinson notified the Blueprint board that the university was no longer interested in pursuing $15 million in additional funding for Bragg Stadium improvements.

The Blueprint board made up of all 12 city and county commissioners approved $10 million for major renovations to FAMU's football stadium in 2020. At the time the stadium was in such disrepair it was unclear whether home games would be played there in the 2021 season.

Last year FAMU asked Blueprint for $15 million more for Bragg improvements. The board in February denied the university's request for immediate funding but voted to explore the use of economic development funds rather than infrastructure dollars for the project.

Robinson in a Monday letter to Leon County Commissioner Carolyn Cummings who chairs the Blueprint board thanked the agency for the $10 million and consideration of the additional $15 million.

""However at this time we are withdrawing our request for additional assistance from the Blueprint Intergovernmental Agency for Bragg Memorial Stadium"" Robinson wrote in the letter obtained by the Democrat. ""We look forward to continuing to work with you the Blueprint Board of Directors and Blueprint staff in other ways going forward.""

The letter was dated two days after FAMU's spring graduation ceremony and surprise announcement of the purported nine-figure stock contribution from Gregory Gerami CEO of Batterson Farms Corp a little-known hemp company based in Austin Texas. The gift would have been the biggest ever for FAMU or any historically Black college or university.

But on Thursday FAMU put Gerami's donation on hold amid mounting questions about it. Gerami has a history of philanthropic overtures to other universities including Coastal Carolina University and the University of Texas at Austin that never materialized according to reporting by the Myrtle Beach Sun News.

It's unclear whether FAMU's decision to backtrack on its most recent Blueprint request was directly related to Gerami's would-be donation. The gift agreement between Gerami and the Isaac Batterson Family 7th Trust stipulated that at least $100 million would go toward FAMU athletics.

A FAMU spokesperson was not available for comment on late Thursday on whether the now-paused donation would prompt the university to reconsider its abandoned request for $15 million in Blueprint funds.

Sugar in your morning coffee or tea fuels your body.

And soon it may power the next flight that you’re on.

“This is a historic day not only for United Airlines not only for aviation but for the globe because this is an important milestone along the way to making aviation truly sustainable” Scott Kirby CEO of Chicago-based United said Dec. 1st before boarding a plane using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The demonstration flight was from O’Hare International Airport to Washington D.C. on one of United’s new 737 Max 8 jets. For the first time according to United a commercial carrier with passengers onboard was using SAF a fuel intended to slash aviation’s carbon emissions footprint.

“Climate change is the biggest issue our generation faces and our generation needs to solve. The implications if we don’t are potentially catastrophic” said Kirby who has made SAF a major priority for United.

The jet was loaded with 500 gallons of SAF containing sugar water and corn made by Virent a company based in Madison Wisconsin. The plane had SAF in one engine and conventional fuel in the other engine. Federal regulations allow airlines to use a maximum of 50% SAF on flights.

“In our process we’re able to take basically sugar water and run it through a refining process kind of similar to what petroleum is today except we’ve got sugar water going in as well as some renewable gasoline and some other things as well” said Dave Kettner president and general counsel at Virent a subsidiary of Marathon Oil. Virent is partnering with United Airlines and Boeing to produce SAF.

Kettner who joined Kirby on the demonstration flight said SAF can be used now in aircraft without any added equipment. He said it burns 35% to 75% cleaner than fuels made from petroleum.

“The fuel that’s going to be on the aircraft is what we call 100% drop-in sustainable aviation fuel” Kettner explained. “It’s dropped in because it’s fully compatible with today’s aircrafts and the fueling infrastructure and all the logistics which means that there doesn’t have to be anything new [that] is going to be done for aircraft.”

Kettner believes SAF will be a game changer in the aviation industry as it tries to become greener.

“I think it’s huge because it shows that the technology is there the fuel is there and it’s ready to go. What we need to do is make sure you know that the policies are in place that are going to help bring this technology to the forefront and give it the opportunity to actually grow and develop into something which is going to be good for everyone” Kettner said.

Kirby said using SAF is part of United’s goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 100% by 2050.

“We are a hard-to-decarbonize industry” he said. “We are not going to be flying big airplanes long distances with batteries. There’s not even a theoretical technology that does that. We’re going to be needing jet fuel to fly. We need to keep traveling and we need to do it … in a way that’s sustainable.”

Kirby said it will take an investment of about $250 billion by 2030 to get the aviation industry transitioning 10% of its fuel to SAF.

“This can be done but it’s going to require all of the partners” he said. “This can’t happen without the right government support. This is an effort that we can only solve together.”

This year United launched its Eco-Skies Alliance program with other global companies including Microsoft Nike and Siemens that collectively have contributed to buying seven million gallons of SAF in 2021. United says that’s enough to prevent about 66000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.

Illinois Congressman Sean Casten a Democrat in the northwest and west suburbs was also on the demonstration flight and said Congress should provide incentives for companies to develop sustainable fuels.

“We have the technology we have the tools we have the people we have the talents especially here in the Chicagoland area where we have all of these amazing businesses” he said. “What we need is the leadership. And the leadership comes at the federal level to make sure that we accelerate the deployment of these technologies.”

United recently agreed to buy 1.5 billion gallons of SAF from Alder Fuels a company developing ways to convert forestry and other woody residue into sustainable fuels. The airline also is an investor in Fulcrum BioEnergy a California company that is making SAF out of household garbage.

Earlier this year Fulcrum finished building in Reno Nevada what it says is the world’s first commercial-scale plant for turning trash into low-cost zero-carbon transportation fuels. And it’s planning to build more including one in Gary Indiana that Fulcrum says would make drop-in transportation fuels using waste from northern Indiana and the Chicago area.

Teaser of Marriott Bonvoy’s travel-inspired NFTs.

Marriott Bonvoy Marriott International’s award-winning travel program featuring 30 extraordinary hotel brands and endless experiences has teamed up with up-and-coming digital artists – TXREK JVY and Erick Nicolay – to create three Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Marriott Bonvoy will become one of the first hospitality brands to create its own NFTs and will unveil the digital art inspired by the travel program’s recent global “Power of Travel” campaign on Saturday December 4 at Art Basel Miami Beach 2021.

“We are excited to bring our extraordinary portfolio of hotel brands and endless experiences into this growing platform” said Brian Povinelli Senior Vice President Brand Loyalty and Portfolio Marketing Marriott International. “We continuously seek opportunities to defy what is conventional and with our entry in the digital goods space we are further igniting the transformative power of travel in the virtual world while supporting this growing community of incredibly talented artists.”

NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital collectibles that can be traded on the blockchain often referred to as the “key” to the metaverse. The metaverse is a hypothesized iteration of the internet supporting 3-D virtual environments through conventional personal computing. Each of the NFTs created for Marriott Bonvoy are an interpretation of travel from the artists’ own unique experiences illustrating how travel has an unmistakable impact on the human spirit.

MΞMORIED  created by Tarek Mustapha a.k.a. TXREK (Tarek Em) uncovers the magic envisioned from new experiences. Each destination provides its own adventure with each experience logged into a memory that adds to the previous one as if they are connected. The digital art incorporates Marriott Bonvoy’s path connector as a pathway to the magical journeys ahead and the peace of mind in staying at any of the approximately 7900 properties within the Marriott Bonvoy portfolio.

The Emotional Journey  designed by Jared “Jay” Richardson (JVY) was inspired by the ability of environmental travel to evoke different emotions whether seeking inspiration escaping reality or fulfilling one’s curiosity to explore. The digital art travels between three environments each expressing a different point of time – from the forest where one can feel lost and the utopia where everything is perfect to the futurism which conveys a postmodern reality.

The digital art travels between three environments each expressing a different point of time – from the forest where one can feel lost and the utopia where everything is perfect to the futurism which conveys a postmodern reality. THE EXPERIENTIAL IN BETWEEN developed by Erick Nicolay explores the duality between the curated elegance of indoor travel experiences and the awe-inspiring scenic exploration of outdoor traveling experiences with Marriott Bonvoy as the final destination. The digital art merges his appreciation for interior design and love for external nature only made possible through 3D surrealistic depictions.

On Saturday December 4 at 10:30 p.m. the NFTs will be unveiled at the FaZe Forever Powered by MoonPay event during Art Basel the world’s premier art show for modern and contemporary art. A countdown clock will draw attendees to the reveal of the NFTCODE where three lucky individuals will each win one of the NFTs as well as 200000 Marriott Bonvoy points.

Marriott Bonvoy’s global Power of Travel campaign executed several industry and company firsts including a first-to-market moment for a hospitality brand with TikTok the first to employ Pinterest’s technology and real-time trends in an out of home placement and more. Looking ahead to 2022 Marriott Bonvoy aims to continue building a presence within the metaverse and engage with consumers in an impactful and inventive way.

With valuations still sky-high by historical standards some investors might be hesitant to buy into the stock market. And understandably so.

But according to CNBC’s Jim Cramer there are still opportunities for those seeking value especially after the COVID omicron variant rattled markets.

“For days I’ve told you we were waiting for the other shoe to drop and it just hit today” he said this past Wednesday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 461 points.

Within that context the Mad Money host offered viewers four value stock recommendations. He even warned that if you wait too long to buy them you’ll probably kick yourself.

Here’s a quick look at Cramer’s group of ""obvious"" bargain-basement buying opportunities. One — or all — of them might be worth buying with some of your extra cash.

Disney (DIS)

AFM Visuals/Shutterstock

It’s easy to understand why Disney made Cramer’s list of beaten down values.

While the S&P 500 has climbed a solid 22% year to date Disney shares have tumbled 19% over the same time period and are off nearly 30% from their 52-week highs.

Theme parks and cruise lines still make up about 17% of Disney’s business so it’s no surprise that new COVID variants significantly hurt the stock’s investor appeal.

Meanwhile streaming service Disney+ added just 2.1 million subscribers in the most recent quarter its slowest pace since launching two years ago.

“Right now Disney’s being held down by the omicron variant and disappointing subscriber numbers for Disney+” Cramer acknowledged.

But he also said that the stock won’t stay down forever because Disney is an “iconic company” with the best franchises. Prior to the pandemic Disney consistently posted returns on equity around 20%.

PayPal (PYPL)

Financial technologist PayPal is another bruised behemoth with its shares having fallen 21% in 2021.

On the bright side PayPal’s core business continues to grow. In Q3 the company’s total payment volume rose 26% year over year to $310 billion. Meanwhile net revenue increased 13% to $6.18 billion.

“I know some sellers are motivated by PayPal’s not-so-hot chart” Cramer said. “I’m motivated by the fact that the stock’s down 131 points from its $310 high. Again it’s a buy.”

To be sure PayPal currently trades at around $182 per share. But you can get a piece of the company using a popular trading app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you’re willing to spend.

Mastercard (MA)

Credit card companies aren’t investor favorites these days because the return of COVID restrictions and lockdowns threaten to slow down international travel — and in turn spending.

Story continues

Mastercard shares for instance are off about 2% over the past month and down 9% in 2021.

But Cramer pointed out that the company is returning more cash to investors typically a sign of financial strength.

On Nov. 30 Mastercard announced an $8 billion share repurchase program and boosted its quarterly dividend by 11%.

“I don’t think Mastercard’s quite ready to bottom at these levels but it’s a lot closer to the bottom than it was a few months ago” Cramer said.

Wynn Resorts (WYNN)

Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock

Wynn Resorts is the most battered name on this list. As the owner and operator of hotels and casinos in Las Vegas and Macau Wynn shares are not only down 29% year to date but remain well off their pre-pandemic levels.

Cramer calls Wynn “one of the most hated stocks” he’s ever seen pointing out that the company’s current valuation is way too low given the value of its properties.

“I think this company could easily be acquired by an MGM or Las Vegas Sands — they know the physical properties and the brand are best in show. Believe me the insiders would be delighted to cash in” Cramer added.

Of course with COVID variants continuing to make headlines it’s fair to say that the concern surrounding Wynn shares — along with the volatility that comes with it — isn’t going away anytime soon.

If you’d like to take a more conservative approach consider building a portfolio of blue-chip stocks just by using your leftover pennies.

A real alternative

Picking stocks isn’t easy. Even investment pundits like Jim Cramer get it wrong — a lot.

If you want an asset that provides solid upside without the volatile ups and downs of the stock market consider fine art.

According to the Citi Global Art Market chart contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years.

Investing in fine art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultra-rich. But with a new investing platform you can invest in iconic artworks too just like Jeff Bezos and Peggy Guggenheim.

View the current offers here.

Heading to Asia is on almost every traveler's bucket list — and after being closed to travelers for nearly two years it might be inching even higher in your priorities. If it is keep reading — we'll show you how to get an excellent deal on off-peak flights to Japan Korea China and Hong Kong with American AAdvantage miles once they reopen to tourists.

Oh and don't be scared by ""off-peak."" For one thing winter can be an excellent time to travel with lower prices fewer crowds and mild temperatures compared to what you might be used to at home if you live in the northern half of the U.S. And — spoiler alert — American's definition of off-peak is awfully generous. You'll be pleased to learn that this lower pricing spans more than half the year including dates that are over school break making this a surprisingly easy way to save some points.

Remember AAdvantage awards originating in the U.S. are eligible for free changes or cancellation so you can book without risk even if your plans change (or borders remain closed). Flights starting from Asia do not have the same policy so you're better off booking a round-trip award from the U.S. to your destination rather than booking two separate one-way flights.

Let's take a closer look at this redemption in this week's edition of Sweet Spot Sunday.

Why it's special

American offers off-peak economy awards for 32500 miles one-way (with low taxes and fees) to Japan Korea China and Hong Kong. Every little bit helps when it comes to award travel and this is an easy way to save 2500 miles per person without having to lift a finger. Here's a look at eligible off-peak dates:

Though the awards are in economy many of these routes are often operated on American Airlines' newly retrofitted Dreamliners. Each seat is outfitted with in-flight entertainment and power outlets and because seats are slightly slimmer you'll notice a tad more legroom too. Plus compared to other aircraft 787s have better cabin pressure and more humidity which can keep you more comfortable and more rested during the journey.

For the same price you can add on segments in the U.S. on the same ticket for extra value. If you're used to sky-high cash prices from non-hub airports you know what a good deal this can be.

How to book

American Airlines makes these awards extraordinarily easy to book. The airline has a robust search and booking tool on its website so there's no need to search elsewhere or call for a reservation.

Step 1: Search for the flights you want

One advantage of traveling off-peak is that award space is more widely available than on peak dates. So go to aa.com and search from your home airport for precisely the dates you want to travel. There's a good chance you'll get lucky and find exactly what you need.

For example this search from Omaha (OMA) to Seoul (ICN) has economy space every single day in August 2022 (the price shows 65000 miles for a round-trip; the other direction is widely available too).

Step 2: Book your ticket online

It's always a pleasant surprise when booking is straightforward. In this case it's no different than purchasing any other ticket from the American Airlines website except that you'll be paying in miles when you check out.

You'll have to enter your passenger information and then enter your credit card information to cover taxes and fees (these are typically around $50 round-trip though the exact amount depends on your exact destination).

If you're not ready to commit — or if you don't have quite enough miles in your account— American lets you place the ticket on a brief hold. That buys you some time to get your ducks in a row or potentially top off your account with any remaining miles before confirming the ticket. This is a nice feature that most airlines don't offer.

You can choose to hold your reservation rather than purchasing.

How to earn points for this award

You can earn American miles with cobranded credit cards. (Photo by ImagineerInc/Shutterstock.com)

American Airlines does not currently partner with any of the major credit card transferable programs which means you need to earn AAdvantage miles directly. You may already have a balance in your account from flying or other partner activity including hotels rental cars or online shopping.

Otherwise an cobranded AA credit card is a great way to earn airline miles on every purchase. There are several cards to choose from including some that offer welcome bonuses for new cardholders who meet sign-up criteria:

Bottom line

Long-haul flights in economy aren't for everybody but if they work for you then American's off-peak awards to parts of Asia are a great deal. Not only are they easy to book but they include a small discount simply for traveling during the designated time of year. With dates spanning parts of all four seasons the calendar isn't much of a limiter either.

We don't know when all these destinations will open back up to tourists but you can book now and change or cancel without penalty later. If that's still more than you want to gamble bookmark this article and check back later when this part of the world is accessible again. We expect these awards to stick around as a sweet spot for a while.

Centenary Bank launches MasterCard Debit Card,"By Ambrose Gahene

Centenary Bank Uganda’s leading commercial microfinance bank on Monday unveiled the new MasterCard Platinum Debit Card targeting all customers who want to enjoy a smart convenience lifestyle especially those in the high net worth category who shop online and travel frequently.

While addressing the media Centenary Bank’s Managing Director Mr. Fabian Kasi revealed that the bank’s partnership with MasterCard is aimed at promoting convenience for its high net worth customers by offering them access to a legacy lifestyle where they will be able to make online purchases book hotels buy air tickets and pay for goods and services when they travel abroad using the MasterCard Platinum debit card.

Kasi remarked: “The partnership comes at a time when there is a fundamental shift in the banking industry and other sectors of the economy in relation to how services are consumed greatly influenced by the increasing rate of technology innovations and adoption through digitally driven platforms like MasterCard.”

According to the bank the High Net Worth customers will enjoy several benefits including higher transaction limits access to airport lounges discounts at selected local and global stores as well as online purchases and faster Visa application tracking among others. Customers will also have a dedicated Relationship Manager to support them.

Mr. Victor Ndlovu Country Business Development Lead East Africa at Mastercard said: “MasterCard is pleased to partner with one of the largest banks in Uganda serving a quarter of the banking population with a unique base of about 200000 customers who we believe are the right users of our card given our global footprint and the value addition that comes with using the Platinum Debit MasterCard.”

Ndlovu explained: “MasterCard provides a world beyond cash by integrating up to date technology with innovations that address the customers’ desired end result” adding that “Through several of our partners we provide great discounts on travel tour shipping luxury shopping and accommodation as well as giving higher card limits and daily weekly and monthly offers.”

DAVAO CITY – Opening a Land Bank of the Philippines (LandBank) account may be done online by Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) registrants.

No initial deposit will be required the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said.

Opening an account is voluntary but the PhilSys encourages registrants to do so to gain access to financial assistance from the government.

“The PhiSys registrants can download the LANDBANKPay a mobile wallet app to be able to get a LandBank virtual transaction account” LandBank said in its November 20 post.

The virtual account can be used for bills payment cash in/out fund transfer online purchase and linking of LandBank Mastercard prepaid and credit cards.

“Getting a LandBank transaction account is part of the goal of PhilSys for financial inclusion to speed up the distribution by local government units of financial assistance in times of calamities and emergency situations” the PSA said.

Aside from the virtual means PhilSys registrants may directly apply at LandBank kiosks located at registration centers by presenting a valid ID and the Step 2 transaction slip.

Signed into law by President Rodrigo R. Duterte in August 2018 Republic Act 11055 or the Philippine Identification System Act aims to establish a single national ID for all Filipinos and resident aliens.

The national ID shall be a valid proof of identity that shall be a means of simplifying public and private transactions enrollment in schools and the opening of bank accounts.

It also seeks to boost efficiency especially in dealing with government services where people will only need to present one ID during transactions. (PNA)",,,

SoB president Matt Gendaszek explained the origins of the group which predates the team itself.

“This is probably the most Philadelphia thing ever but it was three guys who got together at a bar and were basically not happy that Major League Soccer had overlooked such a huge media market and a city that’s got such a rich soccer tradition” he said. “They said to themselves ‘We should start a support group for a team that doesn’t exist and make as much noise as we can so Major League Soccer has to take notice.’ And what they did was they organized the group.”

Gendaszek said the SoB traveled around the city supporting soccer across the area attending college soccer and semipro indoor soccer matches eventually growing its membership to over 1000 diehard supporters all clamoring for Major League Soccer in Philadelphia.

League officials took notice when the group crashed the MLS Cup Championship in 2007 Gendaszek said.

“The SoB walked in with all of the other supporters groups that had teams and they actually just told the security `Oh we’re with the group from Philadelphia.’ We didn’t have a team!” he said. “And that’s what got the notice of our current owner Jay Sugarman. They said ‘Wow there’s probably a built-in fan base in Philadelphia. We should really consider bringing a team there.’”

Shortly afterward Philly was awarded its first MLS team in 2008 with play beginning in 2010. The SoB’s efforts to bring a team here were even turned into a documentary.

Since its inception the SoB has evolved from a gang ravenous for soccer to a legitimate 501(c)(3) charitable organization that holds fundraisers across the region for groups including ACCT Philadelphia Special Olympics Pennsylvania and St. Baldrick’s Foundation which supports childhood cancer research.

SoB members are a tightknit bunch and the bonds formed within the group often extend beyond the tailgates.

Philanthropy director Krystal Kane said she was floored by the outpouring of love she received from the group when her husband received a life-altering medical diagnosis.

“This past summer my husband was unexpectedly diagnosed with [multiple sclerosis] and so many SoBs reached out to both of us to check in on him offered to get us groceries and run errands and asked what they could do and really meant it” she said. “And on a much much happier note everyone has been so excited to welcome our impending new baby into the family once I have her next week.”

Kane said the community always steps up when called upon for charitable causes.

“I put up a social media message that I wanted to do a school supply drive for kids in Chester through the Bernardine Center and received hundreds of dollars and bags upon bags of supplies for the kids in just about one week” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uZWVzcG9ydHMuZ2cvdmFsb3JhbnQvdml2by1rZXlkLWV4cGxvaXQtY2hhbXBpb25zLWRlbGF5ZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vivo Keyd's Breeze exploit: Valorant Champions Group A matches delayed,"Update as of December 5 at 7:30 p.m. GMT+8 | 3:30 p.m. PT | 11:30 a.m. GMT: Riot Games will have Acend and Vivo Keyd replay their third map on Breeze at the start of Day 5’s group stage.

Acend was also handed a 7-0 lead to start the map on Breeze due to Vivo Keyd’s Cypher Spycam exploit. Vivo Keyd versus Acend will take place on December 5.

Riot Games announced that it will delay Valorant Champions 2021’s Group A matches in order to review the ruling against Vivo Keyd who used an in-game exploit against Acend during their match.

Riot Games announced that Vivo Keyd’s Jonathan “JhoW” Gloria violated Rule 7.2.6 of the Valorant Global Competition Policy by using a Cypher Spycam placement that is not functioning as intended on six different rounds during their Group A opening match against European squad Acend.

Riot Games’ initial ruling after Vivo Keyd’s exploit

Day 3 featured a Group A opening match between Acend and Vivo Keyd. The Brazilian squad won the first game on Icebox 13-9 and Acend answered back by securing Bind 13-3.

Vivo Keyd initially won the series 2-1 by securing the 13-8 victory on Breeze before Riot Games made its ruling regarding the team’s Cypher Spycam exploit.

According to the tournament organizers “The six rounds where the camera exploit was used will be forfeited by Team Vivo Keyd and granted them to Acend resulting in an adjusted score of 12-9 in favor of Acend.”

Acend was then awarded an additional one round due to the economic impact of the six forfeited rounds. This resulted in a 13-9 final score with Acend winning their match against Vivo Keyd 2-1.

Why is Cypher’s Spycam on Breeze considered an exploit?

Riot Games explained “The location of the camera allows the Cypher to see through the back of a small map texture that is intended to block the player’s view.”

Due to viewing such a critical location of the map Cypher’s Spycam exploits provide information that is extremely valuable regardless of whatever the camera sees players from the opposing team.

The tournament organizer also explained that match officials will only stop a match if an exploit is clear and obvious or if it is reported by a participating team.

Riot Games also added “Acend did not report the exploit.”

A few hours before the start of Valorant Champions 2021’s Day 4 group stage matches Riot Games decided to postpone its ruling against Vivo Keyd and delayed all of Group A’s matches.

Brazil’s Valorant fans along with notable pro players took to Twitter to react to Riot Games’ initial ruling of overturning Vivo Keyd and Acend’s match results on Breeze.

In fact the hashtag ‘justiceforkeyd‘ became one of the top Twitter trends worldwide after the initial ruling was announced.

Valorant pro players Shahzeb “ShahZaM” Khan Tyson “TenZ” Ngo and Taylor “drone” Johnson along with KRU Esports’ coach Rodrigo “Onur” Dalmagro weighed in on Riot Games’ hasty ruling against Vivo Keyd with varied opinions.

Initially brought back by NXT General Manager William Regal in November 2017 to restore order to the black-and-gold brand after weeks of commotion involving The Undisputed Era and rivalling parties the former WCW staple has since become a focal point of NXT’s annual calendar with 2021 set to mark the seventh and eighth NXT incarnations of the bout following one in 2017 and 2018 and two in 2019 and 2020 respectively.

In World Championship Wrestling the aptly-titled “Match Beyond” was originated as the signature match type of The Four Horsemen who were at the time the top guys in the company. From there the match was held a combined 31 times in WCW concluding when Kevin Nash Jeff Jarrett Scott Steiner and The Harris Brothers overcame the quintet of Booker T Goldberg Sting and KroniK on the September 4th 2000 broadcast of Nitro.

Since then numerous other promotions – from Combat Zone Wrestling to Ring Of Honor to Women Superstars Uncensored – have created their own take on the stipulation but none will ever be as good as the original.

The criteria for this ranking will take into account not only the in-ring quality of these bouts but also their positioning on the card the intensity of the story to justify such a stipulation and what the match led to in the immediate aftermath i.e. championship success the conclusion or continuation of the feud(s) babyface and/or heel turns etc.

Admin aside which NXT War Games match tops our list?

Team Candice Vs. Team Shotzi (2020)

This in no way required the War Games stipulation. WWE seemingly so desperately wanted this storyline to be bigger and feel more important than it was ever going to be but alas it flopped.

The match was a spotfest and not the good kind. It was the kind that bombards the viewer with spot after spot needlessly performing recklessly for thirty-five straight minutes. This isn’t due to the competitors involved either but rather WWE’s insistence on having a minimum of two of every big gimmick match a year.

There was very little of a story to warrant this with Toni Storm having turned heel while feigning saving a downed Ember Moon from Candice LeRae Dakota Kai Raquel Gonzalez and Indi Hartwell. Members of Shotzi Blackheart‘s squad were determined through backstage segments (in Rhea Ripley and Ember Moon’s cases) while Io Shirai joined during a heated brawl against LeRae’s team. Essentially she was joined by the trio because she needed a squad of four.

Just one year on you forget this match even happened. The Undisputed Era vs. Pat McAfee’s team was a far more memorable bout overshadowing this by a great amount. Had it not been for Io Shirai’s famed cage dive with a bin over her head then all memory of this match would have been erased.

Given that Candice – who at the time was on the verge of greatness alongside Johnny Gargano Indi Hartwell and Austin Theory in The Way – suffered a serious arm injury from a spot perhaps she too wishes the match could be erased from memory.

The Undisputed Era Vs. Team Ciampa (2019)

This tried too hard.

NXT TakeOver: War Games 2019 was promoted just under two months following the launch of All Elite Wrestling’s new weekly show Dynamite so the Wednesday Night Wars were in full swing. NXT was doing fine as a weekly product but it was slowly becoming obvious that the brand was trying to achieve too much to combat their newfound competition.

Technically speaking the match was fun which was no surprise given that all eight involved had prior experience in high-level independent promotions (Ring Of Honor Pro Wrestling Guerrilla et al). The spots that occurred while too rushed and not spaced out enough were often delightful sequences and the match at least followed some sort of structure; The Undisputed Era wore down each member of Team Ciampa when they had the numbers advantage concluding with the shock arrival of Kevin Owens.

The setup itself was awful. Keith Lee and Matt Riddle had been saved from a post-match Undisputed Era attack leading to Tommaso Ciampa saving them. War Games was scheduled without a complete Team Ciampa lineup which at least provided that shock factor but the whole point of War Games should be that everyone involved is in this huge feud that can only be resolved by entering the “Match Beyond”.

Then Riddle was removed as he was set to face Finn Balor instead. Dominik Dijakovic took his spot for no reason other than that he was a semi-big deal in NXT at the time.

It simply did too much too soon after AEW Dynamite’s launch. It was increasingly obvious that this was a ploy to get a win over the Tony Khan-helmed promotion which hampered the match’s overall presentation.

The match-ending manoeuvre for example in which Tommaso Ciampa gave Adam Cole an Air Raid Crash off the cage and through two tables below was sublime and deserves all the props thrown its way but was it needed? Cole and Johnny Gargano had just performed a similar sequence in their NXT TakeOver: Toronto II clash three months beforehand.

In the months following Cole and Ciampa waged war over the NXT Championship as Keith Lee and Dominik Dijakovic did over the North American Championship but this felt like a case of War Games happening for the sake of having War Games. WWE somehow fails to understand that they don’t always have to have a men’s and women’s version of a certain stipulation. It works for the Royal Rumble but thus far it hasn’t for War Games.

The Undisputed Era Vs. The War Raiders Ricochet & Pete Dunne (2018)

It’s just as well really that the match itself was superb in 2018 as there wasn’t much of a story to justify the use of the War Games stipulation.

Like The Undisputed Era vs. Team Ciampa 2018’s War Games outing happened for no reason other than WWE had to find a use for the absurdly long steel mesh structure; Pete Dunne’s inclusion for example felt particularly random with the only logic behind it being that he Ricochet and Adam Cole had contested the North American Championship not long before this.

Ricochet was the real star here. His and Adam Cole’s generational North American Championship match from TakeOver: Brooklyn IV was revisited slightly in the early opening with Cole catching the ex-Lucha Underground Champion mid-flight with a Backstabber. Other Ricochet-related highlights included him flying between the two rings and executing his inaugural double-rotation Moonsault in WWE doing so off the top of the cage.

Not much else of note happened though.

A big Tower of Doom off the cage preceded the aforementioned double Moonsault. Hanson flattened Kyle O’Reilly through a table. A staredown between the two quartets one in each ring provided a visual reminiscent of the late-’80s War Games matches.

That’s all really. In-ring-wise – and given the star quality involved – this was a letdown.

The finish saw Pete Dunne hit a Bitter End on Adam Cole followed closely by a springboard 450 splash from Ricochet for the double pinfall victory. At this stage in the history of NXT TakeOver main events that traditionally would have been a mid-match near-fall for a huge cheer rather than the actual ending. It didn’t quite work here though the remainder of the match was solid.

It just suffered from a lack of story development. Bobby Fish locking Pete Dunne in the shark cage would have sufficed had it been Dunne and a partner who captured the NXT Tag Team Championships from Fish and Kyle O’Reilly and not The War Raiders.

The Undisputed Era Vs. SAnitY Vs. The Authors Of Pain & Roderick Strong (2017)

The first War Games match under the NXT banner The Undisputed Era SAnitY and the trio of The Authors of Pain and Roderick Strong served as a means of breaking the match back in.

Presumably WWE officials used this almost as a beta test. Is there interest from the audience in seeing the dual-cage stipulation featured once more as a yearly event? Does it work in the NXT brand? Had they chosen the right competitors for their maiden voyage?

Ticks to all of these questions. It ruled and it ruled hard with the story justifying the stipulation’s revival. The nine men involved had been butting heads effectively since the prior August’s NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III where Adam Cole debuted and formed The Undisputed Era while SAnitY captured the NXT Tag Team Championships from Akam and Rezar. William Regal legitimately had no other choice without leaving NXT a chaotic mess.

In this instance the big attraction spots weren’t spammed. You had a stereo Tower of Doom spot Roderick Strong’s superplex from atop the cage and Alexander Wolfe‘s top-rope German suplex through a table but nothing as memorable as we’ve now become accustomed to. This was to be expected. It may have been NXT’s sole attempt at nailing the War Games stipulation so while you’d traditionally want to go all out to impress those watching you had to be mindful of not exciting viewers too much or else they’d expect the same thing on a yearly basis.

Adam Cole’s chair-assisted Shining Wizard ultimately put Eric Young down for the count serving well as a decisive albeit out-of-nowhere match-ender. The right winners unquestionably given Bobby Fish and Kyle O’Reilly would win SAnitY’s tag straps just weeks later but they could have – and perhaps should have – created a more enticing closing sequence.

Overall the match was fun engaging for the viewer and did War Games justice in its revival. In hindsight though it just could have went that extra bit further seeing as it wasn’t going to be a one and done deal.

The Undisputed Era Vs. Team McAfee (2020)

Really this is the only NXT War Games match thus far where every wrestler’s participation in the match was justified. This was a legitimate gang warfare situation; no entrants were added just to have even teams.

The Undisputed Era and Pat McAfee’s group had real heated on-screen beef that could only be resolved in War Games.

Not only had Adam Cole and Pat McAfee wrestled a banger of a singles match at the previous August’s NXT TakeOver 30 but this was came about after it was rumoured The Undisputed Era would be splitting up. Kyle O’Reilly had been getting a slight singles push away from the group challenging Finn Balor for the NXT Championship at NXT TakeOver 31 while Bobby Fish had been injured. This was The Undisputed Era’s first – and subsequently last – match back as a united quartet.

It was wrestled near-perfectly. The opening flurry between Pete Dunne and Kyle O’Reilly was a masterclass in technical wrestling and as each other entrant came into the cage the match quality only improved.

Pat McAfee stole the show without question though Moonsaulting through a table not long after entering and then taking a series of insane bumps thereafter. His somersault dive off the cage in the same vein as Io Shirai’s cage dive from earlier in the evening was an important fixture of NXT’s output of content throughout the pandemic. Additionally his selling of Adam Cole’s Panama Sunrise was beautiful.

Kyle O’Reilly pinning Oney Lorcan worked wonderfully as a finish too given what followed over the following few months while Roderick Strong stomping on Pete Dunne’s back to interrupt a pin was a subtle yet outstanding callback to “The Messiah of the Backbreaker” initially joining The Undisputed Era at NXT TakeOver: New Orleans.

Both Bobby Fish and Oney Lorcan ended up injured with Fish being absent for Adam Cole’s heel turn on Kyle O’Reilly the following February. Luckily these injuries were nothing too serious and instead acted as a means of putting over the sheer danger of participating in the War Games structure.

Team Ripley Vs. Team Baszler (2019)

Not only did Rhea Ripley‘s team vs. Shayna Baszler’s team make history at the 2019 NXT TakeOver: War Games it did so in remarkable fashion.

The match was signed because Ripley and Baszler had been engaged in a war over the latter’s NXT Women’s Championship. This wasn’t a story of gang warfare you see hence why both “The Nightmare” and “The Queen of Spades” were asked to each pick three partners. They chose Candice LeRae Tegan Nox and Mia Yim and Bianca Belair Io Shirai and Kay Lee Ray respectively so even then there was a bonus feud interjected between LeRae and Shirai.

As a match though it was sublime from start to end. It was inarguably one of the greatest cases of WWE’s first-time-ever-for-the-women moments to date.

Effectively everything worked. Dakota Kai’s legendary heel turn on Tegan Nox – after she’d already mysteriously ambushed Mia Yim backstage leading to her replacing the former RECKONING – was matched effortlessly by the incandescent brutality – pun very much intended – of Rhea Ripley who entered and almost instantaneously dropped Bianca Belair face-first on a trash can with such impact. It was a simplistic spot that worked tremendously well.

Furthermore the likes of Io Shirai and Kay Lee Ray using the dual-ring setup to their high-flying advantage was a superlative addition; the former’s Moonsault off the cage onto both Bianca Belair and Candice LeRae remains an iconic part of modern NXT history.

That Rhea pinned Shayna off a Riptide across two chairs was the correct ending. It took nothing away from her ultimate NXT Women’s Championship capture a few weeks thereafter either. It merely added to the excitement on a weekend that turned Rhea Ripley into a megastar. Her Survivor Series performance the next night was just as amazing as was the ensuing Dakota Kai vs. Tegan Nox feud.

All in all this was a rare moment of WWE getting a match its setup and its aftermath almost entirely correct.

NXT 2.0 WarGames takes place on Sunday 5 December airing live on the WWE Network and Peacock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdHdvcmRvbnNwb3J0cy5jb20vcHJvd3Jlc3RsaW5nLzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvbnh0LXdhcmdhbWVzLXByZXZpZXctcHJlZGljdGlvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NXT WarGames (12/5/21) Preview and Predictions Featuring Both WarGames Matches,"It’s time for one of wrestling fans’ most favorite events of the year: WarGames! When NXT 2.0 was announced I was very nervous the annual highlight would be done away with but I am happy this was grandfathered over. Fun is one thing that is always guaranteed with a WarGames match and I’m sure this year will be sure to deliver! So with all of that said let’s dive in with an NXT WarGames preview and set of predictions.

NXT WarGames Match Card

WarGames Match: Raquel Gonzalez Cora Jade Io Shirai and Kay Lee Ray vs. Dakota Kai and Toxic Attraction (Mandy Rose Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne)

Hair vs. Hair Match: Cameron Grimes vs. Duke Hudson

NXT Tag Team Championship: Imperium (Fabian Aichner and Marcel Barthel) (c) vs. Kyle O’Reilly and Von Wagner

NXT Cruiserweight Championship: Roderick Strong (c) vs. Joe Gacy

WarGames Match: Team Black & Gold (Tommaso Ciampa Johnny Gargano Pete Dunne and L.A. Knight) vs. Team 2.0 (Bron Breakker Carmelo Hayes Grayson Waller and Tony D’Angelo)

NXT WarGames Predictions

NXT Tag Team Championship: Imperium (Fabian Aichner and Marcel Barthel) (c) vs. Kyle O’Reilly and Von Wagner

This match will have the eyes of both fans and management as it will be the first major test for Von Wagner. Facing Fabian Aichner and Marcel Barthel two pillars for both NXT and NXT UK’s tag team division will show where he stands in the new NXT.

I do believe Imperium will walk out with the NXT Tag Team Championship still in their possession. However regardless of the outcome this should be a great match with Imperium’s chemistry and Kyle O’Reilly involved!

Prediction: Imperium (Fabian Aichner and Marcel Barthel)

WarGames Match: Raquel Gonzalez Cora Jade Io Shirai and Kay Lee Ray vs. Dakota Kai and Toxic Attraction (Mandy Rose Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne)

We now get to my pick for match of the night! The story elements in this match on top of the talent involved create the night’s most interesting dynamic. You have the newest chapter between Dakota Kai and Raquel Gonzalez the set-up for the next threat to Toxic Attraction’s hold on all of the NXT gold and of course you have Io Shirai who is guaranteed to shine in a match like this.

On top of everything I just mentioned this is also the least predictable match on the card which adds to the excitement. Still I have to pick and will go with the heels to pick up the win.

Prediction: Dakota Kai and Toxic Attraction (Mandy Rose Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne)

WarGames Match: Team Black & Gold (Tommaso Ciampa Johnny Gargano Pete Dunne and L.A. Knight) vs. Team 2.0 (Bron Breakker Carmelo Hayes Grayson Waller and Tony D’Angelo)

We finally get to the main event! The old guard of NXT looks to defend their roles in NXT against the new guard of NXT 2.0 that hopes to establish themselves with a big win. I firmly believe we will see the latter play out.

In particular Bron Breakker and Carmelo Hayes have a lot of potential. Breakker has been at the forefront of NXT since the switch over to 2.0 and Hayes has been given a great spot but I believe this will be an excellent showcase for him. The WarGames match may even be looked at as Hayes’ breakout moment as it is a bout that can allow him to cut loose with his athleticism.

No matter what as I said initially WarGames is always a fun match and I look forward to it.

Prediction: Team 2.0

MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy1zaWduLWRyYWZ0LXBpY2tzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtdG8tcm9va2llLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers sign draft picks Mason McCormick Logan Lee to rookie contracts,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/sports/steelers-sign-draft-picks-mason-mccormick-logan-lee-to-rookie-contracts/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy1zaWduLWRyYWZ0LXBpY2tzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtdG8tcm9va2llLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen.

Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9iaWctc2hvZXMtdG8tZmlsbC1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stdGFsa3Mtd2VhcmluZy1kYXZpZC1kZWNhc3Ryb3Mtbm8tNjYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Big Shoes To Fill:' Mason McCormick Talks Wearing No. 66,"Though he’s been a Steeler for barely two weeks Mason McCormick knows the reputation that comes along with his new jersey number. Wearing No. 66 David DeCastro’s and Alan Faneca’s old numbers McCormick told reporters he’s fully aware of the legacy he’s replacing. At least in number.

“I have heard a little bit about it” he told reporters via Steelers.com when asked about his jersey digits. “I heard I got some big shoes to fill. And that’s super exciting.”

McCormick clearly isn’t backing away from the expectations. More similar to Troy Fautanu DeCastro was the team’s first-round pick in 2012 going lower in the draft than projections and the last West Coast college prospect the team had taken in the first round prior to Fautanu. After battling injury as a rookie DeCastro turned into one of the NFL’s best guards a six-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro before ankle problems shortened his career. Faneca came before both of them a first round pick and Hall of Famer even if his call to Canton took longer than it should’ve.

A punishing run blocker with tons of experience McCormick didn’t get his phone call until early on Day 3 the team’s fourth round pick. While McCormick will keep his goals high expectations out of the gate are lower than they were for DeCastro. Pittsburgh’s starting guards of James Daniels and Isaac Seumalo are set in stone entering the spring meaning McCormick is set to begin the year as a backup.

But o-line depth is valuable and can be quickly tested. Pittsburgh has been incredibly fortunate to avoid serious or multiple offensive line injuries the past two seasons but sheer law of averages suggests that luck will run out. That could push McCormick into a role sooner than expected.

“I’m ready to do whatever it takes to get on the field” he said. “I’ll play either guard spot center whatever it takes. I just want to help this organization in any way I can.”

That could include reps at center. McCormick noted he was the backup center in college and had South Dakota State’s starter gotten hurt he would’ve shifted over. Pittsburgh worked him out as such shortly before the draft and though Zach Frazier’s selection makes him a clear favorite to start the Steelers like to make their backups as versatile as possible. Friday McCormick played right guard and the Steelers will likely have him work at guard this spring before considering center come training camp.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9sb25kb24vc29tZWJvZHktd2lsbC1kaWUtaWYtZm9ybWVyLW1jY29ybWljay1zLWZhY3RvcnktaXNuLXQtdG9ybi1kb3duLW5laWdoYm91cnMtc2F5LTEuNzE5OTI4OdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS43MTk5Mjg5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Somebody will die' if former McCormick's factory isn't torn down neighbours say,"The owners of the former McCormick's candy factory on Dundas Street have been ordered by city bylaw officials to restore security fencing around the crumbling building but business owners near the property say much more needs to be done to deal with what they call a dangerous eyesore.

""The fence usually lasts 48 hours"" said Gord Inglis who operates Inglis Cycle located on McCormick Boulevard behind the property. ""It's very run down neglected not looked after and ignored and it's turned into a playground for children and an area where homeless people [go] in and out.""

A work order was posted on three parts of the fence surrounding some of the property stating that a property inspection done May 8 found contraventions of a city bylaw that requires owners to ensure that vacant buildings are secured against unauthorized entry and to protect the building from the risk of ""fire accident or other danger.""

When a CBC News reporter visited the site on Thursday there were at least eight places where the fence had been torn down partially or completely allowing anyone to walk onto the property.

Windows doors and duct openings were recently covered with plywood Inglis said but that's also usually torn down within days.

Two young teens had to be rescued from the roof of the building on Sunday night London Fire said. There was a fire in the building and the teens who were exploring inside made their way to the roof while they waited for help said Platoon Chief Kirk Loveland. An aerial ladder was used to communicate with the youth and tell them to stay put until firefighters came to the roof to escort them out of the building he said. The teens weren't hurt and were taken away by police.

A similar incident happened on Thursday afternoon. A teen was stuck in the building and police requested the aerial truck again so they could communicate with the young person and escort them out of the building.

Seeing young people in the building is a frequent occurrence Inglis said. ""I feel the city is playing with the devil. Every time an emergency service is called to the building it seems to be more severe. If you don't do something with this building somebody is going to get hurt.""

There are concerns over this former east London factory as redevelopment plans have stalled Duration 0:56 Once a bustling confectionary factory the former McCormick building is now an eyesore that is dangerous for people going in to strip out any metal that can be sold for cash and youth looking for an urban exploring thrill.

'We're picking up garbage everyday'

The recent rescue was just one of the latest incidents where emergency crews were called to the building said Lou Fatibene who owns neighbouring Dundas Automotive.

""I'm surprised nobody's been killed over there yet"" Fatibene said. ""We've had cars broken into the whole area has been vandalized. We're picking up garbage every day.""

Somebody's going to die"" he said. ""How much did it cost us taxpayers to have that aerial truck out there to save the kids?""

Tena Smith who works at Tim's Tires across the street from the old factory says young people are using it as an urban exploration site. Some throw bricks and other items from the roof damaging property and cars below.

""Every Monday when we come in after the weekend it's like the teenagers have had a heyday in there and they've knocked out more windows"" she said. ""We used to park our cars over there to make room for our customers but they throw stuff off the roof. A brick landed on my car and dented my roof so we don't park over there anymore.""

The owners of the property Sierra Construction based in Woodstock did not reply to emails and phone calls asking for comment. They have until May 12 to comply with the city's work order.

The company bought the property for $1. In 2021 McCormick Villages Inc. owned and run by Sierra Construction submitted a plan for a subdivision for the factory site comprising of five hectares. In October 2022 city council approved the development which included repurposing the former factory into a mixed-use mid-rise building as well as townhouses a long-term care facility and a seniors apartment building on the property.

But Sierra Construction wasn't happy with council's decision to limit the apartment building height to five-storeys and to make a multi-use path on the property publicly-accessible among other issues. The Ontario Land Tribunal will consider that appeal in June.

It's been frustrating watching the building and property fall further and further into disrepair said Ward 4 Coun. Susan Stevenson. ""It's becoming a huge safety concern and a lot of people are worried that there will be a tragedy there let alone the disturbance to the neighbourhood that's happening as well"" she said. ""The neighbours just want it taken down."""

Instagram

Donald Trump reportedly had McDonald's brought to the hospital while he had COVID-19 in October 2020.

New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said she read the detail in Mark Meadows' upcoming book.

The former president's love of fast food has been well-documented.

Former President Donald Trump had McDonald's brought to Walter Reed hospital while he was treated for COVID-19 in October 2020 reports say.

The details have reportedly been included in an upcoming book by Mark Meadows former White House chief of staff seen by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman.

""Trump had McDonald's brought to Walter Reed after the Regeneron started kicking in per Meadows"" Haberman wrote on Twitter.

While infected with COVID-19 the former president took the experimental antibody drug Regeneron to treat his symptoms.

""They had to eat with face shields on at the doctor's orders which didn't thrill any of them"" she added.

The former president's love of fast food has been well-documented.

Trump's standard order at McDonald's consisted of two Big Macs two Filet-O-Fish and chocolate malt according to a book by his former campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie.

The order totals nearly 2500 calories or about one day's worth of food for a man his age.

He is also reportedly a fan of the McDonald's breakfast which he would eat during his 2016 presidential campaign and was known to serve fast food at the White House on occasion.

The former president reportedly loves fast food in part because of a ""longtime fear"" of being poisoned Michael Wolff wrote in his book ""Fire and Fury.""







He also reportedly believes that McDonald's is cleaner than many other restaurants.

The latest detail from Meadows' book comes after a bombshell revelation about the former president's COVID diagnosis.

The Guardian reported that Meadows' book reveals that Trump tested positive then negative for COVID-19 three days before his first presidential debate against then-candidate Joe Biden.

Trump responded with a statement claiming ""The story of me having COVID prior to or during the first debate is Fake News.""

Meadows later told Newsmax that he agreed with Trump: ""The president's right. It's fake news.""

The former chief of staff has long been a loyal supporter of former President Trump.

In October Trump said Meadows' book would be an ""incredible Christmas present"" for those who ""want to learn about politics truth our great administration.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NyaW1lL2FydGljbGUyNTYzNTI1NzIuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZXN0YXRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NyaW1lL2FydGljbGUyNTYzNTI1NzIuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teen killed in shooting at parking lot of McDonald’s SC coroner says,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thestate.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Trump is well known for his love of McDonald's and other fast food and unhealthy fare. His former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski once wrote that on the candidate's airplane ""there were four major food groups: McDonald's Kentucky Fried Chicken pizza and Diet Coke.""

According to Lewandowski a McDonald's meal for Trump typically consisted of ""two Big Macs two Filet-O-Fish and a chocolate malted"" — which as the Atlantic noted represents a 2400 calorie meal with twice the average daily recommendation of sodium. According to the CDC obesity may triple the risk of hospitalization due to a COVID-19 infection.

Inc. (MRK): Here is What You Need to Know,"Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +2.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry to which Merck belongs has gained 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Merck is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter representing a year-over-year change of +202.9%. Over the last 30 days the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.3%.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $8.66 points to a change of +473.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.3%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.7%.

With an impressive externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Merck the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.8%. For the current and next fiscal years $64.28 billion and $68.81 billion estimates indicate +6.9% and +7.1% changes respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Merck reported revenues of $15.78 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +8.9%. EPS of $2.07 for the same period compares with $1.40 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.32 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.95%. The EPS surprise was +6.7%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples such as price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on) is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

Merck is graded C on this front indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March.

The metaverse the digital world's Next Big Thing is touted as the internet domain where animated avatars of our physical selves will be able to virtually do all sorts of interactivities from shopping to gaming to traveling — someday. Wonks say it could be a decade or longer before the necessary technologies catch up with the hype. Right now though the health-care industry is utilizing some of the essential components that will ultimately comprise the metaverse — virtual reality (VR) augmented reality (AR) mixed reality (MR) and artificial intelligence (AI) — as well as the software and hardware to power their applications. For example medical device companies are using MR to assemble surgical tools and design operating rooms the World Health Organization (WHO) is using AR and smartphones to train Covid-19 responders psychiatrists are using VR to treat post-traumatic stress (PTS) among combat soldiers and medical schools are using VR for surgical training.

Facebook Oculus and Covid

Since Facebook — now Meta Platforms — acquired Oculus and its VR headset technology in 2014 for $2 billion numerous health-care applications have been developed. One of the latest was a collaboration with Facebook Reality Labs and Nexus Studios and the WHO Academy. The organization's R&D incubator designed a mobile learning app for health workers battling Covid-19 worldwide. One of the training courses involves AR to simulate on a smartphone the proper techniques and sequence to put on and remove person protective equipment. With content available in seven languages the app is built around the needs expressed by 22000 global health workers surveyed by the WHO last year. Oculus technology is used at UConn Health the University of Connecticut's medical center in Farmington Connecticut to train orthopedic surgery residents. Educators have teamed with PrecisionOS a Canadian medical software company that offers VR training and educational modules in orthopedics. Donning Oculus Quest headsets the residents can visualize in 3-D performing a range of surgical procedures such as putting a pin in a broken bone. Because the procedure is performed virtually the system allows the students to make mistakes and receive feedback from faculty to incorporate on their next try. Meanwhile as the metaverse remains under construction ""we see great opportunity to continue the work Meta already does in supporting health efforts"" a Meta spokesperson said. ""As Meta's experiences apps and services evolve you can expect health strategy to play a role but it's far too soon to say how that might intersect with third-party technologies and providers.""

When Microsoft introduced its HoloLens AR smart glasses in 2016 for commercial development early adopters included Stryker  the medical technology company in Kalamazoo Michigan. In 2017 it began harnessing the AR device to improve processes for designing operating rooms for hospitals and surgery centers. Because ORs are shared by different surgical services — from general surgery to orthopedic cardiac and others — lighting equipment and surgical tools vary depending on the procedure. Recognizing the opportunity the HoloLens 2 provided in evolving OR design from 2D to 3D Stryker engineers are able to design shared ORs with the use of holograms. The MR experience visualizes all of the people equipment and setups without requiring physical objects or people to be present. Zimmer Biomet a Warsaw Indiana-based medical device company recently unveiled its OptiVu Mixed Reality Solutions platform which employs HoloLens devices and three applications — one using MR in manufacturing surgical tools another that collects and stores data to track patient progress before and after surgery and a third that allows clinicians to share a MR experience with patients ahead of a procedure. ""We are currently using the HoloLens in a pilot fashion with remote assist in the U.S. EMEA and Australia"" a Zimmer Biomet spokesperson said. The technology has been used for remote case coverage and training programs and the company is developing software applications on the HoloLens as part of data solutions focused on pre- and post-procedures the spokesperson said.

Microsoft's holographic vision of the future

In March Microsoft showcased Mesh a MR platform powered by its Azure cloud service which allows people in different physical locations to join 3-D holographic experiences on various devices including HoloLens 2 a range of VR headsets smartphones tablets and PCs. In a blog post the company imagined avatars of medical students learning about human anatomy gathered around a holographic model and peeling back muscles to see what's underneath. Microsoft sees many opportunities for its MR tech and in March secured a $20 billion contract with the U.S. military for its use with soldiers.

In real-world applications of AR medical technology Johns Hopkins neurosurgeons performed the institution's first-ever AR surgeries on living patients in June. During the initial procedure physicians placed six screws in a patient's spine during a spinal fusion. Two days later a separate team of surgeons removed a cancerous tumor from the spine of a patient. Both teams donned headsets made by Augmedics an Israeli firm equipped with a see-through eye display that projects images of a patient's internal anatomy such as bones and other tissue based on CT scans. ""It's like having a GPS navigator in front of your eyes"" said Timothy Witham M.D. director of the Johns Hopkins Neurosurgery Spinal Fusion Laboratory. At the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine instructors at the Gordon Center for Simulation and Innovation in Medical Education utilize AR VR and MR to train emergency first-responders to treat trauma patients including those who have had a stroke heart attack or gunshot wound. Students practice life-saving cardiac procedures on Harvey a life-like mannequin that realistically simulates nearly any cardiac disease. Wearing VR headsets students can ""see"" the underlying anatomy which is graphically exposed on Harvey. ""In the digital environment we're not bound by physical objects"" said Barry Issenberg MD Professor of Medicine and director of the Gordon Center. Before developing the virtual technology curriculum he said students had to physically be on the scene and train on actual trauma patients. ""Now we can guarantee that all learners have the same virtual experience regardless of their geographic location."" Since it was founded in 1999 the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) has developed VR AI and other technologies to address a variety of medical and mental health conditions. ""When I first got involved the technology was Stone Age"" said Albert ""Skip"" Rizzo a psychologist and director for medical virtual reality at ICT recalling his tinkering with an Apple IIe and a Game Boy handheld console. Today he uses VR and AR headsets from Oculus HP and Magic Leap. Rizzo has helped create a VR exposure therapy called Bravemind aimed at providing relief from PTS particularly among veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. During exposure therapy a patient guided by a trained therapist confronts his or her trauma memories through simulations of their experiences. Wearing a headset the patient can be immersed in several different virtual scenarios including a Middle-Eastern themed city and desert road environments. ""Patients use a keyboard to simulate people insurgents explosions even smells and vibrations"" Rizzo said. And rather than relying exclusively on imagining a particular scenario a patient can experience it in a safe virtual world as an alternative to traditional talk therapy. The evidence-based Bravemind therapy is now available at more than a dozen Veterans Administration hospitals where it has been shown to produce a meaningful reduction in PTS symptoms. Additional randomized controlled studies are ongoing. As Big Tech continues to build out the metaverse alongside software and hardware companies academia and other R&D partners the health-care industry remains a real-life proving ground. ""While the metaverse is still in its infancy it holds tremendous potential for the transformation and improvement of health care"" wrote Paulo Pinheiro head of software at Cambridge U.K.-based Sagentia Innovation on the advisory firm's website. ""It will be fascinating to watch the situation unfold.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2NyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5L3RoZS1uZXctd29ybGQtb2YtbWV0YXZlcnNlLWFuZC1vd25lcnNoaXAtdmlhLW5mdHMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODgwODY3NjkuY21z0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2NyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5L3RoZS1uZXctd29ybGQtb2YtbWV0YXZlcnNlLWFuZC1vd25lcnNoaXAtdmlhLW5mdHMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg4MDg2NzY5LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The new world of metaverse and ownership via NFTs,"Guest contributor and other agencies

A question that has perplexed scientists for nearly half a century may have finally been answered.No we haven’t discovered aliens but may have found another world within ours. The only catch: It is virtual and goes by the name of “metaverse”.A term first coined in 1992 in a sci-fiction novel by Neal Stephenson the metaverse is a combination of two words — meta meaning beyond and stem meaning universe. The term is basically an idea of a virtual reality where users can buy land building create their own avatars and build their virtual universe. Within the metaverse people can roam around meet their friends visit buildings attend events and even buy goods and services using cryptocurrency . People within the metaverse would be connected all the time without having to worry about physical distances or borders.The concept gained more popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic as lockdowns pushed more and more people to share online spaces for longer hours. The successful development of the metaverse is expected to be driven by augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) gadgets which act at the experiential layer.At this point we would also like to bring back the concept of non-fungible tokens or NFTs from one of our previous articles: NFTs are digital assets that exist on a public blockchain that serves as a record of ownership. While anyone can view the item only the buyer of an NFT has the “official” status of being its owner.Our research shows that the metaverse is best experienced with commerce as one of its core values. There are ways to make NFTs more useful by adding functionalities that can be utilised in a variety of applications across numerous metaverses at once (how cool is that!). A previously issued NFT for example can be transformed into an asset in a game release or used to get access to future NFTs and experiences therefore enhancing the NFT's usability and worth.(Image source: Jon Radoff on Medium) Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg also mentioned the new buzzword during his company’s most recent call. Terming it as the next “big thing” Zuckerberg said people would see Facebook transitioning from being a social media company to “a metaverse company”. “In many ways the metaverse is the ultimate expression of social technology” he told analysts and investors.The company has been rebranded as Meta Platforms.According to a Bloomberg report while Zuckerberg has only recently started using the terminology publicly it is something his company has been focusing on for years with investments in virtual and augmented reality.An early step towards metaverse was witnessed recently when Facebook launched a test version of its new virtual-reality remote work app called Horizon Workrooms. The app still in beta version allows users to hold meetings as digital avatar versions of themselves.(Source: venturebeat The social media giant also announced it would hire 10000 in the European Union over the next five years to help build the metaverse. Facebook has also recently rebranded itself as Meta. “We will effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a metaverse company” Mark Zuckerberg said at its Connect 2021 event.Apart from Facebook several other tech giants such as Microsoft NVIDIA and Epic Games have also announced their plans of exploring the metaverse. VISA entered the metaverse after it purchased its first NFT — a digital artwork — for $150000. Popular brands such as Italian fashion house Gucci are also into the metaverse. The consumer brand in June collaborated with Roblox an online game platform and game creation system to sell a collection of digital-only accessories in the form of NFTs.

Gang Green scored touchdowns on its first three possessions but then did not score again the rest of the day and lost 33-18 to the Eagles at MetLife Stadium on Sunday.

The Jets — who fell to 0-12 all time against the Eagles — are now 3-9 meaning they will have a losing record for the sixth straight season. The Eagles improved to 6-7 and kept their playoff hopes alive.

Philadelphia threw the Jets a curveball with Gardner Minshew starting at quarterback in place of Jalen Hurts who is dealing with an ankle injury but had been projected to play all week. The Eagles rolled up 418 yards on a Jets defense that had no answers. The Eagles scored on their first seven possessions and did not punt until there was two minutes left in the game.

Early in the game rookie quarterback Zach Wilson and the offense matched the Eagles. Both teams scored touchdowns on their first three possessions and it looked like the fans at MetLife including former Jets quarterback Ken O’Brien would see a shootout reminiscent of O’Brien versus Dan Marino in 1986.

3 Gardner Minshew and the Eagles put up 33 points against the Jets on Dec. 5 2021. AP

But the Jets’ offense disappeared after scoring its third touchdown of the game in the second quarter. It was not all the offense’s fault as the Jets’ defense could not get the Eagles off the field. The Jets had just three plays and 1:10 of possession in the third quarter.

The Eagles opened the third quarter with a 14-play drive that lasted 8 minutes 22 seconds and ended with one of Jake Elliott’s four field goals. The Eagles were aided by a few questionable penalty calls one a pass interference penalty on Bryce Hall on third down and an encroachment call on C.J.Mosley on fourth down. Both calls and a few others had Jets coach Robert Saleh screaming at the officials.

Wilson’s hot start cooled off considerably and he threw an interception with 13:02 left in the game to Marcus Epps that ended any hopes the Jets had of winning the game. It was Wilson’s 11th interception of the season and continued his streak of not having a game without a turnover.

Wilson completed 23 of 38 passes for 225 yards two touchdowns and one interception. Minshew went 20-for-25 for 242 yards and two touchdowns.

The first half was an unexpected shootout between the teams. Each team scored a touchdown on its first three drives and the Eagles went into halftime with a 24-18 lead.

Both quarterbacks started off the game hot. Minshew completed his first 11 passes and went 14-for-15 in the first half for 188 yards and two touchdowns both to tight end Dallas Goedert.

Wilson played his best half of the season to open the game. He went 12 of 14 for 108 yards and two touchdowns. Wilson looked in rhythm early something he’s struggled with this year. The two touchdowns were his first in the opening half this season.

The Jets opened the game with a 79-yard kickoff return by Braxton Berrios that set the Jets up at the Philadelphia 21. Wilson and the Jets needed five plays to find the end zone with Wilson throwing a 3-yard touchdown to Elijah Moore. Kicker Alex Kessman signed off the practice squad on Saturday missed the extra point and the Jets led 6-0.

Minshew answered with a 75-yard six-play touchdown drive to put Philadelphia up 7-6. He finished it off with a 36-yard touchdown pass to Goedert who beat Mosley on the play and scored after safety Ashtyn Davis made a poor attempt at tackling him.

The Jets took a 12-7 lead after Wilson scored on a 1-yard run to cap an 11-play drive. Kessman again missed the extra point keeping the Jets’ kicking woes an ongoing story. The Jets cut Matt Ammendola on Saturday and replaced him with Kessman after Ammendola struggled lately. But Kessman had a brutal first game.

As bad as the kicking game was the Jets’ defense was worse in the first half. It could do nothing to slow down Minshew and the Eagles. Minshew connected with Goedert again on a 25-yard touchdown pass early in the second quarter to put the Eagles up 14-12. The Jets gave up 262 yards in the first half 188 through the air.

The Jets kept the shootout alive with another nice 75-yard drive that was finished off with a 1-yard touchdown pass from Wilson to tight end Ryan Griffin on fourth-and-goal. The Jets went for two this time but failed on the conversion and led 18-14 with 9:22 left in the first half. The offense then went dormant.

Kenneth Gainwell ran right through the middle of the Jets’ defense for an 18-yard touchdown with 4:30 left in the half as the Eagles retook the lead 21-18. The Eagles tacked on a field goal before halftime to lead 24-18.

(3-9) Philadelphia Eagles 33 (6-7)

(6-7) NFL Week 13 Final Box Score

MetLife Stadium East Rutherford NJ

The more things change in the NFL the more they stay the same in the New York-Philadelphia matchup.

Behind 418 yards of offense 245 coming from the arm of backup quarterback Gardner Minshew the Philadelphia Eagles (6-7) rolled to a 33-18 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday afternoon at MetLife Stadium.

New York (3-9) not only clinched its sixth consecutive losing season but also fell to 0-12 all-time against the Eagles the only team they have yet to defeat in the regular season.

The Jets enjoyed one of their hottest starts of the season as Wilson earned touchdowns on each of his first three possessions; his first three scores posted in a first half this season.

Aerial scores to Elijah Moore and Ryan Griffin sandwiched a one-yard punch-in on the ground for the rookie quarterback who was making his first MetLife Stadium appearance since the Oct. 3 upset win over Tennessee.

Alas for the Jets even the emergence of Wilson couldn’t be met without bad news. Working with their seventh different regular season kicker since the start of the 2019 season Alex Kessman missed each extra point attempt after the first two touchdowns before the Jets misfired on the two-point try after Wilson’s final score to Griffin.

Philadelphia on the other hand capitalized on its opportunities afforded by a porous effort from the Jets’ defense. They likewise earned touchdowns on each of their first trio of possessions two of which ended with Minshew touchdown passes to Dallas Goedert.

Rookie Kenneth Gainwell also had a seven-yard rushing score while Jake Elliott converted three singe-point tries and one field to go up 24-18 at the midway mark.

But the Jets were unable to transfer some surprising good vibes over into the second half.

They only earned 73 downs on their first three second-half possessions the latter pair of which ended in a turnover on down and a Marcus Epps interception.

Offensively the Eagles sealed the deal with a trio of Jake Elliott field goals that came from 32 43 and 46 yards out. The Jets allowed 418 yards of offense allowing over 400 for the third time this season.

They mustered only a single sack of Minshew coming from the hands of Elijah Riley. This comes after the Jets allowed a season-best 266 yards and earned five quarterback takedowns in last week’s win over Houston.

New York returns to action next Sunday afternoon against the New Orleans Saints (1 p.m. ET CBS).

You’d be hard-pressed to ask a boxing fan about the Four Kings and not get the correct answer back a great percent of the time.

Sugar Ray Leonard Marvin Hagler Thomas Hearns and Roberto Duran not only defined championship boxing in the sport’s lightweight division they gave definition to superstar status for promoters.

Thanks to the today’s proliferation of digital platforms comparing their contributions to promotional coffers isn’t an exact formula when it comes to the top of the division today especially since the four most prominent fighters circle one each more on social media than they do in the ring.

That includes the likes of Las Vegas resident Devin Haney. The current WBC lightweight champion was the featured attraction vs challenger JoJo Diaz Jr. for Matchroom Boxing’s event held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena Saturday night. Haney retained his WBC belt with a unanimous decision over Diaz at the Grand Garden tonight.

The 80s were a golden era when Sugar Marvelous Hitman and Hands of Stone dominated headlines and Pay-Per-View. They didn’t have the benefit of today’s technology to sell pay-per-view via social media to promote sales.

Fans weren’t also lured to competing streaming service platforms like ESPN+ or Matchroom’s broadcast partner DAZN. The services are priced at either $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year for ESPN+ or $19.99 a month or $99.99 annually for DAZN.

In a sport famous for giving its fans far less than what they’ve paid for showing up hat in hand week after week for anywhere from $69.99 to &79.99 on average is getting to be a bit much.

While Matchroom’s Chairman Eddie Hearn was part of the colossal 800000 buys Canelo Alvarez vs Caleb Plant Pay-Per-View in November he hasn’t shied away from calling out the fact that the model pricing and lack of absolutely must-see fights is at the moment upside down in boxing. .

When LVSportsbiz.com asked the loquacious promoter his thoughts on whether Matchroom and its broadcast platform DAZN would eventually find a way to offer boxing via its app and on Pay-Per-View he responded to it being highly likely.

“I see us doing a little bit of both. I think the beauty of DAZN is more affordable boxing and more value for the money for fight fans. I think it’s important to have functionality Pay-Per-View functionality. The ability to do it if a fight presents itself. Where you could be sharing it on another platform with Pay-Per-View or that fighter will only fight on Pay-Per-View.”

However when it came to the recent slate of events especially in the last quarter of the year cannibalizing one another for fan financial contributions Hearn was less than complimentary of Pay-Per-View.

Hearn’s full comments here:

“Cannibalization is the perfect word because if you look at the process over the last few weeks you know you had Canelo Alvarez who’s gone out and you know done a huge amount of buys as he does. Then you have Crawford-Porter that does 130 [thousand] which is a disaster and then you have Tank against Isaac Cruz which could do 50000 buys in a week.

“I mean who knows. Then you’ve got Jake Paul against Tony Fury. Then you’ve got Charles Martin against Luis Ortiz. These Pay-Per-Views I think the Tank Pay-Per-View is $74.99. Coming from the U.K. I can’t even understand how that even works. Do you know what I mean? I would get just taken out of the game. Pay-Per-View will always exist. I’m not I’ve never been a Pay-Per-View is dead campaigner. What I’m saying is the right fights at the right time will always be Pay-Per-View.

“There’s too many Pay-Per-View fights that actually aren’t Pay-Per-View and there’s too many too close together. You can’t expect fight fans to pay $80 a month or $80 every two weeks for one night but it’s been great for DAZN. Our numbers have gone like that because fight fans have actually seen the value. They’ve said “OK we’ve seen Canelo Alavarez twice this year we’ve seen Haney-Diaz we got Lopez-Kambosos and it’s all part of our subscription.” So I really feel like DAZN is making strides in the US and globally.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vVHJhdmVsLU5ld3MvSG90ZWwtTmV3cy9Db3VsZC1NYXJyaW90dC1zZXR0bGVtZW50LWJlLXRoZS1lbmQtb2YtcmVzb3J0LWZlZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could Marriott settlement be the end of resort fees?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Hotel-News/Could-Marriott-settlement-be-the-end-of-resort-fees on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vVHJhdmVsLU5ld3MvSG90ZWwtTmV3cy9Db3VsZC1NYXJyaW90dC1zZXR0bGVtZW50LWJlLXRoZS1lbmQtb2YtcmVzb3J0LWZlZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMDQvd2hpY2tlci1kZXZpbi1oYW5leS1zaG93cy1oaXMtZ2FtZS1hcy1oZS1vdXRib3hlcy1qb3NlcGgtZGlhei10by1rZWVwLWxpZ2h0d2VpZ2h0LXRpdGxlL9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vY3JlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzA0L3doaWNrZXItZGV2aW4taGFuZXktc2hvd3MtaGlzLWdhbWUtYXMtaGUtb3V0Ym94ZXMtam9zZXBoLWRpYXotdG8ta2VlcC1saWdodHdlaWdodC10aXRsZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Whicker: Devin Haney shows his game as he outboxes Joseph Diaz to keep lightweight title,"WBC lightweight champion Devin Haney (R) connects with a punch on Joseph Diaz Jr. in a title fight at MGM Grand Garden Arena on December 04 2021 in Las Vegas Nevada.

You gotta have heart. But it isn’t all you need.

Joseph Diaz Jr. brought the passion into the ring Saturday night at the MGM Grand.

Devin Haney brought everything else.

In fact the 23-year-old Haney brought images of the young Floyd Mayweather punching from irresistible angles maximizing his speed advantages and avoiding most of the trouble.

He kept his WBC welterweight title with a clear but difficult unanimous decision over Diaz.

“He said he’d bring the dog out in me” Haney said. “That’s exactly what he did. He makes it hard for any fighter. From the very beginning I knew he wasn’t going anywhere. He’s a true champion but remember when he said I had no chin. I think I showed them something different.”

Haney came in with a seven-inch reach advantage and used it diligently especially when he got a wide lead in the early rounds. Diaz now 32-2-1 began to close the gap somewhat and seemed to win the fourth round but Haney’s skills took over after that. At the bell that ended the sixth round Diaz slapped Haney respectfully with his glove.

Diaz rallied in the seventh and ninth rounds and in the 12th he opened up and appeared to stun Haney with a left uppercut. But Haney kept his wits and reacted with some right hands of his own and Diaz seemed to have no problem with the decision.

“This is what I do fight the tough guys” Diaz said. “If I end up coming short I just progress and get better.

“I landed some good shots but he’s smart. He managed to get out of those situations and use his distance. I felt like I had him hurt but I didn’t want to get caught with a clean shot. I belong in there with the best and I’ll continue to do that.”

Two judges Max DeLuca and Dave Moretti gave it to Haney by scores of 117-111. Tim Cheatham favored Haney 116-112.

Haney’s virtuosity makes the lightweight division even more interesting. George Kambosos holds the other three belts after an upset of Teofimo Lopez. He has said he wants to defend them against top fighters but stipulates that the next fight must be in his native Australia.

“I’ll fight him on Jupiter if I have to” Haney responded.

It’s difficult to realize that Diaz was a U.S. Olympian nine years ago in London. Teammates included Jose Ramirez Errol Spence Jr. and Jamel Herring all of whom won professional belts.

Gold medals went to Vasyl Lomachenko Oleksandr Uzyk and Anthony Joshua but the only American medals were a gold that went to Clarissa Shields and a bronze to Marlen Esparza. None of the men brought home anything Diaz who had beaten Oscar Valdez in the world championships the year before lost to Lazaro Alvarez of Mexico in the second round.

All Olympians bring expectations even when they come up empty in the Games themselves. Diaz was under focus from the beginning and he won his first 26 fights before he ran into the ultra-skilled Gary Russell Jr. in 2018.

Russell piled up points early then survived Diaz’s rally to keep his WBC featherweight title by a unanimous decision. Ever since Diaz has brought more aggression and power. But his pursuit of a championship kept going awry.

His next fight came against Jesus Rojas and was derailed before it began because Diaz didn’t make the 126-pound limit. He won easily but couldn’t claim Rojas’ WBA title.

Diaz rose to 130 pounds and in January of 2020 scored a unanimous decision over Tevin Farmer to lift his IBF super-featherweight belt. But again Diaz couldn’t make weight for his defense against Shavkatdzhon Rakhimov a year later and missed the 130 limit by three and a half pounds. It was his first post-COVID-19 fight and the two fought to a majority draw.

“I was getting too depleted trying to make that weight” said Diaz 29. He moved up to lightweight and impressively decisioned Javier Fortuna at Banc of California Stadium in July.

Meanwhile Haney has been in a holding pattern after he had established himself as one of the best technicians at any weight.

Haney is now 27-0 with 15 knockouts. He has been knocked for any easy schedule but none of the other young lightweights have managed to sign the bottom line with him. He remains the youngest champion in the sport.

He repeated his goal of becoming one of the all-time greats “like Muhammad Ali and Ray Leonard the best in the world.”

Technically it might be reachable. Besides those guys never fought on Jupiter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8va25wci5vcmcvc2hvdy9uZXZhZGEteWVzdGVyZGF5cy8yMDIxLTEyLTA0L25ldmFkYS15ZXN0ZXJkYXlz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Golden Nugget,"A Las Vegas hotel-casino recently celebrated its diamond jubilee. The Golden Nugget is seventy-five.

The old sign above the property had 1905 on it. That signified that it was part of the railroad townsite auctioned off that year. But the casino didn’t open then. That would come in 1946 thanks to a former Los Angeles vice cop turned syndicate operative Guy McAfee. You heard that right—he went from the right side of the law to the wrong side.

McAfee had done well in Los Angeles but a new mayor took office in 1938. Fletcher Bowron had committed to getting rid of McAfee and his friends. McAfee headed up Highway 91 to Las Vegas. He would have quite an impact. He started out by buying a club on the highway and calling it the 91 Club. He sold it to the builders of the Hotel Last Frontier. He moved downtown and bought a couple of casinos. He also planned something bigger.

In 1945 McAfee announced plans for a new casino on the southwest corner of Second and Fremont. He had several investors with him but it was mostly his baby. When it opened on August 30 it was modeled on San Francisco’s Barbary Coast during the Gold Rush and a bar called the Golden Nugget. He insisted on Victorian era fixtures and wood along with Italian marble. It became known for no-limit gambling and its enormous neon sign complete with a shining nugget. It also was known for expanding to include other casinos west of it along Fremont Street. That was largely the work of McAfee’s successor Buck Blaine who had worked at the Golden Nugget from day one after originally coming to southern Nevada to work on Hoover Dam construction. Blaine retired in 1972.

That led to a new era. A young entrepreneur Steve Wynn bought up a majority interest in the Golden Nugget and began retooling it. He opened its first hotel tower. He got the city to let him expand across Carson Street—he put a restaurant called Carson Street Café for obvious reasons. And the Golden Nugget became the foundation of his empire. He expanded into Atlantic City which enabled him to bring big-name entertainment to the original property. Frank Sinatra moved to his company and performed downtown. Wynn went on to add other towers and attractions until MGM Resorts took over the Golden Nugget and Wynn’s other hotels in 2000.

It was a measure of the Golden Nugget’s success that when MGM decided to sell it the Poster Financial Group—Tim Poster and Tom Breitling—bought it for two hundred and fifteen million. They soon sold to Landry’s headed by Tillman Fertitta a relative of another prominent Las Vegas family in the gaming industry. The Golden Nugget’s growth has continued with expansion to the west more restaurants entertainment and attractions. These include a display of the world’s largest gold nugget and a thirty-million-dollar three story attraction called The Tank that includes 300 animals—among them five shark species. Seventy-five years later Guy McAfee just might be a bit surprised.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9ib3hpbmcvZGV2aW4taGFuZXktd2lucy11bmFuaW1vdXMtZGVjaXNpb24tY2FsbHMtb3V0LWdlb3JnZS1rYW1ib3Nvcy0yNDkxMTEwL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9ib3hpbmcvZGV2aW4taGFuZXktd2lucy11bmFuaW1vdXMtZGVjaXNpb24tY2FsbHMtb3V0LWdlb3JnZS1rYW1ib3Nvcy0yNDkxMTEwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Devin Haney wins unanimous decision calls out George Kambosos,"Devin Haney used his slick boxing skills to retain his WBC lightweight title with a unanimous decision over JoJo Diaz Jr. on Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

With the spotlight on boxing’s lightweight division Devin Haney wanted to deliver a standout performance. What he needed more than anything else though was a win.

He got it Saturday night against JoJo Diaz Jr. using his slick boxing skills to retain his WBC lightweight title by unanimous decision (117-111 117-111 116-112) at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

“He said he was going to bring the dog out of me” Haney said. “That’s exactly what he did. I had to bring the dog out.”

Haney (27-0 15 knockouts) took control from the opening bell establishing the distance with a clean jab and straight right hand that Diaz (32-2-1 15 KOs) had no answers for. Diaz turned up the intensity in the second round and finished strong but still didn’t throw consistently enough to steal the round.

Diaz had by far his best round in the fourth when he finally managed to close the distance. He traded with Haney in the pocket and won the exchanges even though both landed clean shots.

But his moment didn’t last and Haney took back control in the middle rounds. Diaz didn’t throw many punches and Haney who lives and trains in Las Vegas was more than happy to stand on the outside and pick him apart.

Diaz had another big moment in the seventh finding a home for his overhand left a punch that Haney has often struggled to defend. But the inconsistency continued as Diaz lost the eighth round but then again forced the action in the ninth swarming Haney to cause one of the more eventful exchanges of the night.

Diaz’s success was eerily similar to Haney’s last fight when he built a big lead on the scorecards against Jorge Linares but had to survive late adversity because of Linares’ success landing left hooks.

The action reached a high point in the final round with both fighters coming forward and tagging each other with overhand punches.

Newly crowned unified lightweight titlist George Kambosos Jr. was sitting ringside and Haney immediately called for an undisputed title fight with the Australian. Kambosos has the other three title belts after an upset of Teofimo Lopez on Nov. 27.

“Let’s do it for all the belts” Haney said. “The real undisputed. Let’s do it next. I’d go to Jupiter if I got to. I think it’s a great fight. There would be no more dispute. That’s the biggest fight right now for the 135-pound division.”

In the co-main event super lightweight prospect Montana Love earned an impressive third-round stoppage over Carlos Diaz.

Love coming off the most impressive win of his career against Ivan Baranchyk scored three knockdowns in the second round but Diaz survived. He didn’t make it out of the third when the referee stepped in with Diaz stuck against the ropes and taking punishment.

In another undercard fight Jessica McCaskill retained her undisputed welterweight title with a seventh-round technical knockout over Kandi Wyatt who was overmatched from the opening bell.

David Blane from north London had lost all hope of seeing his cat Zeke again and was “in a total state of shock” to hear he had been handed in as a stray 30 miles away in Stevenage Hertfordshire.

“I had resigned myself to the fact that I would never get him back so to get that call out of the blue was utterly amazing” Mr Blane said.

“You don’t expect to hear that your cat has been found safe and well five years after he has gone missing.

“It was an utter relief to hear that Zeke was OK.”

Mr Blane who lives in Haringey leafleted the neighbourhood when Zeke went missing and registered him on the pet alert service PetLog.

Five years later Zeke was handed in as a stray and scanned for a microchip but vets were unable to reach the seven-year-old Maine Coon cat’s registered owner.

Zeke was then placed with Cats Protection’s north Hertfordshire branch where co-ordinator Bianca Kubler said: “He was dishevelled and his coat was quite dirty when he arrived but he was a healthy 9kg boy with an insatiable hunger and despite needing five teeth removed and a good bath he was in good health.”

“I felt so sad for Zeke as he seemed depressed we really needed to find his owner if we were to put the spark back into Zeke’s spirit” Ms Kubler said.

She expanded her search to breeder and lost Maine Coon cat websites.

“We were starting to lose hope by the end of a long weekend of constant searching but my partner decided to ring the number on the microchip one last time. To our total surprise a man answered” she said.

“He was in a total state of shock when we said that we’d found his cat Zeke.”

“He follows me around and it seems he definitely remembers me. It’s amazing to have my baby boy back. He’s more affectionate than I remember which is good… previously he could be a bit aloof but now he comes for cuddles and plays a lot more.

“I’d like to thank John and all the volunteers at Cats Protection’s north Herts branch – they do fantastic work and really have made a massive difference to my life by reuniting me with my baby – now giant – boy.

Currently quantum computing is one of the most promising future technologies that could deliver super-fast processing power for new and emerging industries that are constantly in need of a computational performance boost.

A general overview of quantum computing vs classical computing. Image used courtesy of CB Insights

Quantum computing uses the quantum states of particles (such as spin or charge) to represent quantum bits called qubits. This technology comes in a couple of different forms each with individual benefits and drawbacks.

Companies such as Google and Intel have already started developing their versions of quantum computers that showcase the technology but aren't nearly as powerful as engineers would like them to have any practical and real-world uses.

The main problem towards achieving this goal caused by various factors is the inability to control a large number of qubits efficiently. Generally for quantum bits to be coherent and controllable noise and interference from other sources must be at an absolute minimum.

Creating minimum noise and interference requires excessive signal shielding and near absolute zero cooling. In turn it requires a large and expensive infrastructure that can handle only a handful of qubits which is inefficient for scaling and mass-producing the technology at that stage.

Recently a team of physicists from the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen has developed a potential way to overcome one of these challenges by using semiconductor materials as a platform for a so-called solid-state quantum computer.

University of Copenhagen's Quantum Chip

Research by Ph.D. student Federico Fedele Professor Anasua Chatterjee and Professor Ferdinand Kuemmeth's group fabricated a quantum chip based on quantum dot semiconductor qubits that utilize the dot spin property as logic states for their system.

High-level representation of semiconductor qubits by application and size. Image used courtesy of Chatterjee et al

Unlike other types of qubits dot spin qubits have relatively longer coherence times which means that they can maintain their state for a longer time allowing for faster performance and a smaller chance of error during computations and readouts.

The chip features four qubits in a two-by-two array of quantum dots made out of a gallium arsenide semiconductor structure.

University of Copenhagen's two-by-two array of quantum dots. Image used courtesy of Fedele et al

Between these qubits is a larger central quantum dot that connects all four qubits allowing for parallel control of every single one of them simultaneously.

This attribute is what makes this research groundbreaking. While other quantum technologies require each qubit to be individually ""driven"" to control and read its state they can be operated as one structure by not having to wire every qubit to the system individually.

This structural change creates a significant advantage in qubit coherence and eliminates a portion of that large wiring infrastructure that other quantum computers exhibit.

Semiconductor Spin Qubit Challenges

Although this research does resolve one of the biggest underlying issues of current leading quantum computer designs it still leaves the door open for improvements in scalability both for manufacturing and processing power.

Since this is still a semiconductor technology the hope is that engineers could adapt current semiconductor techniques to use gallium arsenide for qubit chip manufacturing leading to a mass fabrication method for a future quantum processor.

The second biggest challenge developing a quantum chip with a more extensive array of simultaneously operated qubits is a whole research problem of its own.

On the surface level some of the issues that semiconductor spin qubits face are fairly similar to those other quantum computing technologies such as ion trap quantum computers or superconductor quantum computers.

Nevertheless a semiconductor platform is still a very interesting approach since as with our current traditional semiconductor computers which operate using billions of transistors on a single chip quantum semiconductor chips might also feature a similar qubit density and allow engineers to potentially integrate billions of qubits onto a single chip as well.

Semiconductor Qubits = Future of Quantum Computing?

Currently many scientists and engineers are researching this topic. Still due to the price of entry and the relatively new technology quantum computing is far from an industry tool let alone a household item.

Useful and manufacturable quantum devices might vary between these technologies and probably won't become a reality until a true quantum computing standard exists.

Semiconductor spin quantum computers are just one of many technologies that while solving some problems in our current understanding of the technology might show other problems down the road or not be compatible with solutions for some other quantum computing challenges.

Still this is a valuable step forward into qubit control that will hopefully inform other engineers into their future research as the current goal of the technology should not be the immediate scaling of manufacturing to deliver a product. Hopefully opening the gate to more researchers to collectively better understand the scope of quantum's complexity and bring even more solutions to the table to truly develop quantum technologies.",,,,,,,,,

Reuters BEIJING





Toyota Motor Corp is to launch an all-electric small sedan in China late next year having turned to local partner BYD Co (比亞迪) for key technology to finally make an affordable yet roomy runaround four sources said.

Two of the four people with knowledge of the matter described the car as an electric holy grail for Toyota which has struggled for years to come up with a small electric vehicle (EV) that is competitive on cost in China and does not compromise on comfort.

The sources said the breakthrough was chiefly down to BYD’s less bulky lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) Blade batteries and its lower-cost engineering know-how — a turning of the tables for a Chinese company whose popular F3 saloon was inspired by Toyota’s Corolla back in 2005.

Little known outside China at the time BYD or “Build Your Dreams” hit the headlines in 2008 when Warren Buffett bought a 10 percent stake and it has since become one of the biggest manufacturers of so-called new energy vehicles in the world.

Toyota’s new EV would be slightly bigger than its compact Corolla the world’s best-selling car of all time.

It is to be unveiled as a concept car at the Beijing auto show in April and will then most likely be launched as the second model in Toyota’s new bZ series of all-electric cars even though it will only be on sale in China for now.

“The car was enabled by BYD battery technology” one of the sources said. “It has more or less helped us resolve challenges we had faced in coming up with an affordable small electric sedan with a roomy interior.”

It would be pitched below premium EVs such as Tesla’s Model Y or the Nio ES6 but above the ultra-cheap Hong Guang Mini EV which starts at just US$4500 and is now China’s best-selling EV.

Two of the four sources all of whom declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media said the new Toyota would be priced competitively.

One said it would likely sell for under 200000 yuan (US$31400) aiming for a segment of the Chinese market Tesla is expected to target with a small car within the next two years.

“We don’t comment on future products” a Toyota spokesperson said. “Toyota considers battery electric vehicles as one path to help us get to carbon neutrality and is engaged in the development of all types of electrified vehicle solutions.”

A BYD spokesperson declined to comment.

Two of the sources said the BYD evaluations pushed Toyota to create its research and development (R&D) joint venture with BYD last year. Toyota now has two dozen engineers in Shenzhen working side-by-side with about 100 BYD counterparts.

BYD officially launched its Blade battery last year.

LFP batteries have a lower energy density than most other lithium-ion cells but are cheaper have a longer shelf-life are less prone to overheating and do not use cobalt or nickel. Tesla already uses LFP batteries in its Model 3 and Model Y in China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy90ZXhhcy1pbnN0cnVtZW50cy1yYWlzaW5nLWNoaXAtb3V0cHV0LXRvLWZpbGwtc3VwcGx5LWdhcC9hcnRpY2xlMzc4NDI3NjYuZWNl0gFzaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3RleGFzLWluc3RydW1lbnRzLXJhaXNpbmctY2hpcC1vdXRwdXQtdG8tZmlsbC1zdXBwbHktZ2FwL2FydGljbGUzNzg0Mjc2Ni5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Instruments raising chip output to fill supply gap chipmakerTexas Instruments MD,"December 04 2021 09:11 pm | Updated December 05 2021 12:14 am IST

A surge in demand for semiconductors in areas such as automotive computing and communications has resulted in an acute shortage of these products globally. Chipmaker Texas Instruments (TI) is working to address the supply gap globally as it ramps up production capabilities and strengthens distribution channels according to Santosh Kumar president & MD TI India . Excerpts:

TI is said to be rapidly expanding production capabilities. Any plans for a wafer fab in India?

Strengthening our production capabilities is part of our capacity planning for the future. We are continuing to expand production lines at a global level and our recent acquisition of Lehi fab [in Utah from Micron] is expected to boost our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology.

More from a strategic standpoint the Lehi facility is focused on 65-nm (nanometer) and 45-nm production for our analog and embedded processing products. India is a critical R&D centre for TI and we continue to increase our investments here in building products.

We will leverage the strength of our talent here for local as well as global markets as we keep adding more product lines.

How are you responding to the surging demand for semiconductors/chip shortages in the global market?

The Lehi fab came to the TI stable as our fourth 300-mm wafer fab manufacturing unit. This investment is a great asset and will help us ramp up advanced semiconductor processor manufacturing. A few months ago we also introduced new purchasing features on TI.com for our customers in India to facilitate a localised faster and convenient buying experience.

These include payment options through online banking credit cards and a line of credit purchasing options in local currency to make it as easy as possible to get authentic TI products.

The chip industry is fast consolidating; will you opt for a more aggressive and acquisitive posture?

TI has been steadily growing every year and we have been recording strong results with increasing market share. We remain focused on investing in our people R&D and manufacturing.

We continue to strengthen our presence in industrial and automotive driving innovation and building products that customers want.

What is TI’s contribution towards making electronics more affordable through semiconductors?

TI has market leadership in power electronics. We work on a complete set of products for electric and hybrid-electric automotive markets including power electronics for motor drives real-time control units and various sensors. Market adoption of EVs in this decade has definitely pushed more technology innovations to be made available at the right price points.

Along with a strong market presence in ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) we have several plays in automotive markets where semiconductor content is continually rising.

Rapid progress is also being made on medical signal chain and we are delivering competitive products for markets such as CT X-rays and ultrasound. Communication markets are accelerating with 5G+ technology and we contribute to signal chain and RF technologies.

What makes analog increasingly relevant today?

Quite simply — all real-world signals are analog and these need to be processed. We need to condition and process these signal chains for humans or machines and that means there will always be a need for analog signal processing. That said TI also does a lot of work in the digital space and for thousands of our products we need analog digital and software competencies.",,,,,,,,,

Tune into a NFL game today and you’ll likely spot coaches and players using a Surface tablet to review past plays. Millions of people watching football in the fall are exposed to Microsoft’s devices which have become a permanent part of the 102-year-old league.

But when the deal was signed it was a big risk. And Xbox more than Surface was the focal point.

Yet the partnership ended up changing football forever and perhaps saved Microsoft’s tablet brand in the process. It now serves as a marketing case study for a successful sports tech partnership.

“It’s a feel good story” said Brian Hall a former Microsoft exec who helped lead the Surface business when the NFL deal kicked off. “It’s been a great outcome.”

Earlier this NFL season Hall shared behind-the-scenes insights about the deal. “This thing had EVERY opportunity to fail along the way!” he tweeted.

The deal worth a reported $400 million over five years — and later extended in 2020 — was originally set up to be all about Xbox according to Hall. Microsoft wanted to use the partnership to showcase how people could use their Xbox to watch live games and access fantasy football stats.

“For fans the NFL on Xbox will provide the most complete way to enjoy live football by bringing the first fully-integrated fantasy football experience to the TV exclusively through Xbox” Don Mattrick then-president of the Interactive Entertainment Business at Microsoft said in a press release at the time.

That vision — using an Xbox to watch live football — never caught on. The latest Xbox Series X|S consoles aren’t even able to connect to a cable or satellite receiver.

The Surface meanwhile was a much different story — but the first few years on the field didn’t exactly go smoothly.

‘iPad-like tool’

After the deal was announced it took a year before the tablets were ready for in-game use. Microsoft had to develop a custom ruggedized weatherproof version of its “tablet PC” which had just debuted to the public in 2012. The NFL’s competition committee also had to approve the use of such technology.

It was a rocky start to say the least. In 2014 commentators referred to the Surface as an “iPad-like tool.” One month later quarterback Jay Cutler called the devices “knockoff iPads.” Bill Belichick and Aaron Rodgers made headlines for throwing the tablets (the devices can withstand such force by the way).

Then in 2016 the New England Patriots weren’t able to access their tablets during a game against the Denver Broncos.

A column headline from the Chicago Tribune from that year: Microsoft Surface NFL marketing flop. At a cost of only $400 million.

The deal was turning into a marketing disaster. But those fumbles may have been a blessing in disguise for Microsoft.

People were talking about the Surface. It gave the company a chance to educate the public about its new hardware.

3/ The best thing that happened was Surfaces being called iPads in the first year. Internally it was a sht-show – basically me called out as a clown. but umm – that's why we did this! the world saw tablet-thingies as ""iPads"" & we were addressing! +we got make-goods from TV co's! — Brian Hall (@IsForAt) August 29 2021

The timing of this was crucial as the Surface brand “needed work” Hall said. Sales of the first few models also weren’t meeting expectations for Microsoft’s challenger to Apple’s iPad.

Eventually NFL announcers stopped calling the tablets iPads. Microsoft continued to refine the device adding new features such as real-time collaboration between the coaches’ booth and sideline. Teams can now access images within 2-to-3 seconds after a play.

Microsoft stayed in the game so to speak. And it paid off big.

“We had tenacity” said Microsoft sports marketing leader James Bernstrom. “We wanted to get it done.”

Game-changer

Gone are the days of sending still photographs on a wire from the coaches booth to the field — yes they actually did this — or waiting precious minutes for a printer to pump out black-and-white thermal images to review previous plays with a three-ring binder.

“The device is such an important tool in allowing us to do our jobs the best that we can. It’s flawless” said Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur in a video the NFL published earlier this year showing how the tablets have helped players make key in-game changes.

Microsoft now powers 269 NFL events each year with more than 2000 Surface devices and 170 Windows servers installed at 30 stadiums.

In the meantime the NFL’s popularity and viewership continues to climb. The 2021 Thanksgiving games posted their highest viewership numbers since 1998 with an average of 29.7 million fans watching up 9% from last year.

The Surface was even featured in Microsoft’s Super Bowl ad two years ago.

“It has been huge for the Surface brand” Bernstrom said of the partnership.

If it wasn’t for the NFL the Surface brand may not have existed much longer according to Hall.

“The NFL deal probably prevented dumb things from happening” he said.

The Surface family has grown from just hybrid tablets to include laptops desktops whiteboards and even a dual-screen Android device. It’s become an important business for Microsoft which uses Surface computers tablets and devices as a way for the company to advance new form factors in the industry providing a blueprint for other hardware makers to follow.

The Surface-NFL deal also laid a foundation for a number of sports-related partnerships between Microsoft and other leagues including the NBA PGA Tour La Liga and more.

So what’s next for the Surface on the sidelines? There are a few promising possibilities.

It may take time — getting NFL coaches to accept and adopt in-game tech can be a slow process — but instant video replays on the tablets would be a huge step-up from static images.

Enhanced real-time data such as Next Gen Stats at coaches’ fingertips could add a dynamic new layer to in-game strategy.

One thing is certain: the Surfaces are here to stay.

“We’re always thinking about what could be next” Bernstrom said. “And with our technology the sky’s the limit.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9taWNyb3NvZnQtd29yZC1yZXZpZXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Word review,"Microsoft Word is the original productivity application and is still a market leader thanks to features that should put a smile on the face of 21st-century creatives.

Professionals in a range of fields consider Microsoft Word an indispensable productivity application and since 1983 Microsoft Word users have happily been able to write documents and format their text in numerous ways.

The application’s current capabilities extend far beyond text formatting though to include features like instant translation web page formatting and 3D model insertion. With all these new features Microsoft Word is even set to challenge other Office application PowerPoint as some of the best presentation software available.

In this Microsoft Word review we’ll assess all aspects of the application from price to support so you can decide if it’s the best word processing application for you.

Contemporary Microsoft Word does much more than format text (Image credit: Microsoft Word)

Microsoft Word: Plans and pricing

Paid plans include a minimum of 200 times more cloud storage than free plans (Image credit: Microsoft Word)

Microsoft Word has a free application called Word Mobile which allows you to edit Word documents on your mobile phone and read them on laptops desktops and tablets. Word Mobile is insufficient for creating and editing professional documents. Those who want free office software with more features than Word Mobile can use Office Online which includes all formatting options of a paid plan and allows you to store up to 5GB of documents on the cloud.

Microsoft encourages those who want an Office application to purchase a Microsoft 365 subscription instead of a one-time purchase. One-time purchases cost $149.99 and do not include updates technical support advanced security or license-free content to name only a few of the features inclusive to the subscription plans.

Business users can choose a Microsoft 365 subscription with no security features for only $8.25 user/mo. Microsoft 365 plans for businesses that include Word and enhanced security measures also provide collaboration tools. Business users can choose between a $12.50 user/month Standard Plan or a $20.00 user/month Premium Plan with the more expensive plan including enhanced cybersecurity measures.

Microsoft Word: Features

Translate is one of many great features available on Word today (Image credit: Microsoft Word)

Microsoft Word is no longer a simple word processor. New features make it indispensable for professionals who need to give presentations as often as they take notes.

Insert 3D models from a file into Word documents as you would 2D images. If you don’t have your own 3D model on file search Word’s catalog of license-free media for a 3D model you like. You can tilt models and alter size so they cohere with the rest of your document.

Subscription versions of Microsoft Word allow you to access Microsoft’s huge library of icons. Icons include representations of individuals with accessibility requirements road signage iconography and stylized renderings of animals. You can rotate resize and color icons without losing image quality.

Translate a whole document or sections of text into other languages to share your work with those you can’t share a conversation with.

With a touch-enabled device or trackpad draw liberally on Microsoft Word documents. Choose the thickness of pen and color then scribble away. You can use ink to draw shapes or highlight text.

Learn how accessible your document is to those with access needs with Microsoft’s Accessibility Checker. It not only tells you how your document may be inaccessible to those with specific needs but also provides solutions.

Microsoft Word: Interface and in use

Microsoft Word has an easy to use interface to make complex projects simple (Image credit: Microsoft Word)

When you’ve chosen your Microsoft 365 subscription or made a one-time purchase download your application via the link provided. Once your package has downloaded click the file and install it on your device. When it’s installed you’ll be able to open Microsoft Word from your menu or taskbar.



Microsoft Word makes it easy to find what you’re looking for as all menu options and features are named to represent their function. When you first open Word on a laptop or desktop it gives you the option of selecting from recent files templates or a blank document. Word Mobile works the same but can be uncomfortable to navigate on a small mobile device.

Once you’ve selected your recent file blank document or template write away. Select Insert Draw or Design from the menu bar to add visual elements to your document. Every tool you need is a couple of clicks away.

Microsoft Word: Support

Individual Microsoft users and family plan users with technical issues can only solicit help from Microsoft’s Virtual Agent who may connect you with a human chat operator if it can’t solve your problem. Business users can submit a service request via their admin console or call a telephone customer service representative.

Microsoft Word: Security

Choose a subscription over a one-time purchase for cybersecurity protection (Image credit: Microsoft Word)

Microsoft 365 subscribers benefit from enhanced cybersecurity protection that one-time purchasers do not have access to. If file security is important to you choose an Microsoft 365 subscription over a paid plan as ransomware detection and recovery are included as standard. Users can also choose to enable two-factor authentication on their most personal files. Business users on the Standard Plan enjoy the same cybersecurity protections as personal users.

Those on the Business Premium Plan will also benefit from advanced threat protection. This includes tools to detect hidden ransomware and guard against insider threats. Word files can be remotely wiped from devices in cases of loss or theft.

The competition

Google Docs is undoubtedly Microsoft Word’s biggest competitor (Image credit: Microsoft Word)

The best alternative to Microsoft Office is Google Workspace and Google Docs is offered as a rival to Word. It is entirely online unlike Microsoft Word so users do not have to download an application to their desktop or laptop. Most importantly it is free to use for individual users.

Google Docs makes it easy for users to collaborate on documents in real-time as the document creator simply needs to grant editing rights to another user. Microsoft Word users can also do this but only with the collaboration suite Microsoft Teams.

However Google Doc images do lose granularity at a higher rate than those on Microsoft Word making it less appealing when creating complex presentations with visual elements. Additionally Google Docs is not so user-friendly and can suffer from formatting issues when converting files. Microsoft Word is easily superior.

Final verdict

Microsoft Word is the best word processing application available on the market today. If you want to incorporate graphic elements into presentations its features greatly surpass those available on Google Docs. There are few reasons to choose a one-time purchase and be stuck with aging software so choose a subscription plan for enhanced cybersecurity protection.

What makes these phishing emails especially convincing is the use of quarantine[at]messaging.microsoft.com to send them to potential targets and the display name matching the recipients' domains.

Additionally the attackers have embedded the official Office 365 logo and included links to Microsoft's privacy statement and acceptable use policy at the end of the email.

Luckily the phishing messages come with text formatting issues and out-of-place extra spaces that would allow spotting these emails' malicious nature on closer inspection.

""The email subject is 'Spam Notification: 1 New Messages' alluding to the body of the email that informs the recipient that a spam message has been blocked and is being held in quarantine for them to review"" cloud email security provider MailGuard who spotted this campaign said.

""Details of the 'Prevented spam message' are provided with scammers personalizing the subject heading as '[company domain] Adjustment: Transaction Expenses Q3 UPDATE' to create a sense of urgency and using a finance-related message.""

Office 365 spam alert phishing sample (MailGuard)

The targets are given 30 days to review the quarantined messages by going to Microsoft's Security and Compliance Center by clicking on an embedded link.

However instead of reaching the Office 365 portal when clicking the 'Review' button they are sent to a phishing landing page that will ask them to enter their Microsoft credentials to access the quarantined spam messages.

After entering their credentials in the malicious form displayed on the phishing page their accounts' details get sent to attacker-controlled servers.

If they fall victim to these tricks the victims' Microsoft credentials will later be used by the cybercriminals to take control of their accounts and gain access to all their information.

""Providing your Microsoft account details to cybercriminals means that they have unauthorised access to your sensitive data such as contact information calendars email communications and more"" MailGuard added.

Appealing target for phishing attacks

Office 365 users are continuously targeted in phishing campaigns attempting to harvest their credentials and use them in fraudulent schemes.

Microsoft revealed in August that a highly evasive spear-phishing campaign targeted Office 365 customers in multiple waves of attacks beginning with July 2020.

In March the company also warned of a phishing operation that stole roughly 400000 OWA and Office 365 credentials since December 2020 and later expanded to abuse new legitimate services to circumvent secure email gateways (SEGs) protections.

In late January Redmond further notified Microsoft Defender ATP subscribers of an increasing number of OAuth phishing (consent phishing) attacks targeting remote workers.

If successful the impact of phishing attacks ranges from identity theft and fraud schemes including but not limited to Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks.

For instance since last year the FBI has warned of BEC scammers abusing popular cloud email services including Microsoft Office 365 and Google G Suite in Private Industry Notifications issued in March and April 2020.

The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has also revealed that the number of identity theft reports doubled last year compared to 2019 reaching a record of 1.4 million reports within a single year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Jlc2VhcmNoL2xhYi9taWNyb3NvZnQtcmVzZWFyY2gtYXNpYS9hcnRpY2xlcy9maXZlLXJlYXNvbnMtdG8tZW1icmFjZS10cmFuc2Zvcm1lci1pbi1jb21wdXRlci12aXNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five reasons to embrace Transformer in computer vision,"A unified modeling story for artificial intelligence

“Unity” is a common goal in many disciplines. For example in the field of physics scientists have long been pursuing the grand unification theory which is a single theory that can be used to explain the interaction between different forces. There is also a similar goal of “unity” in the field of artificial intelligence. In the current wave of deep learning we have made a large stride towards achieving the goal of unity. For example we usually follow the same process for new AI tasks : collect data label it define network architectures and train network parameters. However in different AI sub-fields basic modeling methods vary and are not uniform. In natural language processing (NLP) the current dominant modeling network is Transformer; in computer vision (CV) for a long time the dominant architecture was convolutional neural networks (CNN); in social computing field the dominant architecture is graph networks; and so on.

However the situation has changed since the end of last year when Transformer began to demonstrate revolutionary performance improvements for a variety of computer vision tasks. This indicates that CV and NLP modeling could potentially be unified under the Transformer architecture. This trend is highly beneficial for both fields: 1) it can facilitate joint modeling of visual and textual signals; 2) it can enable better sharing of modeling knowledge between the two fields which would accelerate progress in both fields.

Transformer’s outstanding performance in visual tasks

The pioneering work of Vision Transformer is ViT [1] published by Google on ICLR2021. It divides images into patches (e.g. 16×16 pixels) and treat them as “tokens” in NLP. Then a standard Transformer encoder is applied to these “tokens” and the image is classified according to the output feature of the “CLS” token. Using a vast amount of pre-training data i.e. Google’s internal 300 million-image classification dataset JFT-300M it achieved top-1 accuracy of 88.55% on the ImageNet-1K validation set setting a new record for this benchmark.

ViT applies Transformer on images in a simple and straightforward way where because it does not carefully consider the characteristics of visual signals it is mainly used for image classification tasks. The capabilities of Transformer on tasks of other granularity levels remain unknown and the academic community has carried out a lot of work to this end. Among the efforts the Swin Transformer [2] significantly refreshed previous records on object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks giving the community greater confidence that the Transformer structure will become the new mainstream for visual modeling. Specifically on COCO an important object detection benchmark Swin Transformer obtained 58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP which were respectively 2.7 and 2.6 points higher than the previous best single-model method. A few months later performance accuracy on this benchmark was further raised to 61.3 box AP and 53.0 mask AP by improving the detection framework and making better use of the data. Swin Transformer has also achieved significant performance improvements on the ADE20K an important evaluation benchmark for semantic segmentation reaching 53.5 mIoU which is 3.2 mIoU higher than the previous best approach. The accuracy was further improved to 57.0 mIoU within a few months.

In addition to excelling in object detection and semantic segmentation tasks the Swin Transformer based approaches have also demonstrated strong performance in many visual tasks including video motion recognition [3] visual self-supervised learning [4][5] image restoration [6] pedestrian Re-ID [7] medical image segmentation [8] etc.

The main idea of the Swin Transformer is simple: combine the Transformer architecture which is powerful in modeling with several important visual signal priors. These priors include hierarchy locality and translation invariance. An important design in the Swin Transformer is the shifted non-overlapping windows which unlike traditional sliding windows are more hardware-friendly and can result in faster actual running speed. As shown on the left-hand side of the following figure in the sliding window design different points use different neighborhood windows to calculate the relationship which is hardware unfriendly. As shown by the right sub-figure in the non-overlapping windows used by Swin Transformer the points within a same window are calculated using the same neighborhoods and are more speed friendly. Actual speed tests show that the non-overlapping window method is about two times faster than the sliding window approach. In addition shifting is done in two consecutive layers. In layer L the window partitioning starts from the upper-left corner of an image and in Layer L-1 the window partitioning shifts half a window downwards and to the right. This design ensures that there is information exchange between windows that do not overlap.

Over the past half a year numerous variants of Vision Transformers have emerged from academia including DeiT [9] LocalViT [10] Twins [11] PvT [12] T2T-ViT [13] ViL [14] CvT [15] CSwin [16] Focal Transformer [17] Shuffle Transformer [18] etc.

Five reasons to embrace Transformer in Computer Vision

In addition to refreshing the performance records of many visual tasks Vision Transformers have demonstrated many benefits over previous CNN architectures. In fact over the past four years academics have been exploiting the benefits of Transformers in computer vision which can be summed up in five aspects as shown in the following illustration.

Reason 1: General modeling capabilities

Transformer’s general modeling capabilities come from two aspects. On one hand Transformer can be seen as performing on a graph. The graph is fully connected and the relationships between nodes are learned in a data-driven way. Transformer modeling is highly versatile because any concept whether concrete or abstract can be represented by nodes in a graph and the relationship between concepts can be characterized by graph edges.

On the other hand Transformer has good generality in establishing the relationships between graph nodes through a philosophy of validation: no matter how heterogeneous the nodes are their relationships can be established by projecting them into an aligned space to calculate similarity. As shown on the right-hand side of the following illustration the graph nodes can be either image patches of different scales or text input such as “player” and Transformer can well depict the relationships between these heterogeneous nodes.

Likely because of this versatile modeling capability Transformer along with the attention units it relies on can be applied to a wide variety of visual tasks. To be specific computer vision mainly involves two basic granularity elements to process: pixels and objects and so computer vision tasks mainly involve the three kinds of relationships between these basic elements: pixel-to-pixel object-to-pixel and object-to-object. Previously the first two relationship types were mainly implemented by convolution and RoIAlign respectively and the last relationship was often disregarded in modeling. However the attention unit in Transformer can be applied to all three basic relational modeling types because of its general modeling capability. In recent years there have been a lot of representative work in this area including: 1) non-local networks [19] where Xiaolong Wang et al. used attention units to model pixel-to-pixel relationships and demonstrated that attention units could help with tasks such as video action classification and object detection and Yuhui Yuan et al. applied it to semantic segmentation achieving significant performance improvements [20]; 2) object relation networks [21] where attention units have been used to model object relationships in object detection and this module has also been widely used in video object analysis [222324]; 3) modeling the relationship between objects and pixels with typical works including DETR [25] Learn Region Feat [26] RelationNet++ [27] etc.

Reason 2: Convolution complementarity

Convolution is a local operation and a convolution layer typically models only the relationships between neighborhood pixels. Transformer is a global operation and a Transformer layer can model the relationships between all pixels. The two-layer types complement each other very well. Non-local networks were the first to leverage this complementarity [19] where a small number of Transformer self-attention units were inserted into several places of the original convolution networks as a complement. This has been shown to be widely effective in solving vision problems in object detection semantic segmentation and video action recognition.

Since then it has also been found that non-local networks have difficulty in truly learning the second order pairwise relationship between pixels and pixels in computer vision [28]. To address this issue certain improvements have been proposed for this model such as disentangled non-local networks (DNL) [29].

Reason 3: Stronger modeling capabilities

Convolution can be thought of as a template matching approach with the same template filtering across different locations in an image. The attention unit in Transformer is an adaptive filter and the filter weights are determined by the composability of two pixels. This type of computing module possesses stronger modeling abilities.

The local relational network (LR-Net) [30] and SASA [31] were the first methods used to apply Transformer as an adaptive computing module to visual backbone networks. They both limited self-attention computation to a local sliding window and achieved better accuracy than ResNet using the same theoretical computational budget. However while the computational complexity is the same as ResNet in theory LR-Net is much slower to use in practice. One of the main reasons is that different queries use different key sets which makes it less friendly for memory access as shown on the left-hand side of Figure 2.

Swin Transformer proposed a new local window design called shifted windows. This local window method divides the image into non-overlapping windows so that within the same window the collection of keys used by different queries would be the same resulting in better actual computational speed. In the next layer the window configuration moves half a window downwards and to the right constructing connection between pixels of different windows from the previous layer.

Reason 4: Scalability to model and data size

In the NLP field the Transformer models have demonstrated great scalability in terms of big models and big data. In the following figure the blue curve shows that the model size in NLP has increased rapidly in recent years and we have all witnessed the powerful capabilities of large-scale models such as Microsoft’s Turing model Google’s T5 model and OpenAI’s GPT-3 model.

The emergence of Vision Transformers has also provided an important foundation for the growth of vision models. The largest vision model is Google’s ViT-MoE model which has 15 billion parameters. These large models have set new records on the ImageNet-1K classification.

Reason 5: Better connection of visuals and language

In previous visual problems we have usually only dealt with object categories in the dozens or hundreds. For example the COCO object detection task contains 80 object categories and the ADE20K semantic segmentation task contains 150 categories. The invention and development of Vision Transformer models has brought the vision and NLP fields closer to each other which helps to connect visual and NLP modeling and links visual tasks to all semantics involved in language. Pioneering work in this area include OpenAI’s CLIP [33] and DALL-E [34].

Considering the above advantages we believe that Vision Transformers will usher in a new era of computer vision modeling and we look forward to working together with both academics and industry researchers to further explore the opportunities and challenges that this new modeling approach presents to the visual field.

""When is a new covid variant good news? When you're a pharma shareholder obviously.""

Based on data compiled by Global Justice Now and released Saturday ""just 8 top Pfizer and Moderna shareholders"" added a combined $10.31 billion to their fortunes last week after stock prices soared in response to the emergence of Omicron. According to a statement by the group:

Moderna's shares skyrocketed after the announcement and settled at $310.61/share on Wednesday 1 December up 13.61% from $273.39/share since Wednesday 24 November the day before the announcement. Pfizer's shares rose by 7.41% from $50.91/share to $54.68/share. Moderna's CEO Stephane Bancel personally became more than $824m richer in the week after the announcement with the value of his shares rising from $6052522978 to $6876528630. He sold off 10000 shares for $319 each on 26 November the day after the variant was announced cashing out $3.19 million. At close of business on Tuesday Bancel's shares had grown by $1.7 billion since the announcement before falling after the company lost a legal dispute over patents. Bancel has refused to share the recipe for Moderna's vaccine with the World Health Organisation to help scale-up manufacturing of mRNA vaccines through its new hub in South Africa. WHO scientists are now trying to reverse-engineer the vaccine. His company is also waging a legal battle to erase the role of massive public funding and public scientists in developing the jab.

With nations in the European Union the United Kingdom and others continuing to block a demand for a vaccine patent waiver at the World Trade Organization public health campaigners have hammered government leaders for doing the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry. Anger has become especially harsh because the emergence of new and dangerous variants was predicted as the likely outcome if nations did not move swiftly to vaccinate the world by making shots universally available.

""Pharmaceutical companies knew that grotesque levels of vaccine inequality would create prime conditions for new variants to emerge. They let Covid-19 spread unabated in low and middle-income countries.""

""Pharmaceutical companies knew that grotesque levels of vaccine inequality would create prime conditions for new variants to emerge"" said Tim Bierley pharma campaigner at Global Justice Now. ""They let Covid-19 spread unabated in low and middle-income countries. And now the same pharma execs and shareholders are making a killing from a crisis they helped to create. It's utterly obscene.""

""At every turn"" he continued ""these companies have obstructed efforts to more equitably distribute vaccines around the world. They have made more than enough money from the pandemic selling two of the most lucrative drugs in history. It's time to hand over the recipe for these essential medicines to the WHO so we can finally end this pandemic.""

While a scheduled decision on the WTO patent waiver was postponed last week progressives worldwide have insisted that there will be no end to the global pandemic until vaccine apartheid is brought to an end.

Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz and trade expert Lori Wallach argued in an op-ed last week that the pandemic cannot be defeated until the waiver is approved.

""As the Omicron variant shows as long as there are raging outbreaks anywhere Covid-19 will mutate and the possibility of more infectious or deadly strains increases"" the pair wrote. ""That's why unless people everywhere are vaccinated we face the prospect of an endless pandemic.""

When the ""underlying problem is a lack of global supply"" they argued--and more vaccines and boosters will be needed to fend off variants--the WTO waiver ""is an obvious way of increasing supply and helping put an end to the pandemic for good.""

And as Bierley said ""It's long past time for the UK and the EU to stand on the side of global health instead of vaccine billionaires--and get behind an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines tests and treatments.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVGhpc1dlZWsvdmlkZW8vZXhjbHVzaXZlLWluc2lkZS1tb2Rlcm5hLWhlYWRxdWFydGVycy04MTU2OTI4NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video An exclusive look inside Moderna headquarters,An exclusive look inside Moderna headquarters Martha Raddatz goes inside Moderna as the company races to update its vaccines.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndkcmIuY29tL21vZGVybmEtc2hvdC1hdC1jdnMtLS1hcC1maWxlLWpwZWcvaW1hZ2VfMDVhNWM4ZjgtNTUzMi0xMWVjLTk2ZjYtOGZjNDM3NDZlOGViLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moderna shot at CVS - AP FILE.jpeg,"Articles Sorry there are no recent results for popular articles.

Armpit pain is a recognised side effect of the Moderna and Pfizer -BioNTech covid vaccines - the ones that use mRNA (messenger RNA) technology. While it can be painful it is usually entirely normal and generally does not require medical intervention.

This reaction was seen during the trials of both Moderna and Pfizer -BioNTech vaccines and is a normal reaction of the immune system. Because of this doctors are keen to allay fears about armpit pain reactions and avoid unnecessary testing or treatment for something that will resolve by itself in a short period of time.

According to the New York Times 11.6% of patients in the Moderna study had such a reaction after the first dose and 16% after the second while with the Pfizer-BioNTech there was a lower reported rate at only 0.3% of participants.

What causes the armpit pain from covid-19 vaccines?

The pain in the armpit is caused by swollen lymph nodes in the area. The lymph nodes small bean-shaped glands are an important part of the immune system and the ones in the armpit are the closest to the vaccine injection site. The lymph nodes become swollen and painful because they are doing their job and reacting to the introduction of the vaccine that stimulates the immune system.

The booster shots are the same formulation as the standard vaccine although the Moderna booster is a half-dose compared to the primary series.

According to the American Medical Association’s President Gerald Harmon “data presented… showed that adverse events following mRNA booster doses are similar to or lower than those seen after the primary vaccine series.”

There’s still time to get your first shot your booster shot or to get your children vaccinated before Christmas. Get vaccinated. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) November 30 2021

Medical advice recommends the following to treat armpit pain from swollen lymph nodes caused by the covid-19 vaccine:

- resting

- drinking plenty of fluids

- taking painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (do not give aspirin to children under 16; always be careful when taking paracetamol that no other product you are taking also contains paracetamol - overdosing can be seriously dangerous causing potentially lethal harm to your liver).

The issue with mammograms and swollen lymph nodes

According to doctors it is best to schedule mammograms at least a month after your last dose of mRNA vaccine because the swollen lymph nodes can look similar on the scan to early signs of breast cancer. However if postponing would mean waiting a long time the general recommendation would be to go ahead with the mammogram but advise your care provider that you recently received a covid-19 vaccine.

When to call a doctor with armpit pain from covid-19 vaccination

Armpit pain can affect the vaccine recipients ability to go about their daily activities particularly sport or where they do physical work. The CDC recommends calling a doctor or healthcare provider if the side effects have become “worrying” or do not “seem to be going away after a few days”.

Other covid-19 vaccine information

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers the following information on covid-19 vaccines saying the covid-19 vaccines are “safe and effective”. This has been demonstrated in industry-standard trials and “millions of people in the United States have received covid-19 vaccines under the most intense safety monitoring in US history”.

The CDC’s recommendation is that everyone over the age of five gets vaccinated as soon as possible to protect against covid-19 and the potentially severe complications it can cause that include death even in young patients.",,,

Chasin’ Dreams Farm maker of popped sorghum snacks is one of nine early-stage brands selected to receive support from Mondelez International Inc. The San Diego-based startup recently launched an equity crowdfunding campaign to fuel expansion and has added Tate’s Bake Shop founder Kathleen King as an investor in the business.

Sydney Chasin founder and chief executive officer of Chasin’ Dreams Farm uses terms like “quasi-indulgent” and “snackvention” to describe her products which feature regeneratively farmed sorghum a drought-resilient crop that is air-popped and lightly coated with tapioca syrup and seasonings. Varieties include sweet and salty cocoa and cinnamon. Resembling miniature kernels of popcorn the products are significantly lower in fat than leading ready-to-eat popcorn brands corn-free and with no hulls.

“We think that delicious indulgent snacks are packed full of questionable ingredients and genetically modified corn and better-for-you snacks and better ingredients including ancient grains are perceived as boring bland and lacking taste appeal” Ms. Chasin said. “What we aim to do is make better-for-you clean label snacks and we’re giving ancient grains as we say the ‘glow-up’ they deserve.”

The products are available online at chasindreamsfarm.com Bubble Goods and SnackMagic as well as in more than 150 natural and specialty food stores. Chasin’ Dreams Farm is raising money to expand retail and foodservice distribution build its team and fund marketing activities. Last year the company was chosen to be part of natural products distributor KeHE’s accelerator program for new and emerging brands.

Previously dubbed Lil Pops the brand’s name was changed last year to allow for additional innovations beyond popped sorghum. The new name was inspired by the family farm where Ms. Chasin grew up as a child diagnosed with celiac disease years before gluten-free products were delicious nutritious and widely available she said.

“Out of necessity back then I was crafting and snacking on what some would call weird ingredients from my earliest memories” she said. “There weren’t good gluten-free flour blends. I was buying sorghum and teff flour and combining it myself.”

Beginning in June Chasin’ Dreams Farm will join eight other snack makers to participate in CoLab a 12-week program led by Mondelez International’s SnackFutures unit offering workshops one-on-one mentorship and $20000 grants. Mondelez will provide tools technologies access to company leadership and industry expertise while gaining insights capabilities and potential investment opportunities. The program will culminate in a final showcase for brands to pitch to key stakeholders.

“I am beyond excited for Chasin’ Dreams Farm to be selected as one of nine brands to join Mondelez International’s inaugural CoLab program” Ms. Chasin said. “I so greatly look forward to learning from ‘big food’ and taking corporate practices we find fit and applying them to our scrappy agile startup ways. Beyond the financial component and educational programming I can't wait to meet our 2021 CoLab cohort and learn from fellow snackpreneurs who like us wish to see a better snack-filled future.”

“Our dreams are far bigger than just pops.”

— Sydney Chasin Chasin' Dreams Farm

Through her crowdfunding campaign at Republic.co she hopes to raise between $25000 to $1070000 through early September. Until recently only high-net worth individuals or institutions were permitted to invest in private companies. A regulatory framework enacted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission allows founders to sell ownership or a financial stake in the company through online portals to non-accredited investors.

“It’s great for us because we have so many business associates a great network of people who may not be able to write the $50000 check that other people can” Ms. Chasin said. “And people who have been interested in investing since forever can finally come in and be a part of this.”

Looking ahead Ms. Chasin hinted at other products in the pipeline slated to launch in the coming years that will be “corn-free never genetically modified gluten-free and super fun.”

“Our dreams are far bigger than just pops and we’re creating a platform for better-for-you more-fun-for-you clean label snacks” she said. “The way we look at future innovation… is where can we take nostalgic favorites nothing that is polarizing to anyone nothing overly fancy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyLzA0L2J1c2luZXNzL2Vjb25vbXktYnVzaW5lc3MvamFwYW4tc2hyaW5rZmxhdGlvbi1lY29ub215L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As global costs soar Japan's 'shrinkflation' gets harder to swallow,"It was a chocolate biscuit that turned Masayuki Iwasa a self-professed penny-pincher with a sweet tooth into one of Japan's most scrupulous chroniclers of ""shrinkflation.""

In April 2019 she was announced as the successor to Amir Shamsi the erstwhile Managing Director of Cadbury Nigeria Plc. By this development she became the first female MD of the company in its over 50 years of existence.

After consciously building a career in finance strategy and business administration both in Nigeria and the United Kingdom for over two decades one can almost say that Oyeyimika had spent all the years preparing for the top. Her appointment was a testament to the company’s commitment to promoting gender equality diversity and inclusion as well as their sharp eye for fine talent.

Oyeyimika was born to late Chief Timothy Adeola Odutola a foremost entrepreneur of his time. It is on record that he was one of the pioneers of indigenous manufacturing in Nigeria alongside the likes of Alhassan Dantata (Aliko Dangote’s great grandfather) and Louis Ojukwu (father of Odimegwu Ojuwku the Biafran leader) and was the first President of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) when the body was formed.

Being daughter to the man who created a “multimillion-dollar conglomerate including three factories a retail franchise a cattle ranch a 5000-acre plantation a sawmill and an exporting business before the end of British colonial rule in 1960” must have been an inspiration in addition to having a mother who was a very successful businesswoman. Oyeyimika recalled in an interview that her parents were her role models.

After her basic and secondary education she proceeded to the University College Cardiff Wales where she bagged a Bachelor of Science honours degree in Economics & Accountancy in 1986. She also got executive management education certification in Finance and Business Administration from the Institute of Management Development (IMD) Lausanne Switzerland between 2000 and 2007.

After graduation Oyeyimika started her career as an articled clerk with a United Kingdom accounting practice Midgley Snelling & Co. Chartered Accountants and was on this job while she qualified as a Chartered Accountant. She became a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Nigeria.

She returned to Nigeria in the 90s and took up a job with the erstwhile Nigerian Accounting and Tax Practice of Arthur Andersen & Co for a couple of years. From there she moved to Nigerian Bottling Company Plc in 1994 as the Director of Finance and Chief Financial Officer for about 13 years.

Returning to Nigeria from the United Kingdom was a career-defining moment for Oyeyimika and she recalls the trigger event thus: “My first “ah-ah” moment was triggered by a conversation I had with an English friend and colleague who was a senior manager in a firm while I was still working in the UK. She had worked in this firm for many years but remained a senior manager while the firm admitted other male managers into partnership.

“She didn’t seem bothered about this and simply admitted that she was not expecting to be made a partner in that firm because it was a “traditional” English firm. It dawned on me that my career limitation in the UK may be two-fold – female and black. The decision to relocate back to Nigeria was not a tough one (in any case my father wanted me back home – for other reasons).”

In November 2008 Oyeyimika was headhunted to join the board of Cadbury West Africa as Finance and Strategy Director West Africa; and a director on the board of Cadbury Ghana Ltd. She was also a member of the audit committee of the company until October 19 2016. She is a member of the executive management committee and member of the risk assessment committee of Cadbury Nigeria.

She spent a total of 10 years and seven months with Cadbury before being appointed as MD Cadbury Nigeria Plc in April 2019. Her LinkedIn profile confirms that she also became MD Mondelez (Cadbury) West Africa two months later. Mondelēz International is the parent company of Cadbury Nigeria Plc.

Outside work she sits on the Board of Trustees of the Timothy Adeola Odutola Foundation named after her father. The foundation targets its philanthropic activities towards providing educational industrial and technological development for Nigerian youths that may be unable to gain admission into tertiary institutions for their higher education.

Oyeyimika Adeboye also serves as the chairperson of the advisory board of Genesis House a home for disadvantaged young women which was set up by Freedom Foundation. She is also a member of the board of The Parity in Income and Education Foundation.",,,,,,

How I got started

“I walked into PricewaterhouseCoopers on Sixth Avenue. I just asked the security guards who the HR person was. One of the guys said: ‘Let me call her up. I know who she is. She has the most visitors.’ I’m practically shaking in my boots. I go up to meet her. And [after talking] she says ‘You seem like you’re qualified. Why don’t you join one of our Super Saturdays?’”

This was how Vanna Krantz the new CFO at Passport a transportation software and payments company got her first job in the U.S. in the mid-1990s at age 27. A chartered accountant with a degree from the University of Waterloo and experience as an auditor Krantz relocated from Canada to New York City with her husband so he could pursue an M.B.A. at Columbia University. The Ottawa-native didn’t have a job lined up. So she walked into PwC without an appointment and was willing to take a gamble. As a finance chief Krantz works to minimize risk. But when it comes to her managing her own career Krantz has a “willingness to take risks” she said.

‘I had three offers’

“I showed up [at PwC] on a Saturday at 9 a.m.” Krantz began. “I guess there was about eight partners [present] and all these guys who had graduated from business school. And I literally had three offers by the time I left. I would say it was a little bit of luck but also a little bit of skill.” Before coming to the U.S. she worked at the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto. In doing risk management at the bank “I felt like I was out of my league” she said. But little did Krantz know the knowledge she gained would help her land a job in the U.S. “I met all the requirements for immigration to stay in the country; thank God because I’ve got this husband who’s already going to school and so somebody is supposed to be paying the rent” Krantz quipped.

She joined PwC as a principal consultant in financial risk management amid a male-dominated environment. “Working in the bullpen of one of these accounting firms is a phenomenal way to learn” Krantz said. “I learned from all these guys.” But the learning curve included pointed feedback. “I remember that one of the partners in the first year said that I just didn’t have the same fire in my belly as everyone else did” she explained. “And I thought okay no problem here I go!” The job really helped her to prioritize work and learn the fundamentals of controls and auditing and finance at the accounting level Krantz said. At the beginning of your career it’s great to learn your job in person in the office but the pandemic may have changed that she noted. “I just saw that PricewaterhouseCoopers is allowing 40000 employees to work remotely so I kind of wonder how these people are going to learn in the same philosophy” she said. “What PwC did for me was it got me acclimated to the pace the vigor the exactness and the level of excellence that you needed in New York to be successful.”

‘We’re not staying in our seats’

After four years at PwC Krantz decided to move on to Merrill Lynch becoming VP of business analysis. But about two years into her time with the company the U.S. experienced the devastating terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) on September 11 2001.

She was working in Merrill Lynch offices in the World Financial Center near the WTC. After the onset of the attack on the Twin Towers in the WTC “even though most of the security guards were saying to stay in your seats this gentleman I have a lot of respect for him said ‘Nope we’re not saying in seats our seats we’re leaving.’ We were on a really low floor and walked out. All I can say is we lucked out.” Consequently Krantz changed jobs and began working Morgan Stanley as VP of finance reporting and analysis in the investment management division. During her time at the company she had her second child. Krantz remained for about a year “mostly due to the fact that I probably wasn’t as interested in the work and I think like a lot of women might do I struggled with what’s the right answer here for me?” she said.

At this time Lawrence Haber the CFO Krantz worked with when she was at Merrill Lynch became CFO at Credit Suisse Asset Management which was in Midtown Manhattan she said. Haber was looking to hire someone with the designation of a chartered financial analyst (CFA) “so they would have credibility with all the investment managers” Krantz said. She had earned a CFA and wound up joining the company as global head of business and financial analysis in the asset management division. “Luckily that worked out for me” Krantz said. Haber allowed for a flexible schedule of four days a week in the office and one day working from home she said. “It was kind of all I needed.” Krantz said. In the year 2003 “I was an anomaly” she commented. And at every job since then Krantz has worked from home on Fridays she said. “I got all my work done. I was really effective. It was just this thing that I started doing and people accepted it” Krantz said.

‘I remember crying on my 40th birthday’

Part of what was exciting about her position at Credit Suisse was the exposure and opportunity to be involved in high-level processes as a relatively junior person she said. When her boss got promoted to be the COO of Credit Suisse Asset Management in Zurich she decided to join a new company. “It was a tremendous opportunity [at Credit Suisse] but it was just time to move on” Krantz said.

“Now I’m going to Thomson Financial” she began. “I got hired as senior vice president of financial planning and analysis developing financial plans forecasts and long-range models and meanwhile I’ve never done FP&A … I’m there for two weeks and they buy Reuters. So now I’m on the deal team of bringing these two companies together for a year.” In 2008 Thomson Corp. and Reuters Group Plc merged into Thomson Reuters Corp. In her role Krantz interacted with the CFO of Reuters and the CFO of Thomson Corp. “I’m trying to bring not only the finance department together but obviously the businesses and [determining] how the pro-forma financial statements would look like once we get rolling as a combined company—all things I have legitimately never done” she said.

Krantz worked hard and at one point the stress took its toll. “I remember crying on my 40th birthday because I’m in the office and I’m working on something that I hardly understand and I’m trying to figure it out” she said. “I’m thinking ‘Is this really a better life?’” But turns out the answer was yes she said.

“I did figure it out” Krantz said. “I definitely had great relationships and connections with both of those CFOs.” When the organization decided there was going to be four divisional CFOs “I was chosen to be in the bakeoff for those roles” she said. That’s how Krantz got her first divisional CFO role— finance chief at Reuters Media. “I didn’t know the first thing about media; I was basically a financial services person” Krantz said. “The CEO of the media group thought that I could be a good CFO.”

Krantz referred to this role as “my CFO in training wheels job.” She continued “I interacted with the board and learned how to communicate with everyone in the business. I learned how to kind of argue or defend the business’ growth projections. I just learned a lot of things in that what I would call safe environment.” After four years she moved on to become the CFO of institutional equities “the bigger kind of more the main wheelhouse of Thomson Reuters” Krantz said.

This was between 2010 and 2011 “the time where there was a big cloud over financial services” she explained. “We were definitely scaling back. We were thinking about where we could win … I get a lot of credibility from other finance folks because I can be a little bit dispassionate [about a business decision]. So that’s worked in my favor. And I think for that kind of consolidation and cost savings time that came in handy.” After two years she was chosen to take on the role of CFO in the wealth management division. “That was a money-making machine” Krantz said. “I learned how to be a real growth company [and] tech company CFO.”

She remained in the role for four years. After a 10-year run in total with Thomson “I really wanted to be an independent company CFO” Krantz said. “I was really fortunate” she said. “I got connected to the big brand executive recruiters and that was before they were necessarily really looking for women if you know what I mean.” Now at many big companies there’s more of a push to have diverse candidates in senior leadership hiring slates that include more representation of women Krantz said.

A tech CFO

“At Bamtech Media I was a pretty decent technology CFO” she said. “And Bamtech Media was a technology company that ended up being purchased by [The Walt Disney Company] to do Disney streaming. I’d literally been there about two weeks.” Krantz wanted to work as an independent company CFO. “And now I’m going to be a divisional CFO again” she said.

However it worked in Krantz’s favor she said. “What a lucky move because now you get to be the CFO for Disney+ and ESPN+.” She initially thought the chairman of Disney would want a new CFO “because I thought this is your biggest initiative in the last 10 years and you haven’t known me for two weeks” she said. But it turns out Krantz was chosen because she was tech CFO while many other candidates were legacy or entertainment CFOs she said.

“I didn’t know one thing about direct to consumer and you know who I learned it from—my boss” Krantz said. “I basically had a morning tutorial every single morning for no lie a year and a half.”

“I am now working on the biggest strategic initiative of The Walt Disney Company in 10 years” she said. “Bob Iger himself is flying to Chelsea Market in New York City where we worked. Once every two weeks we are having meetings continuously about how to launch this product. And I’m lucky enough to be in the room. I’ve never been so energized in my life.” Krantz built the finance team from scratch she said. Her boss became a mentor knowing her background would be an asset she said. “Even though I didn’t know how to do direct to consumer video streaming I knew how to do a lot of great finance stuff” she said. “So I think that’s why he was willing to invest some time in me to teach me this particular vertical.”

After three years with Disney “I went back to trying to be an independent company CFO and so I went to a company called MasterClass” Krantz said. Working at the streaming education platform was a great experience she said. As a startup “as soon as I got there I did a fundraise and interacted with VCs” she said. “You really are thinking about your stakeholders in a much more tangible way” Krantz said. In comparison at Disney “I didn’t think about our shareholders I thought about our customers and how to provide the best product and user experience” she explained. “At MasterClass it was more about me demonstrating to investors the growth trajectory of the company and why it made sense to invest in the company.”

Krantz was at the company for less than a year when she was asked to move to San Francisco where the office is headquartered. “The CEO really wanted the CFO to sit beside him” she explained. “I just couldn’t move to the West Coast.” She ended her tenure with the company in September 2021. In August 2021 Krantz began her role as finance chief at Passport. At the transportation software and payments company she partners with the CEO in developing operational strategy prioritizing initiatives for growth and scaling as well as communicating with stakeholders.

“The most wonderful thing about the first week was the leadership team that [CEO]David Evans has put together truly is excellent” Krantz said. “Each discipline has a leader that is highly experienced. What I like about that is everybody is there for the business to be successful.” Passport is used by more than 800 cities in North America to manage their parking and mobility infrastructure. The company’s digital platform provides end-to-end operating system for managing mobile pay parking parking enforcement digital permitting and micro-mobility. “At first you just have to get the accounting right you have to know your customers the business has to run smoothly” she says. “But as you get more mature there’s just so much more to it. I think that [includes] thoughtfulness about how we really should be utilizing our resources.”

When summarizing her career thus far Krantz put it this way: “I have now learned to be uncomfortable in a very comfortable way.” For example “I’ve just joined a company that is a completely new space for me a fintech” she said. “I’m pretty close to a video streaming expert I would say because Disney made me that. And of course that was highly uncomfortable. I can assure you that I’m no longer scared about learning something new. I actually think I can and probably with speed.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZWNoLzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXN0YXJsaW5rLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtc3BhY2V4LWJyb2FkYmFuZC1pbnRlcm5ldC1nbG9iZS84ODgxODU4MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Starlink and SpaceX relationship could make Elon Musk even richer,"On Thursday SpaceX launched 48 Starlink satellites into orbit off the coast of Florida. From Arizona to Alabama people could spot glimmers in the sky as the satellites orbited the Earth's atmosphere.

These streaks of light could be the reason Elon Musk becomes a trillionaire according to an October report by Morgan Stanley sent to USA TODAY.

Morgan Stanley predicted a $100 billion base valuation for SpaceX chiefly driven by innovations within Starlink.

""We have long seen SpaceX as multiple companies in one"" the report states. ""But the largest contributor to our estimated $100 billion base case valuation for the company ($200 billion bull case) is the Starlink LEO sat comms business which has had a number of important milestones in recent months.""

So what is Starlink and how will it make Elon Musk the world's first trillionaire?

Starlink can bring broadband internet across the globe — along with loads of money for SpaceX

Starlink is a broadband internet service specializing in the expansion of coverage to rural and remote communities. It accomplishes this by launching a ""constellation"" of satellites into low Earth orbit via SpaceX rockets.

Musk created a ""symbiotic"" relationship between SpaceX launches and Starlink satellite deployments where advancements in either sector can reap benefits for both parts of the business Morgan Stanley says.

As SpaceX rockets become more sophisticated they can handle larger and more frequent payloads of Starlink satellites. As Starlink satellites gain more customers around the globe it validates and circulates cash back into the SpaceX rocketry program.

Space travel: William Shatner went to space. Here's how much it would cost you.

Rocket launches have been a key way for SpaceX to solicit the expertise of NASA which has sustained a long presence in space through the International Space Station (ISS).

""We've had continuous human presence in low Earth orbit for about 20 years now. But the ISS is nearing its end of life"" says Phil McAlister director of commercial spaceflight at NASA. ""Prior to that end of life we want to have commercial destinations commercial space stations in low Earth orbit so that we can continue our human research.""

The support and funding of NASA has helped SpaceX send a significant body of satellites up into space and create its own presence in low Earth orbit. Starlink now has more than 1700 internet-beaming satellites circling above according to Florida Today part of the USA TODAY Network.

Regular people can preorder a Starlink Kit that includes a terminal (used to connect to the satellite providing internet) that they would set up themselves in their own home. The Starlink Kit costs $499 and the internet service would cost $99 per month.

Starlink Internet: SpaceX starts accepting orders for Starlink internet service

While the upfront costs for consumers to set up the terminal is high it costs SpaceX even more with estimates from Morgan Stanley reaching over $2000 per terminal. SpaceX hopes to achieve economies of scale and eventually bring terminal costs down to $250 for consumers Morgan Stanley says.

Rural broadband access is lacking despite the rise of fiber

Starlink's addressable market is significant given that much of the world is still lacking broadband internet.

In America only about 72% of adults in rural areas have a broadband connection at home according to February 2021 data from Pew Research Center. The Pew report also found that older people racial minorities and ""those with lower levels of education and income"" are less likely to have broadband service at home.

These issues are acute for people living in rural communities all over America such as Dawn Sutton from Alamance County North Carolina.

Sutton lives on a rural country road in southern Alamance County where internet cables stop just a mile and a half short of her home. For the past several years she and her neighbors have periodically reached out to internet service providers asking them to extend access and have continuously been turned down.

In order to complete her work Sutton goes to her son’s house every day and has been doing this for months on end.

Theoretically companies could lay cable in these areas but the cost of doing so often outweighs the benefits leaving people like Sutton stranded.

US infrastructure spending:Charts show where billions of dollars would go

“If you're a company … what's the return on investment for you if you're spending a whole lot of money to connect three households?” says Kathleen Stansberry an Elon University professor who works with the university’s Imagining the Internet Center. “It doesn't make great business sense for most companies to do it and to build out services for just a handful of users.”

While this may apply to fiber companies it doesn't necessarily apply to SpaceX and satellite technology.

With the existing rocket technology of SpaceX shooting satellites into space may be a quicker way to help people in rural areas get internet given the high cost of deploying fiber infrastructure according to CNET.

The revenue brought in from Starlink can help ""the company attract large amounts of capital at attractive rates"" says the Morgan Stanley report. This could fund further development of more complex launches such as Starship a rocket that Musk says could eventually take people to Mars.

The British annexed Assam in the year 1826 through the Treaty of Yandaboo. Thereafter in a series of operations in 1875 Lotha Naga (1875) in Naga Hill (1886) in the Aao (1889) Sema Naga (1904) and in 1904 the Konyak Naga areas came under British domination. Between 1817 and 1889 Lushai Hills and later in 1912 the Naga Hill District comprising all these regions were annexed to Assam. Subsequently in 1912-13 NEFA was annexed to Assam. This entire landmass was incorporated into Assam by the British for administrative and financial convenience.

In the rest of India there is a popular erroneous belief of considering entire North-East India as a homogeneous entity. This belief system despite the varied cultural mosaic and divergent aspirations of the people inhabiting the region has contributed to the misunderstanding of a myriad of problems cropping up in the region. This area is an interesting cultural mosaic of a variety of ethnic groups.

Sir Edward Gait in his book History of Assam (1905) mentioned: “Assam is in many ways a country of exceptional interest… In Assam… although in the plains large section of the population…are of mixed origin there are also numerous tribes who are almost pure Mongolians and the examination of their affinities in respect of physique language religion and social customs with other branches of the same family forms one of the most interesting lines inquiry open to Ethnologists.” This statement is an eloquent testimony to the diversity of the region.

The Ahoms under Saulung Sukapha set foot in Assam in the year 1228 and ruled for long 600 years by combining all the divergent groups under one umbrella which demonstrates their ability to unite all differences through a process of discussion and mingling with the culture of the country they were ruling. The Ahoms were descendants of the Thai Civilization which was as old as 2500 BC. Mingling of Thai culture for creation of Bor Asom (A Larger Assam) by bringing the seven kingdoms under one at the initiative of the Ahoms is a precedent that is difficult to trace in other areas of the world and is offers an idea for solution of intractable problems afflicting the region during the present days.



By creating a syncretic and inclusive culture through the adoption of local values and ethos and intermingling with Thai culture the Ahoms created a tradition that is very much relevant in the present-day context. The Ahoms also gave predominant attention and encouragement to the barter system of exchange among various tribal communities. The Junbeel Mela which traces its origin to the 15th Century AD is an example of this and during the mela tribal Khasi Jaintia Lalung Karbi and Rabha people exchange their produces and this inculcated friendliness among people living in different states in the NE region even today. Swargadeo Pratap Singha (1603-41) provided Khat (land) to the Naga Heads where people of different communities gathered and executed economic transactions in a very friendly environment. This people-to-people contact encouraged by Ahoms among the border populace is a lesson for the modern communities to resolve their differences. The historical perspective discussed above clearly demonstrates the success of unity amid diversity principle for any project at the frontiers.

In course of time the British Assam had been truncated into states of Nagaland Mizoram Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh as per Article 2 and 3 of the Constitution to address the various aspirations of the communities but without any delineated border. This has led to violence in border areas of Assam and an assessment by Rights and Risk Analysis Group (RRAG) depict a very discouraging picture-since 1979 till 2021 as many as 157 people were killed and 361 injured and 65729 rendered homeless the violence between Assam and Mizoram on 26th July leading to the death of 6 persons including 5 Assam Police personnel is the latest in the tally. These tragic incidents bring to our mind the infamous saying by the former US President Ronald Regan “A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation”. Unfortunately this daggers drawn attitude is displayed by all the states and this policy which is in vogue for over the last seven decades has not brought peace and amity in the region. Under these circumstances it is strongly felt that a change in attitude by both the Centre and the States is the need of the hour.

Since the Union is primarily responsible for the creation of the states the Centre has a major role in the peaceful resolution of the interstate border problem. Identification of the disputed areas among the States and freezing the population of both states residing in these areas through GPS mapping to prevent further encroachment exploration by DONER Ministry for viable Projects in the Disputed areas like Agriculture and Tourism related Agarwood Plantation Pig Rearing etc involving people from both the sides and recycling the profits among the communities inhabiting the areas are some of the steps suggested in this direction. The DONER Ministry should bear the cost incurred in these projects. For the success of these projects people-to-people contact is the sine-qua-non. In Assam there are organizations like AAAPTA (All Assam Agarwood Planters and Traders Association) NEPPFA (North East Progressive Pig Farmers Association) etc which have carried out commendable people-to-people contact initiatives involving people from neighbouring states.



The stakeholder States of this peaceful initiative suggested should also identify such NGOs and DONER should handhold these organizations to make the projects a success. The economic involvement of the border population in such productive activities is certain to develop comradery and ACT East Policy will give a fillip to the endeavour. It is expected that this novel initiative is bound to reduce border escalations till their resolution through the judicial process in due course of time.

Drawing lessons from the path-breaking innovation of Ahom kingdom to resolve the issue of the border through people-to-people contact and cooperation is expected to bring to fruition the famous saying of former US President Barack Obama “We are defined not by our borders but by our bonds”.

Courtesy of the FSC



By Park Jae-hyuk



The government remains uncertain about the complete resumption of short-selling on the Seoul bourse despite plans to resume talks with the MSCI for the Korean equity market to be classified by the American index provider as a ""developed market.""



""We have yet to discuss the timing of the resumption of short-selling with the finance ministry"" Financial Services Commission (FSC) Chairman Koh Seung-beom said in a press conference Friday.



Korea's short-selling ban on small-cap stocks which has continued since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was mentioned in the MSCI's latest market reclassification review in June as a reason for the index provider to keep the country's equity market classified as ""emerging.""



""There is no timeline on the potential resumption of short-selling for the remaining securities in the Korean equity market"" it said at that time. ""As such Korea will experience a deterioration in the rating for short-selling given that current limitations remain in place for a number of securities.""



Considering that Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki told executives from global financial firms in London last month that the relevant ministries would review ways to upgrade Korea's equity market status following his return to Korea the government was expected to come up with a specific plan to lift the ban on the investment method which entails betting on stock price falls.



The FSC chairman however noted that the government has to take into account the effect of the short-selling ban and market conditions although he acknowledged the necessity of the complete resumption of short-selling for Korea's equity market to be among the MSCI's ""developed"" markets.



""The government will review how and when the short-selling should be resumed completely"" he said.



In response to a request from the Citibank Korea union to revise the Banking Act to prevent licensed financial firms from shutting down without permission from the government Koh said that the FSC has studied various cases in other countries and listened to legal experts.



""We will continue to review the effectiveness of reforming the regulations"" he said.



The regulator also warned financial holding companies and banks against paying a huge amount of dividends to their shareholders despite the lifting of the 20 percent dividend cap in June.



""We believe that banks will respond to internal and external economic situations in terms of maintaining their financial soundness and capital adequacy"" he said.



Regarding strengthened policies to curb household debt he basically maintained his hawkish stance although he indicated that ""flexible"" methods can be used next year for borrowers in desperate need of loans.



""Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic the amount of household debt has soared leading the household debt-to-GDP ratio to surpass 100 percent and the financial imbalance to worsen"" Koh said. ""We aim to normalize the pace of household debt growth and bring it back to pre-COVID-19 levels.""

As governments’ and societies’ decarbonisation commitments translate into tangible policies and actions giving rise to winners and losers in the green transition the importance of meaningful and comprehensive carbon measures is higher than ever. Conventional measures only inform us of the emissions companies generate from their own operations and value chains. However the leaders in the decarbonisation race are doing more than reducing their own emissions; they are developing products and services that can drive significant reductions in economy-wide emissions. Avoided Emissions provide an additional lens by capturing companies’ contribution to emissions reductions through the substitution of high carbon activities with low carbon alternatives as these are not reflected in their conventional Scope 1 2 and 3 metrics.

We have developed an Avoided Emissions framework to capture these emissions savings which are calculated relative to a baseline where low carbon technologies had not been deployed. These represent real emissions reductions and will be vital to global decarbonisation efforts. Our framework is based on a proprietary systematic value chain approach drawing on academic and industry literature to capture the contribution of a broad set of industries to Avoided Emissions with an emphasis on investability and scalability. The Avoided Emissions framework is built for direct application to investment analysis and the benefits are twofold: Sharpens our abilities to identify and assess an extended set of winners from the green transition which are otherwise not captured using traditional carbon metrics or “green revenues” Allows for ease of comparison with Scope 1 2 and 3 emissions under a common unit of measurement enabling a more integrated and holistic approach to building a portfolio that reflects both climate risks as well as opportunities We examined 19 carbon-avoiding activities and industries and quantified the emission savings for each dollar of revenue (tCO2e/US$m). If adoption of these activities were now at the levels we expect in 2030 almost a quarter of economy-wide emissions could be eliminated. This highlights the importance of these low carbon products and services to decarbonisation efforts. We also applied the Avoided Emissions framework to the broad MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index (IMI) stock universe and a focused portfolio of companies accelerating the low carbon transition. The analysis shows the latter made significant contribution to emissions reduction even though their Scope 1 2 and 3 emissions are undifferentiated. The analysis further substantiates that companies with positive Avoided Emissions exposure saw revenues grow by an annualised rate of 7% over the past three years which are 20% faster than the MSCI ACWI IMI stock universe as a whole1. The global impetus to decarbonise will continue to provide a strong tailwind to this growth making it all the more imperative for portfolio analysis to include Avoided Emissions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3N0b2Nrcy9uZXdzLzUtd29ybGQtbWFya2V0LXRoZW1lcy1mb3ItdGhlLXdlZWstYWhlYWQvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODgwODU5MDguY21z0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvc3RvY2tzL25ld3MvNS13b3JsZC1tYXJrZXQtdGhlbWVzLWZvci10aGUtd2Vlay1haGVhZC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODgwODU5MDguY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 world market themes for the week ahead,"

NDAQ,"Nasdaq, Inc.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2h5LWZyZXNod29ya3Mtc3RvY2stcGx1bW1ldGVkLTI5LjktaW4tbm92ZW1iZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Freshworks Stock Plummeted 29.9% in November,"What happened

Shares of Freshworks (NASDAQ: FRSH) sank 29.9% in November according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The software-as-a-service (SaaS) stock lost ground after the company reported its first-quarter results and it continued to move lower as the month progressed:

Freshworks published its Q1 results on Nov. 2 posting sales and earnings for the period that came in ahead of the market's expectations. The company posted a non-GAAP (adjusted) loss of $0.04 on revenue of $96.61 million in the period while the average analyst estimate had called for a $0.10 per share loss on sales of $90.85 million. The enterprise software specialist delivered top- and bottom-line beats but performance was less inspiring along other key fronts.

So what

Freshworks sales rose 46% year over year in Q3. The company's net-dollar-based retention rate for the period came in at 117% which means that existing clients increased their spending 17% compared to the prior-year period. Despite recording sales and earnings that topped the market's expectations the company saw its free cash flow slip to a $4.2 million loss in the period -- swinging from positive free cash flow of $10.3 million in the prior-year period.

Freshworks also had a partial stock lockup expiration on Nov. 4 freeing insiders to sell some of their shares; that lockup expiration may have created some extra selling pressure that helped send the company's share price lower as the month progressed. In the meantime investors weighed risks presented by rising Treasury bond yields and the omicron coronavirus variant and became more cautious about growth-dependent tech plays.

Now what

Freshworks stock has continued to slide early in December's trading. The company's share price is now down roughly 19% in the month so far:

For the fourth quarter the company is guiding for sales to be between $99 million and $101 million. Management is targeting an adjusted loss between $0.05 and $0.07 for the period.

For the full year Freshworks expects an adjusted loss per share between $0.20 and $0.22 on sales between $364.5 million and $366.5 million. The company now has a market capitalization of roughly $4.9 billion and trades at roughly 13.4 times the midpoint of this year's expected sales.

Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned.

Accuray is a smaller company with a market capitalization of US$442m so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below) it seems that institutional investors have bought into the company. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Accuray.

See our latest analysis for Accuray

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Accuray?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register especially if they are growing.

We can see that Accuray does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Accuray (below). Of course keep in mind that there are other factors to consider too.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. It looks like hedge funds own 5.2% of Accuray shares. That's interesting because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock Inc. with ownership of 8.5%. Neuberger Berman BD LLC is the second largest shareholder owning 5.5% of common stock and Archon Capital Management LLC holds about 5.2% of the company stock. Additionally the company's CEO Joshua Levine directly holds 1.2% of the total shares outstanding.

After doing some more digging we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Accuray

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

We can see that insiders own shares in Accuray Incorporated. In their own names insiders own US$16m worth of stock in the US$442m company. It is good to see some investment by insiders but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

The general public who are usually individual investors hold a 22% stake in Accuray. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company there are other factors that are even more important. For example we've discovered 2 warning signs for Accuray that you should be aware of before investing here.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sold a massive stake in his company over the past several weeks. And yet he owns 564000 more shares than he did at the start of the selling spree.

An analysis of his filings shows Musk is not backing away from his holdings in Tesla despite his promise to follow a poll he sent to his Twitter followers who called on him to sell 10% of his stake. So far he’s sold 10.1 million shares — about 7 million shares short of the goal.

That’s because at the same time he is selling shares he’s also exercising options to buy additional stock. And he’s doing so at a bargain exercise price of $6.24 a share well below 1% of Tesla (TSLA)’s current share price. Since Musk’s Twitter poll on November 6 he has exercised options to buy 10.7 million shares of Tesla (TSLA). To be clear he would have done so with or without the poll — the options were due to expire by August of 2022 if he didn’t exercise them.

And Tesla is poised to award Musk even more options pending its upcoming financial results. His stake in the company is the reason Musk is the richest person on the planet.

Taxes not Twitter main reason for sales

Whenever he exercises options he becomes subject to a large income-tax hit because he received those options as his primary form of compensation.

He owes about $5 billion in federal income taxes on the new shares he has purchased since November 8. He also will probably owe some amount of state taxes. Musk sold off Tesla stock specifically to cover that tax hit according to the filings.

Musk also plans to exercise additional options that are set to expire next year. He still has 12.2 million of those soon-to-expire options that he has not yet exercised.

If past practice is any indication he’ll sell about 5.3 million of those newly acquired shares to cover his tax bill. But that will still leave him with nearly 7 million more shares than he has today.

Musk is keeping most of the shares he’s acquiring rather than selling them all as other executives have been known to do when exercising options including Robyn Denholm the chair of Tesla’s board.

Once he’s done with these soon-to-expire options Musk will have 22.9 million fewer options than he had at the start of this process. But he’ll still have 50.7 million other options that will allow him to buy that many additional shares albeit at a higher exercise price than options he is now purchasing. He’s not likely to exercise them soon as virtually none of those options will expire until January of 2028.

More options on their way

The number of options Musk holds is likely to grow significantly in the coming year.

Musk’s pay package was designed to give him 12 different blocks of options once the company hits certain financial performance and market value targets. With the company now worth $1 trillion the market value targets are all already accomplished so it’s a matter of revenue and profit targets being hit.

Tesla has already accounted for three additional blocks of 8.4 million options each going to Musk soon for a total of 25.3 new options more than making up for the ones he is in the process of exercising. Company filings state that it is “probable” that the needed financial targets will be achieved soon.

Analysts agree. Musk could qualify for one block of 8.4 million options with the fourth-quarter results and two more with first quarter 2022 results according to Wall Street’s consensus forecasts. And if analysts’ estimates are correct he could get an additional 8.4 million options in the second or third quarter of 2022 and yet another blog early in 2023.

Additional stock sales

Musk sold a block of 5.4 million Tesla shares that he had previous held in trust over the course of three days shortly after the completed his Twitter poll.

Most of the shares sold in those transactions were probably ones he has held since the company’s 2010 initial public offering. So almost all of the $5.8 billion he received for those sales were probably judged to be long-term capital gains taxed at a lower 20% rate not the higher tax rate he’ll pay on the exercise of the options.

To hit the target of selling 10% of the Tesla shares he owned as of the date of the poll he might need to sell about 2 million more shares to cover the tax bill for his additional 12 million options.

But even if he does that with even more options due to come his way he’s still likely to have a bigger stake in Tesla than when he began this process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS1uZXctdG14LWNlby1qb2huLW1ja2VuemllLXN0cml2ZXMtdG8ta2VlcC1wYWNlLXdpdGgtZ2xvYmFsLWV4Y2hhbmdlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New TMX CEO John McKenzie strives to keep pace with global exchanges,"Open this photo in gallery: John McKenzie CEO of the TMX at the new TMX Market Centre in Toronto.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

The Toronto Stock Exchange is a bit of a mess. John McKenzie the market’s boss wouldn’t want it any other way.

On a Wednesday morning in late November the chief executive of TMX Group Ltd. joined executives at tech company Coveo Solutions to open TSX trading in a ceremony that scattered confetti across the exchange’s newly-opened event space. They were celebrating an initial public offering that valued the Montreal-based artificial intelligence platform at $1.7-billion.

By early afternoon Mr. McKenzie was avoiding tiny pieces of white and blue paper while leading a tour of the new cathedral for capitalists a basketball-court-sized facility full of flashing screens spotlights and cameras that opened in late October.

Mr. McKenzie has cause for celebration at the country’s premier marketplace operator which also owns the Montreal Exchange and the TSX Venture Exchange. In his first media interview since becoming CEO in August 2020 – the COVID-19 pandemic put a halt to face-to-face meetings – the new(ish) CEO says he’s now winning a global battle to secure new listings from public companies the lifeblood of every exchange.

“We have a unique platform in Canada as the operator of junior and senior markets and we’re successfully selling that platform to the world” Mr. McKenzie said.

He is also well into a cultural makeover that saw the TMX Group’s previous CEO Lou Ecclestone retire early after an investigation into what some employees described as a toxic workplace.

However Mr. McKenzie faces a daunting challenge as the mid-tier exchange operator goes up against far larger foreign rivals all of them focused on snapping up data services and trading platforms to achieve the same goal of global scale and relevance.

In his short time as CEO Mr. McKenzie has seen the landscape reshaped by Nasdaq’s US$2.75-billion acquisition of Newfoundland-based fraud-detection software company Verafin Inc. and the London Stock Exchange’s US$27-billion purchase of data provider Refinitiv.

As CEO of a company with a $7-billion market capitalization – impressive but rival Nasdaq Inc. is five times larger – Mr. McKenzie said “Our balance sheet has never been stronger.” Yet despite having money on hand and global ambitions Mr. McKenzie said the TMX will not rush to do deals. With the lofty valuations today we will likely wait for a tech market correction before we make a major acquisition” he said.

While patience may be financially prudent investors are signalling their impatience with a perceived slower pace of change at TMX than at peers such as Nasdaq. In a recent report Scotia Capital analyst Phil Hardie noted that for many years TMX and the U.S. exchange commanded roughly the same stock market valuation.

That began to change in January as Nasdaq’s acquisitions added new data platforms that generate reliable revenue and Nasdaq’s own stock price soared. Nasdaq shares now trade at a 30-per-cent premium to the valuation on TMX’s stock as measured by the two companies’ ratios of EBITDA compared with their enterprise value.

“We see parallels between Nasdaq and TMX’s approach to using M&A to accelerate their transformation strategy” Mr. Hardie said. “We believe Nasdaq is roughly 24 months ahead of TMX with respect to its transformation.”

Today’s TMX is already radically different from the exchange Mr. McKenzie joined 21 years ago after a stint in the finance team at Procter & Gamble. A generation back the fortunes of an exchange rose and fell on stock trading volumes. Today TMX is increasingly a tech company selling software and data while also serving as a forum for raising money and trading.

TMX’s most recent quarterly financial results show trading brought in just 22 per cent of TMX revenues down from 40 per cent 10 years ago. In contrast data services and capital raising each accounted more than a third of TMX revenues and are growing at a double-digit pace.

“TMX underwent a significant transformation over the past five years which we believe enhanced its resilience and growth prospects” said Mr. Hardie. He said over time Mr. McKenzie will pull the trigger on acquisitions of data-based businesses similar to the London-based energy trading platform Trayport which TMX acquired in 2017 in a $931-million deal. Trayport is now growing at a 10 per cent annual clip.

But Mr. Hardie cautioned that “with public market multiples remaining elevated across the tech sector we believe the timeline for TMX’s next material acquisition is uncertain and potentially extended.”

In the final weeks of his first full year as CEO Mr. McKenzie is on the verge of setting records for welcoming new issuers to Canadian public markets and for raising money. Through the end of October 371 companies joined the TSX or TSX Venture exchanges.

The explosive growth in listings includes 34 companies headquartered outside Canada including a California winemaker a North Carolina clean-tech company and a Bermuda-based reinsurer.

The number of companies choosing to trade on TMX exchanges this year matches new listings at far larger U.S. marketplaces such as Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange and far exceeds the number of debuts on rival Asian Australian and European exchanges.

Looking ahead Mr. McKenzie said “Our relationships with private companies and investment banks give us a good sense of what’s coming and we see the strength in new listings continuing next year.”

The hot run in new listings and number of international achievements – in September the Montreal Exchange launched derivatives trading in Asian time zones – mark an impressive debut for a CEO who wasn’t even sure he wanted the top job.

Mr. McKenzie aged 49 and an accountant by training was the TMX’s chief financial officer in January 2020 when the company’s board led by chair and investment banking veteran Chuck Winograd asked him to step up as interim CEO.

His predecessor Mr. Ecclestone retired with a year left on his employment contract after the TMX launched a review of his leadership. An external investigator found Mr. Ecclestone bullied and humiliated employees. After he departed the TMX board said in a statement it is “committed to creating a collegial culture and treating people with dignity and respect.”

At the time Mr. McKenzie was supporting his 16-year-old son through eventually successful treatment for bone cancer. “The interim appointment worked two ways” Mr. McKenzie said. “The organization was able to test me while I had time to deal with my son’s health issues then ensure I could make a difference and had something to add.”

“John represents safe hands” said Nicholas Thadaney who ran the TSX as the TMX’s president of global equity capital markets before departing in 2018. “Everyone is comfortable with John after the drama of recent years. He’s a strong thoughtful leader.”

Part of Mr. McKenzie’s pitch to the TMX board was the need for the CEO to be “an advocate for markets and an advocate for Canada something my predecessors did not do.” Since winning the job in the summer of 2020 – over rivals who included two other internal candidates – Mr. McKenzie has become one of a few CEOs willing to routinely take political stands.

In the recent federal election Mr. McKenzie wrote a “call to action” for political leaders that urged Ottawa to simplify tax rules support entrepreneurs and partner with business on environmental issues.

In an interview he said another one of his priorities is getting Ontario’s Progressive Conservative government to make markets more efficient by adopting the national securities market passport system that allows companies to access capital across the country while dealing with only one provincial regulator. Ontario is the only province remaining outside the 16-year-old accord.

Until he began returning to the office in July Mr. McKenzie led TMX from a basement office in his Burlington home setting strategy on video calls against a backdrop of a Peloton bike and his kids’ guitars. Remote work was nothing new: Mr. McKenzie earned a MBA from the University of Edinburgh but only visited the campus in Scotland to graduate.

After being named CEO Mr. McKenzie built bonds with the TMX’s executive team with events such as virtual wine tastings bringing in a sommelier after delivering three interesting bottles to each of his colleagues.

In contrast to the relatively high employee turnover that marked Mr. Eccleston’s time at TMX the company’s executive ranks have been stable on the new CEO. Mr. McKenzie has also added an experienced head of human resources – former Cineplex executive Cindy Bush – and a new chief financial officer former CIBC banker David Arnold.

But at the same time as the TMX scouts for international acquisitions its management team faces new challengers in domestic markets. In November Chicago-based Cboe Global Markets Inc. – a US$14-billion company – announced it is buying Toronto-based stock exchange operator NEO Exchange. It is Cboe’s second Canadian acquisition in as many years.

The six-year-old NEO Exchange targets the same innovation-economy stock listings that TMX covets and Cboe plans to expand the platform. Mr. McKenzie said increased competition will be good for customers and will force TMX to up its game.

“Having a quality player like Cboe in our market is positive for Canada” he said.

Cboe has historically focused on its trading systems and put less emphasis on the listings and capital-raising businesses that are central to the TMX’s growth strategy Mr. McKenzie said. “With the depth of our value proposition we feel we can remain the preferred choice for companies listing in Canada.”

And now the TMX is past its internal upheavals he’s confident that strategy will help it to continue to gain ground worldwide as well.

Critics Don't Get Why.,"“Red Notice” is not a good movie at least by most conventional measures.

It has a score of 36 on review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes and 37% on Metacritic. It’s not going to get nominated for Academy Awards nor did it introduce the world to new talent. A New York Times review deemed it a “vacant bid at franchise creation” and the paper thought so little of the film that neither of its primary film critics reviewed it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZXcuY29tL3R2L3doeS1jb21pbmctb3V0LWNvbHRvbi1kb2N1c2VyaWVzLWlzLWEtbWFqb3ItbWlzc2VkLW9wcG9ydHVuaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colton Underwood: Netflix's Coming Out Colton is a missed opportunity,"Coming Out Colton should have spent more time on the field.

The docuseries streaming now on Netflix chronicles the coming-out process of Bachelor Nation's Colton Underwood who on April 14 revealed he is gay in a Good Morning America interview.

That moment of course arrived after he competed on The Bachelorette and later became the ""virgin Bachelor"" who dated 30 women on a Bachelor season of his own. Underwood famously jumped a fence and professed his love for Cassie Randolph and then spiraled when their relationship ended after the show. Post-breakup Cassie filed a restraining order against Underwood for stalking which included a claim that he had placed a tracking device on her car. Underwood says he can discuss none of this on his new show for ""legal reasons.""

Given all this backstory Netflix has been the target of substantial criticism for handing Underwood yet another platform with Coming Out Colton. But the bigger problem is that the series itself is flawed.

Throughout the six-episode season we watch as Underwood begins connecting with other LGBTQ folks and exploring what made him feel like he needed to stay in the closet. The show starts before his GMA interview as he comes out to family members and brings us with him as he prepares to share his truth with the world.

At the core of Underwood's attempt to reclaim his narrative is a necessary story about the modern culture of the sports world. The docuseries' central figure addresses how the homophobia in his high school locker room contributed to the shame and fear that led him to keep his sexual orientation a secret. With Coming Out Colton Underwood had a chance to tackle what he says prevented him from living authentically — but the show completely squanders that opportunity.

During its second episode titled ""Football"" Underwood speaks with gay athletes and visits his high school coach to discuss the toxicity and homophobia he experienced in the locker room. However as with most of the series the examinations of these complex issues remain surface-level and left me wanting much more.

""The most toxic parts of the locker room were allowed by the coaches and the people who are supposed to be there to look out for these kids"" says Underwood. ""When I heard them be okay with homophobic slurs or a joke that had to do with homosexuality it just drove me further into the closet.""

If this is true for Underwood that these events sparked the fundamental problems in his life then they deserve much more attention than they get here.

To be fair some of the episode is fascinating. Underwood and his friend Gus Kenworthy (a.k.a. his ""gay guide"" as some initial reports referred to him) meet with three gay ex-NFL players who look back on their time in the league and coming out. Michael Sam David Kopay and Esera Tuaolo leave enough of an impression to merit a docuseries of their own. Kopay talks about defying people's negative opinions of his sexuality to attend the funeral of the first man he loved the way his family reacted when he shared his story publicly and how closeted players found ways to socialize in secret. Tuaolo opens up about how Kopay's book saved his life. As a member of the same draft class Underwood remembers Sam becoming the first openly gay football player to be drafted in the NFL and seeing the backlash he faced in real time.

""Hearing the stories from David Kopay Esera and going through it with Michael"" he says ""the one thing that sticks out to me is nothing's f---ing changed.""

Underwood then heads to his high school to reconnect with his former football coach Darrell Crouch. ""All of the problems and everything that has led me to this point now started here"" he says in a confessional. ""Having someone who you view as your second father allow this toxic culture of football whether they meant it or not still had an impact on me.""

After he details the homophobia he witnessed in the locker room explaining that this stage in his life was when he decided to do everything he could to keep his sexual orientation a secret Underwood's conversation with his coach basically comes to a close. It is short and anticlimactic. There is neither confrontation nor catharsis.

Crouch is understanding about how difficult it must be for a player to come out to him — that's the reality at schools in towns like Washington Ill. — but Underwood doesn't have the language ideas or research to take the discussion beyond that. When he recaps the exchange to his best friend he's worried his coach didn't get it — so we're in turn left asking what the point of the whole thing was. It's infuriating to watch Underwood shortchange himself let alone viewers.

Underwood's brief chat with his coach ends the episode but that's where Coming Out Colton should have started. After watching it I was left with countless unanswered questions: How does Underwood's high school locker room experience compare to the locker room experiences of Sam Kopay and Tuaolo in the NFL? What advocacy work is being done to support LGBTQ athletes and who are the people leading it? Underwood's coming-out journey is rightfully his own but imagine a version of the docuseries in which the former professional athlete educates himself and then returns to his coach with informed suggestions on how to reduce toxicity in the locker room — to address the issue head-on early on.

One thing the docuseries does make clear is how much young athletes rely on their teams and coaches. ""I'm more nervous to talk to my coaches than I am like my parents"" Underwood admits to Kopay and Tuaolo. He explains how his coach was like a parent to him and how the culture of football pushed him to behave as a child including hiding his emotions.

""That is what keeps people in the closet is because a lot of the toxic parts were allowed and deemed part of the culture"" he says. If this is where it all began for Underwood he and Netflix could have used the docuseries to cast a spotlight on a conversation we're not having nearly enough.

The inclusion of Sam is another glaring missed opportunity for the show. Underwood was in the same draft class as him and remembers how fellow players spoke about Sam and his partner admitting that he now regrets not speaking up in support of his friend.

""What Michael Sam did should have given other players in the league an opportunity to come out and to not be afraid"" says Underwood. ""Unfortunately I didn't reach out to him and I didn't stick up for him in the locker room. So you know I was part of the problem as well. I felt like I was really letting him down in that moment.""

Underwood acknowledges that Sam faced further obstacles as a Black man and this additional layer of prejudice would have been a compelling avenue to explore — had Underwood and the series creators thought to go in that direction.

Before Underwood was the fence-jumping virgin who had a post-reality-series breakdown he was a gay kid in a locker room who just wanted to play the game well. On a platform like Netflix he could have given children in locker rooms across the country a shot at having a much easier time coming out than he did. Instead Coming Out Colton just feels like a big loss.

Coming Out Colton is streaming now on Netflix.

Why Should I Watch? It’s been two years since Henry Cavill cast his spell on the world and the titular Witcher’s long-awaited return to Netflix is finally upon us. I’m going to be honest: I do not remember much about this show. Twenty-four months — especially these past 24 months — is a long time and I have yet to find the precious eight hours required for my rewatch. But I think that’s OK? What made “The Witcher” work so well was a beguiling combination of palpable enthusiasm (courtesy of Cavill who f’n loves this franchise) and prioritizing spectacle over sanity. Rarely did “The Witcher” slow down so viewers could process what was going on when it could simply charge forward into stranger and stranger events. Whether you can keep up with its wild world-building or not the first eight episodes are an experience to be had and I don’t doubt the second season will be even more… well just more. The spell is too strong.

Bonus Reason: Did my flippancy regarding a very serious fantasy series that you take very very seriously irk you? Are you looking for a reason to get hyped for Season 2 having already invested countless hours into memorizing all the bizarre names and laws that set “The Witcher” apart from lesser epics like “The Wheel of Time” and the Bible? Well fine then. As you undoubtedly already know Season 2 sees Geralt take Cirilla to his hometown (Kaer Morhen) in an attempt to protect the princess from dangers lurking outside and her own burgeoning powers inside. But did you know… it’s snowing there? OK yes you probably did but the Netflix spoilers list is very detailed you guys and I’m genuinely scared to say anything more so… snow. That’s what I’ve got for you. The promise of a white Christmas — in Kaer Morhen and for all of us Witcherites.

2. “Halt and Catch Fire” Seasons 1-4 (leaving December 13)

Why Should I Watch? Have you seen “Halt and Catch Fire”? Have you watched it recently? And by recently I mean are you watching it right now? If your answer is “no” to any of these questions then you have less than two weeks to rectify your choices (hey “Rectify” — also a great show) and appreciate one of history’s great dramas before it disappears from the world’s most popular streaming service. And really Netflix has given you no excuses: “The Witcher” Season 2 won’t be out yet and precious little else constitutes must-see TV in December. (Keep reading though please.) So why not cross a long-overdue item off your TV bucket list? I promise by the time the word “Mutiny” starts meaning anything to you you’ll forget other TV even exists.

Bonus Reason: The cast of “Halt and Catch Fire” instills the same kind of lasting loyalty as series like “The Wire” and “Friday Night Lights” in that once you’ve seen these actors in this show you’ll follow them anywhere. You know how whenever you see Dominic West you shout “McNulty!” or when you spot Zach Gilford and think “Saracen”? Get ready to smile and say “Gordon” whenever Scoot McNairy strides onscreen. And Scoot is working a lot these days. So really by watching “Halt and Catch Fire” you’re opening yourself up to appreciating so much more of the entertainment landscape. And isn’t that why you’re reading this list in the first place?

3. “Voir” (available December 6)

Why Should I Watch? While it’s extremely difficult not to be snarky about a show that capitalizes “Cinema” twice in its synopsis “Voir” represents the work of dedicated artisans celebrating other dedicated artisans and that’s a lovely intention worth our collective respect. From executive producers David Fincher and David Prior the six-episode pseudo-docuseries uses visual essays to honor and examine great filmmaking. In other words it’s a show about the love of movies by people who know exactly what they love about movies — and hope to share that love in a similarly cinematic fashion. Essayists include Walter Chaw Taylor Ramos Drew McWeeny Sasha Stone and Tony Zhou; screeners have not been provided in advance and little else is known about the program but if you’re someone who enjoys reading IndieWire for its in-depth analysis of not only movie stars and directors but editors designers and more “Voir” is probably up your alley.

Bonus Reason: “Cinema” does not need to be capitalized. Please don’t let this be the start of something. The artistic medium of “film” is held in lofty enough esteem we don’t need to start treating the very mention of its name like Jesus Christ or Jughead. OK that is all enjoy your movie show everyone.

4. “Cobra Kai” Season 4 (available December 31)

Why Should I Watch? As of 2021 “Cobra Kai” can call itself an Emmy nominee for Best Comedy Series aka one of the eight best comedy series on television (or streaming or whatever). That honor is voted on by members of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences many of whom are industry professionals and while they make mistakes fairly often TV fans should at least be curious to discover why they choose what they do — and it always starts with watching the series itself. “Cobra Kai” isn’t a simple reboot coasting off the nostalgia attached to “The Karate Kid” franchise. So give it a try. The Television Academy guarantees you’ll find something to appreciate.**

Bonus Reason: “Cobra Kai” is a hit! Don’t you want to join the millions of viewers who flock to each new season of this former YouTube original series? Don’t you want to be a part of the excitement surrounding each new release? Don’t you want to get hyped for your New Year’s Eve party by plowing through Season 4 as soon as it’s released? Sure you do. Have fun.

**This is an implied guarantee only as interpreted by IndieWire based on the Emmys’ good standing and regard for quality. Should you not find a single thing about “Cobra Kai” you admire the Television Academy will not provide you a refund on your subscription or a time machine. IndieWire won’t either. Own your decisions. Thank you.

5. “The Great British Baking Show: Holidays” Season 4 (available December 3)

Why Should I Watch? This is a two-part question really. The first is rather simple: Why should I watch “The Great British Baking Show: Holidays”? After all “GBBS:H” follows a different format than the traditional seasons of “GBBH.” There are only two episodes: “The Great Christmas Baking Show” and “The Great New Year’s Baking Show.” Each episode has its own set of contestants and the drama (on a show already fairly light on tension) is considerably lessened. If that sounds less than enticing then you have your answer. If it sounds good then it’s on to the second question: Why should I watch Season 4 of “The Great British Baking Show”? If this is your query then you’ve probably already sampled one or more of the first three “GBBS: H” seasons and come to recognize them as disposable cheery and baker-dependent. Which means your real question is: Who’s baking? Jamie Finn Rosie Brandreth-Poynter Ruby Bhogal and James Hillery make up the Christmas episode while Nancy Birtwhistle Rahul Mandal Helena Garcia and Henry Bird step into the tent for New Year’s.

Bonus Reason: The Christmas episode features a competition based around “illusion cakes” so you’ll naturally want to find out what those look like and New Year’s is themed after another booze-fueled anniversary: 21st birthdays.

6. “Aggretsuko” Season 4 (available December 16)

Why Should I Watch? Originally a short-form animated series in 2018 “Aggretsuko” follows a 25-year-old red panda named Retsuko (born from lifestyle brand Sanrio) who’s easily one of Netflix’s most relatable characters. No it’s not her pitch-black eyes that turn white with rage onstage (though they do convey a certain “darkness of the soul” inflicted by too many hours on the clock); nor is it her adorable whiskered face (though I’m sure many viewers wish their own visage could look as sweet). It’s her coping mechanism. Aggretsuko takes out her frustrations via screaming renditions of heavy metal karaoke which kicks off many more adventures from there. When the man’s got you down sometimes the only thing you can do is yell back — at a bar after work so you can keep the job your livelihood depends upon.

Bonus Reason: Season 4 sees Haida a spotted hyena and also Retsuko’s co-worker finally pursue the crush he’s let lie these past five years just as a new office director shows up with one priority in mind: obedience. How both developments jive with Retsuko should make “Aggretsuko” plenty entertaining in its fourth year.

7. “Lost in Space” Season 3 (available December 1)

Why Should I Watch? If adventurous family fare is what you seek this holiday season “Lost in Space” is one of the better bets. The shiny Netflix reboot lasted the same number of seasons as Irwin Allen’s original (three each!) and it still tracks the Robinson family as they try to survive the hostile environments of deep space. Season 3 sees Judy Penny Will John and Maureen separated from each other and still trapped on a mysterious planet. With the help of their (legitimately cool) Robot the family will try to rescue local colonists topple an alien threat and — most importantly — reunite with the ones they love.

Bonus Reason: The Robot (just called “Robot”) is the best part of this family-friendly adventure series and one has to hope showrunner Zack Estrin maximizes its potential before the final credits roll. Tune in to find out! (At the very least this outsized open-ended question — “Did they do enough with the Robot?” “What would I have done?” “Where does this robot stand in the long cinematic history of helpful A.I. machines?” — will give parents something to focus on while the kiddos are caught up in all those not-so-dangerous escapes.)

As befits its status as a spin-off from The Toys That Made Us The Movies That Made Us is fueled by populist nostalgia instead of cinematic rigor intended to make you happy about things you (and everybody else) already loved rather than force any examination or introspection about the medium.

Occupying the vast middle ground between The Movies That Made Us and an ultra-meticulous or ultra-intellectual cinematic essay like Thom Andersen’s Los Angeles Plays Itself or Marlon Riggs’ Color Adjustment is Netflix’s new series Voir a six-episode collection of visual essays tied to movie-love.

Voir The Bottom Line The good essays overflow with movie love the worst are at least short. Airdate: Monday December 6 Executive producers: David Fincher and David Prior

Voir comes from executive producers David Fincher and David Prior and will likely be sold on Fincher’s name because he’s David Fincher even if Prior’s involvement is clearly more hands-on. A tribute to the joy of movie-going at a moment many people still don’t feel like going to the movies Voir is an effort to make a show that Film Twitter will want to watch but can’t ethically review because of various personal ties to focal creators like roving critics Drew McWeeny and Walter Chaw or awards blogger Sasha Stone — at least not without obligatory disclosures like: Drew is a friend and longtime former colleague while at least one Voir narrator has me blocked on Twitter for mysterious reasons.

No positive or negative personal connections have much impact on the reality that Voir intentionally isn’t trying to do exclusively one single thing; episodes are all over the place in terms of focus form and quality though it’s less a movie version of ESPN’s 30 for 30 franchise than a half-dozen slightly elongated versions of a Chuck Workman Oscar montage.

The six entries have a common starting point with written essays narrated by this group of aficionados and enthusiasts — McWeeny Chaw Stone Tony Zhou and Taylor Ramos. Actually the easiest way to say what Voir is doing is to urge people to seek out Zhou and Ramos’ Every Frame a Painting webseries still available on YouTube. Only Fincher and Prior know why they wanted to do a new series and not just reboot Every Frame a Painting in a new home since three Voir episodes come from those creators and look and feel like extensions of that series.

I’d guess that the executive producers — Prior directs multiple episodes Fincher does not — liked Every Frame a Painting but wanted to show a little bit more flexibility. So what are the Voir episodes? You have Stone recalling the summer of 1975 specifically the experience of seeing Jaws and watching as it ushered in the era of Hollywood blockbusters. Chaw also looks backward but his take on 48 Hours which he first saw at the age of nine is a tremendous blend of reflection and current analysis looking at the movie as a text and weaving in star theory and auteur theory to show how it fits into Eddie Murphy and Walter Hill’s bodies of work. McWeeny uses Lawrence of Arabia as the pivot for discussing how we can love a movie even if its main characters are unlikeable by design. Zhou and Ramos work on more of a conceptual level and their episodes respectively look at the crafting of animated characters representations of revenge and the eternal debate between film and television.

Within that variety there are several individual approaches. Stone’s recollections are through staged flashbacks featuring actors accompanied by plenty of clips from Jaws. The animation and revenge episodes feature talking head interviews with academics and an assortment of big names in the Disney space including Glen Keane and Brenda Chapman. Some episodes are driven by clips from movies artfully edited around echoes of dialogue or theme. The animation episode features well animation. Several episodes give their narrators an on-camera role generally sitting in a darkened theater while in others they’re voice-only. The TV episode has what I believe to be just a general actress representing all people who watch TV which might as well represent the universality of the medium but I couldn’t say for sure.

Episodes range from 17 to 23 minutes which benefits the essays with a clear thesis through-line and conclusion. It turns out that 22 minutes is the perfect amount of time to listen to Chaw muse on 48 Hours whetting my appetite for a rewatch of the movie which is amusingly available on Amazon rather than Netflix. There’s no question that McWeeny’s thoughts on antiheroes could have stretched to feature length but his episode makes a variety of persuasive points and covers a reasonable range of cinematic history. Plus it’s always pleasant to luxuriate in footage from Lawrence of Arabia which is amusingly available on Amazon rather than Netflix. Zhou’s revenge essay covers everything from early Lumiere shorts to John Wick though it’s built around Sympathy for Lady Vengeance which is amusingly available on Tubi rather than Netflix. In fact say what you will about Voir including clips from Fincher projects and whatnot but the series could have operated as a commercial for Netflix’s library and instead it very much does not.

Not surprisingly this TV critic was most frustrated by the token superficiality of the lone episode to acknowledge television which barely rises to the level of media analysis I’d expect from an introductory class of a freshman seminar. It does however have a very funny punchline related to the Game of Thrones finale. The animation episode is informative and packed with interesting voices but I don’t think it really ties together. Stone’s gauzy recollections of the visceral impact of Jaws are beautifully shot — Prior directed that episode — but the blend of memory and examination runs out of steam before 17 minutes are up.

Netflix stirred up interest for Voir on Twitter with a tease about a Fincher special announcement as if Mank 2: The Mankening were in development. The actual series itself mostly points to the director’s love of movies but there’s no logic by which I could say “If you liked Zodiac you’ll dig Voir.” Take these six episodes as a proof-of-concept for a brainier Netflix show about cinema than just a trip down popcorn-strewn memory lane and there’s enough to enjoy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9uZXRmbGl4LWluc2lkZXItdHJhZGluZy1zZW50ZW5jZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8xMi8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9uZXRmbGl4LWluc2lkZXItdHJhZGluZy1zZW50ZW5jZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Netflix engineer and accomplice sentenced to prison for insider trading,"New York NY CNN —

A former Netflix (NFLX) software engineer and his best friend were sentenced Friday for securities fraud the US Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Washington announced.

Their roles in an insider trading ring illegally generated more than $3 million US attorney Nick Brown said.

Sung Mo Jun 49 was sentenced to two years in prison and a $15000 fine. His co-conspirator Junwoo Chon 50 was sentenced to 14 months in prison and a $10000 fine. Both are from Bellevue Washington and pleaded guilty in August. CNN has reached out to attorneys for Jun and Chon for comment.

“For people in the high-tech industry they will clearly know that there are consequences – including prison time – for this activity” US District Judge Richard A. Jones said.

Insider trading is the buying or selling of a company’s securities with information not available to the public. It is illegal in the United States.

Brown the US attorney said in a press release both men were financially secure and had well-paying jobs but “greed drove them to break the law to increase their own wealth.”

According to case records Jun worked at Netflix from July 2016 to February 2017 during which time he shared confidential subscriber data with his brother Joon Jun and with Chon.

After leaving Netflix Sung Mo Jun continued sharing information and began making trades himself using data received from another Netflix software engineer Ayden Lee case records showed.

Jun is forfeiting $495188 to the US government and Chon is forfeiting $1582885. Both must complete 50 hours of community service and will be on one year of supervised release after they are released from prison.

“What I did was foolish wrong illegal…. I have no excuse. I disappointed many people” Sung Mo Jun told the court at his sentencing.

The other two conspirators Joon Jun and Lee will be sentenced next year."

The six-bedroom five-bathroom residence with double garage — designed by the award-winning architect Bruce Stafford — is at 81 Fitzwilliam Rd. It’s believed to be the closest home to the water on the Sydney harbourfront.

With the couple having relocated to their Bowral residence 12 months ago they’ve now set a February 8 auction via Sotheby’s managing director Michael Pallier who has a $25m price guide.

“This is waterfront living nirvana — north-facing right on the harbour on a natural beauty spot at the northern point of the Fitzwilliam Rd cul-de-sac” Pallier says.

The home gets its name because of the unique pool in the rocks below which according to folklore was a result of a visitor arriving from the country in the 1950s with a stick of gelignite who announced: “I’m going to build you a pool.”

Next minute “boom!” “boom!” Instant pool.

Morgan now managing director of Niche Marketing Group was Westpac managing director between 1997 and 2007. Well before Kelly became the first Labor woman federal Minister in the House of Representatives in 1987.

She was a Minister in both the Hawke and Keating and Labor governments retiring from politics in 1995.

They’d bought ‘Rockpool’ for $8m in 2009 which was then an older home on its 484 sqm block.

They then commissioned Stafford for a rebuild within the existing walls — the replacement house would otherwise not be allowed to be as close to the water.

Having been given an exclusive tour of the home on Friday the new residence is extraordinary.

The minute you step through the front door your eye is immediately drawn to the harbour view to your left.

The huge open-plan living area opens through bifolds to a full-width terrace with views to the Heads to your left; the Crescent Rd Vaucluse waterfronts directly in front of you across Parsley Bay (including hotel developer Jerry Schwartz’s $65m mansion still being renovated); and Parsley Bay Bridge to the right.

Sitting on the lounge watching the Manly ferries going past in the distance and the sound of the water lapping on the rocks below was incredibly relaxing.

Other highlights for me were the practical design of the kitchen (with Miele appliances and a long breakfast bar); the study (which would be a joyous place to work with its harbour view and natural light streaming in); the beautiful master suite (with its freestanding bath and also an outlook of the boats bobbing on the water) on the middle level; and a similarly stunning guest suite (and the neighbouring bedroom) on the waterfront level.

The terrace off both these bedrooms has steps leading an outdoor lounge and bar (perfect for cocktail hour) and the Rockpool which is remarkably perfect given the secret to its creation.

Another bonus is the automated jetty — it can be raised and lowered to suit the tide by remote control.

Morgan and Kelly’s nearby two-bedroom top-floor apartment with harbour views and garage is also available for sale if buyers are interested.

Legendary investor Jeremy Grantham is generally known for his pessimism about the stock market.

Grantham expects a correction to rock the market in the coming months but one sector he remains bullish on is green investing.

The rush of capital to businesses searching for solutions to the planet’s environmental challenges creates “an unfair advantage for green investing” Grantham recently told Bloomberg.

“This is going to be the most important investment theme for the rest of your life” he said.

Grantham has invested most of his own fortune into the green economy as well as a fair chunk of the $60 billion he manages for asset management firm Grantham Mayo & Van Otterloo.

Let’s look at three green energy stocks in the GMO portfolio that might help you make some green of your own. You may even be able to get a piece of them — or stocks like them — with your spare pennies.

1. NextEra Energy (NEE)

You might expect to see Tesla in this spot but Grantham believes the electric vehicle leader’s stock is in a bubble of its own. When the company starts facing stiffer competition he could wind up being right.

Electrical services provider NextEra Energy could have more long-term upside. The energy provider is the world’s largest producer of power from wind and solar and it plans to double in size by 2023.

As the company ramps up and spends more on critical new tech ventures like energy storage it should be able to depend on the revenue generated by its portfolio of utilities including one of the country’s largest Florida Power & Light to maintain its upward momentum. FPL alone contributed $836 million to net income in the third quarter of 2021.

NextEra’s stock has had a bumpy ride this year but it’s up about 14% since the start of 2021.

2. Brookfield Renewable (BEP)

Brookfield Renewable owns and operates an expanding portfolio of solar wind hydropower and energy storage facilities across 34 states. The company says it already produces enough electricity to power about 3 million homes annually.

Story continues

Brookfield has been in the power generating business for more than 120 years. As an experienced partner that can help other companies decarbonize their operations Brookfield possesses a significant amount of growth potential for such an established entity. According to its Q3 earnings report the company has more than $3 billion in liquidity to tap into to ensure that growth continues.

Q3 2021 also saw the company bring in $210 million from operations a 32% increase over the same period last year.

Brookfield’s stock down 20% this year hasn’t exactly been killing it lately. But if you believe in the company’s combination of expertise and upside it might be worth investigating to potentially buy on the dip.

3. Plug Power (PLUG)

Hydrogen production facility | Plug Power

Plug Power is racing to the forefront of the hydrogen fuel cell industry.

Why does that matter for green investors? Hydrogen fuel cells by powering cars trucks and even large facilities like data centers and hospitals figure to be central in the planet’s pivot away from fossil fuels.

But Plug isn’t just in the fuel cell business. It also produces liquid hydrogen and has projected that it will be the top U.S. producer of sustainable liquid hydrogen by late 2023 or early 2024. As more businesses homes and vehicles run on hydrogen Plug could benefit.

Investing in emerging technologies is always a risky venture. Plug’s Q3 revenue was $37 million higher than a year before but earnings still fell well short of expectations. The company’s stock has shed nearly 17% in the last month in an up-and-down year.

Green investing without the threat of a market correction

Patricia Elaine Thomas / Shutterstock

Let’s not forget that Grantham recently said that inflation and overvalued stocks could trigger a correction that puts the crash of 1929 to shame.

If he’s right you might want to protect your portfolio with an asset detached from the market altogether one that provides multiple revenue streams and hedges against inflation: farmland.

Don’t worry. You don’t need millions of dollars or farming know-how to invest in America’s rapidly appreciating farmland. A popular app helps you purchase shares in U.S. farm operations.

Farmland investments have been much less volatile than the S&P 500 and demonstrated strong annual returns. And demand for food will only grow with the expanding global population.

Model: Air Max 97 ""Air Sprung""

Release Date: Spring 2022

Price: $170

Buy: TBC

Editor's Notes: As far as I know T-Pain doesn't make sneakers; not Nike sneakers anyway; but if he did they might come with a name similar to ""Air Sprung.""

Despite what the name might suggest the latest Air Max 97 to join the ever-growing archive of 90s classics has no affiliation with the 2005 banger.

The AM97 ""Air Sprung"" marks the second release within a growing pack of Swoosh icons following the multi-colored Air Max 95 earlier this year and including the Blazer Low Platform Air Max 90 and Air Force 1 Low.

Similiar to its predecessor the 97 gets decked out in a playful light palette that is far removed from the ultra-futurist raver classic that is the ""Silver Bullet.""

The pair part of Nike's Move to Zero features a mix of sand and sail white tumbled leather and canvas. What makes these so endearing is the application of caterpillar and butterfly motifs spread across the silhouette along with bold pops of pink and purple to offset the muted uppers.

Traditional Air Max 97 branding which sits at the woven heel pull and tongue has been remixed and switched out for new ""Air Sprung"" logos which at the tongue are adorned with additional embroidered characters.

If this pair of 97s and the additional silhouettes that make up the larger collection that is due to release next Spring are anything to go by Nike is getting back to having fun creating packs. There's nothing wrong with not taking yourself too seriously and here it excels.

The winter season has barely started yet Nike is already looking ahead to the warmer climates of 2022 where humans can soak in the Vitamin D rather than shield themselves from the bitter cold. Sure to be a popular hit in the casual footwear market is this newest colorway of the ubiquitous Air Huarache a silhouette that enjoyed a grandstand year of releases in 2021 due to its 30th Anniversary. Appearing in a gang of original colorways like the first-ever launch of the Air Huarache “Praline” the Tinker-designed runner is now seen donning a clean white upper above a classic light gum outsole.

Truth be told you can’t beat the comfort style and affordability of an Air Huarache.

The Minneapolis-based skate shop’s new release will be the final Nike Dunk to be released in 2021 closing out a massively popular year for the silhouette. The pairs were first teased in June earlier this year but were rumored to have received a cease and desist order for reasons that are still unknown.

The upcoming pairs pay homage to the legendary First Avenue nightclub in Minneapolis a concert hall that recently celebrated its 50th anniversary. The venue is a cornerstone of music culture in the city and was most notably the setting for the final scene of Purple Rain. It was said Prince performed at First Avenue so often that many of his fans thought he owned the club.

The black nubuck uppers reference the star-spangled cinderblock exterior of the nightclub featuring star perforations on the toebox brick detailing on the dark purple collar overlays and a large star embroidered on the lateral heel. The toe and eyestay overlays are dressed in reflective dark purple leathers with wear-away paint highlights and laces come in bright purple. The interiors of the shoe are lined in velvet materials and insoles feature Familia x Nike SB co-branding on the zoom-air insole heel and a 50th-anniversary vintage-style ticket stub graphic on the midfoot. Below a black midsole and a semi-translucent outsole displaying all-over graphics of the famous stars complete the upcoming pairs.

The Familia x Nike Dunk Low Pro SB “First Ave” will officially release on December 11 at select skate shops. Take a look at David Bluetile’s detailed breakdown above.

Light-hearted guests leaped at the opportunity to wander through tunnels of light amid sculptures of fancifully hued flowers and under tree paths alive with astonishing colors. It was Lightscape Preview Night at the Chicago Botanic Garden in Glencoe once again a sold-out success raising $1 million and attracting 600 visitors.

Co-hosted by The Woman’s Board Board of Directors and Guild of the Chicago Horticultural Society the Lightscape Preview was co-chaired by Woman’s Board members Kathy Paleczny and Karin Palasz Board of Directors Matt Banholzer and Suzanne Burns and Guild members Ali Gerchen and Meg Kellerman.

Lightscape was made possible by the generous support of Northern Trust and Catherine and Frederick Waddell. Culinary Landscape served as caterers for the evening with spirits provided by Beam Suntory.

Guests enjoyed trailside hot bites and seasonal drinks while walking the all-new 1.25-mile path filled with favorite artistic installations like the Winter Cathedral and new and reimagined pieces including singing Christmas trees shooting stars and shining space creatures.

The after-dark illuminated and music-filled trail is open through January 2. Visitors are urged to purchase tickets soon as possible as Lightscape sells out quickly.

The Chicago Botanic Gardens comprises 385 acres of landscaped gardens featuring millions of plants flowers and trees in 27 different gardens. Its educational opportunities are available for all ages. This is the 20th anniversary of its Plants of Concern program to track the status of rare threatened and endangered species in northeast Illinois. A landmark program at the time of its conception Plants of Concern has remained a model for long-term collaborative community science and still represents one of the only programs of its kind in the world.

Looping for Tony Finau is a break from his day job and Smith only missed his regular routine briefly when he considered the calendar. The Utah Jazz owner would be missing a home game Friday night against the Boston Celtics.

Even so he couldn't pass up the opportunity.

Finau's regular caddie Mark Urbanek is home as his wife prepares to have a child. Finau and Smith have been friends in Salt Lake City longer than either can remember.

""He called me and he's like 'Bro I need you to caddie for me.' I had to answer the bell right?"" Smith said after his boss for the week rolled in an 18-foot birdie putt for a 6-under 66 to sit one shot off the lead going into the weekend.

""When Tony calls you go. He doesn't ask for a lot.""

The Jazz beat the Celtics 137-130 in Smith's absence.

Jazz owner Ryan Smith took a part-time job for the week serving as the caddie for longtime friend Tony Finau at the Hero World Challenge. Finau's regular caddie needed the week off because his wife is expecting. AP

This isn't their first time inside the ropes at a tournament. Finau and Smith have been partners twice in the Dunhill Links Championship a three-course rotation that allows Smith to take on the Barry Burn at Carnoustie and the Road Hole at St. Andrews.

""I've been next to him as an amateur partner when he's in contention on the Old Course so I know his game well enough and kind of his temperament"" Smith said. ""It's the perfect setup.""

Almost.

Smith reached the top of the stairs next to the scoring room as Finau stepped inside to sign his card at Albany Golf Club. This was more work than play but he was loving it.

""Hauling a 50-pound bag around I think everyone thinks I'm on vacation"" he said. ""This is hard work. I'm exhausted.""

Smith is co-founder of Qualtrics a cloud-computing company in Utah that was sold to German software firm SAP for $8 billion three years ago. The 44-year-old then became majority owner of the Jazz a year ago.

Basketball has been a lifelong passion and so has golf.

""I had a stepfather who is no longer with us but he kind of got me going in golf"" Smith said. ""I worked at a golf course when I was 14 years old picking balls on the range and then just loved it. At some point in my 20s I was like 'OK you've got to sit down and see what your things are. And golf is one of my things.""

Even as he was building Qualtrics Smith spent enough time on his game to get down to a 2 handicap index. Along with playing the Dunhill Links with Finau in 2018 and 2019 he has been at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am with players like Branden Grace and Josh Teater.

Smith won the Jack Lemmon Award at Pebble in 2019 giving to the amateur who provides the most help to his pro. He and Teater finished third in the pro-am.

""It's like suiting up and playing an NBA preseason game"" Smith said.

As much as he loves the competition Smith finds great value in relationships through golf not to mention a little peace and quiet.

""Some of the best business relationships and the best partners I've met on the golf courses. No way our paths would have crossed if not for this game"" he said. ""And it's the one place I go where the phone stays in the bag which is incredible.

""My wife says 'You need yoga.' I tell her my yoga is golf.""

Smith plays as much basketball as he does golf with Finau one of the more popular players on the PGA Tour. Finau ended a drought that stretched 142 tournaments over five years when he won The Northern Trust to start the PGA Tour's postseason.

That victory made Finau a shoo-in to be picked for the Ryder Cup team where he teamed with Harris English during a record rout by the Americans at Whistling Straits.

This is a good way to end a big year -- a 20-man field of elite players a $3.5 million purse and $1 million to the winner. Finau says his billionaire friend will be treated like his regular caddie.

""He's taking an extreme pay cut I know that"" Finau told Golf Channel. ""It's a fun atmosphere and the perfect tournament to bring Ryan along.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL250aW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tLmF1L2FuLWVyb3Npb24tb2YtdHJ1c3QtcmVzcGVjdC1pbnRlZ3JpdHktYW5kLXRoZS1sYWNrLW9mLWNvbXBhc3Npb24tYW5kLWRlY2VuY3ktbnQtcG9saWNlLXNlcmdlYW50cy1yZXNpZ25hdGlvbi1sZXR0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'An erosion of trust respect integrity and the lack of compassion and decency': NT Police Sergeant's resignation letter,"An Alice Springs Detective Sergeant has cited an “erosion of trust respect integrity and the lack of compassion and common decency” in the NT Police executive team as the reason for resigning after 24 years service in a letter sent to Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker.

Territory-born Leith Phillips who has also acted as a Senior Sergeant said he gave formal notice of his resignation on Thursday in the letter to Mr Chalker that his last day would be on January 3 but he said he was forced out of the Alice Springs police station on Friday.

“For my 24 years’ service I had my computer and swipe card access revoked I was then tracked down inside the Alice Springs police station by Acting Commander Kirsten Engels who feigned compassion instructed not to touch the computer escorted to collect the last of my personal belongings and escorted to the front door of the police station” he wrote.

“The reason given that ‘they’ presumably the executive were concerned as to who I would speak with whilst inside the police station and what I might do presumably via email or other.”

NT Police media manager Rob Cross did not respond to a request for a response to the email but Mr Phillips is now subject to disciplinary action with Acting Commander Kylie Anderson issuing him an 11-page Section 79 notice for alleged serious breaches of discipline – which the NT Independent has seen – one of the alleged breaches being the resignation letter.

The resignation letter was described as being “disrespectful and discourteous” and “disgraceful and improper” to Mr Chalker and the executive and “improper and disrespectful” towards Deputy Commissioner Murray Smalpage.

It said Sgt Phillips had been instructed by a commander on August 12 not to contact Mr Chalker and that he had accepted the disciplinary action against him.

Sgt Phillips said that action came because he had sent an email to Mr Chalker with some links to various ‘COVID-19 sites’ including the Australian COVID Medical Network and advised him he should be better informed.

“The discipline was a meeting with Laidler (Commander Craig Laidler) who said do not communicate with the COP any further. Nothing in writing was provided to me and I was not served any documents” he said.

The other alleged breach is over the fully vaccinated Sgt Phillips giving a 15-minute speech at a Free in the NT rally in Alice Springs on Novmeber 27 where he did not identify himself as a police officer – although he is well known in the town – where he said he was not speaking on behalf of his employer.

In that speech he said he personally wanted a revocation of the NT’s emergency declaration which would remove the chief health officer’s directives including the COVID-19 vaccination mandate. Sgt Phillips also said emergency declarations should be reduced back to five-day orders from the current 90-day orders and the power of the chief medical officer should be severely curtailed into some form of advisory board and that no employer should be able to discriminate on the basis of medical or vaccination status.

He said he was at times embarrassed to be a police officer because of the way the rights of citizens were set aside over COVID-19 regulations.

Mr Smalpage also suspended him without pay for the breaches in a notice also seen by the NT Independent.

Sgt Phillips had also given a 13-page response to the police executive’s request for feedback about proposed mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for officers or the use of masks in the unvaccinated which included the following: his questioning the fatality infection rate modelling for COVID-19; his criticism of the chief health officer directions over-riding historic rights and protections; his championing the use of ivermectin to treat the virus; criticism of the methods of the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s approval of the Pfizer vaccine; criticism of the vaccine mandate not allowing for informed consent; criticisms of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test; and criticism of universal mask wearing.

The Zach Rolfe charge and waning support of Chalker

Sgt Phillips started his letter to Mr Chalker – you can read the full letter at the bottom of the article – with a section called the “excuse provision” where he said he wanted to invoke the “Smallpage defence” and apologise in advance for any offence he may cause in the letter.

“I trust this is a sufficient defence for any intended disciplinary action” he wrote.

That was a reference to Mr Smalpage’s accidental live-streaming of himself in September joking that a collective noun for police officers would be a “murder”. Mr Chalker issued a statement saying there would be no disciplinary action because Mr Smalpage “did not intend to cause such offence”.

The “murder” comment was viewed as offensive by some NT police officers and members of the public who suggested that Mr Smalpage was poking fun of Constable Zach Rolfe who is facing trial for the shooting death of Kumanjayi Walker when trying to arrest him in Yuendumu in 2019 days before Ms Chalker took the top job.

Sgt Phillips was scathing of Mr Chalker who he said he has worked alongside and later defended after he rose to police commissioner. He was also critical of the executive charging Constable Rolfe with murder four days after the shooting.

“Sir and I use this honorific purely due to the respect I hold for the office of the Commissioner of Police not the person who currently holds this position as I no longer have any confidence in your ability to lead this organisation with respect honour and integrity” he wrote.

“I have been pushed into and forced to undertake this action (his resignation) due to the erosion of trust respect integrity and the lack of compassion and common decency which is no longer an integral part of your decision making or that of your executive leadership team.

“In the mess that followed Saturday 9 November 2019 (the death of Mr Walker) and the tumultuous circumstances of your first days in office I supported and vouched for you when others were against you through the first six months of your commencement as COP.

“I did this because I knew you and was hopeful of positive change as I had observed your progression through the ranks since you were a plain clothes Sergeant in Alice Springs CIB.

“However since this time I have borne witness and been subject to your leadership group undertaking persistent executive overreach into police investigations whereby it has become blindingly obvious that very few of your executives have any confidence in the investigative experience and skill-set of the police officers under their commands.

“Nor does it appear that they display any current investigative skill themselves and appear to have lost complete touch with the realities of current day policing.”

In mid October the NT Independent reported NT Police assistant commissioner Dr Narelle Beer resigned – making her the third of the Territory’s top brass to resign this year – citing alleged bullying sources said adding that she felt “used” by the executive over the charging of Constable Rolfe.

A source said Ms Beer was unhappy when other NT Police executives oversaw the charging of Constable Rolfe after Ms Beer had arranged for him to be flown from Alice Springs to Darwin on November 13 2019.

At the time NT Police said they held concerns for the officer’s safety which necessitated the transfer but instead used the opportunity to charge him with murder over the shooting death of Kumanjayi Walker.

The loss of experience from the ranks

Sgt Phillips told Mr Chalker his leadership had overseen the loss of numerous skilled detectives and general duty police officers to other jurisdictions and fields of investigation around the country leaving the NT’s small force depleted of skilled senior detectives and senior officers on the ground.

“It has been a deplorable loss of experience over a very short period for which you have presided and appeared to have encouraged those members to leave” he wrote.

“One can only ask why a leader would be so willing to deplete his workforce of its experience base?

“Would it be so that those who have the experience and therefore the courage and integrity to speak against poor policy are no longer around leaving a junior group who are more willing to comply with poor leadership because they do not know any better?”

The NT Police annual report was tabled in late September that showed the attrition rate shot to 8.51 per cent – from 4.53 per cent in the 2019-20 financial year and 4.66 per cent the year before. The annual report does not give the actual number of officers who left or a breakdown of why they left but is calculated using resignations terminations retirements and dismissals.

In mid September the NT Police Association’s 2021 member survey results were published and showed more Territory cops were seeking a job outside the NT than ever before with officers citing management issues as their reason for leaving.

Of more than 531 respondents 60 per cent or 318 police officers have either applied or are considering applying for a job outside of the NT Police doubling attrition rates since last year.

“The ‘brain drain’ from our organisation has impacted and will continue to impact investigations into the future” Mr Phillips wrote.

“How many homicides and critical incidents have this executive specifically been involved with in their career?

“I was part of the Alice Springs CIB during the infamous 2006-2008 period where we investigated some nine-plus homicides in that 18 month period and for the most part ran them autonomously from Darwin.

“How many in the executive have been involved in Supreme Court trials where regardless of the outcome it is the experience gained from these cases that helps develop investigative skill sets?

“There are some executive members but not many and this is something that can never be trained for.

“It is this experience we are losing and to have a Commander or above dictate or question my ability or that of the senior investigating team as to how to undertake an impartial investigation is insulting at the least and evidence of a lack of experience and trust from those asking the question.”

Police involvement in the COVID-19 response

Sgt Phillips said his trust had been further eroded by what he said was a “continuous and heavy-handed police response” to COVID-19 which began in early 2020.

“We have seen hard working members of our community fined exorbitant sums of money for breaching a chief health officer direction which is not a law but simply a CHO directive enforceable only for the duration of an emergency declaration” he said.

“We have been used as the big stick in a health response where these same hard-working citizens of our community have borne the brunt of flattening the curve and then have been forced to undergo quarantine for weeks at a time.

“In Alice Springs citizens are detained at the Todd Facility where they have less rights and freedom than a prisoner being held in ‘G’ block or in an isolation cell at the Alice Springs Correctional Centre. “The abuse of basic civil (and) human rights is beyond me and I am ashamed to wear the uniform where it says that I am to serve and protect the people of the Northern Territory.”

Sgt Phillips said earlier in the year he had emailed and texted Mr Chalker regarding the police response to COVID-19 and had received responses.

“This ended when you obviously took offence at being provided information which was not in accordance with the current public narrative and therefore had me counselled through the chain of command by an ASCOM with the instruction that I was to not communicate with you any further” he wrote.

“I have not done so until now. This was a further erosion of that trust in the office of the Commissioner of Police.

“Just for the record I am double vaxxed however because I am anti-mandate and am providing comfort to those who are not vaxxed I am a tin-foil-hat-wearing anti-vaxxer.

“I am not an anti-vaxxer I am pro-choice and I believe in informed consent – the right for everyone to conduct a risk assessment of their personal circumstances and proceed if the benefit outweighs the risk.

“A right that no longer appears to be an option in society.”

Sgt Phillips said there was degeneration under COVID-19 of the NT Police force where the law was being used as a tool for political repression and it was enforced unequally on parties with a different set of rules favouring a few sections of society.

“The manipulation coercion force and bullying tactics used in the forced standing down of good people and members of the Northern Territory Police Fire and Emergency Service (sworn and unsworn) medical practitioners teachers and others in the public service is simply irrational without thought logic or common-sense” he wrote.

“In any other time the actions of our executive and government would be deemed unlawful and as an abuse of office and put simply would result in multiple counts of unlawful dismissal.

“Regardless of your position on vaccination I ask all of the senior executive what is your line in the sand?

“Where will you stop and stand and say ‘this far and no further’ in relation to your loss of freedom and the illogical mandates you are enforcing on members and the public?

“Remember the CHO directions (rules) and any future changes to the law which may reflect these current discriminatory directives are the exact same rules which you and your family must also live under when you are off duty.

“You commissioned officers and those in the executive you are not exempt.”

READ THE FULL LETTER:

Commissioner of Police

Excuse Provision

Firstly I invoke the ‘SMALLPAGE’ defence and apologise in advance for any offence I may cause in this email and in any attachment. I trust this is a sufficient defence for any intended disciplinary action.

Formal Notice of Resignation

I gave formal notice of resignation from the Northern Territory Police Force on Thursday 02 December 2021 effective as of close of business 03 January 2022 the last day of my current personal leave.

Friday 03 December 2021

For my 24 years’ service I had my computer and swipe card access revoked I was then tracked down inside the Alice Springs Police Station by Acting Commander Kirsten Engles who feigned compassion instructed not to touch the computer escorted to collect the last of my personal belongings and escorted to the front door of the police station.

The reason given that ‘they’ (presumably the executive) were concerned as to who I would speak with whilst inside the police station and what I might do (presumably via email or other).

So here is the ‘what I might do’ part of ‘their’ concern.

Erosion of trust

Sir and I use this honorific purely due to the respect I hold for the office of the Commissioner of Police (COP) not the person who currently holds this position as I no longer have any confidence in your ability to lead this organisation with respect honour and integrity.

I have come to the position of resigning from the Northern Territory Police Force in my 24th year of service having commenced on 05 October 1998. I have been pushed into and forced to undertake this action due to the erosion of trust respect integrity and the lack of compassion and common decency which is no longer an integral part of your decision making or that of your executive leadership team.

In the mess that followed Saturday 09 November 2019 and the tumultuous circumstances of your first days in office I supported and vouched for you when others were against you through the first six (6) months of your commencement as COP. I did this because I knew you and was hopeful of positive change as I had observed your progression through the ranks since you were a plain clothes Sergeant in Alice Springs CIB.

However since this time I have borne witness and been subject to your leadership group undertaking persistent executive overreach into police investigations whereby it has become blindingly obvious that very few of your executives have any confidence in the investigative experience and skillset of the police officers under their commands. Nor does it appear that they display any current investigative skill themselves and appear to have lost complete touch with the realities of current day policing.

Subsequently under your leadership we have seen the loss of numerous skilled Detectives and general duty police officers to other jurisdictions and fields of investigation around the country leaving our small force depleted of skilled senior Detectives and senior officers on the ground. It has been a deplorable loss of experience over a very short period for which you have presided and appeared to have encouraged those members to leave. One can only ask why a leader would be so willing to deplete his workforce of its experience base? Would it be so that those who have the experience and therefore the courage and integrity to speak against poor policy are no longer around leaving a junior group who are more willing to comply with poor leadership because they do not know any better?

The ‘brain drain’ from our organisation has impacted and will continue to impact investigations into the future. How many homicides and critical incidents have this executive specifically been involved with in their career? I was part of the Alice Springs CIB during the infamous 2006-2008 period where we investigated some 9+ homicides in that 18 month period and for the most part ran them autonomously from Darwin. This was when the Stuart Highway was dubbed the ‘Cannabis Highway to the stabbing capital of Australia’ (thank you SC Deanne Horwood for coining that phrase). How many in the executive have been involved in Supreme Court trials where regardless of the outcome it is the EXPERIENCE gained from these cases that helps develop investigative skill sets? There are some executive members but not many and this is something that can NEVER be trained for. It is this EXPERIENCE we are losing and to have a Commander or above dictate or question my ability (or that of the Senior Investigating team) as to how to undertake an impartial investigation is insulting at the least and evidence of a lack of experience and trust from those asking the question.

COVID-19 Response

The erosion of trust has been further enhanced by the continuous and heavy-handed police response starting in early 2020 to Covid-19 whereby we have seen hard working members of our community fined exorbitant sums of money for breaching a Chief Health Officer (CHO) direction which is not a law but simply a CHO directive enforceable only for the duration of an ‘Emergency Declaration’. We have been used as the ‘big stick’ in a health response where these same hard-working citizens of our community have borne the brunt of ‘flattening the curve’ and then have been forced to undergo quarantine for weeks at a time. In Alice Springs citizens are detained at the ‘Todd Facility’ where they have less rights and freedom than a prisoner being held in ‘G’ block or in an isolation cell at the Alice Springs Correctional Centre. The abuse of basic civil / human rights is beyond me and I am ashamed to wear the uniform where it says that I am to ‘Serve and Protect’ the people of the Northern Territory. The degradation of trust and the division created between the police and the public will be generational.

In the early parts of this year I had communicated with you (COP) regarding the way in which police had been used in the Northern Territory and around Australia in relation to the Covid-19 response. This had been done via email and SMS to which you had replied. This ended when you obviously took offence at being provided information which was not in accordance with the current public narrative and therefore had me counselled through the chain of command by an ASCOM with the instruction that I was to not communicate with you any further. I have not done so until now. This was a further erosion of that trust in the office of the Commissioner of Police.

Further in response to the Assistant Commissioner People & Cultural Reform request for consultation into mask and vaccine mandates I attach the memorandum I submitted on 05 October 2021 detailing my concern. To date I have not received any response to this memorandum not even an acknowledgement of receipt by that office. Note also that I included the NTPA in this memorandum for which our association has been found significantly wanting by its silence on this issue until the eleventh hour. I provide it in full now for all members to see part of my thought process and decision making and why I am taking this stand.

Just for the record I am double vaxxed however because I am anti-mandate and am providing comfort to those who are not vaxxed I am a tin foil hat wearing ‘Anti-Vaxxer’. I am not an ‘Anti-Vaxxer’ I am pro choice and I believe in informed consent – the right for everyone to conduct a risk assessment of their personal circumstances and proceed if the benefit outweighs the risk. A right that no longer appears to be an option in society.

Role of Police in Society

I now come to the role of Constables in the Northern Territory.

When I was sworn in as a Constable of Police I did not swear an oath to the Commissioner of Police. I swore an oath as follows:

I (LEITH PHILLIPS) DO SWEAR – THAT – I WILL WELL AND TRULY SERVE – HER MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SECOND HER HEIRS AND SUCCESSORS – AS A MEMBER OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY POLICE FORCE WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOUR – AFFECTION OR ILL-WILL – FROM THIS DAY UNTIL I AM LEGALLY DISCHARGED FROM THAT FORCE – THAT I WILL SEE AND CAUSE – HER MAJESTY’S PEACE TO BE KEPT AND PRESERVED – THAT I WILL PREVENT TO THE BEST OF MY POWERS – ALL OFFENCES AGAINST HER MAJESTY’S PEACE – AND AGAINST ALL LAWS IN FORCE IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORY OF AUSTRALIA – AND THAT – WHILE I REMAIN A MEMBER OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY POLICE FORCE – I WILL – TO THE BEST OF MY SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE – FAITHFULLY DISCHARGE ALL MY DUTIES ACCORDING TO LAW.

SO HELP ME GOD.

To be more specific the following spells out / defines the role of a police officer in Australia:

THE EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF POLICE OFFICERS IN AUSTRALIA

At common law Australian police do not fall within the

employer-employee relationship.

The often-quoted authority for this proposition is Attorney-General (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd (1952) holds that police officers are not employees but are office-holders with “original authority” in the execution of their duties. It has been observed that because police exercise special discretionary powers derived from the law itself a police officer is a servant to the law and not to any other authority. In addition police officers swear an oath of office.

What I have witnessed in the past 12-18 months and more specifically within the last few months is the fast degeneration of the Northern Territory Police Force into ‘Rule by Law’. The use of law as a tool for political repression and enforcing it unequally on parties with a different set of rules favouring a few sections of society. This can become an instrument of oppression and can give legitimacy to the enactment of laws which may grossly violate basic human rights. In the Northern Territory and Australia in general and not what it should be the ‘Rule of Law’ is whereby all laws apply equally to all citizens of the country and no one can be above the law. It also states that no one will be subject to harsh uncivilised or discriminatory treatment even for the sake of maintaining law and order.

I can no longer in good conscience continue to be part of this descent into totalitarian ‘Rule by Law’ in this Territory. Further the manipulation coercion force and bullying tactics used in the forced standing down of good people and members of the Northern Territory Police Fire & Emergency Service (sworn & unsworn) medical practitioners teachers and others in the public service is simply irrational without thought logic or common-sense. In any other time the actions of our executive and government would be deemed unlawful and as an abuse of office and put simply would result in multiple counts of unlawful dismissal.

I question the conscience of Executive Management who are comfortable working in this current climate of ‘Rule by Law’? Are you happy to be part of this totalitarian regime remember those who stood before the courts at Nuremberg? They too said what they were doing was allowable because it was the law. Those ‘laws’ were subsequently and correctly found to be gross breaches of human rights and so significantly wrong that many of those ’employees’ were sentenced to death or life imprisonment.

You are complicit with coercing members to receive the ‘vaccination’ under duress including members who are now suffering injuries due to the vaccine. Duress manipulation and coercion is NOT consent and it equals ‘unlawful’. The demand to undergo this process to retain your employment is an example of ‘Rule by Law’.

My concerns regarding the direction that the NTPF was heading were raised and dismissed by you. I am no longer comfortable and will not comply any longer.

Regardless of your position on vaccination I ask all of the Senior Executive what is your line in the sand? Where will you stop and stand and say ‘this far and no further’ in relation to your loss of freedom and the illogical mandates you are enforcing on members and the public? Remember the CHO directions (rules) and any future changes to the law which may reflect these current discriminatory directives are the exact same rules which you and your family must also live under when you are off duty. You Commissioned officers and those in the executive you are not exempt.

To quote from the Holy Bible the book of Esther Chapter 4 verse 13 & 14 where Queen Esther (a Jew) was living in the king’s palace (some may call the 6th floor of the NAB Building the kings palace) when discriminatory decrees were being made against the Jewish population in a way not too dissimilar to today. Her uncle came to her and said “Do not imagine that you are safe in the king’s palace you alone of all the Jews. Even if you now remain silent relief and deliverance will come now to the Jews but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows – perhaps it was for a time like this that you became queen?”

Many women are accusing men in Northern Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim society of divorcing them recklessly and leaving them with the financial burden of caring for their children. In this special report by Daily Trust on Sunday divorced women shared their experiences their pain and the burden they bear.

At 21 Hafsat Ismail is a divorcee. Living in the suburban neighbourhood of Unguwan Dosa in Kaduna State Hafsat’s marriage to a young man of her choice had crashed after only six months. Marriage she says is complicated and hers was further intricated by domestic violence that often landed her in the hospital.

A few days into her marriage the 21-year-old said the man she married for love had suddenly turned on her hitting her at the slightest provocation and at some point almost killing her. Six months later at the twilight of the COVID-19 lockdown in Kaduna State the marriage broke down completely. However Hafsat said before the marriage came to an end her ex-husband had made two divorce pronouncements; an action he denied in an attempt to win her back.

“This time around he divorced me in front of witnesses. My marriage was very troubled within its six months lifespan I had escaped from my matrimonial home more than 20 times” Hafsat said.

Armed with her new divorce letter and not minding the scares inflicted on her body the 21-year-old headed straight to a Sharia Court. With the court’s stamp on her letter she was a free woman and now says she is in no hurry to remarry.

“I got the court’s stamp because men sometimes return to say they never divorced you especially when you want to remarry. They could claim you’re still their wife” she said. Now a divorcee Hafsat says life is even more complicated and is not at all what she expected.

Hafsat’s story is one among millions of others that depict a disturbing rise in the rate of divorce in northern Nigeria. Stakeholders admit the growing menace calls for concern and link it to the region’s emerging social problems such as drug addiction among young men and women criminality and prostitution.

In an interview with several divorcees across Kaduna Zaria and Kano Daily Trust on Sunday gathered that in a typical northern society where culture and religion dominate almost every aspect of a woman’s place being a divorcee for many women comes with a lot of consequences.

Our pain and the burden we bear – Divorcees

Yahanasu Saidu is four times unlucky. At 38 she has married four times; divorced three times and widowed once. “My first marriage crashed after 12 years. I had six children with my first husband but three are deceased. I remarried one year after but my husband died and we had a daughter who also died” she told Daily Trust on Sunday on a sunny Monday afternoon outside her parents’ home in Kwangila Zaria city. “I then married again” she continued “but it lasted only 40 days. I still cannot say why my husband divorced me he also didn’t give any reason in the divorce letter he handed to me but I have accepted it as destiny. I remarried a fourth time in Makarfi LGA of Kaduna State and that also ended.”

Married into a polygamous home Yahanasu said trouble started in her fourth home after she got pregnant. She claimed her husband’s first wife could not conceive and so had threatened to burn down the house. With the help of her husband’s relatives Yahanasu said she was moved into a single room apartment for peace to reign. “I went for almost two months without seeing him I gave birth to a son and his relatives took care of the naming ceremony but he abandoned us.”

Tired of waiting for her husband she approached a Sharia Court to summon him. “Initially he told the court he wasn’t going to divorce me and that he wanted me to return and live with his first wife. I was afraid for my safety and that of my child and so the marriage was eventually dissolved and I was left with a four-month-old baby to return to my parents’ home” she said.

Seven years later Yahanasu who is now an auxiliary nurse and also sews to earn a living says she bears the burden of her four children as her ex-husbands have abandoned their responsibilities. “My last child is the only child of his father. After our separation I demanded money for upkeep and at the beginning he made some efforts but later stopped. Today my son is almost seven years old and his father doesn’t know anything about his feeding his health education or clothing” she lamented.

For the three surviving children of her first husband Yahanasu said she recently married off her first child and said after threatening to sue her ex-husband relatives had intervened and compelled him to pay a monthly child support of N5000 for his three children. “But it’s now two months since I received the last alert. I will say he tries because he sometimes buys Sallah cloth for the children” she said.

The story is similar for Aisha Hassan whose 18-year-old marriage crashed six years ago and now bears the financial and moral burden of her children. Still a bitter-sweet experience the mother of four said her marriage had been good until her ex-husband made a decision she prefers not to share. With three boys and a girl Aisha says there is no financial support from their father.

Unlike Yahanasu however Aisha was discouraged from seeking legal redress due to family complications. “With the little I make from my business I am able to provide for my children to go to school and also learn a trade. My parents advised that since God has provided me with the little to cater for my children I should stop expecting anything from their father.”

At 42 Adama Mohammed still gets emotional when she recalls the pain she endured in the hands of her ex-husband. The food vendor who could not hold back tears narrated how her marriage to a butcher in Kano ended after he left her to her fate while bedridden with a mysterious ailment. Speaking from her bukka (roadside restaurant) where she now earns a living the mother of seven recounted a harrowing experience of spousal neglect betrayal and dejection during her most trying period.

A teary-eyed Adama narrated to Daily Trust on Sunday of how her parent’s desperation to find cure for a mysterious ailment that disfigured and discoloured her entire skin took them from one traditionalist to the next for two years.

Two years into her treatment Adama said her ex-husband had slammed her a divorce letter. “At the early stage of the divorce my father had requested I returned to my husband because I was recuperating but I pleaded with him to let me be. He eventually succumbed to my pleadings and I have remained a divorcee even though my ex-husband tried to win me back.”

“He is still alive living in Kano” she said of the man who abandoned her in her time of need. “We have been divorced for 14-years now but the burden of our seven children falls on me. He has never offered even N10 to buy soap for the children” she said.

“How society sees us”

“I like to make up and dress well but some people do not like it. I don’t know if it is because of our culture in the north but they view us as prostitutes. Once I step out you hear people whispering ‘ehen where is she going to’ and when I return home it is the same whispers sometimes they even point fingers” a disgruntled Hafsat Ismail told Daily Trust on Sunday while narrating the stigma that comes with being a divorcee.

The 21-year-old who sells shoes and is a rookie beautician explained that the major challenge faced by divorcees is being stereotyped as prostitutes. “People are quick to judge us and even label us prostitutes. No one cares that you are doing some trade to be self sufficient and financially independent. Instead when a suitor comes for you the same people; your neighbours friends will sneak behind you and tell the man that you are a prostitute or that you have been divorced multiple times and therefore are not marriage material” she said.

Like many women from a low income background Aisha Hassan was born in Kaduna’s Unguwan Dosa she grew up there and married there. As a divorcee she still lives in the same community where everyone calls her by her pet name; Mommy. But since her marriage ended six years ago the mother of four has remained single catering for her children and boldly says she has no plan to remarry even though suitors keep knocking on her door.

Now a business woman who sometimes delves into politics Aisha appears quite popular as many wave or stop to chat with her while walking the streets of Kaduna’s Unguwan Dosa. “We may be divorcees but we are certainly not prostitutes” she said in reaction to a growing stereotype against divorced and unmarried women across northern Nigeria.

“A serious suitor could come to you about marriage and tomorrow you hear people from your own community running after him to tell him you are a prostitute and you have married multiple times. Most times these gossips emanate from people who are angry because you rejected their advances. So the next thing is to peddle falsehood about you” said Aisha.

Divorced women blame this growing stigmatization and stereotypical behaviour on the region’s patriarchal social structure that places high premium on men’s opinion over women. The structure also places high value on marrying younger women against divorcees.

Aisha explained that several times the cultural structure looks the other way when “fraudulent men” take advantage of vulnerable divorcees on the pretence that they intend to marry them. “If you are a fool and give into such men then yours is finished” she warned. “There are a lot of such men they come to us on the pretence of marriage but actually what they want is to take advantage of women and disappear.”

The Chairperson of Kano-based Voice of Widows Divorcees and Orphans of Nigeria (VOWAN) Hajiya Alitine Abdullahi confirms that men take advantage of divorcees who may have pressing financial needs. “When men divorce women they leave them in poverty to care of themselves and the children. Any woman who finds herself in such a position what do you expect from her? Not every woman has the capacity to resist certain offers.”

Abdullahi who is also a divorcee said: “The same men that accuse women of prostitution are the problem. A woman has been kicked out of her home without financial support she is not skilled yet she is left to care for the children. In most instances her parents are poor or maybe dead and when she approaches a man for help he tells her that he can only assist her if she gives him something in return. Then tomorrow this same man will tell everyone that she is a prostitute.”

In many cases even widows are not left out as Rukkaiya Haruna a soft drink retailer who lost her husband in 2005 explained that she is often smeared as a prostitute whenever she goes out for her businesses. “There are times you hear them saying we go out and then return with money and claim we are in business. If you hear their tone you’d understand what they are insinuating but if you know that your heart is pure then you will learn to ignore such gossips.”

Rukkaiya who also sells wrappers and perfumes has equally not remarried because she said it is very difficult for another man to accept a woman with children. “So it is better to care for my children and ensure they get the right education” she said.

Divorce explosion in northern Nigeria

Last mouth Zainab Sani who lives in Maraban Jos Kaduna North LGA stood before a Sharia Court in Kawo Kaduna State and demanded a dissolution of her 14-year-old marriage to Sani Ibrahim. It was the same court where 21-year-old Hafsat Ismail earlier in the year brought her divorce letter for a court stamp. Like Hafsat Ismail Zainab had asked the court to end her marriage due to years of domestic violence. The distraught wife who offered to return a dowry of N40000 paid for hand in marriage over a decade ago said her husband batters her at the slightest provocation even in front of the kids.

Muslims in northern Nigeria abide by Islamic Sharia law which gives men the right to pronounce divorce merely by speaking or writing the words. The process is more complicated for women who will have to approach a Sharia Court and agree to return the bride price paid in their name.

Official data on divorce rate in Nigeria appear non-existent but a majority of divorce cases in the north are pronounced by men. In a typical Sharia Court in Kaduna an average of between 30 and 50 divorce cases are filed monthly.

Daily Trust on Sunday gathered from records at the Magajin Gari Sharia Court in the state that in the month of October about 30 divorce related cases were filed.

This could be higher in courts around Kano State in Nigeria’s north west which is unofficially designated the nation’s divorce capital with about 1.7 million registered divorcees according to VOWAN Chairperson Hajiya Alitine Abdullahi. In 2005 the state witnessed one of the most audacious women movements when divorcees demanded the enactment of a law that will force men to pay them alimony. By 2009 the women had threatened to storm the streets to protest increasing divorce rates. Though the protest never took place Governor Abdullahi Ganduje not too long ago said his government was working with Islamic scholars to come up with a document to curb divorce rates which will be presented to the State House of Assembly.

Prominent Islamic scholar Sheikh Muhammad Aminu Daurawa supports such a law and explained that a Family Law that could have addressed the menace of overhasty divorce pronouncements was proposed during the reign of the 14th emir of Kano Muhammadu Sanusi II. The proposal however never came to a realisation after it became muddled in a controversy regarding the age of the bride and other issues.

“We were then guided by the Family Law of Morocco they called it Mudawwana which concerns issues related to family including the regulation of marriage divorce polygamy inheritance and child custody” he told Daily Trust on Sunday in an exclusive interview.

“Just as such marriages are issued certificates divorce certificates would also be given and there is need for witnesses in divorce just as in marriages. I can assure you that we need to come up with an Islamic Family Law such as this that can guide family life because if we don’t a western law will be introduced and imposed on us” Daurawa said.

Speaking on the importance of such a law VOWAN Chairperson said: “We are not saying there shouldn’t be divorce Allah has permitted it. What we are against is reckless divorce pronouncements. Divorce should be made more difficult so that if a man knows the law bestowed certain obligations on him to his divorced wife then he will think twice.” She however said in northern Nigeria where men call the shots in almost all aspects of life authorities are sceptical about any change that does not gratify the patriarchal norm.

Though VOWAN could not get a legislation on alimony the movement however gave rise to what has come to be known as the Kano mass wedding which later spread to Kaduna Katsina Gombe and Sokoto states.

Mass weddings and implications on divorce rate

“We cannot say the programme was 100 percent successful but if you do something and about 20 percent fails while 80 percent succeeds then it is good you can say the mass wedding has been successful” Sheikh Muhammad Aminu Daurawa said in reaction to enquiry by Daily Trust on Sunday on whether the mass weddings organised under his watch as then Commander General of the Kano State Hisbah Board has addressed the plight of divorcees.

Sheikh Daurawa who is presently the Chairman of Darul Sunnah Foundation and also Love and Mercy School for Marriage Counselling stated in a report accessed by Daily Trust on Sunday that the mass weddings saw to the union of over 2000 marriages contracted between 2012 and 2017. The mass weddings had spread to Kaduna Gombe Katsina and Sokoto states where a total of 3211 marriages were contracted through the intervention.

Chairperson of VOWAN Altine Abdullahi says the mass wedding had helped divorcees find new homes and financial stability but unequivocally stressed that the mass wedding alone cannot solve the problems associated with high divorce rates in northern Nigeria.

The Kano State Hisbah Board which was at the forefront of organising the weddings explained that the board still monitors the couples and counsel them when there are challenges.

Hisbah was established in 2003 as religious police responsible for the enforcement of sharia through arbitrating and voluntary reconciliation of disputes. Its current Commander General Dr. Haruna Muhammad Ibn Sina said the rise in divorce rates is a contributory factor to other social problems such as delinquent behaviour among children. He said because of the level of successes recorded from the mass wedding the board was planning another one and has received over 300 requests from interested participants.

Marriage counselling to the rescue?

Islamic scholars in parts of northern Nigeria are worried by the growing divorce rates in the region and link it to ignorance of religious doctrine on what marriage should be obligations and spousal rights. The Hisbah Board in Kano has established a school to counsel couples before marriage and says in the near future the board hopes to work with the state government to compel every prospective couple to enrol and be certified by the programme before being allowed to wed.

Sheikh Darawa has also established the Love and Mercy School for Marriage Counselling to guide prospective couples and the married. “Everywhere in the world there are counselling opportunities for couples. Couples need to be educated on what marriage is they need to know why they are getting married and the obligations between one another. And if the marriage comes to an end then they need to know the rights of spouses” he said.

He said the school was established to help reduce the rate of divorce in the society and guide couples on the right path of separation if the marriage comes to an end. To reach out to more couples in distress and also help others find life partners about two months ago the religious scholar also developed an application called “Auratayya” which has already been downloaded over 10000 times on Google Play Store.

Watchout for documentary on this story on Trust TV Channel 164 (Startime)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vYS1jYXNlLWZvci1iaWxhdGVyYWwtZGVzY2VudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A case for bilateral descent?,"A few days ago an exchange online with a cast of some of Northern Nigeria’s cerebral minds left me even more curious about the ancestral scam called ethnic identity. So many civilizations and empires rode on the politics and sentimentality of identity to power and for the unlucky ruins. In Nigeria the formation of the Hausa-Fulani supergroup as an identity is a controversy that makes less sense the more its proponents explain it. But it’s also a possible solution to the crisis of identity for the offspring of two or more clashing cultures.

The Hausa and the Fulani are linguistically unalike and so are their cultural obsessions. The marriage that produced the “Hausa-Fulani” as an ethnic identity was the invasion of Hausa city-states along with others towards the end of the 19th century by the Fulani led by Shehu Usman Dan Fodio. With Hausa which was already a widely spoken language of the Hausa ethnic group adopted for social contract and trade in West Africa becoming the lingua franca of Sokoto Caliphate this history paved the way for the pan-ethnic misrepresentation of the North today.

The arguments for the viability of the Hausa-Fulani identity also applies to the non-Hausa states overrun by the Fulani. The monarchies of the major Nupe Emirates which were vassal Emirates in the Caliphate system were led by the Fulani and their descendants today identify with the host ethnic group and it’s safe to claim that their Fulani identity had been subsumed through intermarriages with the conquered ethnic group. What makes their case different from the Fulani in Hausaland however is the resort to adhere to the conventional ethnic grouping system.

What set the Fulani descendants or children of Hausa and Fulani intermarriages in Nupeland Yorubaland and other parts of modern-day Northern Nigeria apart from those in Hausaland is the latter’s utter subsumption by the Hausa and this linguistic disadvantage seems to have triggered the desperation to identify as bilateral descendants today. We function in a patrilineal society and the identity-forming system and sentiment that produced the Hausa-Fulani supergroup are both deviant and opportunistic but it also calls for the rethink of our ethnic grouping politics.

Even though the father owns the child in our society and his ethnicity inherited by the child from birth at what point does this rule cease to be applicable? For the self-proclaimed Hausa-Fulani their immersion in Hausa culture despite patrilineal link to the Fulani even if of vague or unknown lineage is the justification for bilateral identity. So how’s this different from the reality of children from other interethnic groups? The reason of course is the understated opportunism attracted by the demographically advantaged identity.

The marriage that produced the Hausa-Fulani identity thrived on what Antonio Gramsci described as cultural hegemony—exploitation and deployment of a dominant identity by a self-preserving elite to acquire and retain power in a diverse society. In the waves of polarization that undercut Nigerian power politics the Hausa-Fulani drew from both the products of the intermarriages and the non-aligned Hausa and Fulani ethnicities to present a threatening front at the power-sharing table.

In recent years however this bond has waned as the Fulani keep on getting pathologized by the media and the public attempting to make sense of the existence of criminal herders of Fulani descent. The everyday Fulani have acknowledged the fashion in which they were thrown under the bus by the Hausa or so-called Hausa-Fulani elite without efforts to protect them from misguided reprisals and attacks or clarify that the criminals aren’t representatives of the larger Fulani. Even on social media the thaw of this union is evident in the frequent spats—or the jibes by the Hausa who charge that the Fulani have always rejected cultural or genetic association with them.

No matter the genius or toxicity of our identity politics the Fulani and the Hausa exist as separate and distinct ethnic groups both defined by their cultural idiosyncrasies. It’s unfair to accuse the Fulani of rejecting being lumped in the same ethnic bracket as the Hausa. They are not the same people. Despite the subsuming influence of the Hausa culture and language the Fulani still stand out in their habitats and speak Hausa with imperfect accents like various other ethnic groups in the North and even their language Fulfulde and Hausa belong in different language families.

The mischievous categorization of the Hausa-speaking northerners as Hausa is the genius of cultural hegemony and it’s played out through the pan-Arewa political front by northern elites since the colonial investiture of this regional bloc to neutralize southern rebellion to European presence. Whether in pointing to the subsumed ethnic groups of the region or the self-identified Hausa-Fulani the claim that Hausa isn’t a distinct ethnic group by a subsuming culture and identity of the North will always suffer definitional crises.

If mastery of an alien language or adoption of their culture is what makes an ethnic identity then half of the world and almost all of Nigeria are ethnically English. If adhering to Islamic cosmology is the basis for such identity then that disqualifies even the non-Muslim Hausa from the culture. These dilemmas are mere proof of the fluidity of identity and why it’s easy for the political elite to define and propagandize and identify with an identity that guarantees their stay at the top of the political hierarchy.

But what’s worthy of reflection in this chaos of identity is our cultural assassination of matrilineal lineage even for children raised by single mothers. Unlike race culture isn’t genetic. It’s acquired practised and transferred. So between the children of an Igbo man raised by their Hausa single mother in Funtua and those of a Hausa man raised by their Igbo mother alone in Mbaise which is ethnically Hausa? Your answer to this question may tell where you belong in this fraudulent spectrum of identity formation."

The award includes production for boosters that will support the next six SLS flights for Artemis IV through Artemis VIII crewed missions to the Moon.

NASA's SLS is a launch vehicle designed to pave the way for human exploration beyond Earth's orbit. It's a massive beast that is capable of sending humans cargo and the Orion spacecraft to the Moon on a single trip.The final configuration will stand 322 feet (98 meters) tall. For reference that's bigger than the Statue of Liberty. To get off the ground it'll need some powerful boosters. Each SLS launch will be powered by the twin solid rocket boosters positioned on the side of the rocket's core stage which will generate more than 75 percent of the thrust.The company's design for the key components is built on decades of experience supporting NASA programs. So far it has produced booster motors for the first three Artemis missions and is currently casting motors for the fourth lunar mission. As part of the contract Northrop Grumman will design upgraded boosters needed for flights starting with the ninth SLS mission (Artemix IX) - this will increase their performance and allow them to support a higher payload volume.""Upgrading the booster's performance ensures we can improve SLS's ability to send astronauts and cargo to the Moon as well as making our processes more efficient"" explained Bruce Tiller SLS Booster Manager at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.The SLS rocket is part of NASA's Artemis program  which plans to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar surface by the middle of the decade. The rocket will also be used for establishing infrastructure on and around the Moon and will prepare humanity for its next stop: Mars.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9uYXNhLW1lZ2Fyb2NrZXQtYm9vc3Rlci1vcmRlci10aHJvdWdoLTIwMzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA just ordered megarocket boosters for moon missions through 2031,"NASA just awarded a contract worth $3.19 billion to build rocket boosters for future moon missions meant for Artemis moon missions through 2031.

The new award builds on a previous 2020 contract authorizing Northrop Grumman to prepare for production and building twin boosters for the next six Space Launch System megarocket flights following Artemis 3 which will bring the program through Artemis 9.

SLS — which will make its first uncrewed flight in 2022 — is tasked with sending crews across the solar system starting with missions to lunar orbit the lunar surface or the planned lunar Gateway space station. The first crewed orbital flight is expected in 2024 and the first landing mission in 2025.

NASA's contract statement indicated the award will be beneficial in helping the agency plan and grow the Artemis program to meet future needs.

""The contract allows NASA to work with Northrop Grumman to not only build the boosters for upcoming missions but also to evolve and improve the boosters for future flights"" stated Bruce Tiller SLS booster manager at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama.

The SLS booster technology is based upon the solid rocket boosters used to assist the NASA space shuttle during launches. Solid rocket boosters were used during 135 space shuttle missions between 1981 and 2011. The manufacturer was initially Thiokol later called ATK. Northrop Grumman now has the technology thanks to a series of company mergers in the last decade.

The SLS boosters are designed to be one-time use (not reusable as the shuttle program asked for) and include a fifth segment over the shuttle's four NASA documentation indicates. Northrop Grumman's statement about the new contract indicates more design changes the shuttle program are already underway to start flying during the ninth mission of SLS.

""The new ... boosters will replace the steel cases used for the shuttle with a weight-saving composite case and upgraded structures electronic thrust vector control systems and propellant materials to address obsolescence"" the company stated.

""This improved design"" Northrop continued ""additionally provides process simplification improved interface and streamlined ground processing ... leading to greater productivity and efficiency.""

Orbital ATK a predecessor entity to Northrop Grumman began test firings of the booster system in 2009 following years of development. The SLS booster was originally slated to be the first stage of the Ares rocket under a canceled moon-to-Mars program known as Constellation but the technology was eventually repurposed for SLS.

Northrop Grumman has been the lead manufacturer for SLS booster development since acquiring Orbital ATK under an agreement announced in 2017.

This new announcement arises from a nearly $50 million NASA letter contract in June 2020 to provide funding and authorization for future Northrop Grumman booster orders. It authorizes production and operation for boosters supporting the missions Artemis 4 through 8 along with evaluation of a new booster design to fly on Artemis 9.

As of December 2021 Northrop Grumman says it has finished booster production on Artemis 2 and that all segments for the Artemis 3 boosters have been cast with propellant. Artemis 4 segments started casting in November.

Northrop Grumman is also executing other NASA contracts in support of moon missions. This includes building the abort motor and attitude control motor for the Orion spacecraft's launch abort system and building a habitat and logistics outpost module for Gateway.

Northrop Grumman the lead booster contractor has produced booster motors for the first three Artemis missions and is casting the motors for the fourth lunar mission.

This contract with a value of $3.19 billion definitizes a letter contract awarded in June 2020 that authorized Northrop Grumman to order long-lead items and build twin boosters for the next six SLS flights. The period of performance extends through December 31 2031. This includes production and operations for boosters for Artemis IV-VIII and design development test and evaluation of a booster as part of Booster Obsolescence and Life Extension (BOLE) for Artemis IX.

“This contract award ensures NASA will have the most powerful solid rocket boosters ever built for future Space Launch System rockets for the Artemis missions to the Moon” said Bruce Tiller SLS Booster Manager at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama. “The contract allows NASA to work with Northrop Grumman to not only build the boosters for upcoming missions but also to evolve and improve the boosters for future flights.”

The twin solid rocket boosters which are mounted on the side of the SLS core stage will produce more than 75% of the thrust for each SLS launch. The boosters were based on the design of the space shuttle solid rocket boosters but include a fifth segment to produce the extra power needed to send the larger SLS rocket to space. As part of this contract the team also will design and test evolved boosters needed for flights starting with the ninth SLS mission. The new BOLE boosters will replace the steel cases currently used from the space shuttle with a stronger composite case and upgraded structures electronic thrust vector control systems and propellant materials.

“Our boosters are ready to launch the first flight of the Space Launch System on the Artemis I mission and we are making great progress producing boosters for the Artemis II III and IV missions” said Tiller. “Upgrading the booster’s performance ensures we can improve SLS’s ability to send astronauts and cargo to the Moon as well as making our processes more efficient.”

The SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft are part of NASA’s backbone for deep space exploration. Through Artemis missions NASA will land the first woman and the first person of color on the surface of the Moon and establish a long-term lunar presence that serves as a stepping stone on the way to Mars.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vc2F0ZWxsaXRlcHJvbWUuY29tL25ld3MvbmFzYS1hd2FyZHMtNDE1bS10by10aHJlZS11cy1jb21wYW5pZXMtdG8tYnVpbGQtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1zcGFjZS1zdGF0aW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA awards $415m to three US companies to build commercial space stations,"These awards are part of NASA’s plans to transition from the ageing International Space Station to commercial space stations which will be available to both government and private-sector customers.

NASA has awarded a combined total of about $415.6m to Blue Origin Nanoracks and Northrop Grumman to develop commercial space stations in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO).

Blue Origin has been awarded $130m Nanoracks $160m and Northrop Grumman $125.6m through NASA’s commercial LEO development programme.

NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said: “Building on our successful initiatives to partner with private industry to deliver cargo and now our NASA astronauts to the International Space Station NASA is once again leading the way to commercialise space activities. With commercial companies now providing transportation to low-Earth orbit in place we are partnering with US companies to develop space destinations where people can visit live and work enabling NASA to continue forging a path in space for the benefit of humanity while fostering commercial activity in space.”

The awards are the first in a two-phase approach to ensure a seamless transition of activity from the International Space Station to commercial destinations. During this first phase private industry in coordination with NASA will formulate and design commercial low-Earth orbit destination capabilities suitable for potential government and private sector needs. The first phase is expected to continue through 2025.

Blue Origin and Sierra Space have partnered to develop Orbital Reef a commercially owned and operated space station to be built in low-Earth orbit which will start operating in the second half of this decade. Orbital Reef teammates include Boeing Redwire Space Genesis Engineering and Arizona State University. Orbital Reef’s human-centred space architecture is designed to be a “mixed-use space business park” that provides the essential infrastructure needed to support all types of human spaceflight activity in low-Earth orbit and can be scaled to serve new markets.

Nanoracks’ commercial low-Earth orbit destination in collaboration with Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin is called Starlab. Starlab is targeted for launch in 2027 on a single flight as a continuously crewed commercial space station dedicated to conducting advanced research fostering commercial industrial activity and ensuring continued US presence and leadership in low-Earth orbit. Starlab is designed for four astronauts and will have power volume and a payload capability equivalent to the International Space Station.

Starlab will host the George Washington Carver Science Park featuring four main operational departments – a biology lab plant habitation lab physical science and materials research lab and an open workbench area – to meet the needs of researchers and commercial customers for commercial space activities.

The design leverages flight-proven elements such as the Cygnus spacecraft that provides cargo delivery to the International Space Station to provide a base module for extended capabilities including science tourism industrial experimentation and the building of infrastructure beyond the initial design.

For the second phase of NASA’s approach to a transition toward commercial low-Earth orbit destinations the agency intends to certify for NASA crew member to use commercial low-Earth orbit destinations from these and potential other entrants and ultimately purchase services from destination providers for the crew to use when available. This strategy will provide services the government needs at a lower cost enabling NASA to focus on its Artemis missions to the Moon and on to Mars while continuing to use low-Earth orbit as a training and proving ground.

Developing commercial destinations in low-Earth orbit is part of NASA’s broader efforts to build a robust low-Earth orbit economy including supporting commercial activity and enabling the first private astronaut mission to the space station. In addition to these new awards NASA selected Axiom Space in January 2020 to design and develop commercial modules to attach to the station. NASA and Axiom recently completed the preliminary design review of two modules as well as the critical design review of the module’s primary structure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvY2hlYXAtY2Vzc25hLXBsYW5lLXRlcnJvcml6ZWQtaXNpcy1hYm92ZS0xOTc1MDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Cheap Cessna Plane Terrorized ISIS from Above,"Here's What You Need to Remember: In fact the Cessna 172’s younger sister the Hellfire missile packing Cessna AC-208 has been terrorizing the skies over the Middle East for years thanks to a conversion handled by Orbital ATK a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman.

The U.S. military leads the world in stealth aviation technology but not every fight requires a fast-moving radar defeating fighter; sometimes all it takes to win a fight is a good old-fashioned Cessna strapped to the nines with Hellfire missiles.

Cessna may be the most well-known name in civilian aviation with the Cessna 172 widely recognized as the most successful aircraft in history. There have been more Cessna 172s built than literally any other airplane on earth and chances are if you ever take classes to earn your pilot’s license a fair portion of the hours you log will be in a 172. The aircraft’s sturdy high-wing design and reliable powertrain coupled with its low cost and availability make it a favorite for flight schools who value its ability to fly multiple times per day with inexperienced pilots.

In fact the Cessna 172 is so user-friendly that an inexperienced German teenager managed to fly his Cessna straight through the most elaborate air defenses in the world at the time to park his 172 right in Moscow’s Red Square. The ordeal led to the firing of numerous senior Soviet defense officials and may have helped usher in the end of the Cold War. Not bad for an aircraft I’ve heard described as a “lawnmower with wings” by fighter pilots.

But Rust’s wasn’t the only Cessna to get involved in the squabbling of nations. The same things that make Cessnas such good choices for beginner pilots (low cost ease of use low stall speed resilient design) also make the aircraft an excellent choice for reconnaissance surveillance and even some combat air support in environments without formidable air defenses. In fact the Cessna 172’s younger sister the Hellfire missile packing Cessna AC-208 has been terrorizing the skies over the Middle East for years thanks to a conversion handled by Orbital ATK a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman.

The AC-208 can pack Hellfire missiles and 70mm rockets

Converting the Cessna C-208 into the AC-208 Combat Caravan also known as the Eliminator required more than simply mounting some rails underwing. In order to leverage the incredible accuracy offered by the AGM-114 Hellfire missile ATK equipped the Cessna with a combat sensor suite and laser-designator that can be used to pinpoint targets on the fly.

Hellfire missiles are incredibly accurate–so accurate that a secretive version of the weapon has been built that forgoes explosives in favor of retractable swords for targetting bad guys using civilians to shield them from more conventional airstrikes. In the hands of a capable operator with a laser designator Hellfire missiles can be fired from Cessna’s AC-208 at targets that are literally miles away. The AC-208 can also carry “fire-and-forget” AGM-114K Hellfires which are guided by their own internal radar and don’t require continued control after firing.

While Hellfire missiles represent the most potent ordnance this Cessna brings to the fight the AC-208 has other options available to it. Its modular and reconfigurable weapons system allows for the mounting of two Hellfire missiles beneath each wing for a total of four weapons but each wing can also carry a rocket pod that can be used to deploy a variety of guided 70mm rockets including the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) or Guided Advanced Tactical Rockets (GATR).

It takes more than strapping on Hellfire missiles to make a Cessna a warbird

Ballistic panels were also added to the AC-208’s cockpit to protect the pilot and sensor operators from small arms fire while conducting low passes over an active combat zone. A variety of screens mounted in the cockpit offer all sorts of information from common in-flight control data to feeds sourced from the aircraft’s high-definition electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors. As many as six different sensors can be mounted on the MX-15D turret the AC-208 uses to find its prey. Each aircraft carries a crew of three: a pilot a co-pilot and a mission system operator to oversee the sensor and weapon systems.

While modern and advanced air defense systems can engage aircraft at nearly any altitude most dated and shoulder-launched platforms in use in places like Iraq and Afghanistan are limited to targetting aircraft at 10000 feet or lower. The Hellfire-packing Cessna AC-208 can fly at more than twice that altitude but just in case it also comes equipped with a missile warning system and BAE Systems AAR-47/ALE-47 Defensive Countermeasures System meant to throw off an inbound infrared or radar-guided missile with flares or chaff.

Speed isn’t a high priority for the AC-208–in fact it’s the aircraft’s ability to maintain very low speeds while surveying its environment that makes it so handy over war zones in Iraq Afghanistan and other nations across Africa and South America. Its 876 horsepower Pratt & Whitney PT6A-140 turboprop can push this Hellfire packing Cessna along at a respectable 213 miles per hour for distances in excess of 1200 miles. When serving as a stable reconnaissance platform the AC-208 can fly as slowly as just 70 miles per hour without risk of stalling the engine.

Its rugged tricycle-style landing gear is perfectly suited for operating from austere airstrips or even just a nice flat stretch of field.

The idea behind the AC-208 Eliminator is believed to have come from the U.S. military who were looking to find an inexpensive way to equip the Iraqi government with much-needed air support assets. They contacted Orbital ATK in 2008 to discuss converting the civilian Cessna C-208 into a militarized airplane that could carry ordnance like Hellfire missiles as well as conduct reconnaissance and gather intelligence for the increasingly independent Iraqi Air Force. ATK moved swiftly fielding a prototype for live-fire testing in just 11 months.

The first AC-208 debuted in 2009 with the more modern Eliminator that entered service in 2017 commonly referred to as the “Block II” iteration. It’s already seen service in the aforementioned Middle Eastern nations as well as Argentina Honduras Kenya Lebanon Mauritania Niger and Yemen. Reports clearly indicate that deals to purchase these aircraft are brokered by the United States and Air Force personnel have been used to train pilots to operate AC-208s in their respective nations but for the most part acquisition and training related to the AC-208 Eliminator tends to fly under the radar.

According to the U.S. Air Force all they’ll officially acknowledge is that the branch itself does not own any AC-208 Combat Caravans. News reports about these unusual Cessnas prowling the skies over nations like Iraq lofting Hellfire missiles at bad guys don’t crop up very often–but that doesn’t mean the AC-208 doesn’t get into its fair share of scraps.

The AC-208 got its first taste of combat in 2014 when the Iraqi military used the Cessna to launch Hellfire missiles at ISIS targets throughout Fallujah and Ramadi and they haven’t let up since. In 2018 an Iraqi AC-208 was even shot down by ISIS fighters using anti-aircraft artillery fire.

The cruise ship Norwegian Breakaway owned by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd departed New Orleans on a weeklong cruise on Nov. 28 and had stops in Belize Honduras and Mexico the health agency said.

“NCL has been adhering to appropriate quarantine and isolation protocols” the department said in a tweet.

The ship is set to reach New Orleans on Sunday morning according to its itinerary.

Everyone on board will be tested for COVID-19 before leaving and will be provided with post-exposure and quarantine public health guidance by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

People who test positive for COVID-19 will either travel to their homes or self-isolate according to CDC guidelines the health agency said.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not disclose such details regarding the name of the cruise line or cruise ship. This case reveals how CDC keeps public in dark regarding such basic information.

The Norwegian Breakaway owned by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd departed New Orleans last week (on November 28th) on a week-long cruise calling on ports in Belize Honduras and Mexico.

Reuters reports that all passengers will be tested for COVID-19 before disembarking the cruise ship and will be provided with “post-exposure and quarantine public health guidance” by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). People who test positive for COVID-19 are supposed to either travel directly to their homes or self-isolate according to the CDC guidelines.

The Hill later reported that according to WVUE NCL “provided them with take-home rapid tests upon leaving the ship.” If this is accurate it is doubtful that all passengers will follow through with such testing on their own initiative.

This outbreak involves vaccinated passengers and crew members as NCL requires all passengers and crew members on its cruise ships to be vaccinated. NCL states that the passengers are asymptomatic at this time.

NCL misleadingly stated that there were only a “handful of COVID-19 cases among guests and crew.”

According to a news outlet some disembarking passengers told WVUE-TV in New Orleans that they were notified about the positive cases on the cruise ship while others said they had no idea about the outbreak until being asked about it by a reporter.

“We didn’t hear of this until we kind of heard you talking a second ago” said Don Canole a passenger from North Carolina. “It would have been nice to have known. We would have taken maybe a few more precautions.”

NCL is maintaing its current sailing schedule for the Norwegian Breakaway which leaves on another week-long cruise later this afternoon.

This particular incidnt is receiving a great deal of coverage in the U.S. press despite the fact that the number of positive COVID-19 cases (10) is substantially less than other cruise ship outbreaks. It appears that the press coverage is the result of the transparancy of the Louisiana Department of Health which has regularly tweeted about information about the outbreak. Unlike the CDC the Louisiana Department of Health publicly identifies cruise ships with COVID-19 cases.

NCL does not require the wearing of masks on its cruise ships even in indoor spaces.

A Slew of Large COVID-19 Outbreaks

The CDC which extended its conditional sailing order at the end of October until next year identified one-thousand three hundred and fifty-seven COVID-19 cases on cruise ships between June 26 – October 21 2021. You can read the order (total at page 20) here.

The CDC highlighted what it described as “several large outbreaks” on cruise ships. The CDC did not identify any of the cruise ships inolved in the outbreaks.

21 infected – on July 24 2021 one symptomatic passenger who tested positive for COVID-19 on a cruise ship (Cruise Ship A) was epidemiologically linked to 20 additional COVID-19 cases over two voyages including 2 passengers and 18 crew.

– on July 24 2021 one symptomatic passenger who tested positive for COVID-19 on a cruise ship (Cruise Ship A) was epidemiologically linked to 20 additional COVID-19 cases over two voyages including 2 passengers and 18 crew. 58 infected – between July 24 – August 28 a cruise ship (Cruise Ship B) reported 58 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among passengers and crew.

– between July 24 – August 28 a cruise ship (Cruise Ship B) reported 58 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among passengers and crew. 13 infected – between July 29 – 31 2021 three symptomatic passengers tested positive for COVID-19 on a cruise ship (Cruise Ship C). Contact tracing and testing identified an additional 12 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 including 10 passengers and 2 crew.

– between July 29 – 31 2021 three symptomatic passengers tested positive for COVID-19 on a cruise ship (Cruise Ship C). Contact tracing and testing identified an additional 12 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 including 10 passengers and 2 crew. 105 infected – between August 19 – September 7 a cruise ship (Cruise Ship E) reported 105 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among passengers and crew on a total of four consecutive voyages.

– between August 19 – September 7 a cruise ship (Cruise Ship E) reported 105 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among passengers and crew on a total of four consecutive voyages. 112 infected – between August 21 – September 7 a cruise ship (Cruise Ship F) reported a total of 112 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among passengers and crew on four consecutive voyages.

It does not appear that COVID-19 cases where guests disembarked the cruise ship and then tested positive were included in these totals even where the guest was exposed to COVID-19 during the cruise and likely contracted the disease there.

Most Positive Virus Cases Involve “Breakthrough Infections” of Vaccinated Passengers and Crew

The COVID-19 vaccination rates on all of these unnamed ships were at or very near to 100% for crew and between 96.4% and 100% for passengers. Some of the cases apparently involved unvaccinated children but the majority involve fully vaccinated adults.

According to @CDCgov's extension of conditional sailing order #cruise ships subject to CDC jurisdiction experienced total of 1357 confirmed +#COVID19 cases involving pax & crew including 3 ships with total of 275 positive virus cases over multiple cruises https://t.co/aw9HbsWpQ0 pic.twitter.com/HZIxgvpPly — James (Jim) Walker (@CruiseLaw) October 27 2021

USA TODAY reported that when cruise ships began sailing again with passengers from June 26th to August 26th there were 452 confirmed cases of coronavirus on the cruise ships.

Regarding the Norwegian Breakaway expect the number of COVID-19 cases to rise as all of the passengers (and crew members) undergo testing.

The CDC has warned against traveling on cruise ships during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic saying the “chance of getting COVID-19 on cruise ships is high because the virus spreads easily between people in close quarters aboard ships.”

NCL’s stock (NCLH) has steadily declined from over $32 to $18 over the last six month as the pandemic continues. The stock dropped from a high of over $60 to below $8 after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic last year. The stock dropped ten points from $28 to $18 in the last month as cruise lines and the travel industry struggle with the emergence of the Omicron variant which is now in the U.S.

December 5 2021 Sunday Evening (9:00 P.M.) Update: Additional testing revealed another seven COVID-19 cases on the Norwegian Breakaway bringing the total to seventeen cases according to WDSU. “State health officials also said Sunday that one of the 10 cases previously reported involves the emerging Omicron variant. That case involves a crew member who is not a Louisiana resident.” It is unclear what interaction this infected crew member had with guests on the ship. Was he a waiter or cabin attendant? NCL isn’t saying.

The cruise ship remains in New Orleans as of 9:00 P.M. this evening according to MarineTrafiic AIS.

This includes 1 probable case of #Omicron which has been identified among the crew. This case is among the 10 cases that had been previously reported. The crew member is not a Louisiana resident and did not leave the ship. — Louisiana Department of Health (@LADeptHealth) December 6 2021

December 5 2021 Update: NCL told told local TV outlet CBS 4WWL that the crew member is from South Africa and allegely was under quarantine during the cruise in question.

December 7 2010 Update: The AP states that the infection involved “nine crew members and eight passengers.”

Pent-up demand already has led to a huge surge in bookings in 2022 and 2023 from cruisers who have had their trips canceled or delayed because of the pandemic as well as new bookings from people who foresee cruising coming back safer than ever.

A couple of examples of this: Oceania's world cruise for 2023 sold out within one day of opening for sale to the public January 27 2021. And river cruise operator Uniworld has seen a 425 percent year-on-year increase in late 2021 and 2022 bookings to exotic destinations like India Vietnam and Egypt.

Still the future of the cruise industry has changed noticeably because of the pandemic. Here is a look at that future -- and what changes we can expect to see over the coming years.

Travel Restrictions Lifted -- But Vaccine Passports Required

In 2022 ...

Given that we're seeing a generally positive rollout of vaccinations across the globe and scientists are optimistic about reaching herd immunity in 2021 we expect some momentum when it comes to cruising going into 2022. On the back of that positivity we're making some bold predictions for next year.

Transport Canada will lift its ban on cruise ships calling in at its ports en route to Alaska and the state will enjoy its busiest cruise year since 2019.

U.S. citizens will be able to return to Europe again and we predict a boom especially for river cruises.

Australia will (finally) have lifted its travel restrictions and 2022/23 season will be a boom one for cruising. Many lines are already planning for this with Celebrity Cruises announcing Celebrity Eclipse will return on a series of five to 18-night departures from Sydney and Auckland from September next year.

Aussies and New Zealanders will be allowed to leave their countries at long last so we expect a large number in Europe in summer 2022 especially on the rivers.

We do predict however that vaccine passports or at least something showing proof of vaccination will become part of a requirement to travel the same way certain inoculations such as yellow fever are for entering certain countries.

Tech at the Forefront

The pandemic turbo-charged the use of technology onboard.

What once might have seemed vaguely gimmicky -- using your phone as a keycard or to turn off your lights in your cabin -- has become the norm. Tech will be front and center of the cruise ship experience.

Almost everything you do before you get onboard -- online check in boarding pass on your phone and the like -- will be touchless.

Once you are on the ship your phone RFID wrist band or Ocean Medallion or similar device will act as your keycard and to pay for drinks and services.

You will be encouraged to use the ship's mobile app to navigate the ship track your kids monitor your onboard spending and to book meals spa treatments shore excursions and shows.

In-cabin voice-activated artificial intelligence (in the case of MSC Cruises' newest ships) will answer questions that you once would have had to pick up the phone or walk to the reception desk to ask.

The in-person muster drill will be a thing of the past. Royal Caribbean has already developed the e-muster process and other lines will follow suit to avoid crowds and congregating. Instead it will take place in your cabin with a check-in at your own time.

An interesting additional feature of RFID wristbands is that they can be adapted for use as a track and trace device -- something that Royal Caribbean is already doing in Singapore.

The use of QR codes to bring up menus (which also reduces waste) will likely be here to stay; and say goodbye to the paper daily planner left on your bed the night -- this will be accessed on your phone.

The Buffet

Much has been written about ""the end of the buffet"" onboard following an announcement by Royal Caribbean with many readers saying they would not cruise if it meant the end of the buffet. Here's one example from the Cruise Critic message boards:

""As for no buffets … No Buffet = No cruising for us. There is absolutely no reason to remove buffets from cruises.""

As clarified by later statements the buffet is not being removed; it will still be onboard just in a different form.

It will be a compromise: Passengers will go to the serving stations and be served by crew rather than self-served. This was already in practice pre-COVID on Holland America Line for the first few days of cruises. Luxury lines also already had offered a version of this. Passengers still will have a more casual option but it will remove the need for guests to touch utensils others have been handling.

Cruise lines are also likely to make more wrapped ""grab-and-go"" items available at the buffet and cafes.

Private Islands Come into Their Own

All the major cruise line groups own private Caribbean islands. MSC uses one in the Middle East too -- Sir Bani Yas.

A day at a private island whether it be Disney's Castaway Cay or Royal Caribbean's Perfect Day at CocoCay has always been popular for those seeking beach fun. As cruising restarts in earnest private islands will become less of a fun distraction and more of a necessity allowing cruise lines to maintain the same health protocols on land as they do at sea -- and for passengers to wander at will rather than having to take a ship excursion.

It's likely that at least in 2022 most Caribbean itineraries will include a stop and/or an overnight at a private island and in the case of Virgin Voyages at its private beach club.

Destination-Specific COVID-19 Requirements

Destinations will continue to be vigilant about controlling COVID-19 for the next few years. Negative COVID-19 tests or proof of vaccination will be required for entry into many countries as the world works to eradicate the virus.

Cruise lines and cruise travel agents will have to help passengers navigate through this tricky area and all the logistics that will come with traveling in the post-pandemic era. In the same way lines organize visas for passengers to enter certain countries they will have to help passengers with getting COVID tests before returning to their own countries (if a negative test is required).

Expect to see long-term changes to the embarkation process. In addition to proof of vaccination or negative COVID test results changes first rolled out by lines that have restarted already around the world (Costa MSC and Royal Caribbean for example) will become part of the cruise experience. Expect to see fixed (and enforced) boarding times to avoid huge crowds; fully automated and almost touchless check-in and a more robust health screening such as temperature checks at boarding and possibly even PCR testing.

Small and Expedition Ships Become More Popular

Already in 2021 small and luxury ship lines are garnering bookings from people who are new to their brands -- and that trend will likely continue for several years as people eschew crowds for a more intimate atmosphere.

This will also benefit and coincide with the explosion of expedition cruise ships that have been scheduled to arrive in 2022 and beyond. The ships are not only smaller by definition but they also appeal to people seeking out the bucket list cruises that have been put on hold for two years.

Expedition ships also focus on outdoor exploration in more remote places which has become a priority during the pandemic.

Whole-ship charter cruises will enjoy a boost as groups seek to stay safe with people they know.

Shorter Cruises Take Off

The industry requirement that North American cruises stick to weeklong or shorter cruises is set to expire November 1 2021. But as the industry restarts it's looking clearer that shorter cruises will become more of the itinerary mix.

Carnival is of course a pioneer of shorter itineraries and is upping the number on offer this year from the West Coast.

After taking over three- and four-day itineraries from Long Beach in 2021 Carnival Miracle is going to continue its series of four- and five-day cruises to Mexico during the winter season beginning November 2021 and continuing through April 2023.

Virgin Voyages which is still set to debut this year is following Carnival's lead and offering four- and five-day cruises which include a stop at its private beach club

And Royal Caribbean despite divesting itself of two of the ships (Empress of the Seas and Majesty of the Seas) that offered short cruises has a whole roster of two- three- and four-night breaks in November onward most of which include a stop at its private island of Perfect Day at CocoCay.

World Cruises and Far-Flung Destinations Grow

It might sound like a contradiction but at the other end of the scale we see world cruises and cruises to far flung destinations whether by ocean or river becoming more popular.

This has been borne out by booking trends but the other factor in play is those people who had their once-in-a-lifetime cruise canceled in 2020 and aren't hopeful for it happening in 2021 will have waited three or four years to take that bucket list cruise. There's also a sense with the pandemic that life is short and what is the point of putting off that special experience any longer -- if not now then when?

Add to that a trend we have seen bubbling away for a while -- experiential cruises -- and we predict a boom in multi-generational cruises with grandparents taking one or two generations with them for shared experiences.

Long-Term Future of the Cruise Industry

The pandemic might be seen as a collective wake up call for everyone. Companies worldwide will be rethinking their business models and challenging traditional assumptions. Expect the cruise industry to do the same.

During the height of the pandemic we saw more cooperation across cruise brands than perhaps ever before with companies focused on the greater good of the industry rather than for their own corporations. Expect this trend to continue long-term especially as it pertains to health and safety of guests.

""There is no competition when it comes to health and safety said Royal Caribbean Group CEO Richard Fain said who joined with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings President and CEO Frank del Rio in forming the joint Healthy Sail Panel.

Similarly the drum beat of overtourism which reached a height in 2019 will be considered more thoughtfully in 2022 and beyond with lines working closely with one another and destinations so as not to overwhelm an island or a town with multiple arrivals all on the same day.

Cruise lines will be leaner (witness how many ships have been scrapped in the past 12 months) with the larger lines maintaining far fewer smaller and older ships in their fleets.

Finally it's unlikely COVID-19 like the flu or norovirus will be eliminated completely either on ships or around the world.

What's important is how the lines prepare for and react to onboard cases in the future.

Some long-term changes will mitigate this: Ships will set aside more of their cabins as isolation spaces; the enhanced medical facilities introduced onboard will stay and improved ventilation and deep cleaning with hospital-grade technology will become the norm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXRyYWRlLWNydWlzZS5jb20vcG9ydHMtZGVzdGluYXRpb25zL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1mb3VyLXNoaXAtMjAyMy1hbGFza2Etc2Vhc29uLWluY2x1ZGVzLXdhcmQtY292ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean four-ship 2023 Alaska season includes Ward Cove,"Now open to book the weeklong cruises will sail from Seattle Seward and Vancouver BC between May and September.

Then in October 2023 Ovation will sail a nine-night cruise from the Pacific Northwest to Hawaii that offers three island visits and an overnight in Maui.

And pre-Alaska sailing from Honolulu to Vancouver in 11 nights a Radiance cruise will begin with an overnight in Oahu before continuing to Maui and both the leeward and windward coasts of the Big Island then crossing the Pacific to Canada.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zYW50YS1icmluZy1hbW1vLWdvcC1jb25ncmVzc21hbi0yMTIxNDE4MzMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Santa bring ammo': GOP congressman and family pose with guns for Christmas photo days after school shooting,"Republican congressman Thomas Massie has sparked outrage for posting a Christmas photo of his family posing with a trove of firearms just days after four students were murdered in America’s deadliest school shooting since 2018.

The Kentucky congressman shared the family portrait on Twitter on Saturday along with the caption: “Merry Christmas! ps. Santa please bring ammo.”

Mr Massie is seen posing with his wife and members of their family in front of a Christmas tree in a holiday card-style image.

All seven people in the photograph are holding weapons as they beam at the camera.

The Republican faced an instant backlash for his social media post coming just four days after suspected teenage gunman Ethan Crumbley opened fire at his high school in Michigan.

The 15-year-old sophomore is accused of killing four students – Tate Myre 16; Hana St. Juliana 14; Madisyn Baldwin 17; and Justin Shilling 17 – and wounding seven others in Tuesday’s deadly attack. He was charged as an adult on 24 counts including four charges of first-degree murder and one count of terrorism.

The teenager’s parents James and Jennifer Crumbley are said to have bought him the firearm as an early Christmas present on Black Friday.

The Crumbleys were arraigned on charges of involuntary manslaughter on Saturday morning.

Less than four hours later Mr Massie posted his family photo on Twitter and was instantly condemned by both gun control activists and gun owners alike.

Manuel Oliver whose son Joaquin Oliver was among the 17 victims murdered in the 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland told CNN the post should send a message about who the country should and should not elect.

“That is a huge part of the problem… This is also something that should teach us who we should elect and not” pic.twitter.com/g9MJj62PYa — Acyn (@Acyn) December 4 2021

“That is a huge part of the problem. We have some elected leaders like this one” he said.

“I don’t know if he’s trying to be ironic funny or what… This is also something that should teach us who we should elect and not.”

Mr Oliver is demanding a meeting with President Joe Biden following the latest school shooting as calls mount for greater gun control in the wake of a string of mass shootings over the last year.

Fred Guttenberg whose daughter Jaime was also killed in the Parkland school shooting also hit out at Mr Massie and shared photos of his late daughter and her gravestone on Twitter.

“@RepThomasMassie since we are sharing family photos here are mine” he tweeted.

.@RepThomasMassie since we are sharing family photos here are mine. One is the last photo that I ever took of Jaime the other is where she is buried because of the Parkland school shooting.



The Michigan school shooter and his family used to take photos like yours as well. https://t.co/2vz6sJLwXE pic.twitter.com/nGUK2FJRYB — Fred Guttenberg (@fred_guttenberg) December 4 2021

“One is the last photo that I ever took of Jaime the other is where she is buried because of the Parkland school shooting.

“The Michigan school shooter and his family used to take photos like yours as well.”

Another person called Beks simply posted a photo of the four victims of Tuesday’s attack writing: “Their parents would disagree.”

Several gun owners also slammed Mr Massie for what they described as “gun fetishism”.

“I am a gun owner but I do not understand gun fetishism @RepThomasMassie. It seems especially ethically demented this week” tweeted one social media user named Steve Metz.

Last week Mr Massie celebrated the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse during his homicide trial for shooting dead two men and wounding a third in a night of unrest in Kenosha last summer.

He was also one of just 21 House Republicans who voted against giving the Congressional Gold Medal to Capitol police officers who defended the building from attack from Donald Trump supporters in the January 6 insurrection.

The congressman said in the aftermath of the riot that he was “glad to be armed while barricaded for hours in our offices with our staff”.

The entry-level card is believed to feature 8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM and a GA106 GPU the same graphics chip found in the RTX 3060.

4 Reviews

A new release date has been posed for the RTX 3050 NVIDIA's next entry-level desktop graphics card. Previously it was believed that NVIDIA would wait until Q2 2022 to unveil the RTX 3050 tipped to launch alongside the RTX 3050 Ti. However a new rumour alleges that the RTX 3050 could appear in Q1 2022 instead.

Supposedly NVIDIA is working towards launching the RTX 3050 on January 27 possibly around the time that AMD reveals the RX 6500 XT. @hongxing2020 refers to the RTX 3050 being 'on-shelf' by that date for reference which should be the card's official launch date.

Hence NVIDIA could announce the RTX 3050 before its January 27 release date similar to the RTX 2060 (12 GB). It is unclear how the RTX 3050 and RTX 2060 (12 GB) will compare against each other though. Theoretically the RTX 3050 should outperform the RTX 2060 (12 GB) in most tasks thanks to its newer Ampere architecture.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNoc3BvdC5jb20vY29tbXVuaXR5L3RvcGljcy9kaWFibG8taWktcmVzdXJyZWN0ZWQtZ2V0cy1zdXBwb3J0LWZvci1udmlkaWEtZGxzcy1idXQtdGhlcmUtYXJlLXNvbWUta2lua3MtdG8taXJvbi1vdXQuMjcyNTQyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Diablo II: Resurrected gets support for Nvidia DLSS but there are some kinks to iron out,"In brief: A remastered version of Blizzard’s classic action role-playing game Diablo II landed this past September for PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Xbox One Xbox Series Windows PC and Nintendo Switch. Since then the dev team has been continuing to optimize the game servers and listening to player feedback. Now some of those new features are ready to make their debut.

The most notable is support for Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) tech on PC’s with compatible Nvidia graphics cards which arrived in the new 2.3 patch. DLSS is an AI rendering technique that uses Nvidia’s Tensor Core AI processors to produce higher quality visuals without a major performance penalty.

As PC Gamer notes the early implementation isn’t working flawlessly for all users. The publication pointed to a Reddit thread where some users were experiencing blurriness when enabling DLSS. This according to one user could be related to the fact that Blizzard appears to be using dll 2.2.11 instead of the latest iteration version 2.3.4. Details on how to update to the latest version are provided over on Reddit.

That said Diablo II: Resurrected’s system requirements aren’t very steep to begin with. The recommended configuration over on Battle.net calls for an Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+ 6GB of RAM 25GB of available storage space and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 260 or ATI Radeon HD 4870 or better.

The new patch also delivers a handful of visual tweaks to the front-end user interface as well as audio improvements when navigating menus and refilling potions.

Diablo II Resurrected retails for $39.99.

This is especially true if you're currently using an underpowered or aging PSU; not having enough power will usually lead to overall system instability and game crashes. NVIDIA recommends at least a 650W power supply unit (PSU) which is where we will focus in this roundup.

Corsair RM650x View at Amazon Best Price And Performance

This 650W PSU's heat and efficiency are rated 80 Plus Gold near the upper end for this type of hardware. The fan won't be heard unless the system is being taxed thanks to a smart control that keeps RPMs low while idling. It's fully modular meaning you can connect only what you need to connect for easy cable management. A 10-year warranty is included.

EVGA SuperNOVA P2 750 $208 at Amazon Tons Of Power

If you're worried about your system not having enough power at 650W you can always upgrade to the EVGA SuperNOVA P2 with 750W of power. This should set you up better for future upgrades and doesn't cost a whole lot more than lower-power PSUs. It has an 80 Plus Platinum efficiency certification and a 10-year warranty plus it's fully modular for easy connections without clutter.

Cooler Master MasterWatt 650 Check Amazon $84 at Amazon Budget Option

Cooler Master makes some quality PSUs and its MasterWatt 650W option comes at a great price. It has an 80 Plus Bronze efficiency rating and a five-year warranty which aren't as impressive as the top picks but it'll still get the job done. The 120mm fan runs quietly when not under load and it's partially modular to help with cable management.

Seasonic PRIME TX-650

High-End Pick

Have a big budget for your next PC build? The Seasonic PRIME TX-650 has an 80 Plus Titanium efficiency rating and a 12-year warranty putting it near the top of energy management and durability. It's fully modular and there's a dedicated fan control button on the PSU to switch between modes. It's quiet it's efficient and it has the 650W to power the RTX 3070.

Thermaltake TOUGHPOWER Grand 650 $120 at Amazon Built-In RGB Lighting

For those who think PC hardware isn't complete without RGB there is the Thermaltake TOUGHPOWER Grand 650. It has five different RGB modes controlled by a dedicated button on the PSU's back plus it's modular for easy cable management. The 80 Plus Gold efficiency certification ensures it doesn't waste a lot of energy and a 10-year warranty helps protect your purchase.

Best PSU for NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU

Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

NVIDIA recommends a 650W PSU for the RTX 3070 but if you're currently working with say a 600W PSU you might get along just fine depending on other hardware in your system. You can always give it a shot before picking up a new PSU. On the other hand upgrading to something new — especially if your PSU is beginning to show its age — is never a bad idea. An old PSU can cause issues no matter its wattage.

If you are ready to upgrade our best PSU for RTX 3070 pick is the Corsair RM650x. It sits somewhere between the high-end and budget options in terms of price and it has the 650W recommended to power the RTX 3070. The 140mm fan's blades are curved to reduce noise and the fan turns off entirely at low power usage. It's also 80 Plus Gold certified for power efficiency reducing heat and overall draw. It comes with a set of fully modular cables so that you only use what you need (keeping your PC case uncluttered) and a 10-year warranty gives you some peace of mind.

If you think you'd like to upgrade to something that might just better stand up to future upgrades the EVGA SuperNOVA P2 with 750W of power is no doubt appealing. It has an 80 Plus Platinum efficiency certification for excellent heat and power management it comes with a 10-year warranty and it's fully modular for easy cable management.

This has left anyone who wanted a new graphics card incredibly frustrated especially if their aging hardware is struggling to run modern games and unable to make use of hyped-up new graphical effects such as realistic ray tracing lighting.

But what can PC gamers do? Nvidia the huge graphics-card company offers a solution: its GeForce Now streaming service has added a new subscription tier: RTX 3080.

For $99.99 / £89.89 for six months RTX 3080 subscribers can use Nvidia’s remote server PCs to stream games to a variety of devices. Nvidia promises this is an experience similar to playing on a gaming PC with a high-end RTX 3080 GPU.

For gamers who have been trying – and failing – to get hold of an RTX 3080 (or any new GPU) this sounds almost too good to be true. So now that we have access to Nvidia GeForce Now RTX 3080 let’s see if it can live up to the promises.

Building on a good foundation

GeForce Now has been around for a while and I’ve generally had a pretty good experience with the service using the Founders Edition subscription. (This used to be the highest subscription level for $4.99 a month.) Like the current Priority membership it gave users priority access to the servers gameplay sessions of up to six hours and more powerful hardware than the free version of the service which isn't capable of ray tracing graphics.

While games didn’t look as good as games played on my local gaming rig due to the lower resolutions the games I played were impressively responsive. This included playing Fortnite on a MacBook and Planet Coaster on a Chromebook – games that wouldn’t usually be playable on those devices.

The biggest ‘wow’ moment however came when my TV was commandeered for some sort of sporting event that involved kicking balls. I was able to load up Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla on my smartphone with the GeForce Now app and play through a couple of missions using the excellent Razer Kishi smartphone controller.

Playing a game of that scope and ambition on a smartphone was both impressive and exciting. Nvidia’s expertise with servers and streaming clearly paid off. GeForce Now was already an impressive alternative to Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming and Google’s Stadia services so I was excited to see how this new improved GeForce Now tier would work.

Playing on PC

First I played on a PC using the GeForce Now app. Using this subscribers to the RTX 3080 tier can play up to 1440p at 120 fps (frames per second) compared to 1080p at 60 fps of the Priority subscription tier.

This offers a decent bump in visual quality though anyone hoping to play in 4K may be disappointed.

Firing up Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla the gameplay felt pretty good with no noticeable lag. This was on a desktop PC with a wired internet connection and Valhalla isn’t the fastest-feeling game. In settings I changed the graphical options from Medium which is the default to Ultra. On restarting the visual improvement was noticeable and it seemed there was no detriment to performance. Whatever hardware Nvidia is using for the RTX 3080 servers it can easily handle modern games at their highest settings.

I also tried out Far Cry 6 a game that puts more emphasis on fast-flowing action and combat. Here it was more noticeable that I wasn't playing locally but I adjusted after a short while. If you start up a game you’ve never played before it’s unlikely you’ll notice.

Again I had to up the visual quality in the settings. Once done the game looked good although it wasn’t as sharp as when playing natively and there were some visual artifacts in volumetric effects such as smoke.

It was even more impressive when I moved from the desktop to a laptop. I fired up Far Cry 6 again on the HP EliteBook Dragonfly G2 a good light notebook but in no way a gaming laptop. Far Cry 6 looked and ran very well on it. On the smaller screen the slight imperfections with streaming were much less visible. Best of all by moving to a laptop using Wi-Fi rather than Ethernet there was no degradation in performance though admittedly I was sitting near the router.

With the increase in graphical fidelity and resolution Nvidia now recommends a 70Mbps internet connection for playing at 1440p at 120fps something my network just reaches.

Nvidia has also been working hard to make sure latency is as low as possible with the RTX 3080 GeForce Now tier. This is what makes games feel more responsive when played. By lowering the latency the pause between pressing a key or moving a joystick and the movement happening onscreen is reduced. Nvidia also includes Adaptive Sync technology to help make gameplay smooth.

This results in the best cloud gaming experience I’ve had with minimal lag helping games feel more responsive and enjoyable.

Back on the laptop I fired up Cyberpunk 2077 one of the games Nvidia is highlighting for its support of ray tracing. This was perhaps the most impressive showing yet for what GeForce Now is capable of. On a thin and light laptop with integrated graphics I was able to play the graphically impressive Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing effects turned on. That's something this laptop would never be able to do usually. It would normally require a larger bulkier and more expensive gaming laptop with an RTX 3070 or higher.

Being able to play this game on a regular laptop was brilliant. Even when connected wirelessly gameplay remained lag-free enough that I didn’t really notice that I was streaming the game rather than playing it locally.

This is where GeForce Now really shines – being able to turn non-gaming devices into powerful RTX 3080-powered machines.

Ray tracing on a smartphone

Next I tried GeForce Now on my smartphone a Samsung Galaxy S21+. While GeForce Now does support touchscreen controls it’s not ideal for many games which have been designed with a gamepad or mouse and keyboard in mind. I used the Razer Kishi controller instead.

This is essentially a compact controller with Xbox buttons. It snaps in half and each side connects to the top and bottom of your smartphone so when it’s held horizontally you get a Nintendo Switch-like handheld. Crucially the Razer Kishi uses the USB-C port of your phone rather than a wireless Bluetooth connection and this helps reduce any possible latency there.

I launched Far Cry 6 and again set graphics to maximum as well as boosting the resolution to 1080p. This resulted in very good image quality. And even though I was still playing wirelessly (and further away from the router this time) gameplay was generally smooth as well with just a few rare instances of slight pauses. This was down to the stream and Wi-Fi connection rather than anything hardware-related.

Next I tried Cyberpunk 2077 and again whacked graphical settings to full and the resolution to 1080p. Combined with ray tracing the effect was fantastic. A smartphone even a premium one like the Galaxy S21+ simply shouldn’t be able to play games that look this good but GeForce Now makes that possible. The visual fidelity blew away anything on the Nintendo Switch as well and the smaller screen of the phone meant the softness of the streaming image and occasional artifacts were much less noticeable. It’s seriously impressive stuff.

The slower gameplay of Cyberpunk 2077 also meant that latency and buffering weren’t much of an issue either.

Indie games such as Cuphead also ran really well. As long as you have a good data connection and a decent controller GeForce Now is an excellent way to play PC games on your smartphone.

However if you’re only going to be playing GeForce Now on a smartphone you're better off going for the Priority tier or even the Free tier as the small screen size of the phone means you won’t get the most out of the upgraded visuals.

Trying it out on a Shield TV

Finally I tried GeForce Now RTX 3080 on the Shield TV Nvidia’s slim set-top box that’s plugged into my 65-inch 4K TV. I love the Shield TV using it for watching movies via apps such as Netflix and Disney+ and playing the odd game.

By connecting to a TV and coming with a gamepad the Shield TV is the closest thing to a games console Nvidia has made. With the GeForce Now RTX 3080 subscription tier you can stream games to the Shield TV in 4K with HDR. This is exclusive to the Shield TV and I don’t expect it to come to other Android TV boxes (the Shield TV is powered by Google’s OS).

It’s well worth investing in a Shield TV if you are tempted by GeForce Now. Not only is it a great little streaming box in its own right but GeForce Now RTX 3080 works very well on it. Thanks to the 4K resolution even on the big screen the games looked excellent. Cyberpunk 2077 was sharp and clear while Watch Dogs: Legion (another showcase for ray tracing) and Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla also looked incredibly good. While not quite up to the standard of playing the game natively on a powerful gaming PC it came impressively close. Best of all you can buy a Shield TV for around $149 / £129 / AU$249. That’s much cheaper than any games console.

However streaming games at 4K does put a lot of pressure on your broadband connection and Nvidia recommends 80Mbps. I’d suggest at least 100Mbps for the best results as the bandwidth pressures can make games feel sluggish if your internet isn’t up to the task.

Games really did look fantastic however and this bodes very well for the future of the service.

Final thoughts

The potential of the new GeForce Now RTX 3080 subscription tier is incredibly exciting. From my time with the service I was very impressed with how it performed. Games looked particularly good at 4K on the Shield TV.

Throughout the tests I was able to whack the games up to their highest settings and the hardware behind the GeForce Now RTX 3080 service coped admirably. Despite its name you’re not actually getting an RTX 3080 PC instead Nvidia uses a server (known as a GeForce NOW SuperPOD) with an A10G graphics card which is a data center GPU rather than a gaming one.

Nvidia claims this offers a similar level of performance as an RTX 3080 and from what I’ve tried I’d broadly agree. The A10G graphics card actually offers 24GB of VRAM the same amount as the RTX 3090 and over twice the amount of the RTX 3080 which comes with 10GB. However as it’s not a gaming GPU there are some compromises (such as memory bandwidth) which means performance is more in line with the RTX 3080 than the RTX 3090.

Still that’s no bad thing and for the most part the biggest bottleneck for people will be their internet connection. If you have fast broadband and a strong connection either via 5GHz Wi-Fi or ideally Ethernet you’ll get very good performance with the lowest latency I’ve experienced with cloud gaming. In my opinion GeForce Now is definitely the best game-streaming service you can use right now.

Is it a good alternative to having a physical RTX 3080 GPU? No… and then yes. When I say ‘no’ it’s because no matter how good GeForce Now is it still can’t compete with playing a game locally on an RTX 3080-powered PC. When playing on physical hardware you’ll have hardly any latency or lag and graphical fidelity is much stronger.

However not everyone can afford (or find) an RTX 3080 GPU in which case the GeForce Now RTX 3080 subscription tier is a pretty good compromise. It’ll allow you to play your games on more powerful hardware than you may currently have. And as a monthly subscription it could be a good way to bide your time until RTX 3080 stock frees up – then you can cancel it when you get hold of a graphics card.

One of the best things about GeForce Now is that you don't need to rebuy your games – instead you can access games that are already in your various libraries including Steam Ubisoft Connect Epic Games Store and more. And with cloud saves supported by most of those services you can continue from where you left off.

This means that GeForce Now especially the RTX 3080 tier is a brilliant service for people looking to play modern games on a variety of devices. In fact GeForce Now continues to be most impressive when it’s used on devices that usually wouldn't be able to play games like laptops and smartphones. It doesn’t quite offer an experience to rival the best gaming PCs but it comes tantalizingly close.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL252aWRpYS1ydHgtMjA2MC0xMmdiLXVwZ3JhZGUtY2FyZHMtbm90LWdldHRpbmctZm91bmRlcnMtZWRpdGlvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's RTX 2060 12GB graphics cards will not receive Founders Editions,"Thanks to the current market desperation we were talking about Nvidia’s 12GB upgrades of cards like the RTX 2060 since long before they were officially announced. It feels like an odd choice for the company to still be releasing Turing architecture cards but with everyone scrambling to get whatever they can in the shortage these were looking like a ray of light.

The Nvidia RTX 2060 12GB upgrade was set to be a great budget gaming card that you might actually be able to find on shelves. The boost in VRAM from 6GB to 12GB would make the RTX 2060 in a position to actually compete against the AMD Radeon RX 6600 and 6700 cards and hopefully avoid too much interest from miners jacking up the price. It was going to be a great choice on a budget but that’s looking less likely.

Despite getting a good look at the specs for Nvidia’s RTX 2060 12GB Founders Edition card just a few days ago it turns out it probably doesn’t exist. According to TechPowerUp (via Videocardz) Nvidia has since removed the listing from the specs page. A statement said it was placed there in error and only custom designs by partners are going to be available.

This means we aren’t going to see a nice budget Founders Edition of this card to help set the pace for pricing. Board partners will set their own prices and given they already have higher margins they're going to be more expensive. This will only be more so depending on the configurations and other choices included in the boards.

We haven’t seen any partner designs of the 2060 12GB boards yet so hopefully one kind partner will still give us a sweet budget deal. Though without it coming straight from Nvidia we aren’t expecting quite the tasty low price offerings we were hoping for."

RTÉ documentary ‘The Case I Can’t Forget’ details O’Reilly and Callaly’s marriage the morning of O’Reilly bludgeoning his wife to death and staging it to look like a break-in and the aftermath which saw O’Reilly be sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife.

Today's top videos STORY CONTINUES BELOW

O’Reilly went on The Late Late Show to discuss ‘theories’ on who could have possibly murdered his wife.. He showed Callaly’s parents and journalists the murder scene in some sort of ‘murder mystery tour’. He thought he had gotten away with murder.

But what happened on that fateful October morning? How did O’Reilly go about his day before brutally murdering his wife?

October 4 2004

5am

Joe O’Reilly had left his house early on Monday morning. Last night he had an argument with his wife Rachel Callaly where he threatened to leave her. He had started an affair with Nikki Pelley and wanted custody of his children.

While he had grown to despise his wife O’Reilly didn’t want to go through a costly divorce or worse still become a weekend father to his two sons aged four and two at the time. So he plotted something far worse.

5.45am

O’Reilly left his and Rachel’s Baldarragh Co Dublin home to go to the Jackie Skelley gym in Park West on the outskirts of Dublin. He is due to meet his coworker Derek Quearney at the gym but goes to the petrol station to fill up his car a navy Fiat Marea.

He receives a call from Pelley while he’s at the petrol station. They talk for 28 minutes the first of eight calls between the pair that day. The transmissions made to his phone off phone towers which was relatively new at the time would prove O’Reilly’s downfall.

7.45am

O’Reilly arrives at his workplace Viacom Outdoor Advertising in the Bluebell Industrial Estate after showering at the gym. He sends an email to Ciaran Gallagher saying that he may be out of phone coverage for most of the morning. He arranges a lunch meeting with Gallagher for 2pm.

O’Reilly leaves his office at 8.07am according to CCTV. He claimed he was going to the CIE depot in Broadstone but instead went to his and Rachel’s bungalow. CCTV footage shows his car passing Murphy’s quarry near their home.

9am

Rachel Callaly drops her eldest son Luke to school before dropping her younger son Adam to creche. Gardai cameras showed her car passing the same quarry near her and O’Reilly’s home at 9.41am.

Approx. 9.45am

Rachel returns home where O’Reilly is waiting for her in the bedroom. He proceeds to bludgeon her to death with a blunt instrument — either a dumbbell or a wooden post — as she walks through the door.

O’Reilly makes the scene look like a burglary ransacking drawers and ‘stealing’ a camera from his home. However he forgets to steal items such as money — a mistake which makes Gardai and Rachel’s parents believe that the ‘burglary’ was staged.

O’Reilly tells Gardai that he was at the CIE depot in the Broadstone/Phibsboro area from 9am. However his alibi Derek Quearney couldn’t verify O’Reilly’s story. O’Reilly’s car was seen passing the same quarry near his home at 9.59am in the direction of the city.

10.07am-1.45pm

O’Reilly sent a text to his wife whom he had just murdered saying “You and the boys sleep ok? Wish Jacqui a happy birthday for me please. Xxx”.

He claimed that he was in Phibsboro when the text was sent but phone tower reports show that the text was sent from the vicinity of his home where the brutal murder was carried out. No calls were made from Joe’s phone in that area until 10.38am.

He left several voicemails to Rachel’s phone between 11.52am and 1.45pm. Tots United where his son Adam was called O’Reilly to tell him that Adam hadn’t been picked up. On the way to pick Adam up he called Rachel’s mother to go into the house and check on her daughter who lay dead upstairs.

He delayed himself at the creche to make sure that Callaly’s mother got to the house and make the gruesome discovery. To further ease suspicion he was set to go into the house with Adam before they were stopped by a neighbour.

It was there that Joe was told the news of what he did several hours ago. He even ran past his mother-in-law calling for his dead wife shouting ‘Jesus Rachel what did you do?’.

Aftermath

Joe O’Reilly stayed with his mother in Dunleer Co Louth on the evening of the murder. He then admitted to Gardai that he was having the extra-marital affair with Nikki Pelley something he had denied to his murdered wife on three separate occasions.

The clothes O’Reilly was wearing on October 4 2004 were washed by his mother before Gardai could cease them for evidence.

O’Reilly went to bed that evening believing he had just committed the perfect crime. His alibi was foolproof the burglary he had staged was brilliant and the clothes he used to bludgeon his wife to death were being washed of any DNA.

Little did he know that CCTV footage and the new ability of mobile towers being able to ping your location were going to betray him in a way that would see him be sentenced to life in prison for the brutal murder of Rachel Callaly.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ali Mrabet said the 23-year-old man tested positive and all fellow travellers on his flight from Turkey were contacted by Tunisian authorities to be tested as well.

The Omicron variant was first announced by South Africa but has since been discovered to have been present earlier in Europe. It has prompted governments around the globe to reimpose travel restrictions despite warnings from the World Health Organization this could do more harm than good.

On Friday the WHO said it had not seen any reports of deaths related to the new Omicron variant. The WHO has said it will take several weeks to get a full picture of the transmissibility and severity of Omicron and to assess how vaccines tests and treatments hold up against the new variant.

FAIRFAX Va. – The Old Dominion men's basketball team desperately needed a victory and earned one Saturday night with an inspired and physical in-your face defensive effort typical of a Jeff Jones-coached team.



The Monarchs held George Mason without a field goal for a nine-minute stretch of the second half held the Patriots 25 points under their average and claimed a 60-50 victory at EagleBank Arena.



Still recovering from pneumonia Jones was on the bench and was back to as close to normal as he's been since early November screaming and exhorting his team as usual.



The Monarchs (4-5) had lost four of their last five games and defeated Longwood for their lone victory on a Mekhi Long layup at the buzzer. George Mason (4-5) had lost four in a row all on the road but had a marquee 71-66 victory at Maryland on November 17.



C.J. Keyser the transfer from North Carolina Central led ODU with 19 points and made a key basket late in the second half that ended a Monarch scoring drought.



""You've got to give coach Jones super credit"" Keyser said. "" He's dealing with pneumonia but he's here he doesn't quit on us.



""He's a tough dude.""



Point guard Jaylin Hunter added 16 points in spite of playing the final minutes with four fouls and Kalu Ezikpe had 10 points eight rebounds and a key blocked shot that helped the Monarchs salt the victory away.



Long had 11 points and nine rebounds and played stellar defense against George Mason's D'Shawn Schwartz who made just 3 of 10 shots and scored eight.



""He's a really good player and had to work for all eight points"" Jones said. ""Mekhi did a fantastic job.""



Schwartz gave the Patriots their last lead of the game 29-27 47 seconds into the second half.



The Patriots did not score another field goal until the 10:14 mark when Josh Oduro made a short jumper. By then ODU held a 9-point lead it would not relinquish.



Keyser's 3-pointer with 8:59 gave ODU a 13-point lead 48-35. Keyser made a short jump shot with 8:10 left that again built the lead to 13.



But then the Monarchs went stone cold missing their next seven shots and George Mason's Devon Cooper cut the lead to five 50-45.



Keyser then broke the cold spell making a jumper just outside the free throw line to give ODU a 52-45 lead with 1:37 left.



Ezikpe then blocked an attempted layup by Oduro and followed with two free throws with 66 seconds left to build the lead to 54-45.



Hunter iced the game with two free throws with 56 seconds left.



As the game ended and the Monarchs exited the court several hundred ODU fans in the crowd of 3529 were heard chanting ""ODU.""



""You can have the perfect game plan but if they're not out their busting their rear ends it's not going to work"" Jones said.



""Our guys worked. We really got after it.""



Keyser said the victory will give the team a lift heading into its final four non-conference games.



""It was our first road win and came against a great Atlantic 10 team"" he said. ""We needed this win to build some momentum.""



The Monarchs next play Tuesday night at William & Mary. ODU then hosts archrival VCU on Saturday Dec. 11. It is a white out game and fans are asked to wear white.



Jones said the victory gave the Monarchs an emotional boost.



""It's one thing to say 'just hang in there we'll be fine'"" Jones said. ""It's another thing to win. Winning lifts a cloud.



""I think this should make us more excited about practice tomorrow.""



ODU faces a quick turnaround before Tuesday's game in Williamsburg with only two days of practice to prepare for the Tribe.

The Monarchs (6-2) shot 42.9 percent from the field forced 29 turnovers and received a season-high 24 points from Ajah Wayne . ""It was a good win but we still have things to improve upon"" head coach DeLisha Milton-Jones said. ""When we see that the momentum is shifting and is going towards the other team we have to learn how to be better. When we can control the tempo of the game regardless of what the other team is doing then we are on our way to being a great team."" ODU looked poised to run away with the game at halftime leading 42-29 at the break. The Monarchs made 55.9 percent of their shot attempts during the opening 20 minutes including an 11-of-18 (.611) mark in the second quarter and committed only six turnovers.

After a back-and-forth start to the game the Monarchs closed out the first quarter on a 12-2 run turning an 8-6 deficit into an 18-12 advantage after 10 minutes. Old Dominion scored six unanswered during that span highlighted by back-to-back field goals from Kaye Clark.



Clark finished the game with eight points four assists and four steals – matching her season high in takeaways.



The Tribe cut the deficit to four points midway through the second quarter but Old Dominion finished out the half by outscoring the hosts 19-10 over the final 4:51. After having their lead dwindle to four points the Monarchs immediately responded with another 6-0 run to restore their double-digit advantage. Up eight points Wayne corralled an offensive rebound and laid it back in to make it a 35-25 game with 1:29 left in the half and the ODU lead never dipped below 10 points again.



Wayne notched 14 of her 24 points in the first half going 6-of-10 from the floor and making her lone 3-point attempt. That trey came in the closing seconds of the half to send the Monarchs into the intermission with a 42-29 advantage.



A senior from Birmingham Alabama. Wayne notched the 12th 20-point game of her career on Sunday. She shot 7-of-13 from the field and went to the foul line 12 times making nine. In addition Wayne grabbed six rebounds had two assists and three steals. Her 24 points are the most scored by an ODU player this season.



ODU utilized a 14-2 run in the third quarter to build a 23-point lead its largest of the game at 58-35 with 1:31 to go in the period. Iggy Allen started the run with back-to-back baskets including a trey at the 6:40 mark before punctuating it with a takeaway and a transition layup 5:10 later.



Allen was responsible for nine of ODU's 16 points in the third quarter and finished the day with 16 on 7-of-14 shooting (2-of-3 from 3-point range) a game-high eight rebounds and three steals.



William & Mary scored the last six points of the third and then the first seven of the fourth quarter for a 13-0 run spanning nearly six total minutes of action. A pair of free throws from Ruthie Montella made it a 10-point game 58-48 with 7:20 to play but the Monarchs soon sprung back into full control of the game. After those foul shots the Tribe did not score again for 5:39 as ODU put the game away with an 8-0 run. Wayne finished the run with a transition layup with a 1:52 to go.



The Tribe committed 29 turnovers on Sunday the second-most by an ODU opponent this season. ODU was credited with 20 steals its most since a 19-steal game against Alabama A&M on Dec. 21 2012. All five Monarch starters had at least three steals including a career-high matching five from Amari Young.



""I want us to hang our hats on what we do on the defensive end"" Milton-Jones said. ""That's where we can directly control the game and disrupt the game in a major way to turn defense into offense.""



The Monarchs scored 22 points off W&M's 29 turnovers and outscored the Tribe 21-8 in fastbreak points.



""Defense is fun"" Wayne said. ""It opens up our offense. We generate our offense from our defense.""

EMU has been close to reaching both milestones recently when they finished with seven wins in 2016 and 2018 having a chance for eight wins but seasons but ultimately suffering close losses in the 2016 Bahamas Bowl (24-20 to Old Dominion) and the 2018 Camellia Bowl (23-21 to Georgia Southern).

The Eagles’ last bowl win was in the 1987 California Bowl a 30-27 victory over San Jose State.

Eastern Michigan heads into this one with some high-quality wins on its resume versus MAC contenders in 2021 including 52-49 versus Toledo 22-21 versus Western Michigan and 13-12 versus Miami OH.

Fans may know the game by the names it has had over the years including the Dollar General Bowl GoDaddy Bowl GMAC Bowl and Mobile Alabama Bowl. But whatever the name the games featured some exciting performances like in 2001 when then MAC squad Marshall Thundering Herd erased a 30-point halftime deficit to beat the East Carolina Pirates in double overtime 64-61.

For the first time in its 23-year history the game will be played at different site than Ladd-Peebles Stadium moving to the recently-minted Hancock Whitney Stadium which opened in 2020 and is home to South Alabama football.

Abbott,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared Sunday that his state ""will be the home of semiconductor manufacturing going forward"" as the chip shortage has been affecting companies around the globe.

""The country made a mistake over the past one or two decades to farm out manufacturing of all these essential supplies whether it be now semiconductors or could be health care supplies that we needed during the time of COVID whatever the case may be we need to not depend upon China or other countries for our essential needs for things like semiconductors"" the Republican governor argued during an exclusive interview on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

""That is exactly why Texas actually is leading the way becoming the home for semiconductors that go into everything that people use"" he added.

""It’s not just your iPhone or your laptop or whatever the case may be"" he went on to say. ""It’s also in all of these vehicles where you have manufacturing going on.""

As Abbott had stated on Sunday the semiconductor chip shortage was sparked by some regulations implemented – and decisions made – during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The shortage affected the auto sector heavily throughout the year. General Motors announced that it had to reduce some truck production in North America due to the global chip shortage. Ford has also pulled back production at several factories.

FORD GLOBAL FOUNDRIES TEAM UP ON CHIP SHORTAGE: ‘JUST THE BEGINNING’

Abbott and Samsung Electronics Co. announced late last month that the South Korean tech behemoth will build a $17 billion semiconductor factory in Taylor Texas.

The governor touted the move during a news conference as ""the largest foreign direct investment in the state of Texas ever.""

Samsung Electronics Device Solutions Division Vice Chairman and CEO Dr. Kinam Kim said Samsung expects to create more than 2000 high-tech jobs directly with the plant in Taylor and thousands more related to the plant once it is fully operational.

The chip-making factory coming to Taylor will also be the largest investment made by Samsung in the U.S. the company said in a news release bringing the firm's ""total investment in the U.S. to more than $47 billion since beginning operations in the country in 1978.""

Tesla also revealed last week it is now a Texas company according to paperwork filed with the SEC on Wednesday.

The automaker announced that its corporate headquarters is now located at its Gigafactory in Austin.

Elon Musk announced plans to relocate Tesla's headquarters from California during October's shareholder meeting following a year of friction with the state's government over COVID rules and a tweet from California state Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez that said ""F--k Elon Musk""

Musk also said the company was reaching the limits of expansion at its original Fremont California factory and that the expansive Texas facility offered more opportunity for growth.

Abbott told host Maria Bartiromo that in the first 11 months of 2021 ""there have been 70 businesses and corporations that have relocated their headquarters to the state of Texas.""

""If you look on average that means there’s a new headquarters in Texas every five days"" he continued noting that Tesla was one of those companies.

Abbott also pointed to Samsung’s investment in Taylor.

""That is in addition to the announcement the week before where Texas Instruments announced a $30 billion investment for semiconductors"" the governor added.

""Those semiconductors will help in the supply chain process.""

Abbott said the economy in Texas is ""growing and thriving"" stressing that businesses are moving to the state ""because Texas is the land of economic opportunity and innovation.""

Part of the reason ""so many businesses"" are moving to Texas he said is there are ""no mandates infringing upon individual liberty.""

""Texas has been very aggressive about legally challenging all of these mandates that the Biden administration has put in place concerning COVID"" he told Bartiromo.

""And whether it be vaccine mandates or mask mandates — whatever the case may be — we’ve been winning them all in the courts.""

Currently quantum computing is one of the most promising future technologies that could deliver super-fast processing power for new and emerging industries that are constantly in need of a computational performance boost.

Quantum computing uses the quantum states of particles (such as spin or charge) to represent quantum bits called qubits. This technology comes in a couple of different forms each with individual benefits and drawbacks.

Companies such as Google and Intel have already started developing their versions of quantum computers that showcase the technology but aren't nearly as powerful as engineers would like them to have any practical and real-world uses.

The main problem towards achieving this goal caused by various factors is the inability to control a large number of qubits efficiently. Generally for quantum bits to be coherent and controllable noise and interference from other sources must be at an absolute minimum.

Creating minimum noise and interference requires excessive signal shielding and near absolute zero cooling. In turn it requires a large and expensive infrastructure that can handle only a handful of qubits which is inefficient for scaling and mass-producing the technology at that stage.

Recently a team of physicists from the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen has developed a potential way to overcome one of these challenges by using semiconductor materials as a platform for a so-called solid-state quantum computer.

University of Copenhagen's Quantum Chip

Research by Ph.D. student Federico Fedele Professor Anasua Chatterjee and Professor Ferdinand Kuemmeth's group fabricated a quantum chip based on quantum dot semiconductor qubits that utilize the dot spin property as logic states for their system.

Unlike other types of qubits dot spin qubits have relatively longer coherence times which means that they can maintain their state for a longer time allowing for faster performance and a smaller chance of error during computations and readouts.

The chip features four qubits in a two-by-two array of quantum dots made out of a gallium arsenide semiconductor structure.

Between these qubits is a larger central quantum dot that connects all four qubits allowing for parallel control of every single one of them simultaneously.

This attribute is what makes this research groundbreaking. While other quantum technologies require each qubit to be individually ""driven"" to control and read its state they can be operated as one structure by not having to wire every qubit to the system individually.

This structural change creates a significant advantage in qubit coherence and eliminates a portion of that large wiring infrastructure that other quantum computers exhibit.

Semiconductor Spin Qubit Challenges

Although this research does resolve one of the biggest underlying issues of current leading quantum computer designs it still leaves the door open for improvements in scalability both for manufacturing and processing power.

Since this is still a semiconductor technology the hope is that engineers could adapt current semiconductor techniques to use gallium arsenide for qubit chip manufacturing leading to a mass fabrication method for a future quantum processor.

The second biggest challenge developing a quantum chip with a more extensive array of simultaneously operated qubits is a whole research problem of its own.

On the surface level some of the issues that semiconductor spin qubits face are fairly similar to those other quantum computing technologies such as ion trap quantum computers or superconductor quantum computers.

Nevertheless a semiconductor platform is still a very interesting approach since as with our current traditional semiconductor computers which operate using billions of transistors on a single chip quantum semiconductor chips might also feature a similar qubit density and allow engineers to potentially integrate billions of qubits onto a single chip as well.

Semiconductor Qubits = Future of Quantum Computing?

Currently many scientists and engineers are researching this topic. Still due to the price of entry and the relatively new technology quantum computing is far from an industry tool let alone a household item.

Useful and manufacturable quantum devices might vary between these technologies and probably won't become a reality until a true quantum computing standard exists.

Semiconductor spin quantum computers are just one of many technologies that while solving some problems in our current understanding of the technology might show other problems down the road or not be compatible with solutions for some other quantum computing challenges.

Still this is a valuable step forward into qubit control that will hopefully inform other engineers into their future research as the current goal of the technology should not be the immediate scaling of manufacturing to deliver a product. Hopefully opening the gate to more researchers to collectively better understand the scope of quantum's complexity and bring even more solutions to the table to truly develop quantum technologies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDIyMjg2MDIxMDExNDQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Synthesis characterization and evaluation of optical band gap of new semiconductor polymers with N-aryl- 25 ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022286021011443 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDIyMjg2MDIxMDExNDQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZ2ZtYWcuY29tL2V4ZWN1dGl2ZS1pbnRlcnZpZXdzL3RvbXRvbS12cC1mZXJndXMta2luZy1pbnRlcnZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adapting In Record Time: Q&A With TomTom Vice President Fergus King,"Fergus King is vice president of global supply chain for consumer products at TomTom a mapping and geolocation-technology specialist. He offers an insider’s view of the semiconductor shortage explaining why small brands get short shrift and reshoring doesn’t work.





Global Finance: How has the supply chain crisis impacted your company?

Fergus King: While in recent years TomTom has pivoted to software maps and location technology it continues to manufacture and sell personal navigation devices—although in much smaller volumes than in the past. These devices are manufactured in China by a Taiwanese company.

The shortages in consumer electronics are a result of Covid-19 kicking in factories shutting down and then reopening with significantly increased demand. That sequence highlighted capacity limitation in semiconductor manufacturing. In October for example we are likely to receive just 30% of the components we need to meet our inventory requirements.

GF: What measures has the company taken to address these challenges?

King: One strategy we have adopted to maintain activity is to buy common components on the gray market. But for unique components such as semiconductors there is no alternative. Semiconductor manufacture is the critical bottleneck: There are only a few companies in the market and you just wait for your turn. That turn may not necessarily be determined by when you place your order. Any manufacturer wants to serve its biggest and most profitable customers first although longevity of relationship is also important. Everyone is paying more; but even if you offered double or treble the price you wouldn’t necessarily get further up the queue.

GF: What other factors determine when or whether semiconductor orders are met?

King: The technology being deployed matters in semiconductors. Manufacturers obviously want to squeeze as much profit as possible out of production. It might be possible to get 200 chips out of a single wafer with a 5-year-old design. But it might be possible to get 400 chips of a brand-new design out of that same wafer. The manufacturing time is the same in both cases; but the new chip sells for a higher price and they can make more of them. Customers needing older chip designs are inevitably less of a priority. Smaller brands tend to suffer most.

GF: How have pricing and lead times changed?

King: Some semiconductors have doubled in price but overall costs are up by 15%-20% over the past year. Semiconductor manufacturers are trying to limit price increases; but wafer prices are going up and they cannot absorb it all. To date we’ve not passed on these price rises to customers; but our margins have been squeezed dramatically and we will not be able to maintain this forever.





In the past the longest lead time we had was 12-16 weeks for central processing units and glass; now it is up to 52 weeks. One manufacturer of chips is unable to tell us when we can have our order. As a result our engineers are likely to have to redesign circuitry so we can substitute an alternative chip.

GF: Have current logistics problems affected TomTom?

King: As we manufacture in China we face reduced freight capacity and increased costs. As our products are high value we airfreight most of them. Airfreight used to have a three- or four-day lead time. Because of Covid we now assume 10 days for airfreight and sometimes can’t get on a flight. So far our road distribution in Europe has not experienced any major disruption although prices are going up as fuel costs increase.

GF: Has TomTom considered reshoring?

King: Five years ago we felt too reliant on China and investigated moving production to elsewhere in Asia or to Eastern Europe. Our analysis showed that labor costs were broadly similar in Eastern Europe for example; and there were savings on logistics. But crucially most of the electronic components would still have come from Asia; and therefore overall a shift was not viable. In the longer term the US and the EU should be trying to build semiconductor fabrication plants so that they’re not reliant on Asia. The US now recognizes this; the EU also needs to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vYXV0by5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvYXV0by1jb21wb25lbnRzL2t0YWthLWdvdnQtdG8tYWxsb3QtMjAwLWFjcmVzLWZvci1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXNlY3Rvci84ODA5MDI1MdIBggFodHRwczovL2F1dG8uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9hdXRvLWNvbXBvbmVudHMva3Rha2EtZ292dC10by1hbGxvdC0yMDAtYWNyZXMtZm9yLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2VjdG9yLzg4MDkwMjUx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,K'taka govt to allot 200 acres for semiconductor sector,"Advt

The October deal established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 per cent aimed at curtailing profit-shifting to lower-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland where many large international firms have their European headquarters.

It will eliminate incentives to shift jobs and profits abroad US President Joe Biden in early October.

But some companies could still use Ireland to reduce their tax bills even after the agreement takes effect according to tax specialists and a Reuters review of corporate filings.

Thats because the new agreement wont stop companies benefiting from a strategy widely implemented in recent years that reduces taxes over a period of up to a decade or more.

Irelands relatively generous tax allowances permit multinationals with a presence in the country to sell intellectual property such as patents and brands from one subsidiary to another to generate deductions that can be used to shield future profits from tax.

Companies that have generated deductions to reduce their taxable income by more than $10 billion each in recent years via this tax-minimizing strategy include US technology companies Adobe Inc and Oracle Corp corporate filings show.

Business-software provider Oracle declined to comment and Adobe creator of software such as Acrobat pdf-maker didn't respond to requests for comment. Both companies have said they conform to relevant tax laws.

The agreement brokered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is due to take effect in 2023.

It was signed by more than 130 jurisdictions including Ireland.

The Irish finance ministry said Irelands tax treatment of intellectual property transactions is in line with other OECD countries.

In response to Reuters questions the OECD acknowledged that companies could continue to benefit from profit-shifting strategies already in place but that it expects companies to be unable to build up such tax shields in the future.

The approach typically relies on a company also having a subsidiary in a country with a corporate income-tax rate of zero such as Bermuda that enables the company to conduct the sale tax free.

By phasing out zero-tax jurisdictions for multinationals the OECD expects the global minimum tax of 15 per cent will make the strategy no longer attractive. Were trying to design rules for the future said John Peterson an OECD official.

Peterson added that the OECD cant be certain how each countrys rules would interact with the global minimum tax. But he said the OECD is confident that abuses will be limited by a requirement that countries calculate taxable income in accordance with accounting rules.

Tax specialists say the deals impact remains unclear because key details are yet to be agreed including how to calculate the pot of profit that is to be taxed.

Countries are currently debating carve-outs for certain tax breaks.

In addition jurisdictions could retain wide latitude in how they allow companies to calculate taxable income the specialists said.

Where there isnt accounting consistency there is scope for gaming said Nicholas Gardner a tax partner at law firm Ashurst in London.

The new rules are expected to be finalized next year and require lawmaker approval in some jurisdictions.

That includes the United States where several top Republican politicians have voiced opposition to the deal.

Malta is another country that permits multinationals to minimize taxes via intra-company intellectual property sales.

Maltas finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment on its intellectual property-related tax allowances.

International pressure forced Ireland in recent years to phase out one of the worlds best-known corporate-tax loopholes known as the double Irish.

In response companies have increasingly accumulated tax deductions known as capital allowances via intra-group sales of intellectual property according to tax advisors economists and company filings.

Since 2015 multinationals have moved hundreds of billions of euros worth of intellectual property into Ireland economists say.

This has led to vast annual tax deductions for foreign companies related to so-called intangible assets more than 45 billion euros in 2019 up from under 2.7 billion euros in 2014 according to data from Irelands tax authority.

The data doesnt break down what portion of those deductions were related to intellectual-property transactions within a corporation.

Virtually every multinational has moved intellectual property said Christopher Sibley a senior statistician at Irelands Central Statistics Office.

The profits being shielded from tax by US-based companies typically come from sales to Europe Asia and Africa according to tax specialists and corporate filings.

The US Treasury loses out because the products and services sold are based on research conducted and investment made in the United States academics say.

The US Treasury declined to comment on whether US companies will continue to take advantage of pre-existing tax strategies or benefit from future ones.

Adobe books most of its sales to non-US clients through an Irish subsidiary based in a four-storey block in an office park outside Dublin corporate filings show.

In 2020 Adobe Systems Software Ireland Ltd purchased intellectual property from another subsidiary that was both an Irish-registered company and a resident in Bermuda for tax purposes.

The set-up meant no tax was due on the $11 billion profit from the sale. Meanwhile Irish-tax resident Adobe Systems Software Ireland registered an $11 billion expense that could be used to offset taxes on profits over a period of about eight years because it is an asset that depreciates over time according to the subsidiaries accounts.

Adobe paid $197 million of tax on $3.1 billion of reported profit in Ireland in 2020 and sales of $5.6 billion according to accounts for its main Irish unit.

This equates to an effective tax rate of about half of Irelands current statutory 12.5 per cent corporate income tax rate thanks to the impact of the capital allowances.

Other US companies that have amassed multi-billion-dollar tax deductions from intellectual property sales to affiliates over the last three years include semiconductor maker Analog Devices Inc medical devices maker Stryker Corp and software group Cadence Design Systems Inc publicly available accounts for their Irish subsidiaries show.

Analog Devices and Stryker said they adhere to tax rules and regulations but declined to answer questions on their specific tax arrangements. Cadence declined to comment.",,,,,,

AMC on Sunday revealed that its Walking Dead prequel series has been renewed for an eighth season with former leading lady Kim Dickens set to rejoin the show as a series regular. Dickens whose Madison Clark was killed off three years ago in season four will make her triumphant return to the zombie drama in the back half of season seven which will return April 17.

“If there were a Mt. Deadmore Kim Dickens’ face would be on it. Madison Clark is a foundational character to TWDU — heroic complex an everyperson who becomes a warrior and then a force of benevolence” said Scott M. Gimple content chief of The Walking Dead universe. “Kim Dickens’ raw talent strength and brilliance will electrify TWDU once more and we couldn’t be luckier to have her back.”

Details surrounding Madison’s return were not immediately available. The character was last seen in season four’s midseason finale when she was presumed dead after seemingly sacrificing herself to save her family and friends from a horde of walkers. Dickens in an interview with THR at the time of her departure said leaving FTWD was not her choice but instead one made by showrunners Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg who took over for original series creator Dave Erickson. While her character’s death was never shown on-screen Dickens Chambliss Goldberg and Talking Dead host Chris Hardwick all confirmed that Madison had perished. Still the door was left open for Dickens to return to the series she said she was “disappointed” to be leaving.

The renewal for FTWD solidifies one corner of the Walking Dead universe as the flagship series prepares to end its run with the back half of its 11th and final season in 2022. Following the original drama’s conclusion fan favorites Norman Reedus and Melissa McBride will transition to a Carol and Daryl spinoff series that will be joined by an episodic anthology Tales of the Walking Dead at AMC. Gimple the former TWD showrunner oversees the larger universe which also includes the long-gestating Andrew Lincoln-led feature films.

CHY’ENNE VALENTINO

Queendom: Chicago USA

Ms. Chy’enna Valentino is “triple F: fat flawless and fucking amazing.” She is a loud outspoken and fashionable queen.

WOOWU

Queendom: Guangzhou China

Who’s Hungry? Because “the buffet is open eat as much as you’d like.” Woowu chose her name because she likes to make an entrance into every room she enters; who doesn’t love shouting “Woowu?” This queen loves drag because she can live a Hannah Montana-esque lifestyle! Woowu says she can get a bit naughty and rightfully sang Madonna’s “Material Girl.”

LEONA WINTER

Queendom: Paris France

Not again… “the French Revolution has started heads are gonna roll.” This 26-year-old is here to bring us French elegance. She is chic couture feminine and clearly glamorous. Leona’s name in fact comes from her love for none other than Queen of the Universe judge Leona Lewis! Doing her country proud Ms. Winter performed “Non je ne regrette rien” by Édith Piaf.

BITTY BITSCHLAP

“Welcome to the Brazilian fantasy” we hope you enjoy your stay. Grag Queen is from a small Brazilian town where she always stood out. She even claims to be the sexiest person from Canela duh!

Although this is her first time singing on stage alone she proved to be a powerhouse with Amy Winehouse’s “Rehab.”

ADA VOX

Queendom: San Antonio USA

“Decked in red white and blue Ms. Vox is coming for you!” In drag Ada Vox is the personification of the person she has always wanted to be. Fun fact Ada has been diagnosed with an infantile epiglottis meaning basically she has baby vocal cords. Ada has turned her condition into stardom; as an ex-American Idol contestant Ada ran the house to the ground with “At Last” by Etta James.

RANI KO-HE-NUR

Queendom: Mumbai India

What time is it? “Time for the South Asain invasion!” Rani Ko-He-Nur grew up singing and dancing. In her culture drag has been around for decades as seen through kings queens and even gods! Just being out in India is a political statement but when she is in drag and singing she finally feels free. Rani Nama-slayed with the Hindi mashup “Piya Tu Ab To Aaja/Laila Main Laila” by Asha Bhosle/Shah Rukh Khan.

JUJUBEE

Queendom: Boston USA

Claiming this title she embraced the ultimate pop star Ariana Grande performing her hit “Into You.”

REGINA VOCE

Regina Voce surprised us all with the beautiful Italian ballad “Caruso” by Lucio Dalla.

MATANTE ALEX

Queendom: Montreal Canada

“Saddle up bitches the Canadian cowgirl has arrived” and she’s ready to neigh all over this global stage. This French-Canadian queen always wanted to be a pop star. She discovered her true self through drag and is drawn to the classic country aesthetics. Matante gagged the judges with her fabulous yodeling performing “He Taught Me to Yodel” by Rosalie Allen.

ARIA B CASSIDINE

Queendom: Atlanta USA

Get out of the way and “let a real bitch through.” Miss Aria proudly identifies as a glamazon. She is a pageant queen with a long track record including the title of Ms. Gay Black America. As a result Aria B Cassidine is used to competing against talented people. She came out with a powerful rendition of Conchita Wurst’s “Rise Like a Phoenix.”

LA VOIX

Queendom: London UK

“Just like the real British queen [she adores] waving all the other queens goodbye.” As a 41-year-old queen La Voix has been doing drag for 20 years! She has been through the entertainment industry with TV film and more. With a name like La Voix meaning the voice she rightfully performed “Mourir Sur Scene (I Was Born to Sing Forever)” by Shirley Bassey.

SPOILER ALERT:

Unfortunately we had to say goodbye to eight queens Jujubee Bettybitschlap chy-enne Woowu Novaczar and la Voix. But the judges hinted that one queen may get a second chance! However eight queens still remain!

“The global ad market will continue its remarkable recovery from the 2020 downturn” which recorded a 3.9 percent drop in ad dollars the agency said ahead of its unveiling of the estimates during Monday’s virtual UBS Global Telecom Media & Technology Conference. A year ago Zenith had projected a global ad rebound to the tune of 5.6 percent this year which it then upgraded to 11.2 percent in July.

Global ad spend will expand another 5.7 percent in 2023 and 7.4 percent in 2024 to hit $873 billion “as brands continue using advertising to spur further growth in e-commerce” the company predicted.

In the U.S. ad expenditures will jump 13.8 percent this year to $285.2 billion when assuming constant prices after a 2.2 percent drop in 2020 according to the Zenith model. Ad spending will expand 8.4 percent in 2022 followed by 1.8 percent the following year and 6.4 percent in 2024 to reach $364.9 billion.

Zenith also highlighted the growth spurt of social media fueled by the rise of TikTok Instagram and others forecasting that it will reach $177 billion in 2022 to overtake television which will account for $174 billion. “Social media ad spend will rise to $225 billion by 2024 when it will account for 26.5 percent of all advertising followed by paid search at 22.5 percent and television at 21.0 percent” the agency said.

Digital ad dollars are continuing to grow particularly fast globally. “Social media will lead the market with 14.8 percent annual growth to 2024” while online video will improve by 14.0 percent a year according to the Zenith prognosticators. “COVID-19 setbacks have extended the period of heightened digital transformation” the agency stated. “The pandemic has thoroughly disrupted shopping habits. Many consumers who would prefer to browse and purchase in person are shopping online by necessity.”

“Ad spend in all regions is now well above pre-pandemic levels and all are expected to grow healthily over the next few years” the company also said.

Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East/North Africa will be the fastest-growing regions going forward predicts Zenith “but most new ad dollars come from the U.S.” which is expected to see a $80 billion expansion through 2024 accounting for 48 percent of total gains over the period. “The next-largest growth will come from China ($15.8 billion or 9 percent of the total) the U.K. ($6.0 billion or 4 percent) and Japan ($5.4 billion or 3 percent).”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYWdsaXR6LmNvbS9pbmRpYW4tb3JpZ2luLW5ldy16ZWFsYW5kLXNwaW5uZXItYWphei1wYXRlbC10YWtlcy1hbGwtMTAtd2lja2V0cy1hZ2FpbnN0LWluZGlhLXRlc3QtaW5uaW5ncy1tdW1iYWktbWF0Y2gtLW5ld3MtMzAyNDMz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indian-born New Zealand bowler Ajaz Patel takes all 10 wickets against India creates history - News,"Indian-origin New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel has created history after taking all 10 wickets in a Test innings against India during their second Test match in Mumbai.

Ajaz Patel is the third player in the history of cricket to take all ten wickets in a Test innings following former Indian captain Anil Kumble who had figures of 10-74 against Pakistan in Delhi in February 1999 and former England bowler Jim Laker who took 10-53 against Australia in July 1956 at Manchester. The New Zealand spinner registered bowling figures of 47.5-12-119-10. Ajaz Patel who is only playing his 11th Test match for New Zealand was born in Mumbai India in 1988 and then emigrated to New Zealand with his family in 1996.

With valuations still sky-high by historical standards some investors might be hesitant to buy into the stock market. And understandably so.

But according to CNBC’s Jim Cramer there are still opportunities for those seeking value especially after the COVID omicron variant rattled markets.

“For days I’ve told you we were waiting for the other shoe to drop and it just hit today” he said this past Wednesday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 461 points.

Within that context the Mad Money host offered viewers four value stock recommendations. He even warned that if you wait too long to buy them you’ll probably kick yourself.

Here’s a quick look at Cramer’s group of ""obvious"" bargain-basement buying opportunities. One — or all — of them might be worth buying with some of your extra cash.

Disney (DIS)

It’s easy to understand why Disney made Cramer’s list of beaten down values.

While the S&P 500 has climbed a solid 22% year to date Disney shares have tumbled 19% over the same time period and are off nearly 30% from their 52-week highs.

Theme parks and cruise lines still make up about 17% of Disney’s business so it’s no surprise that new COVID variants significantly hurt the stock’s investor appeal.

Meanwhile streaming service Disney+ added just 2.1 million subscribers in the most recent quarter its slowest pace since launching two years ago.

“Right now Disney’s being held down by the omicron variant and disappointing subscriber numbers for Disney+” Cramer acknowledged.

But he also said that the stock won’t stay down forever because Disney is an “iconic company” with the best franchises. Prior to the pandemic Disney consistently posted returns on equity around 20%.

PayPal (PYPL)

Financial technologist PayPal is another bruised behemoth with its shares having fallen 21% in 2021.

On the bright side PayPal’s core business continues to grow. In Q3 the company’s total payment volume rose 26% year over year to $310 billion. Meanwhile net revenue increased 13% to $6.18 billion.

“I know some sellers are motivated by PayPal’s not-so-hot chart” Cramer said. “I’m motivated by the fact that the stock’s down 131 points from its $310 high. Again it’s a buy.”

To be sure PayPal currently trades at around $182 per share. But you can get a piece of the company using a popular trading app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you’re willing to spend.

Mastercard (MA)

Credit card companies aren’t investor favorites these days because the return of COVID restrictions and lockdowns threaten to slow down international travel — and in turn spending.

Story continues

Mastercard shares for instance are off about 2% over the past month and down 9% in 2021.

But Cramer pointed out that the company is returning more cash to investors typically a sign of financial strength.

On Nov. 30 Mastercard announced an $8 billion share repurchase program and boosted its quarterly dividend by 11%.

“I don’t think Mastercard’s quite ready to bottom at these levels but it’s a lot closer to the bottom than it was a few months ago” Cramer said.

Wynn Resorts (WYNN)

Wynn Resorts is the most battered name on this list. As the owner and operator of hotels and casinos in Las Vegas and Macau Wynn shares are not only down 29% year to date but remain well off their pre-pandemic levels.

Cramer calls Wynn “one of the most hated stocks” he’s ever seen pointing out that the company’s current valuation is way too low given the value of its properties.

“I think this company could easily be acquired by an MGM or Las Vegas Sands — they know the physical properties and the brand are best in show. Believe me the insiders would be delighted to cash in” Cramer added.

Of course with COVID variants continuing to make headlines it’s fair to say that the concern surrounding Wynn shares — along with the volatility that comes with it — isn’t going away anytime soon.

If you’d like to take a more conservative approach consider building a portfolio of blue-chip stocks just by using your leftover pennies.

A real alternative

Picking stocks isn’t easy. Even investment pundits like Jim Cramer get it wrong — a lot.

If you want an asset that provides solid upside without the volatile ups and downs of the stock market consider fine art.

According to the Citi Global Art Market chart contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years.

Investing in fine art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultra-rich. But with a new investing platform you can invest in iconic artworks too just like Jeff Bezos and Peggy Guggenheim.

As Twitterati asks billionaire Elon Musk to pay more taxes American singer-actor Courtney Love Cobain has joined the debate tweeting that she has private emails of Tesla CEO and would apparently post those on social media if Musk doesn't pay a fair share of federal taxes.

The tech billionaire had attacked Bernie Sanders on Twitter last month after the US Senator demanded that the wealthy should pay their ""fair share"" of taxes.

Tagging Sanders' tweet Courtney Love posted: ""@elonmusk you know your str8 male PayPal mafia email group? I was on bcc for MONTHS on that thing. With that information in mind don't you think in a ""civilised society"" one should embrace paying our fair share of tax? Don't pick on Bernie. It's Kendall Roy."" She however had not revealed any private email of Musk by Friday.

It’s Kendall Roy shit. pic.twitter.com/cW4gRCxvjU — Courtney Love Cobain (@Courtney) December 2 2021

Last month Musk and Sanders' tweets were making rounds on Twitter.

""We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share"" Sanders said in a tweet.

Musk responded to the 80-year-old Vermont Senator by saying: ""I keep forgetting that you're still alive"" and later raised the possibility of selling more Tesla shares which would require him to pay taxes.

""Want me to sell more stock Bernie?"" he had tweeted.

The Tesla CEO has to date sold off shares worth $10.9 billion. This equals to 10.1 million shares in total.

In early November the world's richest person tweeted that he would sell 10 per cent of his stock if users of the social media platform approved. A majority of them agreed with the sale.

While there are certainly fans of his who are — one assumes anyway — delighted to watch these play out there’s something more than a little frustrating at watching a 50-year-old billionaire acting like a teenage edgelord online. Last month brought one of his most high-profile feuds yet this one against Senator Bernie Sanders.



A quick recap: Sanders tweeted a demand that “the extremely wealthy pay their fair share” on November 13. Musk’s response came a day later: “I keep forgetting you’re still alive.” All of which probably left onetime Sanders voters who drive Teslas feeling a bit frustrated and countless observers asking a simple question: Why Elon Musk?



One of those observers it turns out was none other that Courtney Love. Turns out she’s on Sanders’s side here — and took to Twitter earlier this month to second Sanders’s case and suggest that she has some dirt on Musk. “Don’t pick on Bernie” she wrote. “It’s Kendall Roy shit.”

As Kim Lyons reported at The Verge what was especially notable about Love’s Tweet was her reference to Musk’s “str8 male PayPal mafia email group.” More details on that group — and what may have been said within it — remain elusive but it certainly sounds enticing and potentially scandalous. Could it be the stuff of a prestige cable drama? Stranger things have happened."

As Priscilla Jebaraj reports for The Hindu two years after PepsiCo India provoked outrage by suing nine Gujarati farmers for allegedly infringing patent rights by growing its registered potato variety the company’s registration has been revoked by the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights’ Authority (PPV&FRA).

“This judgement is a historic victory for the farmers of India. It should also prevent any other seed or food corporation from transgressing legally granted farmers’ seed freedoms in India” said Kavitha Kuruganti convenor of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture who had filed the petition to revoke the food giant’s registration.

PepsiCo said it was reviewing Friday’s order but refused to offer further comments.

The PPV&FRA reportedly questioned the documentation produced by PepsiCo claiming it was the owner of the variety and thus could be considered the Registered Breeder under the law.

Kavitha Kuruganti a farmers' rights activist had petitioned the Authority for revoking the intellectual protection granted to PepsiCo's FC5 potato variety on the ground that any patent on seed varieties is not permissible under Indian law.

The Authority has upheld Kuruganti's argument that PepsiCo cannot claim a patent over a seed variety.

The US food giant had sparked an outrage in 2019 when it filed a legal case against some Gujarat farmers for planting the FC5 potato variety which has a lower moisture content required to make snacks such as potato chips.

The company cited its registration of the variety in 2016. The litigation snowballed into a controversy and agriculture activists raised questions against the corporate’s registration of the potato variety and its assertion of exclusive rights. This also forced the government to pressure the company to settle the dispute with the farmers and the company withdrew its litigation.One of the activists Kavitha Kuruganti dragged the company before the authority and demanded revocation of PepsiCo’s registration of the potato variety under the provisions of India’s Protection of Farm Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Act 2001. She submitted that the grant of certificate of registration was based on incorrect information furnished by the company; that the certificate was granted to a person not eligible for protection; that this granting registration and exclusive right over the variety was not in public interest.Acting on the revocation application filed in June 2019 the authority revoked the company’s registration and accepted the activist’s argument that the law acknowledges farmers’ rights and any attempt to harass and intimidate farmers should be considered a matter of public interest.After the judgment was pronounced Kuruganti said the judgment set a precedent for all seed and food and beverages corporations and other registrants to not only uphold but more importantly not to transgress the legally granted farmers’ seed rights and freedoms in India. “Companies should not think that they are at liberty to harass farmers.We are watching and will disallow any such mischief. For us any intimidation and harassment of farmers is clearly a matter of public interest. We sincerely hope that the authority will proactively put into place all measures and mechanisms possible to ensure that farmers’ rights are not violated at any cost. The interpretation of ‘public interest’ by the authority today is very progressive. This is a victory for farmers in the country especially potato farmers in Gujarat who strongly resisted Pepsi’s onslaught on their rights in 2019” she added.Reacting to the development Kapil Shah of Kisan Beej Adhikar Manch said “We believe that the Authority and the government have a responsibility to let every applicant and registrant under the PPV&FR Act know that their rights do not supersede farmers’ rights. The registrants’ rights are limited to only production of a variety and not production from a variety.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmV5Y29udHJvbC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9wZXBzaWNvcy1pbnRlbGxlY3R1YWwtcHJvcGVydHktcmlnaHQtb24tZmwtMjAyNy1wb3RhdG8tdmFyaWV0eS1yZXZva2VkLTc3OTA1NzEuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25leWNvbnRyb2wuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvcGVwc2ljb3MtaW50ZWxsZWN0dWFsLXByb3BlcnR5LXJpZ2h0LW9uLWZsLTIwMjctcG90YXRvLXZhcmlldHktcmV2b2tlZC03NzkwNTcxLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PepsiCo's intellectual property right on FL-2027 potato variety revoked,"Farm activist Kavitha Kuruganti has contended that the intellectual property right (IPR) granted to PepsiCo India on a potato variety was not as per provisions laid down for registration and was against the public interest. (Representative image)

In a setback to PepsiCo India the plant varieties protection authority PPV&FR revoked its varietal registration certificate on December 3 which was granted to the food and beverages major on a potato variety 'FL-2027' in the country. Reacting to the development PepsiCo said it is in the process of reviewing the order passed by the Protection of Plant Varieties & Farmers’ Rights (PPV&FR) Authority.

PPV&FR is a statutory body set up under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Act 2001. The authority ruling came over a petition filed by farm activist Kavitha Kuruganti contending that the grant of the certificate of registration to PepsiCo India was based on incorrect information furnished by it.

She has also contended that the intellectual property right (IPR) granted to PepsiCo India on a potato variety was not as per provisions laid down for registration and was against the public interest. Moreover the certificate of registration has been granted to a person who is not eligible for protection under the Act and the breeder (PepsiCo) did not provide the Registrar with such information documents or materials as required as per her petition.

PPV&FR has consented to Kuruganti’s submission and said the grant of the certificate of registration was based on ""incorrect information"" furnished by the applicant.

""Accordingly the certificate of registration dated February 1 2016 granted by Registrar in favour of the Registered Breeder (PepsiCo) in respect of the potato variety with denomination FL 2027 is hereby revoked with immediate effect"" the authority said in its 79-page ruling.

In its judgement PPV&FR has also come down heavily on the registrar saying that ""the registrar being protector of farmers’ rights violated the rules and this has caused hardship to farmer and other.""

""This is totally unacceptable"" it added.

The authority directed the registrar to develop a standardised sheet for evaluation of application for registration of plant varieties in accordance with the Act rules and regulations. ""Registrar may also constitute a committee and submit the detailed report on how to avoid such instances in future"" the order said.

Commenting on the development a PepsiCo spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the order passed by the PPVFR Authority and are in the process of reviewing the same. Hence at this moment it would be premature to offer any detailed comments."" Earlier PepsiCo India had used the certificate on FL-2027 potato variety to sue farmers in Gujarat in 2018 and 2019.

In a statement Kuruganti described the judgement as historic and said it upholds farmers’ seed freedoms as contained in the PPV&FR Act. PepsiCo’s action against farmers was based on a non-existent exclusive right that it claims to have obtained against Indian farmers she said.

""The judgement of the Authority today also says this. On the other hand the Indian legislation is unambiguous that farmers have over-arching rights over what seed they can plant as well as what they are entitled to do with their produce from any variety including seed of registered variety"" Kuruganti said.

The only condition is that farmers should not sell seed of protected varieties in a branded fashion knowingly Kuruganti added.

""Despite the law being this clear Pepsico India harassed and intimidated farmers and sued them for exorbitant levels of alleged damages in 2018 and 2019"" she said adding that the company also ""engaged detectives to entrap farmers and took secret video footage to build its cases.""

Kuruganti further said the judgement brings to light the procedural gaps in the grant of PVCs (plant variety certificates). ""Importantly farmers’ rights as contained in India’s Act and any attempt to harass and intimidate farmers have been considered as a matter of public interest through this judgement"" she said."

Using the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as a booster for people initially immunized with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine produces a strong immune response and may do more to elicit protection against severe disease researchers reported Sunday.

Their small study of 65 volunteers who all initially got two doses of Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine showed that using the J&J Janssen vaccine as a booster produced a slower but more sustained antibody response against the original strain of the virus as well as the Delta and Beta variants they said.

The Pfizer/BioNTech booster produced a quicker and stronger immune response that dropped off faster their study suggested.

“Both vaccines boost antibody titers very well. At week four neutralizing antibody levels were comparable” Dr. Dan Barouch of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School who led the study team told CNN.

But after four weeks antibody levels began to drop off in people who got boosted with the Pfizer vaccine while they continued to increase in people who got J&J’s vaccine. J&J’s vaccine also increased the numbers of immune cells called CD8 T cells.

Antibodies are a first line of immune protection that can stop a virus from ever infecting cells while T cells come in later and destroy infected cells. This T-cell defense doesn’t prevent mild infections but can stop them from progressing to severe disease.

While the study did not include the Omicron variant Barouch said the findings may be important for coming up with ways to fight the latest variant.

“For variants such as Omicron that might partially evade antibody responses CD8 T cell responses may be particularly relevant for protection” he said. “We think they’re relevant in general but they may become particularly relevant if a variant emerges that can largely escape from antibodies.”

“Now we don’t know that for sure yet about Omicron but as I’m sure you know there’s been a lot of concern or speculation that it might result in at least some degree maybe a substantial degree of escape from vaccine induced antibodies. For a boost you do want a boost to increase both antibody and T-cell responses.”

Barouch said his team has submitted the findings to a peer-reviewed journal and in the meantime it has been posted online without peer review on the preprint server MedRxiv.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91ay1uZXdzLzIwMjEvZGVjLzA1L3dhbGwtb2Ytc2VjcmVjeS1pbi1wZml6ZXItY29udHJhY3RzLWFzLWNvbXBhbnktYWNjdXNlZC1vZi1wcm9maXRlZXJpbmfSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vdWstbmV3cy8yMDIxL2RlYy8wNS93YWxsLW9mLXNlY3JlY3ktaW4tcGZpemVyLWNvbnRyYWN0cy1hcy1jb21wYW55LWFjY3VzZWQtb2YtcHJvZml0ZWVyaW5n?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Wall of secrecy’ in Pfizer contracts as company accused of profiteering,"Ministers have agreed a secrecy clause in any dispute with the drugs manufacturer Pfizer over Britain’s Covid vaccine supply. Large portions of the government’s contracts with the company over the supply of 189m vaccine doses have been redacted and any arbitration proceedings will be kept secret.

The revelation comes as Pfizer is accused by a former senior US health official of “war profiteering’’ during the pandemic. In a Channel 4 Dispatches investigation to be broadcast this week Tom Frieden who was director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under Barack Obama said: “If you’re just focusing on maximising your profits and you’re a vaccine manufacturer … you are war profiteering.”

Zain Rizvi research director at Public Citizen a US consumer advocacy organisation which has examined Pfizer’s global vaccine contracts said: “There is a wall of secrecy surrounding these contracts and it’s unacceptable particularly in a public health crisis.”

Rizvi said the UK needed to explain why it had agreed to secret arbitration proceedings. He said: “It’s the only high-income country we have seen that has agreed to this provision. It allows pharmaceutical companies to bypass domestic legal processes.

“The UK government has allowed the drug firms to call the shots. How did we end up in a situation where a handful of drug firms were able to exert so much control over the most powerful governments in the world? It points to a broken system.”

Pfizer has won plaudits for its vaccine delivery programme but the US multinational faces growing scrutiny over the scale of its profits and the proportion of doses it has delivered to low-income countries.

While AstraZeneca agreed to sell its vaccine at cost during the pandemic Pfizer wanted to secure its profits. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine which now has the brand name Comirnaty will be one of the most lucrative drugs in pharmaceutical history.

The Channel 4 investigation reveals analysis by one biological engineering expert claiming the Pfizer vaccine costs just 76p to manufacture for each shot. It is reportedly being sold for £22 a dose to the UK government.

The estimated manufacturing costs do not include research distribution and other costs but Pfizer says its profit margin as a percentage before tax are in the “high-20s”. Pfizer expects to deliver 2.3bn vaccines this year with predicted revenues of $36bn (£26.3bn).

A report last month by the People’s Vaccine Alliance a coalition of organisations including aid charities said Pfizer and other drug firms have sold the majority of doses to rich countries leaving low-income countries “out in the cold” . Only 2% of people in low-income countries had been fully vaccinated against coronavirus. Drug firms should suspend intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines tests treatments and other medical tools.

Pfizer has faced increased scrutiny allegations of excessive global profits after its partner the biotechnology company BioNTech announced in September 2020 it was to receive up to €375m (£320m) from the German government to fund vaccine development.

Anna Marriott Oxfam’s health policy manager said: “It is deplorable that billions of people around the world are being denied vaccines so that pharmaceutical companies can make obscene profits. Given that public investment was crucial to vaccine development it’s incomprehensible that pharma monopolies are being prioritised over people’s lives.”

Pfizer has to date pledged 40m doses out of global production to Covax the UN-backed initiative delivering vaccines for low income countries. This is less than 2% of its global production for 2021. The firm says it aims to deliver at least two billion doses to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2022.

Pfizer said vaccine production was the “biggest scale-up” in the firm’s history and it was proud to have delivered more than 2bn vaccines to 162 countries. It supplied low-income countries on a not-for-profit price and all other countries were being offered the vaccine at a significantly discounted price.

The company added: “The pandemic has highlighted the extraordinary value that a vibrant private sector can deliver to society.” It said confidentiality agreements were standard practice. The estimated cost of manufacturing the vaccine by a biological engineering expert was grossly inaccurate and meaningless because it did not reflect the true costs of bringing the vaccine to patients including clinical studies increased manufacturing efforts and global distribution.

The government said its vaccine contracts were commercially sensitive and it could not disclose any further details. BioNTech did not respond to a request for comment.

""When is a new covid variant good news? When you're a pharma shareholder obviously.""

Based on data compiled by Global Justice Now and released Saturday ""just 8 top Pfizer and Moderna shareholders"" added a combined $10.31 billion to their fortunes last week after stock prices soared in response to the emergence of Omicron. According to a statement by the group:

Moderna's shares skyrocketed after the announcement and settled at $310.61/share on Wednesday 1 December up 13.61% from $273.39/share since Wednesday 24 November the day before the announcement. Pfizer's shares rose by 7.41% from $50.91/share to $54.68/share. Moderna's CEO Stephane Bancel personally became more than $824m richer in the week after the announcement with the value of his shares rising from $6052522978 to $6876528630. He sold off 10000 shares for $319 each on 26 November the day after the variant was announced cashing out $3.19 million. At close of business on Tuesday Bancel's shares had grown by $1.7 billion since the announcement before falling after the company lost a legal dispute over patents. Bancel has refused to share the recipe for Moderna's vaccine with the World Health Organisation to help scale-up manufacturing of mRNA vaccines through its new hub in South Africa. WHO scientists are now trying to reverse-engineer the vaccine. His company is also waging a legal battle to erase the role of massive public funding and public scientists in developing the jab.

With nations in the European Union the United Kingdom and others continuing to block a demand for a vaccine patent waiver at the World Trade Organization public health campaigners have hammered government leaders for doing the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry. Anger has become especially harsh because the emergence of new and dangerous variants was predicted as the likely outcome if nations did not move swiftly to vaccinate the world by making shots universally available.

""Pharmaceutical companies knew that grotesque levels of vaccine inequality would create prime conditions for new variants to emerge. They let Covid-19 spread unabated in low and middle-income countries.""

""Pharmaceutical companies knew that grotesque levels of vaccine inequality would create prime conditions for new variants to emerge"" said Tim Bierley pharma campaigner at Global Justice Now. ""They let Covid-19 spread unabated in low and middle-income countries. And now the same pharma execs and shareholders are making a killing from a crisis they helped to create. It's utterly obscene.""

""At every turn"" he continued ""these companies have obstructed efforts to more equitably distribute vaccines around the world. They have made more than enough money from the pandemic selling two of the most lucrative drugs in history. It's time to hand over the recipe for these essential medicines to the WHO so we can finally end this pandemic.""

While a scheduled decision on the WTO patent waiver was postponed last week progressives worldwide have insisted that there will be no end to the global pandemic until vaccine apartheid is brought to an end.

Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz and trade expert Lori Wallach argued in an op-ed last week that the pandemic cannot be defeated until the waiver is approved.

""As the Omicron variant shows as long as there are raging outbreaks anywhere Covid-19 will mutate and the possibility of more infectious or deadly strains increases"" the pair wrote. ""That's why unless people everywhere are vaccinated we face the prospect of an endless pandemic.""

When the ""underlying problem is a lack of global supply"" they argued--and more vaccines and boosters will be needed to fend off variants--the WTO waiver ""is an obvious way of increasing supply and helping put an end to the pandemic for good.""

And as Bierley said ""It's long past time for the UK and the EU to stand on the side of global health instead of vaccine billionaires--and get behind an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines tests and treatments.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3BmaXplci1mYWNlcy1zY3J1dGlueS1vdmVyLXNjYWxlLW9mLWl0cy1jb3ZpZC1wcm9maXRzLXNheXMtcmVwb3J0LTEyMTEyMDUwMDcyNF8xLmh0bWzSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvcGZpemVyLWZhY2VzLXNjcnV0aW55LW92ZXItc2NhbGUtb2YtaXRzLWNvdmlkLXByb2ZpdHMtc2F5cy1yZXBvcnQtMTIxMTIwNTAwNzI0XzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer faces scrutiny over scale of its Covid profits says report,"Pfizer has won plaudits for its Covid vaccine delivery programme but the US multinational faces growing scrutiny over the scale of its profits and the proportion of doses it has delivered to low-income countries The Guardian reported.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League."

It is undeniable that one of the technologies which has found its way into various industries including the oil and gas sector is nanotechnology. As an interdisciplinary technology nanotechnology has attracted the attention of large oil and gas companies. A look at the current status of these companies indicates that depending on the significance they attach to nanotechnology they have dedicated a remarkable part of their innovations and inventions to this technology.

With the advent of nanotechnology numerous scientists predicted that this technology would penetrate varied areas and become one of the most vital tools to meet technological challenges. In this regard the oil and gas industry would be considered a key industry in the world the developments of which have tangible effects on other sectors.





This report aims to examine patents as one of the important indicators to study the degree of penetration and impact of nanotechnology in the oil and gas sector. To do so the statistics pertaining to nanotechnology patents of several large companies active in the field of oil and gas in the world have been scrutinized. The Forbes and Fortune websites have been used to compile a list of the top oil companies while the Orbit database has been employed to extract patent statistics for these companies. Forbes is a business company offering invaluable information in the fields of economics finance industry and market and Fortune is an American business magazine that works in the area of ranking various companies. The original companies have been used to extract the statistics whereas their subsidiaries which have different names from the main companies have not been examined.





Table 1 presents a list of the 25 largest oil companies with the most patents related to nanotechnology. These patents have been issued or registered in different years by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO). The table also outlines the number of nano patents issued by these companies by USPTO and EPO the number of patents in all fields of science and technology the share of nano patents from all the patents and the country where the companies are located. The entire number of patents issued by these top 25 companies in the field of nanotechnology amounts to about 5005 of which more than 84% have been published in the USPTO and about 16% in the EPO.





Of the 25 companies listed nine are owned by the United States and a total of around 58% of the nano patents issued by these 25 oil and gas companies are held by US companies. Among these companies are Baker Hughes Company and Halliburton which have issued 940 and 731 patents in the area of nanotechnology and are ranked first and third in this regard respectively. The second place belongs to the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) which has had a significant growth in the issuance of patents in the field of nanotechnology in the past few years. Another fact is the presence of three companies from Japan a country which possesses scarce oil and gas resources but has a serious presence in this field having registered 205 nano patents.

Table 1. The world's top oil and gas companies based on the number of patents and patent applications issued in the field of nanotechnology.

Studies reveal that in total the two continents of North America and Asia have the highest number of companies regarding nanotechnology patents in the oil and gas sector followed by Europe and South America. Figure 1 illustrates the share of different continents with regard to the top companies in this field.

Figure 1. Share of different continents with regard to the top companies active in the oil and gas sector in the dissemination of nano patents.

Figure 2 shows the patent release trends for the top 5 companies in this field between 2010 and 2020. One of the highlights of Figure 2 is the significant growth of nanotechnology patents by the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) from 2017 onwards. Between 2010 and 2013 Aramco published less than 10 inventions in the field of nanotechnology every year but in 2014 experiencing a noticeable growth it increased the number of inventions in the field of nanotechnology to over 10. However the most significant growth of this company started from 2017 onwards with the company registering the highest number of patents in the field of nanotechnology among all the top 5 companies in 2018 while it achieved the second position in nano patent issuance by November 2021.





The other top four companies issued similar numbers of patents in the field of nanotechnology in 2010 whereas Baker Hughes Company with an increase in patent numbers in this field in 2012 was able to widen the distance with the other companies taking the first place. In 2020 with the exception of the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) the other four companies faced a decline in patent releases a fact which is also observed in 2021. One of the reasons for this could be the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on the global economy including the oil and gas sector and companies active in this field which has led to a degeneration in research and development in these companies.

Figure 2. Number of patents issued in the field of nanotechnology by the top 5 companies in the oil and gas sector over the last 10 years.

One of the indicators proposed in this research is the ratio of patents in the field of nanotechnology to the total patents published in all fields of science and technology. This indicator shows the role of nanotechnology and its impact on the overall findings of a company. In this regard the highest share of nanotechnology patents in the total number of patents belongs to the Iranian Petroleum Industry Research Institute (RIPI) at 41.94%. Of course this company does not possess a significantly large number of patents with a total of 62 patents in the two offices in the United States and Europe. The second position according to this criterion is held by the Indian Oil Company with a share of 12.90% while SK Innovation ranks third having a share of about 11.37%. Among the companies with an American nationality Baker Hughes Company and Phillips 66 account for the largest share of nano patents with a total of more than 6%.





The Middle East is one of the richest oil and gas fields in the world and the countries in this region are among the most active countries that produce and export oil and gas. A review of the companies and patent registration trends for the countries in the region indicates that only two countries Saudi Arabia and Iran have companies which are among the top 25 oil and gas companies investing in nanotechnology. In recent years Saudi Arabia has expanded its patent-related efforts in the field of nanotechnology with the cooperation of other countries including the United States while taking advantage of international researchers in this field. Saudi Arabia's strategic planning for nanotechnology reveals the following as its oil and gas priorities: improving catalysts increasing corrosion resistance increasing yields increasing well productivity and developing well drilling equipment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdHJhdmVscmFkYXIuYWVyby9icml0aXNoLWFpcndheXMtZ29lcy1mdXJ0aGVyLXdpdGgtaXRzLXN1c3RhaWJsZS1hdmlhdGlvbi1ncm93dGgtc3RyYXRlZ3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,British Airways Goes Further With Its Sustaible Aviation-growth Strategry,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='travelradar.aero', port=443): Read timed out.

Various items of sports memorabilia are put up for auction including a Chilean national team shirt of Blackburn Rovers striker Ben Ben Brereton Díaz and domestic club kits.

Jorge Gomez an ESPN journalist in Chile involved in the auction told Las Últimas Noticias the Leeds shirt was 'sent by diplomatic bag from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.'

""At one point I thought it was a scam"" he added.

Last year Teletón raised $40m and since its inception rehabilitation centres for children have been built in 13 locations across the city by Fundación Teletón.

Bielsa also sent a Leeds shirt in 2018 to help raise funds for the cause paying extra for delivery to ensure the shirt arrived in time and in 2010 made an appearance on Chile helps Chile another charity telethon that raised money to help those affected by the earthquake that struck southern Chile in February of that year.

In 2019 Bielsa sent a message of support to those protesting inequality in Chile in a post-match press conference at Hillsborough.

""I admire what the Chilean people are doing the normal citizens"" he said.

""They take democracy in a different way. They are an example for the rest of the country but treated by their authorities. And they claim in the correct way with democracy and they understand to have a good democracy you have to do more than vote."

In a press release from Allegiant the pair shared their plans to enter into a “fully-integrated Commercial Alliance Agreement” pending permission from the DOT and approval for antitrust immunity.

Antitrust immunity allows carriers in a joint venture to collude on routes included in the agreement meaning they can modify prices and earn profits according to the Department of Justice. Currently there are 14 active antitrust alliances approved by the DOT like United Airlines and Germany-based Lufthansa; Delta and UK-based Virgin Atlantic; and American and Australia-based Qantas.

Joining as a team the duo will be able to coordinate their airline operations including their data systems loyalty programs marketing scheduling and routes. The alliance will enable Allegiant which does not currently fly to Mexico to offer flights to Mexican leisure hotspots.

Meanwhile Viva Aerobus will be able to add several routes to popular destinations in the US where Allegiant has a strong presence like Las Vegas and Orlando. According to Allegiant Viva Aerobus will have access to the Las Vegas-based airline’s distribution network and point-of-sale process.

The hack was first reported on Saturday night (Dec. 4) when security analysis firm PeckShield showed that a BitMart address was showing large outflows of entire token balances sometimes for tens of millions to an address known as “BitMart Hacker.”

PeckShield later tweeted that the losses were around $100 million on the Ethereum blockchain and $96 million from the Binance Smart Chain.

BitMart representatives initially denied the hack and called it “fake news.” The company originally posited that the outflows were just regular withdrawals.

Then the company confirmed the security breach hours later.

According to the report the hacker had been using decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch trading the stolen assets for the cryptocurrency ether and then using a secondary address to deposit the coins into Tornado Cash a privacy mixer. That made it more difficult for the funds to be tracked.

Cybercrime including hacking and fraud related to crypto has been on the rise since the pandemic started as many people and businesses began relying more on the internet to conduct daily life and business.

PYMNTS writes that hackers have begun stealing crypto from just random individuals as the “crypto boom” has been attracting more normal individuals and “mom and pop” types of businesses. This is a change from the usual hacking targets who were often wealthier investors.

The carriers have upped their security measures in response while law enforcement is trying to team up with other entities to address the breadth of scams.

The Federal Communications Commission has boosted rules for wireless carriers to tighten restrictions. In response to that some companies like AT&T have said the new restrictions could end up with customers subject to more fraud overall if requests to switch devices or carriers are mistakenly tagged as SIM swap scams where hackers switch information from one device to another.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmVybWlsaW9uY291bnR5Zmlyc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvc3R5eC1yZW8tc3BlZWR3YWdvbi1sb3ZlcmJveS1zZXQtZm9yLWxpdmUtdW56b29tZWQtc3VtbWVyLXRvdXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Styx REO Speedwagon & Loverboy Set For 'Live & unZoomed' Summer Tour,"Styx and REO Speedwagon are gearing up for 35-city summer trek dubbed the “Live & unZoomed” tour with special guests Loverboy opening at all dates.

We can’t wait to take the stage and rock this summer it’s gonna be awesome. These are all the groups I grew up with and I’m there too. Best tour of the summer — guaranteed.

Styx guitarist Tommy Shaw told us that the Styx-REO connection stems from his personal friendship with fellow Midwesterner REO's frontman Kevin Cronin: “Kevin and I ran into each other — we've known each other since like 1975 and it's something we'd talked about. We ran into each other in 1998 at a MTV at some kind of a game show that he and I were both on. And he wound up coming back over and I was doing 7 Deadly Zens at the time and he said 'Let me come over and be on your solo album.' So that was kind of the genesis of it that 'Wouldn't it be cool if we did this?' But so many things had. . . the planets had to align. And they finally did and once they did it was like a piece of cake.”

Kevin Cronin told us that out of countless musicians he's known over the years — especially those he played with while growing up — he's never forgotten how truly blessed he is to earn a living as a working musician: “I lucked out man. I saw the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show decided that's what I wanted to do — and I'm still doin' it. And obviously it's the REO Speedwagon fans that have given me this great opportunity — and believe me; I don't take it for granted for one second. And I try to thank them every night by givin' them a great show and letting them know that I don't take their support for granted.”

We asked the Loverboy lead singer Mike Reno how and why a band that hails from Calgary Alberta can be treated like local “hometown” heroes in so many cities across the U.S.: “Y'know that is really is amazing that you picked up on that because we talk about it all the time. There's some pockets in the U.S. that treat us like we're homeboys and it's so cool. Y'know what I think a lot of it stems from is that they grew up listening to our music when they were going through school or when they were going through college or when they were getting married; and we're a good memory. So we're part of their DNA and I think people wanna pull things out that make them feel good and make them happy. The Loverboy days were happy days for most everybody and we definitely try to keep it that way.”

We asked Vanna Krantz to walk us through the zigs and zags of her career path which started when she left Canada and arrived in New York City without a job. Since then Krantz has navigated the male-dominated world of finance worked near the Twin Towers on 9/11 started a family and became a streaming expert and supported the launch of Disney+ among other adventures. Read on for a unique look at how she navigated the corporate ladder—and takeaways for how you might as well.

Vanna Krantz’s career path:

CFO at Passport (present)

CFO at Masterclass

CFO at Disney Streaming Services

CFO at Bamtech Media

Divisional CFO roles at Thomas Reuters

Global Head of Business & Financial Analysis (Asset Management Division) at Credit Suisse

VP Finance & Reporting Analysis (Investment Management Division) at Morgan Stanley

VP Business Analysis at Merrill Lynch

Principal Financial Risk Management at PwC

Vanna Krantz is currently CFO at Passport. Courtesy of Passport

How I got started

“I walked into PricewaterhouseCoopers on Sixth Avenue. I just asked the security guards who the HR person was. One of the guys said: ‘Let me call her up. I know who she is. She has the most visitors.’ I’m practically shaking in my boots. I go up to meet her. And [after talking] she says ‘You seem like you’re qualified. Why don’t you join one of our Super Saturdays?’”

This was how Vanna Krantz the new CFO at Passport a transportation software and payments company got her first job in the U.S. in the mid-1990s at age 27. A chartered accountant with a degree from the University of Waterloo and experience as an auditor Krantz relocated from Canada to New York City with her husband so he could pursue an M.B.A. at Columbia University. The Ottawa-native didn’t have a job lined up. So she walked into PwC without an appointment and was willing to take a gamble. As a finance chief Krantz works to minimize risk. But when it comes to her managing her own career Krantz has a “willingness to take risks” she said.

‘I had three offers’

“I showed up [at PwC] on a Saturday at 9 a.m.” Krantz began. “I guess there was about eight partners [present] and all these guys who had graduated from business school. And I literally had three offers by the time I left. I would say it was a little bit of luck but also a little bit of skill.” Before coming to the U.S. she worked at the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto. In doing risk management at the bank “I felt like I was out of my league” she said. But little did Krantz know the knowledge she gained would help her land a job in the U.S. “I met all the requirements for immigration to stay in the country; thank God because I’ve got this husband who’s already going to school and so somebody is supposed to be paying the rent” Krantz quipped.

She joined PwC as a principal consultant in financial risk management amid a male-dominated environment. “Working in the bullpen of one of these accounting firms is a phenomenal way to learn” Krantz said. “I learned from all these guys.” But the learning curve included pointed feedback. “I remember that one of the partners in the first year said that I just didn’t have the same fire in my belly as everyone else did” she explained. “And I thought okay no problem here I go!” The job really helped her to prioritize work and learn the fundamentals of controls and auditing and finance at the accounting level Krantz said. At the beginning of your career it’s great to learn your job in person in the office but the pandemic may have changed that she noted. “I just saw that PricewaterhouseCoopers is allowing 40000 employees to work remotely so I kind of wonder how these people are going to learn in the same philosophy” she said. “What PwC did for me was it got me acclimated to the pace the vigor the exactness and the level of excellence that you needed in New York to be successful.”

‘We’re not staying in our seats’

After four years at PwC Krantz decided to move on to Merrill Lynch becoming VP of business analysis. But about two years into her time with the company the U.S. experienced the devastating terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) on September 11 2001.

She was working in Merrill Lynch offices in the World Financial Center near the WTC. After the onset of the attack on the Twin Towers in the WTC “even though most of the security guards were saying to stay in your seats this gentleman I have a lot of respect for him said ‘Nope we’re not saying in seats our seats we’re leaving.’ We were on a really low floor and walked out. All I can say is we lucked out.” Consequently Krantz changed jobs and began working Morgan Stanley as VP of finance reporting and analysis in the investment management division. During her time at the company she had her second child. Krantz remained for about a year “mostly due to the fact that I probably wasn’t as interested in the work and I think like a lot of women might do I struggled with what’s the right answer here for me?” she said.

At this time Lawrence Haber the CFO Krantz worked with when she was at Merrill Lynch became CFO at Credit Suisse Asset Management which was in Midtown Manhattan she said. Haber was looking to hire someone with the designation of a chartered financial analyst (CFA) “so they would have credibility with all the investment managers” Krantz said. She had earned a CFA and wound up joining the company as global head of business and financial analysis in the asset management division. “Luckily that worked out for me” Krantz said. Haber allowed for a flexible schedule of four days a week in the office and one day working from home she said. “It was kind of all I needed.” Krantz said. In the year 2003 “I was an anomaly” she commented. And at every job since then Krantz has worked from home on Fridays she said. “I got all my work done. I was really effective. It was just this thing that I started doing and people accepted it” Krantz said.

‘I remember crying on my 40th birthday’

Part of what was exciting about her position at Credit Suisse was the exposure and opportunity to be involved in high-level processes as a relatively junior person she said. When her boss got promoted to be the COO of Credit Suisse Asset Management in Zurich she decided to join a new company. “It was a tremendous opportunity [at Credit Suisse] but it was just time to move on” Krantz said.

“Now I’m going to Thomson Financial” she began. “I got hired as senior vice president of financial planning and analysis developing financial plans forecasts and long-range models and meanwhile I’ve never done FP&A … I’m there for two weeks and they buy Reuters. So now I’m on the deal team of bringing these two companies together for a year.” In 2008 Thomson Corp. and Reuters Group Plc merged into Thomson Reuters Corp. In her role Krantz interacted with the CFO of Reuters and the CFO of Thomson Corp. “I’m trying to bring not only the finance department together but obviously the businesses and [determining] how the pro-forma financial statements would look like once we get rolling as a combined company—all things I have legitimately never done” she said.

Krantz worked hard and at one point the stress took its toll. “I remember crying on my 40th birthday because I’m in the office and I’m working on something that I hardly understand and I’m trying to figure it out” she said. “I’m thinking ‘Is this really a better life?’” But turns out the answer was yes she said.

“I did figure it out” Krantz said. “I definitely had great relationships and connections with both of those CFOs.” When the organization decided there was going to be four divisional CFOs “I was chosen to be in the bakeoff for those roles” she said. That’s how Krantz got her first divisional CFO role— finance chief at Reuters Media. “I didn’t know the first thing about media; I was basically a financial services person” Krantz said. “The CEO of the media group thought that I could be a good CFO.”

Krantz referred to this role as “my CFO in training wheels job.” She continued “I interacted with the board and learned how to communicate with everyone in the business. I learned how to kind of argue or defend the business’ growth projections. I just learned a lot of things in that what I would call safe environment.” After four years she moved on to become the CFO of institutional equities “the bigger kind of more the main wheelhouse of Thomson Reuters” Krantz said.

This was between 2010 and 2011 “the time where there was a big cloud over financial services” she explained. “We were definitely scaling back. We were thinking about where we could win … I get a lot of credibility from other finance folks because I can be a little bit dispassionate [about a business decision]. So that’s worked in my favor. And I think for that kind of consolidation and cost savings time that came in handy.” After two years she was chosen to take on the role of CFO in the wealth management division. “That was a money-making machine” Krantz said. “I learned how to be a real growth company [and] tech company CFO.”

She remained in the role for four years. After a 10-year run in total with Thomson “I really wanted to be an independent company CFO” Krantz said. “I was really fortunate” she said. “I got connected to the big brand executive recruiters and that was before they were necessarily really looking for women if you know what I mean.” Now at many big companies there’s more of a push to have diverse candidates in senior leadership hiring slates that include more representation of women Krantz said.

A tech CFO

“At Bamtech Media I was a pretty decent technology CFO” she said. “And Bamtech Media was a technology company that ended up being purchased by [The Walt Disney Company] to do Disney streaming. I’d literally been there about two weeks.” Krantz wanted to work as an independent company CFO. “And now I’m going to be a divisional CFO again” she said.

However it worked in Krantz’s favor she said. “What a lucky move because now you get to be the CFO for Disney+ and ESPN+.” She initially thought the chairman of Disney would want a new CFO “because I thought this is your biggest initiative in the last 10 years and you haven’t known me for two weeks” she said. But it turns out Krantz was chosen because she was tech CFO while many other candidates were legacy or entertainment CFOs she said.

“I didn’t know one thing about direct to consumer and you know who I learned it from—my boss” Krantz said. “I basically had a morning tutorial every single morning for no lie a year and a half.”

“I am now working on the biggest strategic initiative of The Walt Disney Company in 10 years” she said. “Bob Iger himself is flying to Chelsea Market in New York City where we worked. Once every two weeks we are having meetings continuously about how to launch this product. And I’m lucky enough to be in the room. I’ve never been so energized in my life.” Krantz built the finance team from scratch she said. Her boss became a mentor knowing her background would be an asset she said. “Even though I didn’t know how to do direct to consumer video streaming I knew how to do a lot of great finance stuff” she said. “So I think that’s why he was willing to invest some time in me to teach me this particular vertical.”

After three years with Disney “I went back to trying to be an independent company CFO and so I went to a company called MasterClass” Krantz said. Working at the streaming education platform was a great experience she said. As a startup “as soon as I got there I did a fundraise and interacted with VCs” she said. “You really are thinking about your stakeholders in a much more tangible way” Krantz said. In comparison at Disney “I didn’t think about our shareholders I thought about our customers and how to provide the best product and user experience” she explained. “At MasterClass it was more about me demonstrating to investors the growth trajectory of the company and why it made sense to invest in the company.”

Krantz was at the company for less than a year when she was asked to move to San Francisco where the office is headquartered. “The CEO really wanted the CFO to sit beside him” she explained. “I just couldn’t move to the West Coast.” She ended her tenure with the company in September 2021. In August 2021 Krantz began her role as finance chief at Passport. At the transportation software and payments company she partners with the CEO in developing operational strategy prioritizing initiatives for growth and scaling as well as communicating with stakeholders.

“The most wonderful thing about the first week was the leadership team that [CEO]David Evans has put together truly is excellent” Krantz said. “Each discipline has a leader that is highly experienced. What I like about that is everybody is there for the business to be successful.” Passport is used by more than 800 cities in North America to manage their parking and mobility infrastructure. The company’s digital platform provides end-to-end operating system for managing mobile pay parking parking enforcement digital permitting and micro-mobility. “At first you just have to get the accounting right you have to know your customers the business has to run smoothly” she says. “But as you get more mature there’s just so much more to it. I think that [includes] thoughtfulness about how we really should be utilizing our resources.”

When summarizing her career thus far Krantz put it this way: “I have now learned to be uncomfortable in a very comfortable way.” For example “I’ve just joined a company that is a completely new space for me a fintech” she said. “I’m pretty close to a video streaming expert I would say because Disney made me that. And of course that was highly uncomfortable. I can assure you that I’m no longer scared about learning something new. I actually think I can and probably with speed.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25leWNvbnRyb2wuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL25tYy1ncm91cC1mcmF1ZC1jYXNlLWItci1zaGV0dHktYmFjay1pbi11ay1jb3VydC10by1hbm51bC11YWUtYmFua3MtMWJpbGxpb24tZnJlZXppbmctb3JkZXItNzc5Mjk5MS5odG1s0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmV5Y29udHJvbC5jb20vbmV3cy90cmVuZHMvZmVhdHVyZXMvbm1jLWdyb3VwLWZyYXVkLWNhc2UtYi1yLXNoZXR0eS1iYWNrLWluLXVrLWNvdXJ0LXRvLWFubnVsLXVhZS1iYW5rcy0xYmlsbGlvbi1mcmVlemluZy1vcmRlci03NzkyOTkxLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NMC Group fraud case: B.R. Shetty back in UK court to annul UAE bank’s $1billion freezing order,"Dr B.R. Shetty is the founder of NMC Group which has 200 clinics and hospitals in 19 countries.

In December 2020 the high court in London imposed a worldwide freezing order against Dr B.R. Shetty the founder of NMC Group and five other key officials on an application by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) the group's biggest creditor. Sitting in private Justice Simon Bryan had given the freezing order to prevent the possible dissipation of assets among other reasons.

One year after the December 2 2020 judgment Dr B.R. Shetty and others are back in the UK court to strike out the $1 billion freezing order. They are also asking the court that the fraud claim hurled by the bank should be tried in the UAE and not England.

Dr Shetty thus joins Vijay Mallya and Pramod Mittal who are facing court proceedings by their creditors in London. Both Mallya and Mittal incidentally have been declared bankrupt by UK courts.

During the four-day virtual hearing which began on Monday (November 29 2021) before His Honour Judge Mark Pelling the counsels for Dr Shetty; famous UAE businessmen Khalifa al-Muhairi Butti (his wife Ameera al-Taweel was once married to Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Al Saud) and Saeed al-Qebaisi Butti who were principal shareholders and directors in NMC; and Prasanth Manghat former CEO and director made their submissions which gave a glimpse into a wider complex extensive and multi-dimensional legal battle ahead.

ADCB one of NMC’s biggest creditors alleges that through fraudulent misrepresentations and conspiracy it was induced to give $1 billion in six credit facilities.

Shetty – victim or perpetrator?

Interestingly Dr Shetty who is stuck in India is pursuing Bank of Baroda Ernst and Young Prasanth Manghat and his brother Promoth - who was also a senior executive in NMC Plc - in a New York court are claiming that he himself is a victim of fraud. In court proceedings in the UK Dr Shetty has taken a similar position that the guarantees that were given to ADCB in relation to him were forged.

Dr Shetty moved to the UAE from Karnataka in 1973. Here he established NMC Group which became one of the biggest healthcare providers in the region. NMC began from a humble clinic started by Dr Shetty himself a former medical representative and went on to being listed on the FTSE 100 Index.

But submissions before Judge Pelling were far removed from the laudatory remarks and the chest-thumping pride that Indian immigrants in the UAE once felt towards Dr Shetty and NMC. Before we come back to the proceedings heard by Judge Pelling it would be instructive to discuss in brief how a once much-revered group has now been reduced to facing allegations of epic-scale fraud.

The problems began in December 2019 when Muddy Waters a US-based firm that has scripted the fall of several companies by exposing frauds and mismanagement came out with a report on NMC Group. It ended its analysis noting: “We are unsure how deep the rot at NMC goes but we do not believe that its insiders or financials can be trusted.”

NMC share prices tumbled. Picking up on the red flags and discrepancies highlighted by Muddy Waters over the next few months it emerged that the NMC Group had between $4.357 billion and $5.352 billion of undisclosed debt much of which was allegedly pocketed by the principal shareholders and senior management.

In April 2020 NMC Plc. (which was incorporated in the UK in 2012) was placed in administration on the application of ADCB. Multiple cases had begun in several jurisdictions as befits a behemoth which had around 80 lenders and 200 hospitals/clinics spread over 19 countries. Dr Shetty also owned UAE Exchange the forex and money transfer service whose presence has become a marker of relative prosperity in cities and towns in the hinterland.

Legal proceeding in England

After listening to the extensive submissions by the counsels before Judge Pelling it won’t be wrong to say that the NMC Group’s woes were not due to any inherent weakness or unviable business model but due to perpetration of fraud. Who are the individuals or group of individuals responsible for the fraud and whether it can be decided in an English court lie at the heart of the proceedings.

Tim Penny QC and James Sheehan representing the two influential Emirati investors who it seems are like Dr Shetty adopting the position of being a victim of fraud told the court that the UAE is the proper forum for the case. Seeking to strike out the freezing order Sheehan told the court on Tuesday that the “bank (ADCB) has acted oppressively” in putting forward long overbearing requests in relation to asset disclosures.

Adam Zellick QC who represented Mangath also asserted that the “idea that conspiracy was made in England has no evidence” and also that his client has no assets in the UK. It also came out during his submission that the 19 million documents which the administrators appointed to various companies related to NMC Group are all in the UAE. “Every aspect of the case and the lending” happened in the UAE said Zellick.

Dr Shetty represented by Ruth den Besten QC denies any wrongdoing. The court heard from Besten that if there are failings they are “regulatory failings” and that there is “no serious issue to be tried against Dr Shetty”.

In making all these points reference was made to the long-drawn and bitter Essar-Mittal legal battle wherein an English judge ruled that ArcelorMittal would not get the $1.5 billion freezing order it sought. Unlike ArcelorMittal though ADCB was successful in getting a freezing order against NMC’s principal shareholders and key executives.

Attention was also drawn that the case in English courts would cost “many many times” more compared to the UAE court making the latter cost-effective.

The December 2020 freezing order

Adrian Beltrami QC representing ADCB made repeated references to the freezing order granted by Justice Simon Bryan. Describing NMC Plc as a company which was “rotten throughout by undisclosed debt” due to “falsification of its financial statement and concealment” he told the court that each of the defendants coordinated to deceive ADCB in the knowledge that it would cause loss to the bank.

It is not difficult to see why Beltrami kept referring to the judgment by Justice Bryan. In the 24-page judgment the judge agreed with the bank’s description of Dr Shetty as the “chief protagonist” in the dispute and that he was satisfied with the bank’s submission that Dr Shetty “could not have carried out the fraud without the knowledge and assistance of the other defendants”.

Beltrami told Judge Pelling that when NMC Plc was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2012 Dr Shetty had said it was specifically done to expand the company to new high growth markets and because of London’s deep pool of capital and global profile. In 2017 it was included in the FTSE 100 and in 2018 its market capitalisation reached $10 billion.

The London listing fundamental benefits of the English language global reach of the alleged fraud NMC board meetings in London risk of dissipation of assets and breach of English fiduciary duty were some of the issues cited by Beltrami to support the commencement of a trial in an English court and the continuation of the freezing order.

“Not much has changed since the matter was before Justice Bryan we submit his judgment is helpful” Beltrami told Judge Pelling. But the hearing before Justice Bryan was in private in the “interest of justice” to avoid the risk of alleged fraudsters being “tipped off”. The opposing lawyers did not fail to point out that the findings in Justice Bryan’s ruling were based on evidence that they had not seen and hence the parties should be discharged from the freezing order.

Judge Pelling however has the benefit of listening to all the parties and will deliver judgment in the New Year. That judgment will lay the grounds for continuing legal proceedings to dissect and come to the heart of the high-profile collapse of a once FTSE 100 company.",,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble is vacating its namesake Toronto office building.

The consumer goods company is downsizing from its 90000 sq ft office at 4711 Yonge Street. CBRE is marketing the concourse ground floor and second floor block at the Yonge and Sheppard tower which is owned by Menkes. P&G declined to comment on its move.

While pricing for the P&G office space was not available the asking net rent for the 15th floor is $21/sq ft on par with the average for the North Yonge submarket. Additional rent for the 23000 sq ft space is $23.61/sq ft. Suite 902 at 17000 sq ft asks the same.

As of the end of Q1 the office vacancy rate in the North York submarket was 24.7% higher than the Toronto North average of 19.3%.

The P&G block is available as of Feb 1 2025 and podium signage is offered. The space is being marketed towards life sciences companies and data centre operators. It offers 25 watts of power per sq ft.

Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.

Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year.

ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

The decline of America at the hands of the Left-wing “Progressives” and the Democrat Party is evident to observers at home and overseas.

The 22 November issue of the Wall Street Journal contained a perceptive critique of American education by Ms. Habi Zhang a Ph.D. candidate. The scholar wrote a letter to the editor contrasting the way young students in China and America are educated.

Young Chinese students are subjected to high academic standards rigorous homework and discipline. But her young child in America was taught “Woke” liberalism how bad America is absent challenging homework. The doctoral student feared for America’s future in any contest with Communist China. Ms. Zhang said “Woke” American schools and the government are emulating China by “limiting free expression” and “controlling thoughts.”

Zhang said Chinese students score at the top of mathematics and science tests while American students are taught identity politics and victimization. Zhang said Xi Ping the president of China and the schools and colleges teach “unity” and “national pride” and the Chinese people “no longer hide their enmity for America.”

American Thinker’s Dennis L. Weisman retired Kansas State University economics professor writes that the erosion of academic standards and Woke censorship in the liberal arts mathematics and science are racist in its premise that minority students cannot meet traditional standards; and reflects “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”

Left-wing Progressivism contains Marxist-Communist objectives as exhibited in columnist Ed Sherdlu’s coverage of the nomination of Soviet-trained Marxist Saule Omarova for Comptroller of the Currency in the Treasury Department. Omarova favors putting the Federal Reserve in charge of individual savings and checking accounts and wants to “bankrupt all the coal oil and gas companies.”

Columnist Ned Ryun of Alpha News argues that the Progressive Woke political movement would impose authoritarianism rule by the intellectual elites and the punishment and ostracism of dissenters. who dare question school board policies. This strategy is supported by the Left-wing media and the cancel culture social media.

The Deep State Ryun suggests applied those methods and objectives in their unsuccessful attempt to remove President Donald J. Trump from office.

Retired liberal arts professor Loyd Pettegrew a Townhall columnist adds the education establishment to the Woke movement to “fundamentally transform America aiming “to destroy America to save it.” Pettigrew contends “universities care less about educating students than taking their student loan money and firmly implanting their Marxist ideology.”

Pettegrew adds the American Medical Association to the WOKE list with its capitulation to gender and critical race theory politics.

As far as the threat to traditional America allegedly deliberately posed by Leftist extremists the Epoch Times published an early November assessment by former law student Keith Alber in a letter to the editor. Alber cited a political science text that listed the steps revolutionaries list to overthrow democratic governments:

Divide the nation into contentious ethnic groups (which historians call “Balkanization”); undermine trust in police authority; allow open borders and ignore federal immigration law; weaken military strength and unity; facilitate economic and civic unrest and street violence; corrupt the voting process and balloting; control the media narrative; and I would add challenge capitalism and the premise that America is a good decent and exceptional nation.

Historian Victor Davis Hanson noted in a recent Town Hall column that Americans are “losing confidence” in our government because of “woke policies institutional censorship and bias politicized federal health spokespersons the education establishment corporate executives law enforcement prosecution attorneys and top military leaders.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued violations on Friday to four companies affiliated with the warehouse and to Los Angeles County which is responsible for maintaining the Dominguez Channel.

The warehouse fire started on Sept. 30 and quickly burned through rubbing alcohol wipes that were stored in crates and pallets a Los Angeles County fire inspector told KTLA. Mark Pestrella director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works said in an interview on Sunday that the warehouse contained “large vats of ethanol” and “everything from hand wipes to bottles of hand sanitizer.”

The chemicals then passed into the sewage system the air quality district said and ultimately drained into the Dominguez Channel a flood-control waterway that runs more than 15 miles from Los Angeles International Airport to Los Angeles Harbor. This led to the decay of organic materials in the channel resulting in the emission of hydrogen sulfide gas that far exceeded the state’s nuisance standard the agency said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZmlyZS1zdGVuY2gtY2Fyc29uLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi_SAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9maXJlLXN0ZW5jaC1jYXJzb24tY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Large warehouse fire source of lingering stench in California town investigation finds,"An investigation into a nauseating stench that plagued Carson California for months found that a nearby fire released chemicals into a local channel creating the odor. Now Los Angeles County and four other companies are facing violations for their role in the incident the South Coast Air Quality Management District announced Friday.

On September 30 a large fire ignited at a warehouse in Carson that contained beauty and wellness products from the companies Virgin Scent Incorporated and ArtNaturals and Day to Day Imports Incorporated the investigation found. The fire lasted for multiple days.

Following the fire chemicals from the stored products including ethanol passed through the city's sewer system and into the Dominguez Channel causing elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide to be emitted into the air the investigation found. At one point the hydrogen sulfide levels in the local waterway were about 230 times higher than California's nuisance standard.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hydrogen sulfide gas is colorless has a strong odor of rotten eggs and can cause irritation to the eyes and respiratory system as well as coma convulsions dizziness headache and insomnia upon exposure. The gas is created by rotting plants and other materials in the water according to the Los Angeles County Public Works.

The two companies their parent company Prologis Incorporated Liberty Properties — the owner of the warehouse — and the county of Los Angeles are accused of causing a public nuisance that violates a section of California's Health and Safety Codes as well as a rule from the South Coast Air Quality Management District. The lingering stench cost the Los Angeles Department of Public Works an estimated $5.4 million to remedy.

Officials said they began receiving reports of foul odor in the city on October 3 and have since responded to more than 4600 complaints from residents throughout Los Angeles County.

One Carson resident said at one point the smell was so bad that they wore a face mask while inside of their own home CBS Los Angeles reported. Another said the fumes worsened their preexisting health conditions.

""I'm in remission from cancer so that makes it worse and I have asthma"" resident Hermel Rivera told CBS Los Angeles.

Thousands of impacted residents were relocated to hotels in surrounding cities due to the lingering odor and hundreds of air purifiers were distributed Carson Mayor Lula Davis-Holmes said. The mayor and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors each declared a local emergency for the stench in October.

The five notices of violations can result in civil penalties should the violators not establish measures that reduce emissions or prevent future violations regulators said.",,,,,,,,,

Given the backdrop of low interest rates regional insurers would do well to diversify into more private assets including private credit however experts say building professional on-the-ground teams and selecting asset managers could be a headache panelists said at the Insurance Investment Breakfast Briefing held by AsianInvestor on Friday December 3.

“Under the low interest rates it's very challenging from an insurers perspective because we know we still have to hit return targets"" Fanda Ho head of investments at Prudential Hong Kong told in the investment briefing.

""But as we can all see the US dollar fixed income market dominates so we will also look at other currencies for risk diversification. Also we should have more private credit assets in our portfolios for a greater illiquidity premium” she said.

“Dream-come-true assets are very hard to find but what we need to do is to balance all these different components” she said adding that there were now more private assets to choose from compared with previous years.

Indeed the market has been growing enabling asset owners plenty of choice when supplementing their private asset portfolios.

Assets under management of funds primarily involved in direct lending surged to $412 billion at end-2020—including nearly $150 billion in “dry powder” available to buy additional private debt assets—according to financial data provider Preqin.

This came as institutional investors with a fixed-income allocation including insurers pensions endowments and sovereign wealth funds have increasingly tapped directly or indirectly into the market.

Despite this asset owners are also facing two problems: how to select the right managers to lead the investment and how to build up on-the-ground teams in newly targeted markets.

""We have to look at the diversification through a few different lenses. Each of these asset classes has a very different risk profile underlying drivers of supply and demand and different levels of cyclicality or coalitions to the economic cycle” another panellist told the same session noting that selecting managers could be challenging as well.

“For manager selection diversification is quite important particularly because in the private credit space there's less history and it's less mature compared with private equity as an asset class” he added.

ASIA EXPOSURE

Gerald Posthuma CIO of Manulife said his firm had been leveraging more global talent in its Asia market as it aimed to penetrate further into the region.

“Our diversification is one of necessity in Asia. We found that at some point in time we were not able to support our liabilities from a local perspective so we started leveraging our US teams” Posthuma told the event.

He said that as far as global balance sheets were concerned probably about 20-30% of private credit was in the US and in Asia the figure stood at about 10% where there was greater scope to push into the region.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that Dominica’s gross domestic product (GDP) will get back to the percentage it was before the pandemic equating to five per cent (5%) growth per year within 2022 to 2026.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a “heavy toll” on Dominica’s economy.

The Washington-based financial institution has just completed a virtual Article IV Mission to the island.

IMF cited that the tourism sector supported by the ongoing construction of new hotels and the inauguration of direct flights from the United States from December 2021 would be the main contributor to this growth.

But the IMF noted that risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside citing that the insufficient vaccination rate vaccination hesitancy and the emerging new COVID-19 variants might be an obstacle to the economic growth of the island.

“Despite intense declines in tax revenue & rise in spending large CBI revenue led to a small reduction in the fiscal balance in the financial year 2020. However the expected public debt rose to 106 per cent of GDP in 2020 with higher official borrowing.”

The IMF added the financial sector has remained liquid and stable during the pandemic but NPLs are above prudential benchmarks.

“Despite an improvement relative to 2020 NPLs remain high in the range of 11-14 per cent of loans for banks and 10-17 per cent for credit unions (the prudential benchmark is five per cent in both sectors”.

Supported by the large public investment projects like housing roads healthcare and the international airport project IMF said that Dominica’s growth outlook is promising.

“All these projects would definitely stimulate growth in the near term during the construction phase and will also increase potential output in the long term including spillovers in tourism and reduction of fossil fuel dependency all of which improve Dominica’s external sustainability and competitiveness.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NjaGllZi5ldS9sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWFuZC1zdHJhdGVneS9tZWV0LWNlby1kZWJiaWUtY3Jvc2JpZS1sYW5kcy10b3Atam9iLW5hdGlvbndpZGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the CEO: Debbie Crosbie lands top job at Nationwide,"Seasoned banker and executive Debbie Crosbie has been tapped by Nationwide Building Society as its new CEO marking the first time the 175-year financial institution has been led by a woman.

Crosbie’s appointment at the helm of Britain’s biggest building society follows the hire of Alison Rose as CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland in 2019 which made her the first-ever woman to lead one of Britain’s biggest banks.

This isn’t the first time Crosbie has broken the glass ceiling however having been the first female executive to sign Scottish banknotes in 2015.

Crosbie 51 was selected by Nationwide’s board following a rigorous selection process and is set to take the helm of Nationwide the UK’s second-biggest mortgage lender in the UK in the first half of 2022.

She is set to replace Joe Garner CEO for six years who announced he was stepping down in September 2020. Under Garner Nationwide member numbers grew by two million to 16 million.

It’s certainly big banking boots to fill so what makes Crosbie the ideal candidate?

Why Crosbie is the right choice to lead Nationwide

For the last two decades Crosbie has held executive positions at some of the UK’s leading financial institutions namely at Clydesdale Yorkshire Banking Group (CYBG) later becoming Virgin Money and at challenger bank TSB.

In particular she has extensive experience in leading turnaround strategies and digital transformations. While COO and acting CEO of CYBG she led the preparation for the bank’s demerger from National Australia Bank and its subsequent IPO. She was also instrumental in the development of the bank’s new operating platform following its stock market debut and managed the migration of two million customers to the new entity.

More crucially she is credited with turning around troubled bank TSB after leading a comprehensive restructuring during her tenure as CEO. Joining in May 2019 in the wake of the bank’s IT meltdown Crosbie managed to successfully bring TSB back from the red.

Her three-year growth strategy to streamline the challenger bank’s operations led to investment in digital services and the cutting of costs by closing branches. Under her helm TSB reported a pre-tax profit of £110m this year compared to its £152m loss last year.

According to Kevin Parry incoming chairman of Nationwide Crosbie brings “significant banking experience combined with deep operational and technological knowledge” which he says are core skills needed to run a modern building society.

How did Debbie Crosbie get there?

Born and raised in Glasgow Crosbie studied industrial relations at the University of Strathclyde before cutting her financial teeth at Prudential on its graduate training programme.

She then joined Clydesdale Bank in 1997 as project manager and spent the next 22 years here rising to COO in 2015 and being appointed interim CEO of Clydesdale Bank prior to its demerger. In 2017 she was invited to provide evidence to Parliament’s inquiry into Women in the Workplace.

In 2018 Crosbie was poached by TSB beginning as CEO in May 2019 where she took the helm of the bank becoming one of the most senior women in UK banking.

She is a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Bankers and a member of the Glasgow Economic Leadership Forum and is vice-chair of the Scottish CBI.

Nationwide in strong position as Crosbie takes helm

As the new CEO Crosbie is tasked with leading the Society in its next phase of growth and will “work with its members and colleagues to make it the leading retail financial services provider in the UK” says Crosbie.

She does however join the building society at a time when it is in excellent health.

Not only have Nationwide member numbers grown by two million to 16 million over the last five years but the building society managed to double its profits to £853m in the six months to the end of September 2021.

“The growth in our membership coupled with our superior service and underpinned by our financial strength is a solid foundation to continue growing the Society and ensuring we are ready to meet the future needs of our members” says Nationwide chairman David Roberts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYmVybmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi9jb252ZXgtZXVyb3BlLXNhLXJlY2VpdmVzLWZjYS1wcmEtYXBwcm92YWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Convex Europe Receives FCA & PRA Approval,"Convex Group Limited announced that the UK branch of its recently established Luxembourg based European insurer Convex Europe SA [CES] has received approval from the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority effective immediately.

Previously there was no cost for inspection.

However with the privatisation of electrical inspection persons are now required to pay upwards of $25000 before their property can be certified.

Under the law premises must be inspected and certified by the Government before JPS connection.

On November 1 the Government transitioned to a new system where licensed electricians and private inspectors are now responsible for certification.

They are free to set their own fees.

The Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) spoke out against the new regime arguing that this is a new cost that customers must now pay in addition to the electricians' fees and the cost of house wiring.

The light and power company had called for the Government to regulate the fees and expand the pool of licensed electricians and inspectors certified to offer their services.

READ: JPS shocked by new mandatory inspection rates

But the energy ministry has pushed back against the proposal.

It argued that there needs to be an appreciation that a private electrical inspector operates in a market and as such the new regime relies on the market to determine the cost of inspections.

The Ministry highlighted that inspectors have to bear the cost for public liability insurance transportation communication and administrative expenses which must be factored in the costs to the consumer.

“The first response of Government ought not to be to limit or to restrict market forces but rather to focus on creating an environment that seeks to protect the interest of consumers” said a spokesperson in a statement.

“Establishing a fees schedule is just one option that is available to the Government which is usually frowned upon by businesses operating in a free market enterprise as the JPS may very well appreciate” the spokesperson added.

Meanwhile the energy ministry said it has re-issued a call for private electrical inspectors in an effort to increase the pool that is available to the public.

Noting that the privatisation of electrical inspections has introduced a new professional grouping it said that time may be required to reach an acceptable number of professionals who are qualified to carry out inspections based on the requirements of The Electricity (Electrical Work Registration and Licensing) Regulations 2020.

It noted that since November 1 twenty-nine private electrical inspectors have fully met the requirements to carry out inspections.

An additional 10 are seeking to secure public liability insurance to satisfy all of the requirements under the regulations.

A report tabled in Parliament shows that Kalenjins are 202 out of 351 permanent workers at the State agency representing a 58 percent share.

A report by Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu say the firm is in breach of the National Cohesion and Integration Act 2008 which bars a single community from occupying more than a third of employment positions in State-owned firms.

The report highlights struggles by the Public Service Commission to ensure that offices funded by taxpayers have a face of Kenya with all communities given an opportunity to serve.

The audit report currently before parliament further notes that during the year under review the KSC management recruited 16 new staff out of whom 11 (about 67 percent) were drawn from one ethnic community.

“The company has not adhered to the law” the audit report.

According to Public Service Commission (PSC) diversity policy all public service institutions will now be required to put in place measures to correct the ethnic imbalance.

Under the diversity policy for State ministries departments and agencies (MDAs) ethnic groups whose job representation surpasses their corresponding national population proportion are considered to be overrepresented.

The diversity policy was expected to tackle the problem of overrepresentation by setting hiring quotas for ethnic groups and disadvantaged classes such as the disabled.

The audit states that the composition of the company’s board violates the Mwongozo code of governance for state corporations.

The audit shows that of the 12 directors only one the company secretary was of female gender.

The Mwongozo guidelines require that the size and composition of the boards be diverse in gender competencies and skills for effective leadership of an organization.

His wife Chinna and he were inseparable and that may be the reason why they fell to Covid together - she didn’t recover but he also never did. Within months they are together again.

With Vinod an era in Indian journalism ends. An institution ends. Not many know that his distinct way of speaking as a host came from his days of theatre with Dr Sidhu who taught all of us - taka taka ke bolna. While Sidhu sahab was always on high pitch Vinod mastered the art of stressing on words and points by remaining low pitch yet firm. From playing Kalasidh in Indumati Satyadev in 1981 to being the “Janvaani” and always “Aap Ke Liye” anchor he was the nation’s voice for a long long time.

""I started out as a fast bowler and was selected for India's under-19 cricket World Cup team"" Harrdy Sandhu said of his passion for cricket. Unfortunately I injured my elbow during training and despite my best efforts to get it treated all efforts were in vain. Then I went to Australia on a student visa to figure out my next chapter in life and settle down. When nothing seemed to be working out I began driving taxis to make ends meet.""

Harrdy Sandhu is known for his amazing Punjabi hits like ‘Naah’ Kya Baat Ay Horn Blow and many more. He states that he got a break for his song ‘Soch’ in 2013.

""In February 2019 I was only in Chandigarh for a day and I randomly got a call from Ammy Virk (he was one of the first few actors to be confirmed for '83') saying 'Come down to the restaurant of your building I have to make you meet someone"" Harrdy Sandhu explained.

That's how I first met Kabir Khan sir and Balwinder Sandhu ji. We discussed how '83 is shaping up and they asked if I could imitate Madan Lal ji's bowling motion. Madan Lal ji who was also a fast bowler had coached me at an NCB camp so I thought I could do it.""

""I practiced a lot and sent them a video of myself bowling as Madan Lal Ji but I didn't hear back for a long time."" One fine day I received word from my team that they admired the dexterity with which I pulled it off and that's how I ended up as a member of '83.' ""I'm overjoyed that it's finally happening after so many delays!"" Harrdy stated.

83' is a sports drama directed by Kabir Khan based on the Indian cricket team's historic World Cup victory in 1983. Ranveer Singh Ammy Virk Tahir Raj Bhasin Jiiva Saqib Saleem Jatin Sarna Deepika Padukone Harrdy Sandhu and other actors appear in the film. On December 24 it will be released in theatres.",,,

The acquisition of the property by the Korean pension organisation which has some $778 billion in assets under management is its second major investment in London in the last three months and its third major buy globally within the same interval after the NPS committed to a $2.5 billion San Francisco project in October.

The NPS-LaSalle offer won out over competing bids by Abu Dhabi sovereign fund Mubadala Investment Company and mainland billionaire Du Shuanghua’s Bright Ruby Resources to win the rights to the 700000 square foot (65032 square metre) complex in the Bishopsgate Without area of the City of London according to a report in the UK’s Estates Gazette.

The deal comes as a boom in London office investments is bringing Asian capital flocking to the city with Singapore’s Sun Venture said last week to be buying a freehold asset from WeWork and Hong Kong’s Kerry Properties having snatched up a West End office block for $199 million in September.

CK Asset Finds an Exit

The property developer controlled by Hong Kong’s richest man Li Ka-shing had reportedly been looking for a buyer for 5 Broadgate since June of this year with CK Asset said at the time to have set a minimum price of £1 billion for the six-year-old property.

Sometimes referred to as a “groundscraper” the 13-storey building which includes 12 office floors is leased to UBS through at least 2035 and forms part of the 4.7 million square foot Broadgate commercial complex developed by LSE-listed British Land.

CK Asset had acquired the property which was built to suit for UBS from British Land and GIC for £1 billion in June 2018. At the reported compensation the developer is receiving approximately £1786 per square foot for 5 Broadgate.

The Hong Kong-listed developer has yet to make a statement on the reported sale and inquiries by Mingtiandi remained unanswered at the time of publication. Colliers International had represented CK Asset in the sale.

Korean Shopping Spree

The NPS was a primary contributor to what property agency Savills referred to as a record-breaking September for the investment market in the City of London when the Korean fund’s partnership with Hines and local player Lipton Rogers Developments agreed to pay approximately £200 million for a site at 18 Blackfriars Road in the financial district.

That investment which gives the new owners rights to an already-approved project including a 32-storey office tower a 53-storey residential structure and a 324-key hotel helped bring total transactions in the district that month to over £1 billion. For the first three quarters of 2021 Savills reported £5.35 billion in investment in the City of London which is 14 percent above the five-year average for the district during the period.

During the same month that it committed to the London deal with Hines the NPS also teamed up with the Houston-based developer and fund manager to announce a $2.5 billion redevelopment project for the Pacific Gas & Electric Company campus in San Francisco’s South Financial district.

In July the NPS agreed to pay $900 million to acquire Lendlease’s Melbourne Quarter Tower in the capital of Australia’s Victoria state for $900 million.

The NPS also has some history working with LaSalle after the Chicago-based fund manager purchased Goldman Sachs’s European headquarters at Plumtree Court in the City of London on the Korean fund’s behalf in 2018. Media reports at the time indicated that Goldman Sachs received £1.2 billion for the property which it continues to occupy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8va2V2c2Jlc3QuY29tL2Jlc3Qtc3RvcmFnZS1pbi1sYXMtdmVnYXMtbnYv0gEyaHR0cHM6Ly9rZXZzYmVzdC5jb20vYmVzdC1zdG9yYWdlLWluLWxhcy12ZWdhcy1udi8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Best Storage in Las Vegas NV,"Below is a list of the top and leading Storage in Las Vegas.

This new processor comes with a CPU/GPU architecture upgrade and its performance runs into millions on AnTuTu. However the company took a different path from its regular naming scheme. The predecessor of this chip is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC. However this new chip uses the name Snapdragon 8 Gen1.

The previous numbers appear to be straightforward simple and easy to remember. These chips can be easily distinguished by numbers. For example the Snapdragon 8 is better than the Snapdragon 7 series and the Snapdragon 888 is better than the Snapdragon 870 and so on. However why did Qualcomm change the name of its flagship processor?.

Don McGuire senior vice president and chief marketing officer of Qualcomm explained the name change. According to him the number naming is no longer used purely because there are not enough numbers. Last year it was Snapdragon 888. If you continue to use numbers only Snapdragon 899 will be available.

Gizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram

Don McGuire explained that in the Chinese market Qualcomm did not add the company name at the beginning but directly promoted the Snapdragon brand. The current name change is the first time it has been used globally.

According to Qualcomm’s research many people know Snapdragon but don’t know the word Qualcomm. Therefore the company’s name is actually negatively affected by the combination of Qualcomm + Snapdragon as the brand. Thus it will remove the Qualcomm name and will only promote the Snapdragon brand will in the future.

Snapdragon 8 Gen1 technical specs

The CPU of this chip comes with a three-cluster design (1+3+4) and the main core is an ARM Cortex-X2 core with a 3.0 GHz clock speed. There are also three “supporting” performance cores based on the newer ARM Cortex-A710 standard. Those will run at 2.5 GHz. Finally we have four efficiency cores that will also sport the new ARM Cortex-A510 standard running at 1.8 GHz. Overall the new CPU will reduce power consumption by up to 30 percent. That certainly is a significant upgrade.

Furthermore this new processor comes with an Adreno 730 GPU with a 30% performance boost and up to 25 power-saving thanks to its new architecture. Qualcomm developed three Elite Gaming features one of which will allow developers to strike a balance between performance and power efficiency.

Furthermore the Snapdragon 8 Gen1 brings an integrated X65 5G modem. It offers support for both sub-6 and mmWave operations. It can deliver theoretical peak speeds of 10 Gbps. For the first time it also supports carrier aggregation for the uplink. Local connectivity enjoys Wi-Fi 6 and 6E support plus improvements to Bluetooth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvdC1tb2JpbGUtNWctbmV0d29yay1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTgtbW9kZW0tc2Ftc3VuZy1zMjJfaWQxMzY4ODfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile is ready for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 5G modem in Samsung's S22,"







T-Mobile will be able to take advantage of the Qualcomm X65's three-carrier 5G aggregation in several different ways. The carrier has more than 100MHz of mid-band 5G spectrum in a lot of places and in those places it needs 3xCA to do two 100MHz mid-band channels plus a low-band channel for uplink/better range. There are also some cities (like New York) where its mid-band allocation is split in half and can be used like two separate bands. So X65 phones (such as the Galaxy S22) should bring considerable performance improvements on T-Mobile's mid-band.

3.45-to-3.55GHz spectrum which is in the middle of being auctioned should clear in some places by the end of 2022. This means that AT&T and whoever else buys that spectrum will potentially see a considerable boost in C-band performance specifically when used with those X65 modems next year over and above the initial C-band launches.





As far as Verizon's vaunted mmWave 5G is concerned it is now just a few candles on T-Mobile's ""5G layer cake"" instead of a full layer as you can see in the picture from Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit and it is not clear if T-Mobile is just trolling  or it genuinely has given up on the speeds of mmWave.





It is after all the only 5G tech theoretically able to deliver the 10Gbps speeds that Qualcomm's new X65 modem is rated at provided that your network can supply such speeds of course. The mmWave networks are very bad at range and building penetration though so they make more sense at specific crowded places like stadiums just what Verizon has been doing with its NFL 5G contract





The other question is whether you would need 10 Gigabit 5G speeds on your phone in the foreseeable future at all. For instance even 8K streaming video chat wouldn't need as much bandwidth; despite that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 now supports it T-Mobile's execs mentioned in the interview that their top 5G plan called Magenta Max will keep maxing out at 4K streaming and that has nothing to do with deprioritization.





In any case it looks like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor will not only have the more advanced 4nm production node amongst mobile chipset but it is also scoring the best 5G modem of the company that does 5G modems best - Qualcomm. The Galaxy S22 series is shaping up to be at the forefront of 5G connectivity as has become customary for Samsung's flagship phones that usually beat iPhones to the punch in that regard. The iPhone 13 models after all have to make do with Qualcomm's current generation X60 modem and even then the latest iPhones get beat by Samsung's Galaxy phones





With the Galaxy S22 models that can take advantage of the Qualcomm X65 modem's three-carrier 5G aggregation as soon as T-Mobile Verizon and AT&T start enabling the technology on their next-gen networks the 5G connectivity gap between Apple and Samsung is only poised to grow wider and Samsung will have the definite advantage at least until the iPhone 14 rolls off the conveyor belts.

T-Mobile's dynamic duo over at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Tech Summit in Hawaii - VP of product engineering Ryan Sullivan and SVP of tech strategy Karri Kuoppamaki - have sat down for another interview further detailing the Un-carrier's 5G plans",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL3NuYXBkcmFnb24tOC1nZW4tMS12cy1kaW1lbnNpdHktOTAwMC0zMDY4ODM4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 vs Dimensity 9000: Battle of the arch-rivals,"Qualcomm

Qualcomm has just announced the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 the successor to the Snapdragon 888 series processors that powered many flagship Android phones in 2021. The new processor is expected to be adopted by loads of premium flagships next year but it isn’t the only brand-new high-end SoC available for Android brands.

MediaTek is joining the party as well as the newly announced Dimensity 9000 is being positioned as a full-blown premium flagship SoC. But is this wishful thinking on MediaTek’s part or is Qualcomm in for a fight next year? Here’s how the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and Dimensity 9000 compare in terms of specs and features.

CPU/GPU

When it comes to the all-important CPU category both MediaTek and Qualcomm are offering a very similar proposition. Both firms are offering a single Cortex-X2 CPU core for heavy tasks three Cortex-A710 cores for medium activities and four Cortex-A510 cores for lightweight tasks. The most visible difference here is clock speed with the Dimensity 9000 enjoying a slight advantage in terms of the X2 and Cortex-A710 clocks.

Meanwhile the MediaTek chipset also sees a big increase in cache size over its predecessor and the Snapdragon 888 with 8MB of L3 cache and 6MB of system-level cache (SLC) on offer. Qualcomm offers a smaller 6MB L3 cache and 4MB SLC. Its power-efficient Cortex A510 cores also share their L2 cache between two cores while the equivalent cores in the Dimensity 9000 have their own private 256KB L2. Combined with higher clock speeds the Dimensity 9000 may be a marginally faster chip in some scenarios.

Both chipsets use the latest Armv9 CPU cores in a 1+3+4 arrangement but there are subtle differences.

Switching to the graphical side of things Qualcomm has traditionally enjoyed an advantage over MediaTek in this regard. The Snapdragon maker is sticking to Adreno graphics once again (ditching a model number from now on) promising 30% faster graphical rendering and 25% efficiency over the Snapdragon 888 series.

MediaTek on the other hand is using an Arm Mali-G710 MC10 GPU. It’s claiming a 35% performance boost over the Snapdragon 888 as well as huge efficiency gains of 60%. This certainly sounds like the Dimensity 9000 will be extremely competitive with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 at first glance especially when it comes to sustainable performance.

Qualcomm’s latest GPU also offers a variety of features such as improved variable-rate shading Unreal Engine 5 support and volumetric rendering. MediaTek’s processor on the other hand supports software-based ray tracing via Vulkan for Android. More reading: Everything you need to know about smartphone chipsets

One notable way we’re seeing GPUs being used is to drive higher refresh rates and Qualcomm has an impressive figure here. The 2022 Snapdragon chip touts a 144Hz refresh rate at QHD+ resolution while MediaTek hasn’t disclosed a refresh rate at this resolution. It has however claimed a cool 180Hz at FHD+ resolutions.

Finally the Dimensity 9000 sports LPDDR5X RAM support versus LPDDR5 in the Qualcomm processor. That means a marginally faster peak RAM clock speed of 3750MHz versus Qualcomm’s 3200MHz resulting in a bandwidth comparison of 60Gbps and 51.2Gbps respectively. Although we’ll have to see if any commercial devices end up using this more expensive and marginally lower power RAM.

Imaging smarts and video

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

A key differentiating factor these days between high-end chipsets is camera capabilities and performance and both companies are bringing some impressive credentials to the table here.

An interesting tidbit is that Qualcomm touts a 3.2 gigapixel per second speed for its image signal processor (ISP) compared to MediaTek’s ISP topping out at nine gigapixels per second. It does make you wonder whether gigapixels per second is becoming a marketing measurement as we’ve seen with AI benchmarks (e.g. TOPS). But what are these ISPs capable of in the first place?

Starting with the Qualcomm chip’s photo capabilities the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 offers support for 200MP images 64MP+36MP dual cameras and 36MP triple camera support (36MP+36MP+36MP). Switching to video it offers 8K/30fps HDR recording as its main upgrade this year. That’s the first major 8K recording upgrade we’ve seen on mobile since the quality option was first introduced. Other notable features here include 4K/120fps recording and 960fps slow-mo at 720p.

MediaTek has made big strides in the camera field but Qualcomm has raised its game too.

Qualcomm is also touting a host of other features here such as double the number of burst mode shots (240 12MP shots) and 30 frames of multi-frame image processing (up from six). The latter should result in improved night mode and/or HDR capture. There’s also chromatic aberration correction for ultra-wide cameras a bokeh engine for 4K video capture and video super-resolution.

MediaTek’s Dimensity 9000 on the other hand supports a single 320MP camera and 32MP triple camera support. It also brings 8K recording to MediaTek’s portfolio for the first time (8K/24fps) but lacks HDR at this resolution.

The new chipset also offers 4K three-exposure video HDR and three simultaneous 4K HDR video streams. MediaTek didn’t disclose much more regarding the chipset’s camera features but the previous-generation Dimensity 1200 also offered features like AI Panorama Night Shot multi-person video bokeh video noise reduction and AI-based auto-exposure/autofocus/auto white balance. So we’re guessing most of these features are available on the new chipset too.

Machine learning Machine learning is a major part of pretty much all phones on the market today being used for tasks like computer vision photography performance and more. And both flagship processors bring the heat here as far as dedicated silicon is concerned.

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 brings an upgraded Hexagon processor and Hexagon Tensor Accelerator. Qualcomm touts four times faster machine learning performance than the previous generation as well as a Tensor Accelerator that’s twice as fast.

Interestingly the chipset’s always-on sensing hub now has an additional imaging chip capable of face detection (but not authentication). Qualcomm tells Android Authority that it can detect faces while the phone is asleep without “any material change” to battery life. Explained: The difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence

MediaTek’s Dimensity 9000 is pretty capable on the machine learning side of things too. It now offers a fifth-generation APU being a hexa-core design consisting of four high-power cores and two low-power cores. What does this mean for actual improvements though? Well the company says you can expect a 400% performance boost and a 400% efficiency gain over the Dimensity 1200.

It’s difficult to get a handle on which chipset offers better machine learning credentials owing to the wide variety of tasks that use ML capabilities in the first place. But both processors seem to offer top-notch features in this regard.

5G and other connectivity

Supplied by MediaTek

It goes without saying that both MediaTek and Qualcomm’s new flagship processors offer 5G connectivity. Both chipsets support sub-6GHz 5G connectivity but only the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 offers mmWave support. This 5G standard is mainly restricted to the US but it’s a notable omission nonetheless.

The Snapdragon chipset also tops out at 10Gbps downlink speeds compared to the MediaTek SoC’s 7Gbps speeds. Of course you’re not going to see these maximum speeds on any device but mmWave support means the Snapdragon SoC should be faster where coverage is available.

Both the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and Dimensity 9000 support Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 6 too while the MediaTek chipset supports Bluetooth 5.3 and the Snapdragon SoC offers Bluetooth 5.2. Bluetooth 5.3 isn’t a huge upgrade but still brings better power efficiency improved reliability and tougher security.

Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 vs Dimensity 9000 — which is better?

Qualcomm

It’s tough to judge which processor will reign supreme when there aren’t any real-world devices to test just yet. So we’ll have to wait until then for a definitive verdict. In saying so it seems like the two chips are on similar ground in terms of CPU power. We’re not sure which chipset will be better in terms of graphical power either but we can say that Qualcomm offers a wider variety of features.

Then there’s the question of sustained performance as both Qualcomm and MediaTek claim to be prioritizing sustained power over peak power. Again we’ll need to wait for real-world devices to put these claims to the test. See also: Leak says Dimensity 9000 could be cheaper than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1

There’s ultimately only one major confirmed loss for MediaTek right now (mmWave) while 8K HDR recording is another notable advantage Qualcomm has over the Taiwanese company. But MediaTek has a few confirmed advantages too such as support for newer Bluetooth and RAM standards as well as AV1 decode support.

Either way it looks like this is the closest the two companies’ flagship offerings have been in years. And that can only be a good thing for consumers. 2022 can’t come soon enough. Which one is looking like the better chipset to you? Let us know via the poll below.

The company is behind some of the best games and consoles ever made.

Most recently this has been highlighted by the Nintendo Switch which at launch was one of the best and most innovative consoles ever seen.

Though it wasn’t a powerhouse technically the custom portable form factor motion controls and docking system were revolutionary at the time. This plus stellar early games like Zelda Breath of the Wild led to strong sales for the first few years of its life.

But recently there’s no denying the Nintendo Switch has begun to feel a little stale. On the one hand this is because outside of Metroid Dread I’ve not seen a lot of exclusive games I’d actually like to play on the Switch this year.

For me this is just a symptom of a wider problem with Nintendo’s current strategy: it doesn’t seem to care one bit about competing on a hardware level.

This was showcased most recently when after months of speculation Qualcomm revealed it is indeed going to release a gaming focussed chip for use in Switch-style games consoles the Snapdragon G3x. What’s more it has already come up with a concept device running the chip that was built in partnership with gaming powerhouse Razer.

I’m not going to pretend the concept is terribly exciting. It actually looks a lot like a Razer Kishi with a smartphone soldered in but the idea behind it is excellent. To catch you up the Snapdragon G3x isn’t attempting to take on Intel Core or AMD Ryzen chips like the ones seen in the Dell Concept UFO or the Valve Steam Deck. It’s targeting the cloud gaming market.

From what we heard at the briefing it will be able to run “most” games in 1080p at 144Hz which isn’t to be sniffed at – though until we get a list of titles and what graphics settings Qualcomm’s referring to gauging quite how impressive this is will be tricky.

Instead it’s the chip’s Wi-Fi 6E and 5G mmWave hardware that interests me. Qualcomm spent a lot of the chip’s reveal showing off its Game Pass GeForce Now and Stadia support claiming it will power a fresh wave of portable consoles. This plus the Razer Concept’s ability to output to an external display via USB-C in 4K scream’s affordable Switch rival.

Yes the Steam Deck and Dell Concept UFO have shown similar features before the Razer Concept but for me there’s a crucial difference. Both of these devices have focussed on having powerful internal components and the ability to play games locally.

This is a key reason the 512GB Steam Deck retails for £569 – you can get a 64GB version for £349 and 256GB for £459 but considering how big PC games are these days these will run out of space fairly fast based on our experience. Every version of the Steam Deck is more expensive than the flagship Nintendo Switch OLED which released this year.

Considering how common key gaming features like high refresh rate panels are becoming on the mid-tier segment of the mobile market there’s no reason the devices running Qualcomm’s new chip couldn’t be competitively priced.

If Qualcomm can position its supposedly Android-powered portable consoles as streaming stations with low £200-300 and below RRPs this could make them a much more compelling option especially if the services come bundled with subscriptions to Game Pass Stadia or GeForce Now.

Given my experience using the Razer Kishi mobile controller dock and a Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus to play games via GeForce Now over the past year and a half I can definitely see the appeal of a device like the new Razer Concept.

Which is why for me if it wants to compete Nintendo needs to do a lot better in 2022 if it wants the Switch to retain its place as my portable console of choice."
DGX,Quest Diagnostics,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vc29rb3Rvcy1uZXctZGlhZ25vc3RpYy1jZW50cmUtYW5zd2Vycy1xdWVzdC1mb3ItbWVkaWNhbC10b3VyaXNtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sokoto’s new diagnostic centre answers quest for medical tourism,"Each month 5000 Nigerians travel abroad seeking medical attention. This amounts to expenses totalling $1b annually. However a recent update indicates that Nigerians spend $3b each year in India alone on medical tourism. While abroad they not only pay for medical attention they are accommodated in hotels and purchase meals from restaurants in addition to other payments such as transport and contingencies. In most cases many have to return to the foreign hospital for additional check-ups. In sum the huge population gives a boost not only to the medical institutions but to the travel and hospitality sector in those countries. They help to build foreign economies and this has been going on for many years. One curious detail deserves mention here: In the 1970s the Saudi Royal family used to frequent the University of Ibadan in Oyo state for medical attention. This sounds like a long time ago.

The wheel has come full circle and things are changing. Effort is now on to provide first class service locally and to redirect the population of Nigerians which has been moving outwards. A multibillion Naira medical diagnostic centre was commissioned in Sokoto on Wednesday December 1 by Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa Governor of Delta state assisted by Governor Aminu Tambuwal Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar III the Sultan of Sokoto and other government dignitaries as well as officials of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA).

Located along the airport road the N3.2billion centre is poised to halt the movement abroad by many Nigerians seeking medical attention in countries such as India UK USA Saudi Arabia and Germany. A teaching hospital is also under construction within the same axis of Sokoto which means that the airport area of the ancient city will become a medical hub of sorts as the years pass. The diagnostic centre will cater to patients from Nigeria. It will also have regional significance as it will cater for nationals from the republics of Benin and Niger. The combined effect of these –with massive impact on transport hospitality and health sectors etc –will give uplift to the internally generated revenue (IGR) of Sokoto a few years down the line.

“A staggering number of Nigerians seek health care services abroad it has been reported that 5000 Nigerians travel overseas for medical treatment monthly with an estimated bill of over $1billion annually. This has been as a result of non-availability of advanced health care technology in our health facilities” states Dr. Ali Inname Commissioner for Health Sokoto state in a press release issued ahead of the commissioning.

Speaking during the event proper which was gently bathed by the early evening sunshine Inname stressed that the commissioning is an “important milestone in our determination to positively transform the lives of our people in all facets of human endeavour.” He adds that the centre will reduce the suffering of patients that have to travel abroad in search of reliable diagnostic services.

In an earlier communication Inname stressed “There are 860 public and private health facilities in Sokoto state. For this number of health facilities to provide effective services for a population of 5 million in the state they must adopt advanced technologies that are used globally.” He draws attention to the fact that the facility is world-class and a milestone in the history of medical diagnosis in Nigeria.

The Sultan of Sokoto Ahaji Sa’ad Abubakar III gives a background to how the idea of the diagnostic centre emerged. His words “A few years ago I hinted to the Governor of Sokoto state on the need for us to have a centre of excellence to take care of our numerous health challenges in this part of the country and the need to have a synergy between the Sokoto Kebbi and Zamfara governments.” He explained that the centre will help the people and stop the lengthy trips to foreign countries for medical diagnosis.

The Sultan gives a suggestion on how the hospital could help the poor and vulnerable who may not be able to afford the fees. His words “I propose a big basket managed by reputable Nigerians so that somebody who has no money to bring him to the centre can be given prompt attention without paying because somebody else had paid for him.”

The facility with state of the art medical equipment has a Radiology Unit Laboratory Unit Out-Patient Clinics Dental Unit and ENT Unit. It will offer a variety of services including medical investigations Radiological Investigations and Laboratory Investigations. It also has extensive capacity for MRI CT scan Fluoroscopy Digital X-ray Mammography Chemical pathology Histopathology Microbiology and Hematology.

Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa himself a medical doctor commissioned the centre and was full of praise for Governor Aminu Tambuwal. According to Okawa the centre is a “project for the people and a project that the people will cherish long after you have left the government as Governor. You have always believed in your people and the people of Nigeria.” He too makes a point about access to the hospital by the poor and the vulnerable. Hear him: “There are some of our people that may not be able to afford the services here so there is the need for us to think of how to ensure that none is left behind if they require the services of this centre.”

The centre which saw N824 million spent on construction and N2.4 billion expended on equipping the project has provision for ECG Echocardiography and Vascular Doppler Gastrology Endoscopy Neurology and EEG. Meanwhile Medical Consultants medical officers laboratory scientists/technicians nurses and other personnel required for the smooth running of the centre are being hired.

Governor Aminu Tambuwal recalls that the diagnostic centre is a product of his regular consultations with the Sultan of Sokoto. On support to the vulnerable who may need to access the hospital he states “We will come up with a fund where government will contribute members of the business community and well-meaning Nigerians can contribute to subsidise the services that are going to be rendered to indigent people at the centre.”

In a few remarks Tambuwal points out “I encourage all of us to leave out politics after elections and concentrate on providing good governance to our people because that is what our people are yearning for and asking for.” He states that before long the hospital will generate revenue not only for itself but to Sokoto state as well.

The Sokoto state government designed constructed and equipped the new Advanced Medical Diagnostics Centre to provide high-quality cutting edge medical diagnostics services available to any other place in the world. This is another giant project out of Sokoto which was carefully prepared with hardly a mention in the media during its years of construction.

Dr. Inname concludes “The overall objective here is to provide healthcare services for our people and make Sokoto a hub for medical tourism so the services provided by the centre are designed in such a way that they are affordable to the people.” For efficiency the centre will be managed by Healthfield Medical Services Ltd through a public-private partnership model.",,,,,,,,,,,,

And though many designers have the air of bohemian artists who would squander their fortune immediately some have proven to be quite astute entrepreneurs. The following is a list of those who have been the most successful earning billions from their creations:

8.9.10. Sara Blakely – $1 Billion

Fashion isn’t all about eccentric highly creative designers and their elegant or flamboyant collections. Sometimes it’s all about having an idea and solving a problem – which is how Sara Blakely began her journey to becoming the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire.

At 29 she had a job selling fax machines door-to-door and wasn’t satisfied with the pantyhose she was wearing – so she decided to create something better. With no formal education regarding patents advertising or business Blakely managed to create a hosiery empire based solely on the quality of her products even earning an endorsement from Oprah along the way. Despite the company’s huge growth the Georgia native intends to keep Spanx private an approach which seems to have paid off thus far.

8.9.10. Tory Burch – $1 Billion

Born into a wealthy family Tory Burch had a much smoother career development than other fashion industry billionaires. After graduation from the University of Pennsylvania (where she majored in art history) Burch moved to New York where she worked for the likes of Vera Wang and Polo Ralph Lauren.

She finally launched her own brand in 2004 and enjoyed immediate success (an endorsement from Oprah certainly helped as well!). Now a billionaire and a philanthropist Burch was named the 79th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes in 2014.

8.9.10. Michael Kors – $1 Billion

Born in Long Island New York to a former model Michael Kors was exposed to the world of fashion from an early age. As early as ten he designed clothes and sold them from his parent’s basement and at eighteen he enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. Like other very successful designers (see below!) he quit after short afterwards and decided to rely on his talent and flair instead.

He initially sold his designs from a small boutique across from Bergdorf Goodman on 57th Street before catching the eye of the luxury department store’s fashion director. It hasn’t been a smooth run for Kors who went bankrupt in 1993 but he has subsequently bounced back and is now one of the world’s few billionaire designers.

7. Aerin Lauder – $1.3 Billion

This heiress to the Estée Lauder fortune wasn’t content to just live of the wealth brought in by the company her grandparents founded. Nor did she wish to just help run the business as a board member like other in her family. Instead Aerin Lauder is the company’s image and style director and has also launched her own brand (called Aerin) which makes cosmetics perfume accessories jewelry shoes and clothing.

Like Tory Burch another acclaimed female designer on our list who went to the University of Pennsylvania Lauder studied at Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania which interestingly enough makes the Ivy League school very well-represented in the world of fashion.

5.6. Domenico Dolce – $1.6 Billion

Sicilian-born Domenico Dolce is the elder half of one of the biggest and most acclaimed partnerships in the world of fashion: Dolce & Gabbana. Like many other industry mavens Dolce dropped out of design school after realizing he wasn’t learning anything he didn’t already know. Seeing how things turned out he certainly wasn’t wrong!

In 1980 while he was working in Milan as a designer’s assistant he met Stefano Gabbana and subsequently established a partnership which would prove extremely lucrative. Their company has created clothing and costumes for artists like Madonna or Kylie Minogue and for movies like Romeo + Juliet (starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes).

5.6. Stefano Gabbana – $1.6 Billion

The second half of Dolce & Gabbana Milan-born Stefano Gabbana was introduced to the trade by Domenico Dolce after the two met in a club.

The pair unveiled their first collection in 1985 but the brand really took off during the early 90s thanks in part to a partnership with Madonna. Dolce and Gabbana’s innovative flamboyant designs have been described as capturing the essence of the 2000s.

4. Renzo Rosso – $3.1 Billion

Born in Veneto a northeastern Italian province and thus far away from the global fashion capital that is Milan Renzo Rosso’s fortune is connected to the alternative – jeans. His flagship brand Diesel got its name partly because diesel was seen as an alternative fuel during the 1970s oil crisis when the company was established.

Nowadays Rosso is about much more than just denim and owns multiple small high-end fashion houses including Marni or Viktor & Rolf through his holding company OTB (Only The Brave) Group.

3. Miuccia Prada – $4.2 Billion

The youngest granddaughter of Mario Prada founder of the eponymous Italian company Miuccia Prada took over the company in 1978 overseeing its development into a globally acclaimed fashion label.

A big part of her and her brand’s success was her partnership with Patrizio Bertelli who oversees most of the business-related aspects allowing Prada to concentrate on the creative side of things. An astute entrepreneur in her own right Miuccia Prada also created her own label called Miu Miu aimed at people with a taste for the avant-garde and sophisticated new trends.

2. Ralph Lauren – $6.9 Billion

Born in The Bronx New York City Ralph Lauren dreamt of becoming a millionaire from a young age. However he started really small selling ties he made himself to his classmates something he went on to do in his mid-20s while working as a salesman for a tie company. His European-style design eventually caught the eye of Neiman Marcus with the luxury department store becoming Lauren’s first major client.

Soon afterwards in 1967 the designer founded his own company called Polo Ralph Lauren which is now a fashion industry powerhouse with revenue amounting to $7.5 billion in 2014. Lauren himself is worth $7 billion so it’s safe to say his ambitions have been fulfilled.

1. Giorgio Armani – $7.5 Billion

Founded by Giorgio Armani in 1975 the Italian label is nowadays a global powerhouse while the designer’s last name is basically synonymous with fashion.

Initially a medical student who spent some time with the army Armani then went on to work in a Milan department store initially as a window dresser and then as a seller. This experience at the bottom of the industry proved to be very valuable as the talent was clearly there and was quickly recognized as soon as he started working as a designer at first at Nino Cerruti then as a freelancer and finally for his own company. Today Armani heads a fashion empire worth about $8.5 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtaW5nb25waG9uZS5jb20vbmV3cy96ZXBldG8tYmFncy1hLTE1MC1taWxsaW9uLWludmVzdG1lbnQtZnJvbS1zb2Z0LWJhbmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Social gaming platform Zepeto bags a $150 million investment from Soft Bank after rediscovering metaverse,"Zepeto the popular metaverse platform from South Korea recently landed a jackpot $150 million investment from Soft Bank a Japanese multinational conglomerate holding company.

According to Naver’s estimates 70% of the users on Zepeto are said to be females between the age of 13 to 24. Recognizing this the application has launched a large number of fashion clothing and makeup items. These aren’t just any normal items. Many of the items are works by luxury brands such as Gucci Ralph Lauren and more. Additionally the metaverse platform also features celebrity clothing giving its audience the chance to cosplay as some of their favorite celebrity figures. Zepeto has gone as far as organizing fan meetings to give its users a chance to meet with some of their idols.

The Nittany Lions will play the Arkansas Razorbacks for the first time ever. The game kicks off at noon on New Year's Day in Raymond James Stadium.

The bowl will be seen as a jumping off point for the 2022 season which should feature dynamic change. The Lions will break in a new defensive coordinator probably a new quarterback and may rely on big contributions from arguably James Franklin's top recruiting class ever.

First though the Lions will hope to improve on their worst bowl season record under Franklin since the team lost their final four to finish 7-6 in 2015.

Heading into the week Penn State seemed most likely to land in bowl games in Las Vegas New York City (Pinstripe) or Nashville (Music City). Their New Year's Day hopes seemed to be ruined by two losses in the final three games — narrow defeats to Michigan and Michigan State.

No. 1 problem:Penn State James Franklin letting you down? It all comes back to one thing ...

Senior decisions:Which Penn State seniors will return in 2022?

But Outback Bowl officials viewed the Nittany Lions as the best option to be had even over others with better records — Wisconsin Purdue and Minnesota. The Lions have not played in the game since the 2010 season and always boast a stellar bowl game travel following and TV ratings.

The Lions' reputation in these games won out in the end.

Penn State of course started this season at 5-0 and moved into the top five of the national rankings in early October. But a dominating start at Iowa was wiped away after quarterback Sean Clifford was knocked out by injury.

The Lions lost that day which started a stunning slide of five defeats over their final seven games. They were so close to so much more — their five defeats came by a combined 21 points.

The Outback Bowl surely will be the final game in a Penn State uniform for stars such as receiver Jahan Dotson safety Jaquan Brisker defensive end Arnold Ebiketie punter Jordan Stout — and perhaps Sean Clifford. The fifth-year quarterback however does own another year of eligibility if he so chooses because of an NCAA COVID exemption.

Other key Penn State seniors or underclassmen who may leave but still haven't announced their intentions include defensive tackle P.J. Mustipher safety Ji'Ayir Brown linebacker Brandon Smith and offensive tackle Rasheed Walker.

The Lions are 3-3 in bowl games under Franklin missing only last year with their 4-5 record.

Penn State (7-5) and Arkansas (8-4 College Football Playoff No. 21) who have never faced each other will meet in the Jan. 1 game at Raymond James Stadium (noon ESPN2). The Razorbacks also are making their first appearance in the bowl.

“I’m so proud of everything our team has done to this point to earn a trip to the Outback Bowl” second-year Arkansas coach Sam Pittman said. “Playing in a marquee bowl game on Jan. 1 in Florida is an incredible accomplishment for our program and our fans.”

Arkansas which finished 22nd in the final Associated Press top 25 — two years removed from one of the worst seasons in its history when the Hogs went winless in SEC play — was especially appreciative to be playing on New Year’s Day.

“Our program has not played in a Florida-based bowl in 15 years and haven’t played on New Year’s Day in 13 years” vice chancellor/director of athletics Hunter Yurachek said. “All of this speaks to the hard work and dedication Coach Pittman his staff and our student-athletes have put in to get us back to this point.”

The Nittany Lions will have a bit of history on their side. The Razorbacks have gone 0-4 against Big Ten teams in bowls. Penn State has a 3-1 Outback record dropping its last appearance there to Florida 37-24 on Jan. 1 2011.

“Tampa Bay is a great destination for our loyal fan base and we know they will be there in full force to help send this special group of seniors off on a high note” said Penn State coach James Franklin who is making his first Outback trip.

Arkansas ranked No. 22 in the AP Top 25 Poll and No. 21 in the final College Football Playoff rankings boasts an 8-4 record so far this season with wins over four ranked teams. The Razorbacks went just 4-4 in conference play but finished the season on a high note with a 34-17 win over Missouri and a close loss to No. 1 Alabama.

In the grand scheme of things the Outback Bowl matchup will mark Penn State’s first game against Arkansas in program history. The Nittany Lions are 24-23 all-time against SEC teams.

James Franklin’s program posted a 7-5 record in 2021 with ranked wins over No. 12 Wisconsin and No. 22 Auburn. The Nittany Lions sputtered following a 5-0 start though and wound up with a disappointing 4-5 record in conference play including a nine-overtime loss to Illinois at Beaver Stadium. January’s matchup with Arkansas will feature Penn State’s seventh ranked opponent this season.

Apollo Crews wins Intercontinental Title at WrestleMania 37

The Nigerian drum fight wasn’t exactly what we thought it would be but was a simple No Holds Barred match. Both Big E and Apollo made use of weapons to put the other man down for the count.

The match began with both men wailing at each other with brutal kendo stick shots.

Big E flattened Apollo with a massive spear through the ropes and off the ring apron and both men covered a long distance with the impact. Crews fought his way back into the match with a death valley driver on the apron and set up the steel steps below him. He tried to flatten Big E’s head by smashing him between the steel steps but Big E dodged it.

Crews would end up digging his own grave as he would get planted on the steel steps courtesy of an uranage. The champion set up a table in the ring and went to put the challenger through it but Crews fought back and destroyed him with shots with the kendo stick.

He then laid Big E on the table and looked to hit the frog splash but ate a mouthful of wood.

It feels like an odd choice for the company to still be releasing Turing architecture cards but with everyone scrambling to get whatever they can in the shortage these were looking like a ray of light.

The Nvidia RTX 2060 12GB upgrade was set to be a great budget gaming card that you might actually be able to find on shelves. The boost in VRAM from 6GB to 12GB would make the RTX 2060 in a position to actually compete against the AMD Radeon RX 6600 and 6700 cards and hopefully avoid too much interest from miners jacking up the price. It was going to be a great choice on a budget but that’s looking less likely.

Despite getting a good look at the specs for Nvidia’s RTX 2060 12GB Founders Edition card just a few days ago it turns out it probably doesn’t exist. According to TechPowerUp (via Videocardz) Nvidia has since removed the listing from the specs page. A statement said it was placed there in error and only custom designs by partners are going to be available.

This means we aren’t going to see a nice budget Founders Edition of this card to help set the pace for pricing. Board partners will set their own prices and given they already have higher margins they're going to be more expensive. This will only be more so depending on the configurations and other choices included in the boards.

We haven’t seen any partner designs of the 2060 12GB boards yet so hopefully one kind partner will still give us a sweet budget deal. Though without it coming straight from Nvidia we aren’t expecting quite the tasty low price offerings we were hoping for.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9OVklESUEtR2VGb3JjZS1SVFgtMzA1MC1KYW51YXJ5LXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS1tb290ZWQtZm9yLXVwY29taW5nLUdBMTA2LWJhc2VkLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQuNTgyOTA5LjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050: January release date mooted for upcoming GA106-based graphics card,"NVIDIA may have just announced the RTX 2060 (12 GB) but we may only be 6 weeks away from the launch of the RTX 3050. The entry-level card is believed to feature 8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM and a GA106 GPU the same graphics chip found in the RTX 3060.

A new release date has been posed for the RTX 3050 NVIDIA's next entry-level desktop graphics card. Previously it was believed that NVIDIA would wait until Q2 2022 to unveil the RTX 3050 tipped to launch alongside the RTX 3050 Ti. However a new rumour alleges that the RTX 3050 could appear in Q1 2022 instead.

Supposedly NVIDIA is working towards launching the RTX 3050 on January 27 possibly around the time that AMD reveals the RX 6500 XT. @hongxing2020 refers to the RTX 3050 being 'on-shelf' by that date for reference which should be the card's official launch date.

Hence NVIDIA could announce the RTX 3050 before its January 27 release date similar to the RTX 2060 (12 GB). It is unclear how the RTX 3050 and RTX 2060 (12 GB) will compare against each other though. Theoretically the RTX 3050 should outperform the RTX 2060 (12 GB) in most tasks thanks to its newer Ampere architecture.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9ncmFwaGljcy1jYXJkcy1hcmUtZ2V0dGluZy1tb3JlLWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1hZ2FpbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Graphics cards are getting more expensive again,"The price of graphics cards has been a sore subject for many over the last year with a tragic mix of hardware shortages and high demand causing massive inflation.

With China's crackdown on Cryptomining operations resulting in ex-mining GPUs flooding the market it was anticipated that we could finally start to see prices of new hardware drop to something more affordable but it seems recent market analysis suggests we're not out of the woods yet.

MyDrivers a Chinese language tech website reports that the supply of Nvidia RTX 30 series graphics cards will drop by 30% compared to August with the RTX 3060 suffering from a 50% reduction in expected availability and prices are increasing again for just about every GPU on the market – even including older hardware like the Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti.

The sorry state of silicon

Videocardz converted the price hikes of various in-demand Nvidia graphics cards from yuan to USD in its own reporting and notes that AMD GPU stock appears to be less affected by shortages despite also facing inflated prices.

We can't be certain that the price increases we're seeing are reflective of the increased manufacturing costs and various other reasons such as temporary closures of GPU assembly lines due to new COVID outbreaks have also been cited as a cause for hardware shortages but knowing why GPUs are more expensive is going to be of little comfort to consumers who have been waiting patiently for the grotesque inflation to drop and for stock to be more plentiful to reduce scalping.

Analysis: We're in this for the long run

While some of the above price changes are small there's little reason for an older GPU like the GTX 1050 Ti to receive a price bump when newer entry-level cards with a relatively affordable MSRP exist on the market such as the RTX 3060. This paints a concerning picture for the coming months of availability and while this is purely speculative it looks like we're going to suffer through low stock and artificially inflated prices for a good while.

We also wouldn't discredit that this is happening in China rather than in western countries like the USA. A blend of misfortune means no singular reason can be blamed for the current market situation but a key issue is a supply with the Covid-19 pandemic causing production to slip. As China is a major manufacturer for electronics it's likely we will see this trickle across to the wider global market.

If you've been trying to get your hands on a new GPU at a reasonable price then you're in for a lengthy wait. Our best advice is to look into buying a gaming laptop or if your internet connection is good enough consider trying streaming services like Nvidia GeForce Now. With any luck production will increase and the graphics card market could start to eventually stabilize but it's unlikely we'll see much improvement before 2022.

This should set you up better for future upgrades and doesn't cost a whole lot more than lower-power PSUs. It has an 80 Plus Platinum efficiency certification and a 10-year warranty plus it's fully modular for easy connections without clutter.

Cooler Master MasterWatt 650 Check Amazon $84 at Amazon Budget Option

Cooler Master makes some quality PSUs and its MasterWatt 650W option comes at a great price. It has an 80 Plus Bronze efficiency rating and a five-year warranty which aren't as impressive as the top picks but it'll still get the job done. The 120mm fan runs quietly when not under load and it's partially modular to help with cable management.

NVIDIA recommends a 650W PSU for the RTX 3070 but if you're currently working with say a 600W PSU you might get along just fine depending on other hardware in your system. You can always give it a shot before picking up a new PSU. On the other hand upgrading to something new — especially if your PSU is beginning to show its age — is never a bad idea. An old PSU can cause issues no matter its wattage.

If you are ready to upgrade our best PSU for RTX 3070 pick is the Corsair RM650x. It sits somewhere between the high-end and budget options in terms of price and it has the 650W recommended to power the RTX 3070. The 140mm fan's blades are curved to reduce noise and the fan turns off entirely at low power usage. It's also 80 Plus Gold certified for power efficiency reducing heat and overall draw. It comes with a set of fully modular cables so that you only use what you need (keeping your PC case uncluttered) and a 10-year warranty gives you some peace of mind.

If you think you'd like to upgrade to something that might just better stand up to future upgrades the EVGA SuperNOVA P2 with 750W of power is no doubt appealing. It has an 80 Plus Platinum efficiency certification for excellent heat and power management it comes with a 10-year warranty and it's fully modular for easy cable management.

Last week reports emerged that Huawei hoped to introduce the Watch D this month its first smartwatch that can monitor blood pressure levels. Reputedly Huawei will unveil the Watch D alongside a new foldable smartphone currently referred to as the 'Mate V'.

Supposedly Huawei has settled on unveiling the Watch D on December 23. The Watch D could debut at a wider launch event that includes laptops other smartwatches and TV-related hardware. This launch event will probably only apply to Huawei's home market even if the Watch D's announcement becomes international news.

Hence the Watch D will likely arrive globally in early 2022. At any rate Huawei appears to be gearing itself to release the Watch D in the US among other markets outside China. Accordingly Huawei has received a Class II certification from the country's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to release a medical grade device."

So how do we capitalize that?” asked Mr. Bikash Giri the CEO of Trizac Holding Group.

Israel’s gateway to the Arab world and Africa

Giri is a visionary CEO whose main mission is to expand the company’s investments in the Arab world Asia and Africa. “There are many underdeveloped countries in these regions that need to catch up with the rest of the developed world and their people need access to basic services” said Giri. “We want to change that and the opportunities for everyone involved are huge.”

The UAE’s strategic location plays an important role for Trizac Holding’s expansion into all of these areas and the signing of the Abraham Accords have opened another door with great potential the Israeli market. “Our company has strict regulatory practices in place to facilitate safe and secure investments from our partners we are experienced in emerging markets especially in the Middle East and Africa and we are engaged in key sectors such as Telecommunication and Renewable Energy both of which are the future for these markets” he explained.

We have some strategic acquisitions in mind and we are now in the process of raising funding from our investors. For instance we are ready to proceed with an investment in a major power project in Bangladesh and that would be the perfect opportunity for Israeli investors” explained Giri.

The future is bright and the potential is great especially when it comes to these three aspects: Technology Power and Telecommunications. Following the Covid19 pandemic crisis Trizac Holding Group is ready for the big comeback and we invite potential Israelis partners to join our regional expansion plans” Giri concluded.

The first stop of the day is an apartment complex in west Glendale. He grabs a plastic bag from his trunk and heads toward the first client.

Already expecting him and the chimichanga meals a voice from the first-floor apartment instructs Saunders to come in after he knocks on the door. Saunders asks the client about their weekend and how they were feeling as he hands him the bag of meals and a couple of bottles of orange juice.

""When they see me it's the same person coming there each time"" Saunders told The Arizona Republic. ""So I get familiar and they get comfortable. You kind of build a relationship.""

Saunders is one of 15 staff drivers at YWCA Metropolitan Phoenix who deliver food to elderly people and people with disabilities.

YWCA's senior program provides assistance to people facing food insecurities. According to the nonprofit food insecurities in Glendale and El Mirage have dramatically risen since the pandemic.

The nonprofit received a grant from The Arizona Republic's Season for Sharing campaign which supports programs for at-risk children and families helps teachers and students and provides services for older adults.

HOW TO DONATE:Make a gift to Season for Sharing here

Last year Season for Sharing raised $2.1 million and provided more than $200000 in grants to organizations working with older adults and people with disabilities including:

$25000 to YWCA for its senior programs.

$18000 to Duet: Partners in Health and Aging for free-of-charge grocery shopping transport and other services for homebound seniors and disabled adults.

$15000 to Aster Aging Inc. for nutritious Meals on Wheels with daily wellness checks.

$10000 to Area Agency on Aging for trips for older adults in need.

$7500 to Neighbors Who Care to help homebound and disabled older adults stay in their homes for as long as feasibly possible.

Help for those on fixed incomes

The Phoenix metro area is facing a plight of senior food insecurity. According to a Feeding America report released in August 7.5% of older adults in the Valley are experiencing food insecurity.

""We need to allow seniors not only to age in place but to age with dignity"" said YWCA advancement director Genevieve Villegas. ""A lot of times when they're on fixed incomes our seniors are having to decide if they're going to pay their electric bill or are they going to have a meal that evening. We want to eliminate that decision for them.""

YWCA's program aims to help older adults live outside of assisted living facilities or nursing homes. The goal is to help them save money on food so they can afford housing and utilities among other costs.

Villegas said the food they provide is nutritious and follows dietary restrictions as needed.

Currently 745 clients are registered for the food distribution and delivery program. According to YWCA 85% of them belong to low-income households.

Before the pandemic the program served 92000 meals to 1110 older adults and people with disabilities each year.

Last year the number of registered clients declined. However the need only increased. The program served 122000 meals in 2020 according to YWCA.

""We have less people but we've been pushing out more meals which is just crazy"" Villegas said. ""We don't see that going away even when we get back to normal.""

'They're not going to ask for additional help'

Clients needing help first sign up with the Area Agency on Aging where they are assigned a case manager who assesses their needs and refers them to YWCA as clients.

Two-thirds of YWCA's clients are 65 or older. Apart from hunger many of them also face loneliness Villegas said.

""They have a lot of pride there"" she said. ""They're not going to ask for additional help. They just are so grateful for the meals that we're providing. It's up to our drivers who are very in tune with the surroundings and they can see issues.""

Saunders whose usual daily route consists of 20 stops has moved furniture sorted dishes and tended front yards for different clients.

""For a lot of them this is all the time you get to see (someone) face to face"" Saunders said. ""I kind of like that interaction and seeing how they're doing what they're doing in their lives.""

He previously worked as a kitchen cook and prepared some of the meals for YWCA's congregate service. The congregate service held in its offices where anyone could come in to grab a meal is currently suspended due to the pandemic.

According to YWCA the senior programs require a $1.1 million budget to run each year.

YWCA also sponsors about 12000 rides and conducts 1600 activities focused on seniors and people with disabilities each year.

""It is very important and helpful that we receive that funding every year for those seniors"" Villegas said.

YWCA plans to reopen its in-person services in February.

In the meantime Villages said clients are treated to warm food and smiling faces directly at their homes.

The Rebels (6-2) defeated No. 19 Memphis 67-63 on Saturday securing the Rebels' first win against a ranked opponent this season. The Rebels held visiting Memphis (5-3) to 38.8% shooting and 2-for-11 shooting from 3-point distance. Memphis didn't do itself any favors shooting 23-for-37 from the free-throw line.

Ole Miss led by 11 points with 2:19 remaining but Memphis trimmed that margin to two points with 14 seconds remaining. Ole Miss fired back with clutch free-throw shooting; the Rebels shot 23-for-29 on free throws.

Memphis' talented trio of freshmen had no offensive answers against the Rebels. Top-50 recruits Jalen Duren Emoni Bates and Josh Minott combined to shoot 4-for-17 and score 14 points.

The win is Ole Miss' first against a ranked opponent since Feb. 23 of last season against Missouri and is the sixth such win under coach Kermit Davis now in his fourth season in Oxford.

Ole Miss led 30-26 at halftime. The Rebels held the Tigers to 10-for-27 shooting (37%) in the first half and jumped ahead thanks to 13 points from senior Jarkel Joiner and Memphis' dismal 6-for-14 mark from the free-throw line.

Memphis thundered back with an 8-2 run early in the second half to take its first lead since it was up 11-10 eight minutes into the game. That lead didn't last long. The Rebels regained their lead 21 seconds later and never again trailed.

Sophomore guard Matthew Murrell a Memphis native catalyzed the Rebels with 19 points. Murrell shot 4 of 9 from 3-point distance and set a new career-high in scoring for the second time in as many games.

Joiner led the Rebels with 20 points and eight rebounds.

Not having forward depth hurt the Rebels throughout. Senior Robert Allen injured his knee in the first minute of the second half and did not return. He was seen on crutches wearing a knee brace out of uniform. Sophomore Jaemyn Brakefield only played 15 minutes because of foul trouble.

The Rebels return to action next Saturday (7:30 p.m. SEC Network) in Atlanta against Western Kentucky.

He never talks about how he desperately tried to save the older sister of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams and was with her in her final moments following the drive-by shooting in Los Angeles.

He also never talks about the nightmare of being as he claims put in handcuffs and carted off to a cell with police thinking he could be involved in Yetunde’s killing.

Memories of Yetunde who was 31 and a mom of three when she was gunned down in September 2003 have haunted Wormley every day since her death. Now they are being refreshed by the new hit movie “King Richard” about the Williams family — including Yetunde.

9 Wormley was driving Yetunde’s car when she was fatally shot in the passenger seat by a Crips gang member.

Wormley 46 is breaking his silence in an exclusive interview. “A lot of people haven’t heard my side of the story. This really messed me up” he told The Post. “The truth is the Williams family didn’t just sweep me under the rug they flushed me down the toilet as well.”

A representative for the Williams family did not comment.

For Wormley Yetunde’s murder — which happened just yards from the Compton neighborhood courts where Venus and Serena first learned to play tennis — left him spiraling into a life of crime and struggling with mental health issues.



The two first met at a surprise party in Compton hosted by mutual friends to celebrate his 28th birthday on April 30 2003.

“Tunde wasn’t dancing so I left everyone on the dance floor and sat by her side. I didn’t know who she was — I didn’t know she was from the Williams family — but I just wanted to make sure everyone was happy” Wormley recalled. “We started talking and she danced with me. She didn’t want to turn the birthday boy down!

“We were inseparable. We talked and danced the whole night and we ended up going to my brother’s after-party. We spent the whole night together.”

The couple began dating and got serious fast. Yetunde who was a registered nurse beauty salon owner and part-time assistant to her famous sisters soon asked Wormley to move into her home in Corona Calif.

“I accumulated so much love for her kids” said Wormley of Yetunde’s three children. “I didn’t have any father growing up so I wanted to be there for them.”

Still he turned down Yetunde’s request to move in and get married. “I wanted to gain her trust. She had been hurt previously. She was a single mom with three really young kids and I was young” Wormley remembered. “I told her ‘I don’t want to hurt you and be in the kids’ lives and end up breaking up.'”

Yetunde who was the valedictorian of her high-school graduating class was the oldest daughter of Oracene Price and Yusef Rasheed. She and her sisters Lyndrea and Isha were raised by Oracene and her new husband Richard Williams along with their half-sisters Venus and Serena.

Yetunde had her son Jeffrey who was 11 at the time of his mom’s death with Jeffrey Johnson. The couple were together less than a year as she left him after he was jailed for assaulting a policeman.

She then wed Byron Bobbitt and had daughter Justus and son Jair — 5 and 3 at their mom’s passing — but Yetunde lived in fear of Bobbitt. She filed a police complaint in 1997 which read in part: “Husband threatened me with a knife to my throat stating he would kill me if I took his daughter away — and he also physically assaulted me.”

With her family’s help Yetunde left Bobbitt divorcing him in 2000 and launched a beauty salon in Lakewood Calif.

Wormley admits he was no angel. He had served time for vehicle theft petty theft and domestic violence and was on parole for drug and gun offenses at the time of his girlfriend’s death.

He said he told Yetunde all about his past. “I was in a gang when I met her but I would not show her any parts of that. It was a totally different life with me and her” he told The Post.

But everything came crashing down in the early hours of Sept. 14 2003.

Yetunde had been “calling and calling” her boyfriend that night upset that he had forgotten their planned date.

“I told her ‘We still got tomorrow'” Wormley remembered.

The couple met up before midnight when Yetunde picked him up from a friend’s house in West Compton where he had been watching a boxing match on TV.

“She told me she was drinking a little bit and asked me to take the wheel” he said.

But Wormley didn’t have a valid driver’s license so he stuck to side streets as he drove Yetunde’s GMC Yukon Denali.

“I looked over to her and said ‘Tunde are you OK? Where do you want to go?’ But she was over it. I said ‘Damn I didn’t remember I had promised to take you out.’ It freaked me out seeing her crying” he told The Post. “I was desperately trying to make it up to her. Her last words to me were ‘Oh Ro.'”

Their car was he said “right across the street from where her sisters practiced tennis and I see these sparks I couldn’t hear anything as the windows were up. I see a guy standing to the side of a house … he has something in his hand and he’s shooting at us.

“I instantly grab Tunde’s hand and press the gas. I floor it and drive through the next set of lights. I’m freaking out.”

As he explained to The Post what happened Wormley began to sob.

“The back window is just shattered. I pull over. I lift Tunde up and blood is dripping out of her. I didn’t see where she got shot and now I’m freaking out and it’s dark … it was a lot. It was a lot.”

In shock Wormley drove to his mother’s nearby apartment and she called 911. He claimed that the authorities who arrived arrested him on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon.

A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department did not follow up on a request for comment.

According to Wormley Yetunde — who had been shot by an AK-47 assault rifle — was still in the passenger seat when cops cuffed him.

“They left her in the truck while she was still living” he alleged. “If they would have took her to the hospital immediately she would still be living.

“All I kept saying was to get her to hospital … They didn’t care about anybody [who was] black or coming to their rescue especially when it was gun violence — until they found out that she was a superstar’s sister.”

Wormley’s sister Carmelle recalled the scene to The Post: “The ambulance turned the light out as they turned the corner and we knew she had gone. Rolland was still in the police car watching. They were pretty much harassing him.”

LAPD officers reportedly held him for allegedly violating the terms of his parole. During interrogations he claims authorities told him that other witnesses said he had fought with people at the Compton house which he denied.

“I had my hands cuffed behind my back like an animal I couldn’t use the phone or watch the news” Wormley alleged. “They wouldn’t let me phone a lawyer or my family. They told me they didn’t want to harm their investigation.”

Most painful he said was that he missed Yetunde’s funeral.

“I went through so much pain. I lost my love — did anybody think about that? We just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

Wormley said he was kept behind bars for just over a week

“I asked God every day ‘Why did you take her? She was an angel why didn’t you take me?'” he recalled.

He claims that the Williams and Price families — whom he had celebrated with at Yetunde’s Hawaiian-themed birthday party the month before — “shut me out.”

“I went through hell the minute I lost Tunde. Her family thought I had something to do with it” Wormley said.

In January 2004 police arrested former Crips member Robert Maxfield then 23 for her killing.

In 2006 Maxfield pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison the Los Angeles Times reported and paroled in March 2018 according to state corrections officials. Maxfield was arrested again months later after allegedly violating his parole according to Los Angeles County sheriff’s officials and jail records.

Meanwhile a spiraling Wormley found himself in and out of trouble for a string of crimes after Yetunde’s death. “He was just devastated by Tunde’s death. That just took his life away” his sister said. He went to jail in 2004 after pleading no contest to burglary. In December 2006 he was sentenced to 14 years in prison for robbery and attempted murder. His mother died while he was in prison.

He’s now two years out of prison and on parole working as an Amazon delivery driver. He has five children and a sixth on the way with a girlfriend.

He said that leaders of the Crips gang of which Maxfield had been a member later apologized to him for Yetunde’s murder.

During an episode of Facebook Watch’s Red Table Talk last month with “King Richard” star Will Smith Serena Williams said that seeing Yetunde on screen as portrayed by actress Mikayla LaShae Bartholomew made her emotional.

“I think I cried the whole time. Whenever she came on film I just … personally I just started like — I mean even still” she said.

The sisters’ mother Oracene Price added of Yetunde’s portrayal: “It was a quiet moment I think. ‘Cause we know how it was … it was just something that you kind of try and put in the back of your mind and don’t want to remember.”

The Williams family opened the Yetunde Price Resource Center in Compton in 2016 to provide resources and programming to those affected by trauma.

Maxfield meanwhile is once again in legal trouble. On Wednesday he was at an LA court after being charged with possession of a firearm. He will be sentenced in January and his attorney said he intends to surrender. Maxfield had no message for the Williams family and declined to comment as he left court.

As for Wormley who has a tattoo of Price’s name he is concentrating on taking care of his kids and “staying out of trouble.”

He still thinks often of Yetunde and her three children who he never saw again after her death as they were raised by Oracene in Florida.

“I’m not sure if I’ll be able to watch the film” he said of “King Richard.”

“All I did was get in the car and drive. I’m sorry I turned down the wrong street.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcnlzdmlsbGVqdC5jb20vbmV3cy9hLWhhbGYtY2VudHVyeS1iZWhpbmQtdGhlLWJlbmNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A half-century behind the bench – Marysville Journal-Tribune,"Unavailable.

Magistrate Daniel Eckert Behrens announced his retirement from the Marysville Municipal Court after 50 years of service.

The court and The Union County Bar Association commemorated Behrens with a retirement gathering Friday at the Marysville Municipal Court 1250 W. Fifth St.

“Dan will be missed by the court the staff and the citizens of the county. We have never had a Municipal Court for the last 50 years without him” said current Municipal Court Judge Robert Parrott. “It is with regret that we lose a fine judge and equally fine individual. Dan has always been a strong supporter of his community. We are grateful for his service to the court and to the people of Union County. We wish him the best on a well-deserved retirement.”

Behrens’ last day in court is Dec. 28.

“It’s just time” the magistrate said. “My brain doesn’t work as well as when I was 35 40 or 45 or even 50. It just doesn’t work as well.”

Behrens 78 graduated from Marysville High School in 1961 and earned his bachelor’s degree at Miami University in Oxford Ohio in 1965. He graduated from The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law in 1968 then he was admitted to the Ohio bar.

After law school Behrens worked for Ohio Attorney General William B. Saxbe. He was also in the U.S. Army National Guard and attended Officers Candidate School.

Then Behrens served as the domestic relations referee under Judge Joe Grigsby in Common Pleas Court.

“My main job was to make a recommendation as to what should happen with the children. Who gets custody? For how long?” he said.

Former Municipal Court Judge Robert Evans appointed Behrens in late 1971 as the “small claims referee” which later changed to “magistrate” of the local municipal court. About this time Behrens left a law firm in Marysville and began working full-time as editor of the Marysville Journal-Tribune. Behrens was hesitant to accept the position because of his schedule with the newspaper but Evans convinced him that it was only a part-time position.

“I have heard Dan tell members of the bar association that he planned a law career and intended to practice locally on his own or in one of the area law firms. However the demands of his family newspaper business prevented him from following that course” Parrott said. “Instead he became active in helping to run and publish the Marysville Journal-Tribune starting in 1969. He served as managing editor editor publisher president and chairman of the board.”

Behrens explained that the magistrate is a hired employee which is why he never wore a robe behind the bench.

“The judge hires the person to be magistrate” he said.

He added that he “always felt that the robe denotes you as an elected judicial officer” which he is not.

Attorneys must give up their private practice in the municipal court to serve as magistrate there. Behrens said other candidates for the position had established civil and criminal practices they did not want to close.

“(Evans) said ‘You’re my last hope’” Behrens said with a laugh.

He officially began as magistrate in January 1972.

Throughout his career as magistrate Behrens served under five judges — Evans Richard Parrott Kevin Pelanda Michael Grigsby and Robert Parrott Richard Parrott’s son. He was sworn in every time an interim judge was appointed or a judge was elected.

“You serve at the pleasure of the judge” Behrens explained. “Every time a new judge was elected I would call them or talk to them and hand them my resignation if they wanted it so they could name somebody else if they wanted to do that. And they all said no.”

Behrens administered the law for small claims under former judges Evans and Richard Parrott. When Judge Pelanda was elected Behrens began hearing eviction cases as well.

Behrens explained that magistrates only give recommendations they do not make final decisions. However the majority of his recommendations were accepted by the judge. He remembers that former Judge Grigsby reversed his judgment a few times.

“Dan was always known as being a caring judge. He disliked removing families from the home they rented when they had hard times and could not pay rent” Robert Parrott said. “Every attorney knew that he would not sign an entry to evict a family during Christmas time. His knowledge of the law in the area of small claims and evictions is second to none in the Union County Bar Association. He is held in high respect by his fellow bar members.”

Behrens said he was referred to as the “equity magistrate” because he “always tried to be fair.”

Robert Parrott agreed saying “He is known for being fair just and honest.”

Behrens’ time behind the bench over the past five decades has been marked by some unforgettable circumstances.

“As referee Dan heard a wide variety of cases and claims” Robert Parrott said. “He could probably write a book on some of the unusual cases he heard over the years.”

During one small claims hearing a defendant who was using an oxygen tank died in the courtroom above the fire department. The original court was located at the corner of East Sixth and South Main streets. Paramedics from the fire department below tried to resuscitate him to no avail. The magistrate recalled that the plaintiff was concerned about obtaining the money he was allegedly owed.

“I said ‘You know what you’re going to have to file a claim to his estate if there is an estate. That’s the only other way you can do it because I’m done. I can’t find a judgment against a dead person’” Behrens remembered telling the plaintiff.

He also recalled hearing a small claims case over $4 allegedly owed to a plaintiff.

Behrens said he often encouraged plaintiffs and defendants to try to work it out themselves in small claims cases about money or damage claims in eviction cases.

“I would say ‘Now look you’re going to ask me to make a decision and you both can’t win. One of the two of you isn’t going to like my decision and you don’t know what that is right now. You may think you know but you don’t. Believe me’” he said.

He added that “a fair amount of times they settled it.”

In addition Behrens laughed as he shared a story about the ceiling caving in during a hearing with a packed courtroom at the municipal court located where the Memorial Health Pavilion and Partners Park are now.

On several occasions the magistrate summoned police officers from a panic button to stop altercations in the courtroom.

“One time the defendant was charging me the bench” he said. “He was walking toward the bench and they grabbed a hold of him.”

Behrens also commended the employees in the clerk’s office.

“They’re just good quality people” he said adding that they are “knowledgeable” and “easy to work with.”

He supposes he will miss going to court every week but he hopes to enjoy his retirement by spending more time in Florida.

Behrens has been involved in the Union County Bar Association as well as the Ohio Association of Magistrates and the Ohio State Bar Association.

“It may not have been the legal career Dan planned but his service as a judge has been invaluable and distinguished” Robert Parrott said. “He is known throughout the state for his long and remarkable service as a magistrate and jurist.”

Rebecca R. Pokorski a current member of the Union County Board of Elections will replace Behrens in the new year. Pokorski practices criminal defense in Columbus with experience in the Franklin County Public Defenders Common Pleas unit. She was appointed by Judge Parrott to fill the position.",,,

Grimsby has lots of buildings which come with their very own haunting stories.

We've had a look through the records to find Grimsby's most haunted sites from a charity store to a popular pub and a foot tickling ghost

Join us as we look at 11 infamous ghost stories that have come from Grimsby throughout the years.

1) The Imperial pub

The 115-year-old Victorian coach house structure which straddled the corner of Blundell Avenue and Grimsby Road in Cleethorpes has a Dutch gable and legend persists the former hotel is haunted by the ghost of a Victorian maid.

The story claims a young woman became pregnant and was locked away upstairs to avoid shaming her family. Ghost hunters also claim to have found the spirits of a missing fisherman and a sobbing pregnant woman in the old hotel.

Through the years publicans and their regulars have reported ghostly goings-on with objects having been mysteriously moved and electrical equipment flicked on and off and some claim to have felt strange sensations surrounding them.

The building has since been turned into flats.

2) The Coliseum

Although The Coliseum on Cleethorpes High Street has changed it's name and uses over the years rumours persist that when it was known as the Baton Rouge it was also plagued by unexplained incidents convincing management the place was haunted.

Doors slammed at night bottles fell off shelves lights were switched on – and rumours abounded of a ghostly lady who floated up and down.

3) 64 Victoria Street

Previously a post office and in recent years an Argos 64 Victoria Street boasts a phantom postal worker. He was seen by an old post office worker walking up the stairs at night in the older parts of the property.

None of the eyewitnesses could ascertain whether the phantom was a male or a female and numerous stories were spread about the origins of the ghostly figure.

One of the stories is that the property was erected on the long gone St Mary’s Church Cemetery. Another theory is that the phantom was a postman killed during WWII but who is returning to carry out the job he loved so much in life.

4) The Fishing Heritage Centre and Ross Tiger trawler

(Image: Fishing Heritage Centre)

It has been claimed that the Fishing Heritage Centre is home to the spirit of a former tour guide and skipper named Alf. Alf sadly passed away on Halloween 2003 and was known throughout Grimsby as being a trawlerman working on such trawlers as Ross Tiger.

It has been said that staff and customers have seen Alf walking around and heard shuffling feet. Some witnesses have smelt tobacco and a lone pair of legs has been seen standing in the gift shop.

However more recently the Centre posted on their Facebook page about some rather unusual goings on aboard the trawler Ross Tiger whch is moored in Alexandra Dock.

The post said: ""#Spooky goings on today as Skipper Dennis Avery reported the smell of food wafting from the Galley!

""The stove hasn't been used in almost 30 years. Perhaps the spirit of an old cook was hard at work! Well it is nearly #Halloween.""

5) Bradley Wood Black Lady

(Image: Rick Byrne)

The Black Lady of Bradley Woods which is situated on the outskirts of the village of Bradley is described as being a young pretty female about 5’6’’ tall and dressed in a flowing black cloak with a black hood that obscures her face and her hair. Occasionally the hood will flow backwards revealing her pale tear soaked face and while there are no records of her hurting anyone her appearance is said to scare the hardiest of eyewitnesses.

One theory is that the story is a cautionary tale a story told to scare children from entering the woods alone. Another theory is that the Black Lady is the ghost of a nun a third theory is that she is a spinster linked to witchcraft!

Another story told about the Black Lady is that she was attacked and her baby stolen with some claiming that uttering a verse “Black Lady Black Lady I've stolen your baby!"" three times the Lady appears to them to take back her child.

The problem with this is that the verse is a common verse from numerous locations across the UK all linked to ladies in black white red and blue.

6) Beagles Lighting

(Image: Grimsby Telegraph)

Beagles Lighting on Cleethorpes Road was at one time said to have been very active with my colleagues from Most Haunted visiting the site in 2005. It was claimed that lights dropped from the ceiling of their own accord doors open and close violently and phantom footsteps have been heard roaming through the premises.

One customer stood transfixed as a collection of candles flew across the shop and a picture above appeared to show a mysterious floating orb in the room.

The shop had previously been Gooseman wine makers in the 1870’s and in the early 1900’s it was the labour exchange before by 1935 being used to make radios. Numerous investigations were carried out at the venue by paranormal groups and at one point it was even visited by a Shamanic Pathwalker.

7) The Phanton Monk of Langton Drive

In the 1980’s Langton Drive Nunsthorpe was said to have a haunted property owned by the Grenny family. It was home to a phantom monk that eventually drove the family from the property. The daughter of the family Stacey Grenny had reported seeing a faceless monk.

Weeks later the mother Sharon had heard shuffling feet in the bedroom when she saw a faceless featureless monk at the foot of her bed.

Eventually the council intervened and Sharon and her family were moved out. The move was filmed and broadcast on television interviewing the family and showing the furniture being removed to awaiting vans.

8) The Yarborough Hotel

The Yarborough Hotel on Bethlehem Street and now a Wetherspoon's pub is said to boast a ghost of its own. The property was built in 1851 by the Earl of Yarborough who was the chairman of the Manchester and Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Company. In later years the property became a JD Wetherspoon pub and was known as being the location of the Yarborough Riot.

Customers who had visited often reported the feeling of unease at the property and a phantom figure was seen wearing a white shirt and glasses.

9) The Corporation Arms

The Corporation Arms on Freeman Street is said to be haunted by the former landlady Mrs Drayton who it is claimed lost her life at the pub in a fire in 1918.

Interestingly the newspaper archives do not show a fire at the property in 1918 and there is no record of anyone named Drayton dying in Grimsby in 1918.

10) Waltham Church

All Saints Church in Waltham can be dated back to the 1200s so it’s not surprising that it has had its fair share of history. In the late 1800s and early 1900s the church underwent extensive renovations and a brass monument stands in the church dating back to 1420 and bearing the name of Joanna Waltham.

It was claimed that the church was the scene of a mass sighting in the 1990s when a Christmas choir made its way down the central aisle suddenly a priest adorned in robes was spotted reading from a book but as the choral procession approached he vanished into thin air.

11) The Old Coach House

Another property on Bethlehem Street it is said to be the oldest pub in Grimsby and also boasts a ghost.

It is claimed that there have been numerous sightings of a tall dark shadow in the corridors of the pub with one theory stating that the ghost could be that of a boy killed in an accident in the barn.

12) RAF Binbrook

There are many strange tales about Lincolnshire’s old Second World War airfields. RAF Binbrook is said to be haunted by “Clubfoot” an Australian sergeant who blew himself up while trying to sabotage a Lancaster bomber. He is said to be seen waving wildly on the runway or limping around nearby roads trying to flag down cars.

Stories abound of a ghostly apparition of a pilot who was once seen in the theatre by three guests on a previous ghost hunting investigation who each verified what they had seen after the figure suddenly disappeared as quickly as it had arrived.

Incarnate voices have been heard in various areas of the location as well objects disappearing and mysteriously reappearing days later in the building.

But stories of ghosts at Binbrook go back much further than the Second World War. A poltergeist was reported at a nearby farm in 1905. Could there be a chilling connection?

Brookenby parish clerk Sam Coulam previously told the Grimsby Telegraph: “We just have strange things happening after we have these (paranormal) events.

""Hot water urns will stop working the CCTV will go funny. Certain areas just feel eerie but other areas are absolutely fine.

“I have an office upstairs but I won’t use it I work from home.”

13) The shoe factory shop

Situated at 21A Wellowgate the property has had numerous reports of activity throughout the years. It has been claimed that staff and customers have seen the apparition of an old man doors have opened and closed footsteps have been heard shoes have been removed from their racks the scent of tobacco and shadowy figures have been reported.

Some of the strangest of experiences that have been reported are customers who have had their feet tickled.

14) Oxfam Freeman Street

The Oxfam store on Freeman Street is said to be haunted with reports from staff members claiming that the shop has experienced cold spots stock pushed off shelves audible phenomena has been reported such as staff hearing their names being called and lights have flickered on and off.

The computers have malfunctioned walls have been felt vibrating and an unknown misty form has been seen at the top of the stairs.

No explanation has ever been given for the phenomena experienced here.

15) The Wonderland Ghost Train Ghost

(Image: Jeff Beedham)

This story dates back to the 1980s when staff at Wonderland in Cleethorpes reported seeing the ghost of an old man who would disappear into thin air. Some said they heard their names being called.

As with many urban legends a deeper layer was then added: a man had hanged themselves in the old ghost train and his phantom was now haunting the spot.

16) Weelsby Street School

(Image: Grimsby Telegraph)









Every school has its “haunted classroom” but few have seen an urban legend get quite out of hand as Weelsby Street School.

In 1924 eyewitnesses claimed to have seen a ghost at the New Clee school while others heard moaning from the school grounds and bell tower.

Wild rumours spread like wildfire. A ""figure in white"" had been seen gliding around the boys' playground mysterious blue lights were floating from room to room a headless body of a child had been found under a classroom floor and an unknown man had been found hanging in the belfry.

Children were left in a panic too scared to attend and police had to hold back a crowd of up to 2000 people who turned up to hunt the ghost.

Pent-up demand already has led to a huge surge in bookings in 2022 and 2023 from cruisers who have had their trips canceled or delayed because of the pandemic as well as new bookings from people who foresee cruising coming back safer than ever.

A couple of examples of this: Oceania's world cruise for 2023 sold out within one day of opening for sale to the public January 27 2021. And river cruise operator Uniworld has seen a 425 percent year-on-year increase in late 2021 and 2022 bookings to exotic destinations like India Vietnam and Egypt.

Still the future of the cruise industry has changed noticeably because of the pandemic. Here is a look at that future -- and what changes we can expect to see over the coming years.

Travel Restrictions Lifted -- But Vaccine Passports Required

In 2022 ...

Given that we're seeing a generally positive rollout of vaccinations across the globe and scientists are optimistic about reaching herd immunity in 2021 we expect some momentum when it comes to cruising going into 2022. On the back of that positivity we're making some bold predictions for next year.

Transport Canada will lift its ban on cruise ships calling in at its ports en route to Alaska and the state will enjoy its busiest cruise year since 2019.

U.S. citizens will be able to return to Europe again and we predict a boom especially for river cruises.

Australia will (finally) have lifted its travel restrictions and 2022/23 season will be a boom one for cruising. Many lines are already planning for this with Celebrity Cruises announcing Celebrity Eclipse will return on a series of five to 18-night departures from Sydney and Auckland from September next year.

Aussies and New Zealanders will be allowed to leave their countries at long last so we expect a large number in Europe in summer 2022 especially on the rivers.

We do predict however that vaccine passports or at least something showing proof of vaccination will become part of a requirement to travel the same way certain inoculations such as yellow fever are for entering certain countries.

Tech at the Forefront

The pandemic turbo-charged the use of technology onboard.

What once might have seemed vaguely gimmicky -- using your phone as a keycard or to turn off your lights in your cabin -- has become the norm. Tech will be front and center of the cruise ship experience.

Almost everything you do before you get onboard -- online check in boarding pass on your phone and the like -- will be touchless.

Once you are on the ship your phone RFID wrist band or Ocean Medallion or similar device will act as your keycard and to pay for drinks and services.

You will be encouraged to use the ship's mobile app to navigate the ship track your kids monitor your onboard spending and to book meals spa treatments shore excursions and shows.

In-cabin voice-activated artificial intelligence (in the case of MSC Cruises' newest ships) will answer questions that you once would have had to pick up the phone or walk to the reception desk to ask.

The in-person muster drill will be a thing of the past. Royal Caribbean has already developed the e-muster process and other lines will follow suit to avoid crowds and congregating. Instead it will take place in your cabin with a check-in at your own time.

An interesting additional feature of RFID wristbands is that they can be adapted for use as a track and trace device -- something that Royal Caribbean is already doing in Singapore.

The use of QR codes to bring up menus (which also reduces waste) will likely be here to stay; and say goodbye to the paper daily planner left on your bed the night -- this will be accessed on your phone.

The Buffet

Much has been written about ""the end of the buffet"" onboard following an announcement by Royal Caribbean with many readers saying they would not cruise if it meant the end of the buffet. Here's one example from the Cruise Critic message boards:

""As for no buffets … No Buffet = No cruising for us. There is absolutely no reason to remove buffets from cruises.""

As clarified by later statements the buffet is not being removed; it will still be onboard just in a different form.

It will be a compromise: Passengers will go to the serving stations and be served by crew rather than self-served. This was already in practice pre-COVID on Holland America Line for the first few days of cruises. Luxury lines also already had offered a version of this. Passengers still will have a more casual option but it will remove the need for guests to touch utensils others have been handling.

Cruise lines are also likely to make more wrapped ""grab-and-go"" items available at the buffet and cafes.

Private Islands Come into Their Own

All the major cruise line groups own private Caribbean islands. MSC uses one in the Middle East too -- Sir Bani Yas.

A day at a private island whether it be Disney's Castaway Cay or Royal Caribbean's Perfect Day at CocoCay has always been popular for those seeking beach fun. As cruising restarts in earnest private islands will become less of a fun distraction and more of a necessity allowing cruise lines to maintain the same health protocols on land as they do at sea -- and for passengers to wander at will rather than having to take a ship excursion.

It's likely that at least in 2022 most Caribbean itineraries will include a stop and/or an overnight at a private island and in the case of Virgin Voyages at its private beach club.

Destination-Specific COVID-19 Requirements

Destinations will continue to be vigilant about controlling COVID-19 for the next few years. Negative COVID-19 tests or proof of vaccination will be required for entry into many countries as the world works to eradicate the virus.

Cruise lines and cruise travel agents will have to help passengers navigate through this tricky area and all the logistics that will come with traveling in the post-pandemic era. In the same way lines organize visas for passengers to enter certain countries they will have to help passengers with getting COVID tests before returning to their own countries (if a negative test is required).

Expect to see long-term changes to the embarkation process. In addition to proof of vaccination or negative COVID test results changes first rolled out by lines that have restarted already around the world (Costa MSC and Royal Caribbean for example) will become part of the cruise experience. Expect to see fixed (and enforced) boarding times to avoid huge crowds; fully automated and almost touchless check-in and a more robust health screening such as temperature checks at boarding and possibly even PCR testing.

Small and Expedition Ships Become More Popular

Already in 2021 small and luxury ship lines are garnering bookings from people who are new to their brands -- and that trend will likely continue for several years as people eschew crowds for a more intimate atmosphere.

This will also benefit and coincide with the explosion of expedition cruise ships that have been scheduled to arrive in 2022 and beyond. The ships are not only smaller by definition but they also appeal to people seeking out the bucket list cruises that have been put on hold for two years.

Expedition ships also focus on outdoor exploration in more remote places which has become a priority during the pandemic.

Whole-ship charter cruises will enjoy a boost as groups seek to stay safe with people they know.

Shorter Cruises Take Off

The industry requirement that North American cruises stick to weeklong or shorter cruises is set to expire November 1 2021. But as the industry restarts it's looking clearer that shorter cruises will become more of the itinerary mix.

Carnival is of course a pioneer of shorter itineraries and is upping the number on offer this year from the West Coast.

After taking over three- and four-day itineraries from Long Beach in 2021 Carnival Miracle is going to continue its series of four- and five-day cruises to Mexico during the winter season beginning November 2021 and continuing through April 2023.

Virgin Voyages which is still set to debut this year is following Carnival's lead and offering four- and five-day cruises which include a stop at its private beach club

And Royal Caribbean despite divesting itself of two of the ships (Empress of the Seas and Majesty of the Seas) that offered short cruises has a whole roster of two- three- and four-night breaks in November onward most of which include a stop at its private island of Perfect Day at CocoCay.

World Cruises and Far-Flung Destinations Grow

It might sound like a contradiction but at the other end of the scale we see world cruises and cruises to far flung destinations whether by ocean or river becoming more popular.

This has been borne out by booking trends but the other factor in play is those people who had their once-in-a-lifetime cruise canceled in 2020 and aren't hopeful for it happening in 2021 will have waited three or four years to take that bucket list cruise. There's also a sense with the pandemic that life is short and what is the point of putting off that special experience any longer -- if not now then when?

Add to that a trend we have seen bubbling away for a while -- experiential cruises -- and we predict a boom in multi-generational cruises with grandparents taking one or two generations with them for shared experiences.

Long-Term Future of the Cruise Industry

The pandemic might be seen as a collective wake up call for everyone. Companies worldwide will be rethinking their business models and challenging traditional assumptions. Expect the cruise industry to do the same.

During the height of the pandemic we saw more cooperation across cruise brands than perhaps ever before with companies focused on the greater good of the industry rather than for their own corporations. Expect this trend to continue long-term especially as it pertains to health and safety of guests.

""There is no competition when it comes to health and safety said Royal Caribbean Group CEO Richard Fain said who joined with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings President and CEO Frank del Rio in forming the joint Healthy Sail Panel.

Similarly the drum beat of overtourism which reached a height in 2019 will be considered more thoughtfully in 2022 and beyond with lines working closely with one another and destinations so as not to overwhelm an island or a town with multiple arrivals all on the same day.

Cruise lines will be leaner (witness how many ships have been scrapped in the past 12 months) with the larger lines maintaining far fewer smaller and older ships in their fleets.

Finally it's unlikely COVID-19 like the flu or norovirus will be eliminated completely either on ships or around the world.

What's important is how the lines prepare for and react to onboard cases in the future.

Some long-term changes will mitigate this: Ships will set aside more of their cabins as isolation spaces; the enhanced medical facilities introduced onboard will stay and improved ventilation and deep cleaning with hospital-grade technology will become the norm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXRyYWRlLWNydWlzZS5jb20vcG9ydHMtZGVzdGluYXRpb25zL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1mb3VyLXNoaXAtMjAyMy1hbGFza2Etc2Vhc29uLWluY2x1ZGVzLXdhcmQtY292ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean four-ship 2023 Alaska season includes Ward Cove,"Now open to book the weeklong cruises will sail from Seattle Seward and Vancouver BC between May and September.

Suddenly here he was clean through on goal: the best player in the world the hometown icon who has come to symbolize P.S.G.’s ambition prowess excess and hubris his flashbulb moment at his fingertips.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

Investors in the latest funding round include Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and George Soros via his Soros Fund Management the Wall Street Journal reported.



Other investors in the company’s most recent funding round include Google Silicon Valley venture-capital firm DFJ Growth and Salesforce chief executive officer Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures.

CFS has raised more than $2bn in funding since it was founded in 2018.

It said the latest round of funding includes capital to build commission and operate Sparc the world’s first “commercially relevant” net energy fusion machine. In addition it will enable the company to begin work on Arc the first commercial fusion power plant. This work will include developing support technologies advancing the design identifying the site and finding partners and customers for the plant.

The company is collaborating with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to use decades of research combined with new high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnet technology.

CFS said HTS magnets will enable compact fusion power plants that can be constructed faster and at lower cost.

In 2020 CFS published a series of peer-reviewed publications in the Journal of Plasma Physics that verified Sparc will achieve net energy from fusion.

Net energy means the plasma generates more fusion power than used to start and sustain the process the requirement for a fusion power plant. Sparc is planned to be the first compact fusion system capable of delivering net energy gain generating 50 MW from a 25 MW input.

Earlier this year CFS which is a spinoff from MIT started construction at MIT of the Sparc building a manufacturing facility and company headquarters.

The company is aiming for Sparc to produce commercially relevant net energy from fusion by 2025 with the first Arc fusion plant completed in the early 2030s.",,,,,,,,,

We are slowly getting new capacity tiers. Recently we covered Western Digital 20TB ePMR Hard Drives with OptiNAND and WD Gold 16TB 18TB and 20TB models. Seagate is now getting into shipping 20TB hard drives with a duo intended for storage servers and NAS gear.

Seagate Exos X20 and IronWolf Pro 20TB HDDs Shipping

In search of more capacity Seagate announced that it will be shipping two 20TB drives this month just making it in 2021. For higher-end NAS units there is the IronWolf Pro 20TB drive. For larger storage servers there is the Seagate Exos X20.

The Seagate Exos X20 is available in 18TB and 20TB capacities with both SATA 6Gbps and SAS 12Gbps models available. Here is the spec sheet for these:

The Seagate IronWolf Pro 20TB is part of the performance-optimized NAS line. That is different segmentation from the Exos X20. The Exos X20 is more for storage servers and arrays. The IronWolf Pro 20TB falls into the category of personal NAS storage at Seagate. Here are the specs for the IronWolf Pro:

Both have a maximum sustained transfer rate of 285MB/s but the IronWolf Pro does not have a SAS3 option. One interesting note is that the AFR reliability rating of the Exos drive is much higher and it also uses considerably less power.

Final Words

Pricing is set to be $669.99 for the Exos X20 20TB and $649.99 for the IronWolf Pro 20TB. Those are list prices and we have seen supply challenges mean that drives do not always sell for list. One of the biggest benefits we tend to see is that as new capacity points become available and somewhat competitive it sometimes pushes down prices of lower capacity drives. We hope that is the case with this new release.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudGVycHJpc2VzdG9yYWdlZm9ydW0uY29tL2hhcmR3YXJlL2hkZC1pbmR1c3RyeS10cmVuZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 HDD Industry Trends to Look for,"Enterprise Storage Forum content and product recommendations are editorially independent.

Hard disk drives (HDDs) are one of the major non-volatile memory storage devices often used in enterprise data centers and arrays.

They are mechanical devices read and written by floating heads and popular solutions for offline backup. Despite the prevailing discussion on solid-state drives (SSDs) in the data storage industry HDDs are still used prominently and they’re still undergoing improvements.

See below to learn about some of the top trends in the hard disk drive market:

HDD Trends

Also Read: HDD Market Outlook

1. Focus on Full Disk Encryption

Self-encrypting disks (SED) and full disk encryption (FDE) are more secure methods of storage encryption than software-based encryption which can be undone if an attacker steals credentials.

In full disk encryption processes the device’s CPU does not store the symmetric encryption key.

Hardware-based encryption for disk drives is more secure and makes data harder to reach. If a hard drive is encrypted and it’s offline attackers will not be able to read its data.

2. Leaning on Other Hardware Protection Technologies

Hard drives need intensive security controls to improve storage security environments according to Doron Youngerwood VP of marketing at Continuity Software.

Data protection in general needs to strengthen defenses against data-targeted theft such as ransomware too:

“Existing vulnerability management solutions do not cover storage and backup” Youngerwood said. “Many organizations are not aware of this major blind-spot.”

Enterprises need “new ways to harden the storage and backup services” he said

Although Youngerwood acknowledged that hard drive tech advancements won’t be enough to solve all the problems related to data protection and security there are a few that can improve security in storage environments.

“These include hardware support for data locking (immutable drives) that can help guarantee hackers will not be able to compromise data copies” Youngerwood said.

He also cited “hardware support for data encryption — with better integration with key management systems” and “support for protocol encryption (SATA Fibre Channel) — that can help further secure storage in sensitive environments.”

The market as a whole needs new ways to protect recovery copies of data and improve storage security he said.

3. Raising Ransomware Protection

All storage mediums need measures to protect stored data from cyber attacks particularly ransomware an insidious type of data theft that encrypts stolen data and requires a paid ransom to take the data back.

Cybersecurity vendor Sophos spearheaded a 2021 survey of 5400 businesses and 37% reported being hit by ransomware attacks.

“Enterprises are looking for answers to ransomware and insider threat prevention” said Ron Gula president at Gula Tech Adventures. “To do so they are deploying access control data solutions which leverage encryption authentication access control and user behavior monitoring where data is stored. Normally enterprises deploy these types of technologies at the network layer or agent layer.”

Racktop Systems he added has implemented access control in their Cyberstorage solution..

BrickStor Racktop’s ransomware detection and prevention solution uses both hard drives and solid-state drives in its arrays. Racktop partners with Seagate using its self-encrypting hard drives which can reset encryption keys and automatically lock themselves.

BrickStor also has the ability to block just one infected user or machine allowing the rest of the system to continue performance said Jonathan Halstuch co-founder and CTO of Racktop.

“We can actually detect even the data theft portion and block that user … or block the machine user that is infected with the ransomware virus” Halstuch said. “We allow the other [non-virulent] users to keep working.”

Hard drives are one of the best offline storage solutions for protecting data at rest from ransomware: they are less expensive than SSDs and they’re faster to access than tape.

4. Increasing Drive Capacity

Although global hard drive unit sales are decreasing the overall storage capacity of HDDs is increasing according to Horizon Technology.

“The HDD market crossed an impressive threshold in 2020 hitting one zettabyte (ZB) of shipped capacity. That’s the equivalent of one billion terabytes (TB) of fresh storage” Horizon says.

IDC reported high volumes of created data in 2020 partly due to people staying home more during the pandemic. And in a 2020 report done in partnership with IDC Seagate Technologies predicts that by 2025 data will increase exponentially to hit 175 created zettabytes.

Overall standard enterprise hard drives have greater capacity than solid-state drives. And though plenty of data center SSDs range into the multiple-terabyte size where HDDs win is their cost per capacity. Hard drives are still cheaper overall.

While SSDs are popular hard drive capacity continues to increase IDC expects that HDDs will remain the most common installed storage medium until at least 2024.

5. More Storage Arrays

Disk arrays don’t just hold hard drives: they include other features like redundancy tiering and drive-level encryption.

Storage arrays exist in multiple environments including data centers and edge deployments.

The size of an edge data center partially dictates the size of the HDD and SSD form factors and the storage arrays.

Many enterprise arrays support both HDDs and SSDs. Some enterprise storage arrays include:

Hewlett Packard Enterprise HP StorageWorks XP10000

Dell PowerVault ME4

Dell/EMC Disk Storage Array

Lenovo ThinkSystem DS4200

The well-attended ceremony concluded a long planning process that spanned nearly two decades at a cost of over $21000000.

The completed bridge provides a bike-friendly east-west connection over the railroad tracks near 53rd Street to the Bay Street Shopping Center. A connection that will connect housing to jobs and residents to amenities.

Video: Albena Trandeva

Project Initiated in 2002

The initial idea of the bridge actually goes all the way back to the 1980’s when it was included in a General Plan update. Development for the bridge began in 2002 when the city was awash with Redevelopment money.

By 2008 planning for the project was well under way following community meetings and environmental review. The location a designated EPA Brownfields site also required significant environmental remediation.

Emeryville City Council at the time consisted of Ruth Atkin Nora Davis Ken Bukowski John Fricke and Richard “Dick” Kassis.

As the engineering design phase of the project was underway Councilmember Fricke and members of a design committee pushed back on the initial design deeming it not bike-friendly enough due to the inclusion of stairs/elevators and lack of ramps. The project was redesigned to incorporate the gently sloping approach ramps that would better allow bikes wheelchairs and strollers to access the bridge without the inclusion of elevators (similar to the Berkeley Pedestrian Overcrossing).

Projects Hits Snag in 2011

While the eventual design is indeed favorable to cyclists the additional time in the design phase and community feedback may have set the timeline of the project back longer than anyone could have foreseen.

In 2011 amid a state budget crisis then California Governor Jerry Brown successfully abolished local Redevelopment Agencies throwing the project in limbo.

The City of Emeryville sued the state to recoup the $12000000 allocated for the bridge and other projects. The legal battle spent several years in state courts with the city of Emeryville ultimately prevailing.

Following the successful lawsuit the project was reactivated in 2015. The right-of-way negotiations with the Union Pacific Railroad and other stakeholders would take an additional four years.

Councilmember John Bauters serving his appointed term as Mayor in 2017 committed to “putting a shovel in the ground” in a since deleted 2017 tweet. This proverbial “shovel” would not touch dirt for another three years. The project took on almost a mythical status within the community.

The bidding process began concurrently in 2018 with the winning bid going to Ghilotti Construction of Santa Rosa. Ghilotti officially kicked-off construction of the bridge in early 2020. It reached a significant construction milestone at the end of 2020 when the bowstring truss was hoisted into place.

The bridge pieces were fabricated and painted in Arizona and shipped to Emeryville. The distinct red hue is the same “International Orange” as the iconic Golden Gate bridge. The signature arch span is comprised of materials and components fabricated in three continents and six states.

Work Remains for Seamless Connection to other Bikeways

While the bridge is finally complete work remains to provide the seamless connection to the Bay Trail to the West and Emeryville Greenway/Mandela Parkway to the East.

“The Emery” housing project at the former Sherwin-Williams site is well underway and is one of the largest under-construction housing projects in the East Bay with 500 units.

Bay Street remains in a delicate state with the new owners pinning their hopes on the addition of a Grocery Store to help revitalize the declining shopping center and encourage consistent use of the bridge.

The Knights held a one-point lead with 2:26 left. But a botched snap on the punt attempt from LCA was recovered by St. Charles in the end zone.

The Comets led by five after a failed two-point attempt. But on the ensuing possession LCA quarterback Ju'Juan Johnson threw his second interception of the game.

The turnover handed the ball back to St. Charles which failed to grab a first down but handed the ball back to the Knights with no timeouts and only about a minute left to play.

LCA couldn't even produce a first down as the Comets defense iced the game.

""(This loss) definitely makes you appreciate it more the success we've been able to have"" LCA coach Trev Faulk said.

Miscues defined the night for LCA. Along with the botched snap the Knights also had two punts blocked two fumbles and two interceptions. They allowed 17 points off of turnovers and sunk into a 14-0 hole in the first quarter after the Knights threw an interception and had a fumble in consecutive possessions.

LCA fought back tying the game in the second quarter. But a blocked punt that was forced out of bounds by the Knights handed the Comets two more points to give them the 16-14 lead at halftime.

The Spaniard found himself on top of the timesheet at one stage in Q1 which ended with him berating Pierre Gasly over the Ferrari team radio for blocking him – the AlphaTauri driver was subsequently given an official warning when the duo appeared before the stewards.

But Q2 was when things really went downhill for Sainz who had a spin in Turn 11 where without even knowing it he clipped the wall and suffered rear-wing damage.

After a quick patch-up job back in the garage the 27-year-old had one last chance to try and set a time that would get him into Q3 – but he almost lost the car again and bowed out of qualifying still struggling with that compromised rear wing.

🇸🇦 Tough one today. I’ve been fast and comfortable all weekend and a single snap of oversteer has compromised Qualy and the race. I clipped the wall damaged the wing and had to abort the second lap. Confident on my pace. Let’s race tomorrow. 👉https://t.co/XOPvOaeKP5 pic.twitter.com/qMIMbtV4C8 — Carlos Sainz (@Carlossainz55) December 4 2021

“A bit of a shame because I was coming from a very strong FP3 a very strong Q1 and suddenly this snap in the middle of Turn 11 cost me a whole qualifying” Sainz told the Formula 1 website.

“I tapped the wall with the rear end-plate a touch I actually didn’t feel in the car and then when I looked in the mirror the end-plate was completely bent and obviously the rear wing was not delivering the downforce it should.

“Something to analyse something to look into what I could have done differently because it’s a snap of oversteer I was not expecting. This corner had been flat for me the whole qualy and for some reason on that lap I lost the rear. We’ll look at it and come back from it.”

Sainz is not the only Ferrari driver to have had hairy moments on the brand-new Jeddah Corniche Circuit because his team-mate Charles Leclerc suffered a hefty crash during FP2.

But the man from Madrid is not allowing his qualifying travails to affect his morale which is on a high following some strong recent performances that have solidified a promising first season with the Scuderia.

“Even with the rear wing bent like it was I was on a very strong lap until the rear wing properly gave up” said Sainz.

“So the confidence is still there – it’s been there all weekend and for the last four weekends actually. One small bump in the road but I feel comfortable and I feel happy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15bG9uZG9uLm5ld3MvbmV3cy91ay13b3JsZC1uZXdzL3ByaW1hcmstc2hhcmVzLXNuYXAtbmV3LXdpbnRlci0yMjM3MTc2NNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15bG9uZG9uLm5ld3MvbmV3cy91ay13b3JsZC1uZXdzL3ByaW1hcmstc2hhcmVzLXNuYXAtbmV3LXdpbnRlci0yMjM3MTc2NC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Primark shares a snap of new winter look but fans are distracted by one thing,"We have more newsletters

It’s officially the season to wrap up warm and stay cosy as temperatures are sending a chill down our spines.

But fashionistas around the country will be frustrated with the fact that covering up means it’s harder to show off their great dress sense underneath.

So if we absolutely have to layer on a thick coat  then at least let it be a stunning one.

And for Primark shoppers that’s exactly what they all seem to be in the market for.

Fortunately the discount retailer shared a trench coat that fans are all saying they need in their fabulous winter closets.

Mo Salah's 11pm post sums up Liverpool forward's incredible dedication to being the best

Mo Salah has highlighted once again his relentless dedication to being the best after he posted a photo of himself on social media late on Saturday night.

Earlier in the day the Liverpool forward had provided the assist for Divock Origi who scored a 94th minute winner at Wolves.

Salah has been in sensational form this term scoring 19 times in all competitions.

His appetite for goals has been clear throughout his time at Anfield but this term he appears to have gone up a level.

The Egyptian posted a photo of himself on Instagram swimming at 11pm holding up the peace sign to his followers.

It is not the first time this season that the Liverpool star has been doing extras late at night.

Following Liverpool’s 3-2 win over AC Milan in September in which he scored Salah posted a similar photo this time at 3am.

Have Your Say! Where should Salah have finish in the Ballon d'Or rankings? Tell us in the comments section

Despite the 29-year-old's efforts he was ranked seventh in the 2021 Ballon d'Or list which came as a surprise to many.

Salah was ranked below winner Lionel Messi Robert Lewandowski Jorginho N'Golo Kante Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Jurgen Klopp himself made his feeings clear saying: ""I was surprised about his position.

""Journalists vote for the Ballon d'Or so... if you think he should be higher up you should convince your colleagues!

""You can always give it to Lionel Messi for the career he's had but if you don't give it to Robert Lewandowski this time then he will never get it.

""And Mo should have been higher up definitely.""

Salah will play a key role if Liverpool are to regain their Premier League crown.

The Reds were unable to mount a meaningful defence of their title last term as they were hampered by injuries.

Their win at Molineux took them top momentarily to the summit moving above Chelsea and champions Manchester City before Pep Guardiola's men won at Watford and replaced the Reds.

Salah tweeted after the win at Wolves: ""It’s in our hands"".

Klopp will be desperately fearing the upcoming period for which the Egyptian will head off to the Africa Cup of Nations to represent his country.

The German though is confident that an agreement can be reached for Salah to stay on Merseyside for the crucial festives clashes against Chelsea and Leicester.

“It’s not decided yet. I am an optimistic person so I hope so but it’s not written in stone and not completely in our hands” he said."

The dam however isn't a major power source these days and a conflict is brewing over whether to tear down the expansive structure that has blocked the lower part of an acclaimed Southern river from flowing freely.

In late November seven organizations filed paperwork with the federal government that they hope will eventually persuade Georgia Power Co. to tear down the dam at Lake Tugalo northwest of Clemson in Oconee County.

They are trying to stop Georgia Power from conducting a major upgrade to the Tugalo dam arguing that the structure should instead be considered for removal.

The effort by environmentalists could take years but if successful tearing down the 160-foot tall Tugalo dam would mark one of the largest dam removal projects in the Carolinas and Georgia they say.

Dozens of dams have been removed in the region in the past 30 years but many have been on small streams and they are shorter than the one on the lower Chattooga.

All told about 4 miles of the lower Chattooga would be restored as well as several miles of the nearby Tallulah River in Georgia according to a Nov. 24 motion filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington.

Lake Tugalo sometimes spelled Tugaloo would no longer exist if the dam is eventually removed.

While the Chattooga's lower section is covered by lake water miles of river above the dam remain intact and unspoiled.

It is one of the few federally designated national wild and scenic rivers in the Carolinas and Georgia and the only one of its kind in South Carolina. The Chattooga River's rapids are considered some of the most challenging in the Southeast attracting paddlers from across the country.

""Deliverance"" a movie based on the James Dickey novel was filmed on the Chattooga in the 1970s. The movie was about friends who had a harrowing experience canoeing down a wild river before it was dammed. The Chattooga River extends about 60 miles through the mountains from North Carolina before flattening into Lake Tugalo.

Environmentalists say the river restoration would create whitewater rafting areas on the lower Chattooga restoring what's believed to be a substantial gorge now covered under the water of Lake Tugalo.

Tearing down the dam also would restore valuable river habitat for important plants some known to grow only in Georgia and South Carolina the Nov. 24 motion says. Those include the endangered Persistent Trillium a plant with a brilliant white flower that once was featured on a postage stamp.

In addition getting rid of the dam would allow forests to be restored eliminate greenhouse gases that are generated from operating the dam and save ratepayers millions of dollars for the cost of making dam repairs environmentalists say.

Removing the dam -- completed in 1923 -- is plausible because unlike many major lakes in the Carolinas and Georgia virtually no one lives on Lake Tugalo they say.

""The Chattooga River is a treasure for the country -- and this is impounding that last section of the river"" said Peter Raabe southeastern basin director for American Rivers. ""Now we have this opportunity to restore this gem of the Southeast.""

Environmental groups filing the motion include two of the nation's most prominent river advocacy groups American Whitewater and American Rivers as well as Upstate Forever of South Carolina the Georgia Canoeing Association Naturaland Trust of Greenville and the Chattooga Conservancy which operates in both states.

The Southern Environmental Law Center a non-profit legal service headquartered in Virginia is handling proceedings before the FERC.

Nicole Hayler director of the Chattooga Conservancy and Southern Environmental Law Center attorney Frank Holleman said getting rid of the dam is worth considering.

""We think there's a whole other set of rapids underneath the lake and conceivably world class rapids"" Hayler said noting that studies are still ongoing. Sediment has buried much of the old river bottom through the years.

Records show that Georgia Power plans to spend at least $24 million upgrading the dam at Lake Tugalo. The work would extend the life of the Tugalo powerhouse by four decades according to the environmental groups' FERC filing.

The environmentalists' call to study removing the dam arose after Georgia Power filed a request with the FERC to amend its current operating license for the structure.

A recent Federal Register notice says the company wants to replace and upgrade four generating units at the Tugalo powerhouse. Work proposed by Georgia Power at the dam includes upgrading four turbines; refurbishing generators; and replacing control room panels and spillway gates the notice says.

Georgia Power did not directly respond to questions about the need for the Tugalo dam except to say that it is part of a power generation mix. In an email the company said it operates 19 hydroelectric dams and some of ""these projects continue to deliver value for Georgia Power customers.""

The company also said it may remove two dams in other parts of Georgia. The Riverview and Langdale dams are being decommissioned the company said.

""Lake Tugalo dam is one of a network of hydro-electric facilities maintained and operated by Southern Company and Georgia Power as part of a diverse generation mix to serve millions of customers across the state"" the company said in the email. ""As a regulated utility Georgia Power works to regularly evaluate the state's current and future energy needs and realign our generation resources to ensure safe clean reliable and affordable power while also protecting and preserving our state's natural resources.""

Critics say work on the dam isn't needed and the relatively small amount of power produced could be replaced with solar farms. They also note that Georgia Power is building two new nuclear plants that will provide large amounts of energy.

The lower Chattooga River dam produced power for about 12500 homes in 2020 or about 1 percent of all the company's total power generation according to American Rivers.

Environmentalists say upgrading the dam now will only strengthen the power company's case when it formally seeks a new 40-year operating license in 2031. It would be harder for the federal government to turn down a new license if the company has spent tens of millions of dollars upgrading the dam Holleman and Raabe said.

The Southern Environmental Law Center's motion to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asks the agency to require a detailed environmental study of the dam repair plan and to ""fully consider decommissioning the dam"" when the existing license expires in 2036.

Dam removal efforts like the one at Lake Tugalo can take years to accomplish but the initiative has picked up steam across the country as environmental and outdoor recreation groups push to tear down dams no longer considered necessary to generate power or for other purposes.

In many cases the idea is to restore the natural flow of rivers for recreation and to improve wildlife habitat.

American Rivers which has 35000 members nationally says 69 dams were removed across the country in 2020.

In the Carolinas and Georgia since 1990 about 60 dams have been removed many of them on creeks and rivers smaller than the Chattooga according to American Rivers' database of dam removals.

Those include for instance a small dam on Congaree Creek near Columbia in 2019 and one at Burson Lake in Oconee County SC in 2020 the environmental group's data base shows.

Holleman the Southern Environmental Law Center attorney said he hopes the lower Chattooga dam will make the list of removed dams.

""The dam serves very little purpose now"" he said. ""Removing it would be an incredible event for natural resources and recreation across the entire country.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMS8xMi91cy9jb2FsLWFzaC1wb25kcy1wbGFudC1iYXJyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gambling 'America's Amazon',"Gambling ‘America’s Amazon’ Alabama’s largest utility plans to bury a heap of toxic coal waste in one of North America’s most biodiverse river systems. Experts say it will put one of the nation’s most pristine wetlands at risk.

A predawn phone call woke Ron Bledsoe with a jolt. It was his supervisor telling him to come in.

Bledsoe dressed and drove an hour to the power plant near Kingston Tennessee where he worked. He arrived at a shocking sight: A mountain of coal ash covering the road and a set of railroad tracks. It looked like the surface of the moon he recalled.

Hours earlier an embankment at the plant had ruptured flooding the area with gray muck. The spill was an environmental calamity and the fallout was immediate. The ash blanketed up to 400 acres killed hundreds of fish damaged more than a dozen homes and polluted nearby waterways. The clean-up took years and cost more than $1 billion.

Coal ash an umbrella term for the residue that’s left over when utilities burn coal is one of the United States’ largest kinds of industrial waste. It contains metals — such as lead mercury chromium selenium cadmium and arsenic — that never biodegrade. Studies have shown these contaminants are dangerous to humans and have linked some to cancer lung disease and birth defects.

For a time the Kingston incident catapulted coal ash into the public consciousness. But experts say it continues to pose a massive threat throughout the country.

About 400 miles southwest of Kingston a coal ash lagoon — which holds almost four times as much sludge as what spilled in Tennessee — is sitting in the Mobile–Tensaw Delta one of the most biodiverse areas of the United States with flora and fauna not known to exist anywhere else on Earth. Environmentalists community members and scientists fear the pond could someday unleash a Kingston-like catastrophe on southern Alabama and say leaving the coal ash in the delta is shortsighted and dangerous.

“We’ve got an A-bomb up the river” John Howard who lives in Mobile County and said he has been fishing in southern Alabama for decades said. “It’s just waiting to happen.”

‘Horror’ scene in Kingston

Most Americans had likely never heard of coal ash until three days before Christmas 2008 when the Kingston spill news broke.

Before the 1970s many utilities pumped their coal ash into the atmosphere attorney Lisa Evans who has focused on coal ash litigation for more than 20 years said. After Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1970 which regulated power plants’ air emissions some facilities began storing their coal ash in dirt ditches commonly known today as ash ponds or surface impoundments.

Hundreds of these sites now dot the country according to data that federal regulations require pond operators to publish and was compiled by Earthjustice a nonprofit that handles environmental lawsuits. Because coal plants produce electricity by converting large volumes of water into steam many of these waste sites are situated near river systems and flood zones. But 40 or fewer have a protective liner to contain the leftover ash and more than 200 have been shown to contaminate groundwater with toxic substances at levels that exceed federal safety standards the Earthjustice data shows.

With the Clean Air Act the nation traded one environmental problem for another Evans who works for Earthjustice said.

“One could see the billowing black smoke” Evans said. “You can’t see coal ash contaminating underlying groundwater (…) you can’t see the slow pollution of the adjacent river and the dying of the fish (…) It’s likely to be less dramatic.”

After 5.4 million cubic yards of coal ash spilled at the Kingston plant the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated the area as a Superfund site. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) which owned the plant spent more than $1 billion over six years to clean up the spill.

The aftermath “was like nothing I’ve ever seen before” Richard Moore who served as the inspector general for the TVA at the time said. “It was like a scene out of a horror movie.”

Tommy Johnson — like Bledsoe the worker who compared the Kingston spill to the moon’s surface — was at the facility that day. He spent six years working on the clean-up effort and said he believes exposure to the coal ash made him sick.

In 2018 Johnson joined more than 200 plaintiffs in suing Jacobs Engineering a TVA contractor hired to oversee the Kingston cleanup alleging Jacobs lied to workers about the ash’s toxicity. Bledsoe was also part of a suit which was filed in 2013. A jury eventually found that Jacobs failed to keep workers safe during the cleanup and that this failure could have caused the illnesses and injuries they suffered. The parties are now litigating over whether individual workers’ illnesses are a result of coal ash exposure.

“It’s (been) one ailment after another” Johnson said.

Today Johnson said he struggles to breathe and walk. Bledsoe according to court filings signed by his doctor suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease a disease that is typically caused by cigarette smoking. Bledsoe and his doctor have said he was never a smoker.

In a statement Jacobs spokesperson Heather Byrd told CNN the company “stands by its work assisting TVA with the difficult job of cleaning up the Kingston coal ash spill” adding that “the evidence will prove that the plaintiffs’ claimed conditions were not caused by exposure to coal ash at Kingston.”

TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks said in a statement that the utility has become an “industry leader in the safe secure management of coal ash.”

EPA’s ‘tipping point’

In response to the Kingston disaster the EPA set out to review the condition of more than 500 coal ash ponds across the United States.

“(Kingston) was almost a tipping point” Mathy Stanislaus who served as assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response from 2009 to 2017 said. “The reaction (at the EPA) was ‘We need to do something about this.’”

In 2015 the agency implemented its first-ever regulations on coal ash disposal forcing utilities across the country to begin closure and remediation of ponds that were unlined and contaminating groundwater above permitted levels.

The rule gives such ponds’ owners two closure options: seal the ash through a procedure known as capping-in-place or dig it up and move it to a lined landfill.

Depending on a pond’s size the EPA gave utilities between five and potentially 15 years to close them. In 2018 a federal court decision prompted the EPA to amend its rule. Today some utilities may have until 2036 to complete closure of certain ash ponds.

But environmental advocates say capping-in-place is not always an effective option especially for ponds where coal ash sits below the water table the point below which the ground is saturated with water because the cap does not prevent heavy metals from leaching into the surrounding area. They often point to a 2001 report by the Electric Power Research Institute in which researchers studied three unlined closed ponds and found that while groundwater quality improved at two it didn’t improve at the third where some ash sat below the water table.

Moreover they fear that as weather patterns become more extreme and less predictable leaving coal ash in an unlined pond is reckless because the potential for a catastrophic spill will always loom.

A nationwide challenge

There are an estimated 511 coal ash ponds in the United States according to a CNN analysis of the data compiled by Earthjustice. Nearly half — about 46% — are unlined and have been or will be closed in place. The utilities’ self-reported data shows around 160 are known to be contaminating groundwater but groundwater data gathered by the Environmental Integrity Project a nonprofit watchdog that advocates for better environmental law enforcement places that number at closer to 200. It’s unclear how many of those ponds sit below the water table or have direct contact with groundwater but around 60 sit in a flood zone.

Mapping coal ash ponds

Geologist Mark Hutson said that because the majority of the ponds are constructed along rivers — and typically in flood plains — many are likely to pollute the groundwater.

“The science points us clearly to excavation as the only way to protect public health and the environment” Michael Regan who ran North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality and now serves as EPA administrator said about ponds in that state in 2019.

In the 2015 rule the EPA declined to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste instead opting to regulate it as solid waste a category that can include everything from banana peels and candy wrappers to sewage and industrial sludge. That designation effectively allowed utilities to police themselves unless state regulators or private citizens which the law gives standing to seek enforcement through the courts intervened.

Stanislaus the former EPA assistant administrator said the agency declined to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste in part because business leaders raised concerns that doing so would hamstring their ability to recycle the substance which is frequently used in cement grout and other construction materials and because officials felt regulating coal ash as solid waste would still adequately prevent it from contaminating air and water.

That decision meant that initially states could regulate coal ash through existing water and waste programs. But it was a missed opportunity to enact stronger safeguards Dalal Aboulhosn the Sierra Club’s deputy director of policy advocacy and legal said.

“If EPA would have decided to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste we would have gotten the strictest of protections for communities” Aboulhosn said. “From cradle to grave we would be looking at coal ash as something that could harm communities and (making) sure it would be disposed of properly.”

In 2016 the federal government reclaimed some oversight when a new law authorized the EPA to review states’ programs for regulating pond closures. For states that didn’t develop their own programs the law required the EPA to develop one instead.

The EPA must still approve states’ programs but Evans said lax oversight and vague benchmarks — guidelines the agency published in 2017 say mainly that state programs must be “at least as protective as” federal regulations and should ensure public participation — have given states considerable leeway when regulating coal ash.

“The absence of (federal) requirements has left important criteria up in the air and fails to guarantee important safeguards nationally” Evans wrote in an email.

When President Joe Biden chose Regan to lead the EPA last December Evans hoped the pick would usher in more rigorous enforcement. Regan had firsthand experience with the consequences of coal ash pollution; In North Carolina he led the state’s department of environmental quality in the years following a spill.

In an interview with CNN last week Regan signaled the Biden EPA will indeed take a firmer stance on coal ash management.

While Regan did not provide specifics he said the agency is planning to announce details which he said could include additional regulatory actions soon. That announcement Regan said will give a “clearer picture of how the agency plans to move forward” nationwide.

“We’re pretty far down the road on this and we recognize the sense of urgency” Regan said.

Sources familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement is still being finalized told CNN they expect it to include decisions on a handful of applications for closure extensions at coal ash ponds across the country and notices to several facilities about compliance obligations.

In the meantime some state governments have taken it upon themselves and forced utilities to excavate their coal ash pits.

After a broken pipe unleashed more than 46000 cubic yards of coal ash from a retired power plant on the Dan River in 2014 near Eden North Carolina state officials enacted a law forcing the closure of all unlined coal ash ponds in the state ultimately requiring utilities to recycle the ash or put it in a lined landfill.

And in 2019 a Virginia law required Dominion Energy to excavate more than 27 million cubic yards of coal ash from ponds across the state.

But in other states including Alabama utilities still have the option to close ponds through cap-in-place.

It is one of the largest and most biodiverse river systems in North America; the region is home to at least 35 kinds of orchids and likely more turtle species than any other river system on Earth. At least 30 types of carnivorous plants live in the delta. Raines who has often referred to the delta as “America’s Amazon” points out one that eats insects.

Alabama’s ecosystems are particularly diverse because glaciers never covered the state during Earth’s last ice age unlike large swaths of what is now North America.

The delta is where Alabama Power’s James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant’s smokestacks tower above the treeline. Many refer to the plant named for the executive who led the utility from 1949 to 1952 as simply “Barry” or “Plant Barry.” It’s about 25 miles north of downtown Mobile sits on the Mobile River and forms a corridor of industrial facilities. At 597 acres Barry’s ash pond is nearly as large as the National Mall. A grassy berm dotted with yellow flowers lines the property’s edge and separates 21.7 million cubic yards of coal ash from the river.

“Coal ash is sitting there right on the edge of (the delta)” Raines said occasionally stopping his boat to pluck a plant from the water and marvel at it.

“If there were an accident (…) we would have lost you know one of America’s treasures and a treasure that people are only beginning to understand and explore.”

Alabama Power spent $30 million to construct Barry which opened in 1954. The plant was intended to meet the area’s rapidly expanding electricity needs. Mobile’s population exploded during World War II as the shipbuilding industry grew Mark VanLandingham a population studies professor at Tulane University said. Mobile was fairly developed by the 1950s; it had 17 movie theaters four hotels and two daily newspapers. The city which had about 174000 residents in 1956 was a manufacturing hub for pulp and paper products lumber and textiles. A guide to Mobile from 1957 boasted that the city was on its way to becoming one of the “great centers of trade and industry.”

But that didn't pan out. The city’s population peaked at roughly 200000 in 1960. As residents moved to suburbs and manufacturing began moving overseas Mobile’s population like many other post-industrial cities’ declined VanLandingham said.

As of 2019 census estimates showed the city of Mobile was home to almost 189000 people. About 18% of the city’s residents lived in poverty. That share was higher — about 21% — for Black Mobilians who made up more than half the city’s population.

With about 6000 employees Alabama Power is a major employer in the state. It provides energy to roughly 100000 customers in the city of Mobile. Its corporate parent Southern Company owns electric utilities in Georgia and Mississippi and is the third largest electric utility company in the country by market value.

In a state where storms are commonplace “the most important person who shows up at our door after a hurricane is the Alabama Power guy who has just turned our lights back on” said Casi Callaway who grew up in Mobile and spent 23 years as the executive director of Mobile Baykeeper an environmental nonprofit that aims to protect southern Alabama’s waters.

“We love our power company” she said.

Alabama Power’s choice

Alabama Power is poised to close the Barry pond through capping-in-place. Its process according to the closure plan filed with state environmental regulators last year would remove water from the pond to shrink its footprint by nearly half before filling the perimeter with soil and sealing the ash with a cover made from plastic crushed rock and artificial turf that the company has said is designed to “virtually eliminate infiltration of surface water.”

Records show the site has been contaminating groundwater for years. In its most recent groundwater monitoring report from 2020 Alabama Power revealed elevated levels of arsenic and cobalt near the Barry plant that exceeded groundwater protection standards by more than eight times and more than five times respectively. In 2018 state officials fined the company $250000 for arsenic pollution saying the company had “caused or allowed the unpermitted discharge of pollutants associated with ash pond wastewater from the Plant Barry Ash Pond to waters of the State.”

In a document filed with the state’s utility regulator last month company officials acknowledged environmental groups’ concerns about the cap-in-place method’s effectiveness toward protecting groundwater and that “the risk of an adverse outcome remains” but wrote the company believes its plans for Barry’s ash pond and about 10 other coal waste sites in the state meet federal requirements and that requiring full ash removal would “dramatically” increase costs and “adversely impact” nearby residents’ quality of life through “decades of constant truck traffic.”

“It’s about the money” Moore the former TVA inspector general who now lives near Barry in Baldwin County said. “I believe the corporate culture and the corporate mindset at most utilities is the same way: If they can do it on the cheap that's what they're going to do.”

Alabama Power has estimated that it will spend about $860 million to close the Barry ash pond by capping it in place and an additional $36 million for post-closure maintenance according to its closure plan. Jack Bonnikson a company spokesperson declined to say what the company estimated excavation would cost.

But no excavation cost would compare to cleaning up a spill Evans the environmental attorney said.

“It is infinitely cheaper to scoop ash out of a pond and truck it to a lined landfill than to excavate it out of a river and out of people’s yards” she said.

Frank Holleman a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) who has litigated against utilities over coal ash contamination for over a decade said utilities often misrepresent how much each method will cost.

“As a general rule they overstate the cost of excavation and they understate the cost of cap-in-place” Holleman said.

In addition Holleman said utilities often prefer capping-in-place to avoid the “managerial hassle” of transporting coal ash.

In written responses to CNN Bonnikson challenged Holleman’s claim. He said cost estimates often change as work on a project progresses and that the engineers and geologists who develop cost estimates are expected to adhere to professional standards.

Closing these ponds has sometimes come at a high price for utilities though often their customers are footing large shares of the bill.

Duke Energy for example has estimated it will spend $8 billion to $9 billion to comply with North Carolina’s law and excavate 31 ponds in that state in addition to four in South Carolina.

Bill Norton a spokesperson for Duke Energy couldn’t say how much of that total pertained to the North Carolina ponds. But he said it made up “the vast majority” of the multibillion-dollar estimate and that about $3.8 billion — or at least 40% — will be passed on to North Carolina retail customers.

But customers’ payments aren’t just going toward the cost of pond closures. They’re also lining shareholders’ pockets.

Because many utilities operate as natural monopolies where state regulators control prices the companies’ profits often depend on how well they control costs. In 1923 the US Supreme Court ruled that to ensure that utilities remain financially sound and can continue to provide services they should be entitled to recoup the costs of certain investments and profit from them.

Utility regulators and courts are supposed to make sure such investments are reasonable and necessary and that the costs passed onto customers are appropriate.

But Dave Rogers a deputy director at the Sierra Club said they are often politicized and customers don’t always get “a fair shake.” Jim Lazar a former senior adviser at the Regulatory Assistance Project said the result is that today’s customers end up paying for earlier generations’ mistakes.

It’s unclear how much Alabama Power stands to profit from the Barry closure. Bonnikson declined to provide a figure but a recent filing with the state’s public service commission outlined financial information related to how the company will comply with government mandates next year.

Anna Sommer a consultant at Energy Futures Group who has advised groups working toward improving Alabama’s public utility regulation process reviewed the filing for CNN and estimated that the utility would likely return around $200 million to shareholders in the coming years as a result of the Barry pond closure. Sommer’s assessment was reviewed by two ratemaking experts for CNN: Lazar and Stephen Hill an independent consultant who has provided expert testimony in ratemaking cases.

Debating Alabama Power’s plan

In an email Bonnikson said the utility’s annual filings “transparently provided estimated costs for compliance and associated rate calculations.” He declined to comment on Sommer’s estimate saying only that the utility “will not validate estimates or calculations (CNN) may have received from a third-party group.”

In March community members environmentalists and coal industry advocates gathered at a Hampton Inn in Saraland a Mobile suburb near Plant Barry for a public hearing to comment on Alabama Power’s closure plan.

Some speakers including Jonathan Hale who runs an Alabama-based mining company supported the utility’s plan. Hale said he was concerned that transporting the waste to a landfill could lead to ash spills on roads and put unnecessary wear and tear on Alabama’s highways.

Many speakers opposed Alabama Power’s plan. One woman became emotional as she recounted learning there was an unlined coal ash pond near her home. A man compared the Barry pond to a rotting tooth that needs to be taken out a cancerous skin lesion that should be removed and mold growing on drywall that needs to be gutted and replaced.

Nicholas Williams a 29-year-old sales and support representative for a small online hunting gear retailer stood at the microphone in a T-shirt and baseball cap.

“Twenty years I’ve been poking around up there looking for deer and hogs and ducks and big ol’ flatheads” Williams said. “Looking for game but also looking for the peace that a vast mass of calm waters and cypress trees brings. Looking for a sense of being and perspective that you find when you stand on top of the Indian mounds (…) and realize that you’re really very small in the grand scheme of things.”

For Williams being in the delta is a way of life. He and his wife Sarah bought a home perched on Tensaw Lake a tributary in the delta three years ago. The couple have chickens in their front yard — the rooster is named Sue after the Johnny Cash song — and a collection of birds Nicholas has killed is mounted on their living room wall. He said he worries that a spill at Barry could destroy the delta that he hopes to one day share with his children.

“I believe leaving the coal ash pond in place is taking a chance with something that should not be left to chance” he said. “We don’t have to jeopardize the Mobile–Tensaw Delta.”

While state regulators approved Alabama Power’s plans for the Barry pond in July EPA Administrator Regan told CNN last month that his agency is “actively investigating (…) the Plant Barry situation.”

“We understand the concerns about this facility in Alabama” Regan said. “The last administration’s leadership failed to act on these concerns. This administration will act to protect communities and based on my prior experience if there is coal ash in contact with groundwater that’s putting the health and safety of communities at risk and requires our attention.”

‘Nothing God can do’

When Hurricane Ida approached the Gulf Coast in late August Cade Kistler and the Mobile Baykeeper staff prepared for the worst.

At their downtown Mobile office they put trash bags over computers and moved them away from windows. They prepared their boat and test tubes to take water samples from the river and check for coal ash. Kistler Baykeeper’s interim director made sure his family had enough food in case the power at their home went out.

After the storm made landfall in Louisiana Kistler drove to Barry to look for signs of damage.

He put a chainsaw in the back of his Subaru in case he needed to cut through fallen trees. The rain was still heavy he said recalling how his car shook from the wind as he crossed Mobile Bay on the highway. Kistler who remembered feeling cautiously optimistic because Ida didn’t directly hit the area said he didn’t see any signs indicating a disaster had struck Barry.

Meanwhile Ida was carving a path of destruction across the country killing at least 80 people across eight states. By any measure it was one of the strongest tropical storms to ever hit Louisiana.

“We got off really light” Kistler said. “It really is just a matter of when a similar storm (…) hits coastal Alabama.”

When Kistler and his staff learn a hurricane has formed in the Gulf they worry about two disaster scenarios at Barry: its dam collapsing or that river water will overtop the dam sending coal ash surging into the delta.

A coal ash spill wouldn’t be southern Alabama’s first brush with environmental disaster. In 2010 an explosion on a British Petroleum (BP) oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers and set off a domino effect that caused oil and natural gas to leak into the Gulf for nearly three months.

The Gulf is still recovering from the calamity which the EPA has called the largest marine drilling-related oil spill in history. As of 2018 researchers were still detecting oil contamination in thousands of fish in the Gulf of Mexico according to one study.

“You couldn't walk on the beach” Mobile resident Madelyn King said. “There were tarballs washing up all the time.”

The BP spill hobbled leisure tourism in the region. Visitor spending in Louisiana dropped by $247 million in 2010 according to a report prepared for the state’s tourism agency by Tourism Economics a consulting firm that analyzes global travel data.

Callaway who was leading Mobile Baykeeper at the time (she left Baykeeper for a job as Mobile’s chief resilience officer in May) said southern Alabama dodged a bullet.

“The power of the Mobile River and the delta pushing water out of the bay made sure we didn't have much oil come into the bay” Callaway said. “If something happens with the coal ash pit there’s no natural protection. There’s nothing God can do to protect us from that.”

If the Barry pond were breached the volume of slurry could eclipse the amount of oil that spilled into the Gulf during the BP disaster.

“They would be dealing with that for God-knows-how-many years“ Keith Johnston an attorney for the SELC said. “It would be devastating for the city of Mobile and the bay. A lot of people rely on that bay for their livelihood.”

When an environmental disaster strikes Black and Brown communities often suffer the worst consequences Aboulhosn the Sierra Club deputy director said.

“Across the board communities that are people of color that don't have the socioeconomic levels of some predominantly White communities are the ones that are shouldering this burden” she said.

Joe Womack who grew up in Mobile runs an environmental advocacy organization in the city’s Africatown neighborhood a historic Black community that is choked by highways and industrial facilities. He said he worries Africatown where residents still talk about the ash from a nearby paper mill that would rain down on the community years ago would continue to bear the brunt of industrial pollution and its consequences.

For “folks that are at the bottom end of the totem pole” Womack said “(it’s) just like anything else: You see things happen to you more in a negative sense.”

“The thing with Barry” he said is “just more of the same.”

In his remarks to CNN last week EPA administrator Regan — the first Black man and second person of color to hold the position — called environmental justice and equity “a pillar” for the administration.

“What we’re saying is ‘We see you we hear you and we’re responding’” Regan said. “Too often whether it’s the coal ash pond or a chemical refinery or a landfill our communities are disproportionately impacted by exposure to pollution.”

The SELC and Mobile Baykeeper have called on Alabama Power to change tack and excavate the pond. The organizations argue the utility’s plan will allow groundwater contamination to continue and that the potential for a disaster will remain if the coal ash is not removed.

Bonnikson declined to say whether the utility has studied how far coal ash might travel if its dam was breached but told CNN in an email that the company’s “structural stability analysis and regular inspections demonstrate the dikes are safe and secure and continue to function as designed.”

In 2010 engineers — hired by the EPA to conduct Barry’s dam safety assessment as part of the national review launched following the Kingston spill — determined that Barry’s dam was in “satisfactory” condition but had a “significant” hazard potential because a failure could cause major damage to the environment wildlife and habitat if coal ash were released into the river.

Alabama Power has modeled potential flooding in the area with the help of third-party experts but Bonnikson declined to provide CNN with the data used to run the model. In an email he wrote that the experts’ models for “extreme river and tropical flood events (showed) no overtopping of the ash pond’s existing dike wall” and that “Even a 500-year tropical flood with an additional 5 feet of storm surge showed no impact on Plant Barry or its ash pond.”

“Since 1965 15 different tropical storms and hurricanes have passed within 50 miles of the plant site with no impact to plant operations or the ash pond” Bonnikson wrote.

Storm path data from 1980 to 2020 shows that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico aren’t necessarily becoming more frequent and an analysis of synthetic aperture radar data which can be used to track how water saturates land showed no notable flooding near Barry after heavy rainfall. A predictive analysis of flood gauge data at Barry didn’t suggest large deviations from the norm in the coming years.

There is some evidence that more storms are reaching a higher intensity although there’s some indication that the frequency of storms may be going down Michael Bell an atmospheric science professor at Colorado State University said. In 2020 for example researchers at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and NOAA looked at nearly 40 years of data and found the probability of storms reaching major hurricane status — Category 3 or higher — increased decade after decade.

Sean Powers a marine scientist and professor at the University of South Alabama said changing weather patterns are his biggest concern about the Barry ash pond.

“Everything now is based on our understanding of the risk that exists now” Powers said.

“Obviously sea level will rise” he said. “Storms will increase at least in intensity if not frequency and all of those pose serious risk for the release of that material.”

While environmentalists keep an eye out for the next Ida some scientists say a less visible and more insidious crisis is already underway.

“Eventually (a disaster) is going to happen” geologist Mark Hutson whom the SELC hired to review Alabama Power’s closure plan for the Barry pond last year said. “In the meantime there will be decades of slow release of metals into the swampy areas.”

In his report for the SELC Hutson concluded that to effectively close any coal ash storage site the waste must be permanently isolated from water including groundwater and that the Barry pond’s location — on a meandering river system’s floodplain — was an unsuitable place to permanently store waste.

“No (new) waste disposal facility” he determined “would be permitted in this physical location.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3M0amF4LmNvbS9uZXdzL2dlb3JnaWEvMjAyMS8xMi8wNC92b2d0bGUtbW9uaXRvcnMtc2VlLW1vcmUtZGVsYXlzLWV4dHJhLTFiLWZvci1udWNsZWFyLXBsYW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vogtle monitors see more delays extra $1B for nuclear plant,"ATLANTA – Monitors say even the most recent pushback of completion dates for two new nuclear reactors in Georgia isn't enough to account for all the delays and increased costs they see coming.

Testimony filed Wednesday with the Georgia Public Service Commission by engineer Don Grace and others predict that the third reactor at Plant Vogtle near Augusta won't meet the most recent range of July 2022 to September 2022 set by Georgia Power Co. Instead Grace said ongoing delays suggest a range of November 2022 to February 2023.

Grace said the fourth reactor currently scheduled for completion between April and June of 2023 might not come online until sometime in late 2024.

The Public Service Commission an elected five-member regulatory body pays Grace and others to monitor construction. Grace said the problems are “largely attributable” to electrical wiring problems that have already sparked increased scrutiny from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

“This level of schedule performance does little to inspire confidence in the company’s ability to accurately forecast progress on the project” testified Public Service Commission analyst Steven D. Roetger and nuclear engineer William R. Jacobs. “We have testified in many prior (proceedings) that the schedules provided by the company are not achievable.”

Georgia Power spokesperson Jeffrey Wilson said the company is holding to its current completion estimates and “will continue to respond and provide our perspective” through the Public Service Commission cost monitoring process.

More delay Grace said could mean $1 billion more in spending on a project already on track to cost $28.7 billion not counting $3.68 billion that original contractor Westinghouse paid back to owners after going bankrupt.

Georgia Power a unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. owns 45.7% of the project. Other owners include Oglethorpe Power Co which serves most Georgia electric cooperatives and the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia which serves municipal utilities. Florida’s JEA and some other municipal utilities and cooperatives in Florida and Alabama also are obligated to buy power from the plant.

Oglethorpe and MEAG say overruns have already tripped an agreement requiring Georgia Power to pay all the remaining overruns with the others selling shares of their ownership to Georgia Power equal to the additional costs that the private utility pays. Georgia Power disagrees. The owners signed an agreement Oct. 29 to delay the resolution of the disagreement.

Grace said company estimates have “repeatedly been demonstrated to be unrealistic and unreliable.” He said the company will need longer than the four months that it projects to load nuclear fuel and complete testing that Nuclear Regulatory Commission supervision could slow things down more and that company proposals to push back some work until after it starts loading fuel will make everything slower and harder. He said the company is submitting many fewer notices to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission than planned showing work has been completed and tested.

Grace also warned that construction performance on Vogtle's fourth nuclear reactor is not improving with only 0.65 hours of actual work completed for every hour planned in the six weeks ended Oct. 17.

Georgia Power said for years that Unit 3 would be in commercial operation by November 2021 but has pushed back that deadline three times since May. When approved in 2012 the estimated cost was $14 billion with the first electricity being generated in 2016.

Besides devastating San Francisco and many North Coast towns the 1906 earthquake also changed the course of railroad and lumber company history in northern Mendocino County.

In anticipation of a railroad being built through Branscomb and then down the South Fork of Eel River “Henry Neff ‘Pap’ Anderson a wealthy Washington business man bought out the Bear Harbor Lumber Company and its timber holdings and rail line. Anderson incorporated his company in 1903 with $500000 dollars and proceeded to build a large state-of-the-art lumber mill and a sizable mill town which he named Andersonia. Andersonia and its mill were located across the river from the future town of Piercy near the mouth of Indian Creek where it enters into the South Fork of Eel River from the west.

Many Southern Humboldt men found employment constructing the mill town and holding pond dam. In the years preceding the mill’s opening millions of board feet of old growth redwood logs had been harvested by the Southern Humboldt Lumber company from their extensive timber holdings between the Andersonia and the coast and were being stored in a holding pond behind a 30 foot high by 80 feet wide dam.

Rather than duplicate our feature article’s telling of the tale we will simply summarize and say that owner Henry Neff Anderson’s tragic death at his mill in late 1905 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake dealt fatal blows to the mill’s opening and operating.

This week Odd Old News will share a little known account of the history of the Andersonia Mill that was written in 1937 by longtime northern Mendocino county homesteader and school teacher the remarkable Mrs. Minnie Lilley. She and her husband Bill were caretakers for the Andersonia mill site for many years and at one time lived in the house built for Mr. Anderson on the property. Her dates and estimates of the amount of old growth held in the log pond vary from most accounts but Mrs. Lilley’s account has great value as it was written by one who lived the history. Her biography is a story in itself she is best known as the owner of the iconic tourist stop Lilley’s World Famous Tree House at the Lilley Redwood Park just south of the new Rosewarne bridge over the South Fork. We turn to her to tell the story of the “Million Dollar Mill that Never Milled”.

FATE PRESERVED REDWOODS OF EEL’S SOUTH FORK IN GARBERVILLE SECTION

THREE STACKS OF ANDERSONIA MILL BEAR MUTE EVIDENCE TO FAILURE OF MAN’S MACHINERY TO BITE INTO HUMBOLDT LOGS—FATAL ACCIDENT TO OWNER AND 1906 EARTHQUAKE BALK DESIRES TO LAY WASTE TO VIRGIN WATERSHED COVERAGE IN INTERESTS OF REAPING GOLDEN HARVEST.

(By Minnie S. Lilley in the Ukiah Redwood Journal) As you travel north or south over the Redwood highway near the Humboldt line you may look across the south fork of Eel river and see three tall smoke stacks outlined against the green of a virgin forest.

These smoke stacks mark the ruin of the old Andersonia mill. Let us begin with the history of Andersonia which dates from the organization of the old Bear Harbor Lumber company. Their operations began in the early nineties. Ties posts and other split products also tan bark were their output. They had a wharf at Bear harbor where shipment was made and supplies obtained for the country around Garberville and elsewhere. From Bear harbor after climbing a steep incline their railroad extended along the banks of Indian creek as far as Moody several miles inland. At Moody a large warehouse was built supplies were kept and bark weighed for shipment. Here mule teams came over the old Garberville-Moody road. The tinkle of the bells on the mules could be heard for miles. They were laden with wool for shipment and on return trips took much needed supplies to the country around Garberville Briceland and elsewhere. In 1903 the Bear Harbor Lumber company whose principal owners were Stewart Hunter and Cooper sold to the Southern Humboldt Lumber company. Henry Neff Anderson was the president of this company and associated with him were George McPherson J. A. McPherson and A. W. Middleton. Anderson was a mill man of wide experience having operated mills in Pennsylvania and Aberdeen Washington. Vision Determined Site

Early in 1903 the site of the mill was chosen at the mouth of Indian creek. It was chosen here because the stockholders of the company believed that eventually the Western Pacific would build to Eureka along the banks of the south fork instead of the main Eel and they planned shipping their lumber by rail as well as by boat as Bear harbor is only a summer harbor. This dream was not to be realized because the survey of the road maps and all data were lost during the fire and earthquake of 1906. The survey of the road along the main Eel was preserved and many think that the engineers rather than incur expense of another survey along the south fork built along the main Eel using data that had not been lost. The railroad from Bear harbor to Moody about 12 miles distant from the ocean was a standard gauge and Southern Humboldt Lumber company extended it to the site of their mill. Timbers for the mill were sawed at Aberdeen Washington and brought in over the railroad. A small portable mill operated by Burt McKee sawed small stuff. This was used in construction of a large warehouse which invariably housed $lOOOO worth of goods. Dwelling houses cook house bunk houses blacksmith shop etc. were built. The machinery of the mill was the finest that could be obtained and was brought to Andersonia by boat to Bear harbor then by the railroad. When they went to install the carriages they found that the plans were too narrow. This had to be remedied to make machinery fit. Owner Fatally Injured

While the workmen were engaged in the work Anderson visited the mill one morning. The workmen were hoisting a beam to support the timbers where others had been cut away to make machinery fit. The timbers were attached to a cable and hoisting done with a donkey engine. The beam remained suspended before placing and Anderson not understanding cause of the delay ordered workmen to proceed. The timber slipped from position and struck Anderson a glancing blow on the head. He was carried to the “big company house” as it was called across Indian creek. Drs. Lendrum and McCornack of Fort Bragg were called and they performed the operation of trepanning the skull. On the ninth day after the operation October 23 1905 Anderson died as inflammation had set in. The blow affected his power of speech so that he never spoke after the injury. His body was packed in ice taken over railroad to Moody thence by team to Fort Bragg. From there the long journey by rail began to Altoona Pennsylvania where the remains were interred at his old home. Anderson left a young wife having been married only a short time to Cora Patterson who had nursed his first wife in her last illness. He also left a large family of grown sons and daughters. Litigation soon developed and all work was suspended never to be resumed. Anderson’s sons had their homes and interests in Aberdeen Washingon and none of them cared to leave Washington to operate at Andersonia Cruisers and prospective buyers were numerous for months after Anderson’s death. Early in 1906 a man by the name of Trumbell was very much interested in securing the holdings for his son Trumbell preferred a mill with a steel frame but this obstacle was overcome and he went to San Francisco to complete arrangements for the purchase of the property. He experienced the fire and earthquake of 1906 and this so embittered him with California that he would have none of it. The next prospective buyer was a man by the name of Hicks. The Hicks-Hauptman Lumber company operated in Oregon. Hicks and several associates visited the mill and their cruisers spent several weeks on the property. Hicks experienced some difficulty in obtaining funds with which to finance the proposition and in a fit of despondency committed suicide. As Hicks was the chief instigator his associates were not interested enough to complete the deal. The Mill Today

How well I remember the night when the caretaker of long years W. G. Lilley and the wife who had shared the trust wept tears of anguish when they heard the creaking and groaning of the timbers of the old mill a last dying wail of an enterprise never to be. The storms of November 1919 were unusually severe and on the night of November 19 1919 the swollen waters of Eel river and Indian creek so undermined the structure that morning revealed the mill in a state of collapse.Prior to this the earthquake of 1906 storms and ravages of time had all taken their toll of the once proud structure whose output was to have been 150000 feet of lumber per day. To feed its two big engines of 110 horsepower 12000 acres of virgin timber estimated at more than a half million feet formed the background. After the collapse of the mill the half million dollars of machinery and engineering perfection were fast forgotten.The machinery was removed from the structure and remains housed on the property today in a wonderful state of preservation. The boiler room is the most completely intact unit of the ruin. The boilers still lie in their brickwork bed undisturbed by the ravages of time. A concrete base supports the immense flywheel which hangs between the twin engines. Trees over three feet in diameter have grown up on the property since the hum of activity at Andersonia ceased. You may find many large redwoods with its wreckage of iron vines and whatnot all in tangled confusion. The dam which held 1000000 feet of logs went out in 1924.

Today the bleaching ruins are an attraction for tourists of the Redwood highway who stand awestruck when you tell them the story of the mill that never turned a wheel”(Healdsburg Tribune Enterprise and Scimitar 7/24/1939).

(Contrary to the date that Mrs. Lilley used Mr. Anderson’s accident happened on the 28th of October resulting in his death on November 6th 1905. Other estimates of how many board feet went out to sea when the dam broke in 1924 range from 6-15 million board feet).

Mrs. Lilley didn’t live long enough to see that the old growth forests that she loved did eventually get cut down. Around 1950 after a small scale reopening of the Andersonia mill by the Anderson family in the late 1930’s-‘40’s Tom Dimmick leased the mill from the Andersonia Lumber Company and acquired its timber rights. Dimmick modernized the mill operated it from 1950 to 1972 and created several hundred miles of timber haul roads between Andersonia and the coast. Other timber companies continued to harvest the vast forest until the formation of Redwood Forest Forest International in 1997 “by a group of community leaders who wanted to have a positive response to the timber wars one that benefited the community. The original mission was to acquire large tracts of land that had been heavily logged over during the industrial timber years and bring it into community control”(Mendocino Beacon 2019 ).

With some 50000 acres having been purchased by 2007 RFFI began their mission of establishing community based forests for important biodiversity habitat through “stream-by-stream” watershed and forest restoration projects.

The 1906 earthquake that destroyed the tracks and trestles built by the Southern Humboldt Lumber Company stranded the Bear Harbor Lumber Company No. 1 “Gypsy” steam locomotive at the railroad depot at Moody.

In 1958 local timber operator Rogan Coombs Grant Anderson Jr. (grandson of H.N. Anderson) and other railroad enthusiasts rescued it transporting it first to Andersonia where it sat for some years before being donated the Ft. Humboldt Logging Museum.

As a flight from Colorado Springs to Phoenix was taxiing a man opened the rear galley door and jumped out.

The Southwest Airlines passenger then ran to an airport fire station and barricaded himself in a dorm room.

A 30-year-old suspect has been booked for two felony counts of trespass police say.

While Southwest Airlines Flight 4236 was taxiing at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix Arizona on Saturday morning authorities say a passenger opened a rear galley door and jumped out of the plane.

The man ""exited"" the plane shortly after it arrived from Colorado Springs Colorado a Southwest Airlines spokesperson told Insider.

After he jumped Capt. Todd Keller of the Phoenix Fire Department told Insider that the man ran along the runway and into an airport fire station. He then locked himself in a dorm room.

""As soon as we asked him to unlock the door he unlocked the door"" Keller said. The man was then evaluated treated for a leg injury and transported to a hospital he continued.

""There was great communication from Sky Harbor and from Phoenix Police Department to the Phoenix Fire Department"" Keller said. ""Everybody was dedicated talking the whole time and in constant communication so that we were able to take care of the patient and safely get him to the hospital.""

A Phoenix Police Department spokesperson told Insider that the sole suspect has been identified as 30-year-old Daniel Ramirez. He has been booked for two felony counts of trespass.

""Local authorities responded to the situation and shortly after the flight continued to its designated gate with all remaining Customers and Crew"" a Southwest Airlines spokesperson said.

The plane reached the gate after a short delay KPNX reported.

Insider reached out to Sky Harbor International Airport. A spokesperson did not provide a comment.

The flight's captain stopped the plane and notified air traffic control. Local authorities responded to the scene and the plane continued to the gate with remaining customers and crew ""shortly after"" Landson said.

Initial reports came in around 8 a.m. when multiple agencies responded to Southwest Flight 4236. Southwest says the flight was coming from Colorado Springs when a passenger onboard got out of the plane through a rear galley door as it was taxiing to the gate. The airline says that at point the captain stopped the plane and notified air traffic controllers.

Phoenix fire crews say the passenger walked over to a nearby fire station where he locked himself in a dormitory room. Firefighters were able to get him to unlock the door a few minutes later and he was taken to the hospital for his injuries.

It’s not clear how the person was able to get out of the plane.

At around 8 a.m. flight 4236 coming into Phoenix from Colorado Springs experienced a 30-year-old man jumping out of a door from the back of the plane and locking himself in the fire department nearby said Capt. Todd Keller with the Phoenix Fire Department said.

The airplane's captain stopped the plane and contacted air traffic control said Dan Landson with Southwest Airlines. Authorities arrived on the scene and the rest of the flight's passengers were able to get to their gate.

""After a few minutes firefighters were able to get the adult male to unlock the door where he was then evaluated treated and transported to a local hospital for a lower extremity injury"" Keller said.

It's not known why the man jumped out of the plane or what the extent of his injury is.

Hours later Phoenix Police identified the man as Daniel Ramirez. He's being booked into jail on suspicion of two counts of felony trespassing.

Daniel Ramirez

Phoenix Police said of the incident ""We are aware of this incident and at this time the investigation is ongoing.""

Keller with Phoenix Fire says the incident although unexpected was handled well by those involved.

""They were in constant communication as soon as this person was on the runway. Sky Harbor control tower had eyes on him the entire time and that’s how they notified us. It just shows you how much of a well-oiled machine they are out there"" Keller said.

Travelers respond to the ordeal

April and Sean Kelly flew in from Oregon and they're wondering why would somebody do this – saying ""why and how I mean how would you jump off a plane?""

Billy Richardson from Denver remarked ""I would actually look to the stewardess and the people on the flight to help. I would expect that they would have been trained to know their job.""

Gary Keys who is also from Denver says ""I would basically just disarm them and put them down in about less than 30 seconds. You have to take action …""

Dealing with unruly passengers is a growing issue. As of late fall Sky Harbor staff and police have responded to nearly 3000 calls of disruptive customers and assaults.

Nationally the Federal Aviation Administration reported more than 5400 unruly passenger reports so far this year.

Daniel Ramirez 30 years old now faces potential felony charges following the bizarre incident on Saturday morning.

Southwest Airlines flight WN4236 from Colorado Springs was an otherwise uneventful flight that landed at Phoenix Sky Harbor at around 8:25 am on Saturday. According to a company spokesperson Ramirez somehow managed to open one of the main exit doors at the back of the aircraft.

“Initial reports indicate that while the flight was taxing to the gate a Customer onboard exited the aircraft via a rear galley door” the airline explained in a statement. “The flight’s Captain stopped the aircraft and notified Air Traffic Control (ATC)” the statement continued.

The man who has been identified locally as Ramirez then ran into the airport fire station and managed to lock himself into a dormitory room. Phoenix Fire Department Captain Todd Keller continues the story:

“After a few minutes firefighters were able to get the adult male to unlock the door where he was then evaluated treated and transported to a local hospital for a lower extremity injury” the fire captain added.

The Captain of the Boeing 737 aircraft was able to continue taxiing the plane to the gate where the other passenger deplaned as normal.

What’s even more unusual about this case is that Ramirez appears to have opened one of the main exit doors which is normally guarded by a flight attendant. Opening one of these doors would normally activate an emergency escape slide although this system can be deactivated by a flight attendant.

In recent months there have been several cases of passengers using emergency exits to get out of aircraft. In one recent incident a passenger onboard a United Express branded aircraft managed to open an emergency exit and jump out of the plane while it was taxiing for takeoff at Los Angeles International Airport.

In another incident a man onboard a delayed American Airlines flight tired of waiting onboard the aircraft and instead activated the overwing emergency exit and jumped onto the wing of the plane."

BUFFALO N.Y. — The Buffalo Starbucks employees seeking to unionize are getting some more national support.

Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is holding a virtual town hall Monday at 8 p.m.

Workers at three local stores are in the midst of their vote. Ballots must be submitted to the national labor relations board by December 8.

If it passes the stores would be the first corporate-owned Starbucks locations in the country to unionize.

Employees have said the company is continuing to try to bust up the union before it starts which Starbucks has denied.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2Rob3VzZWtlZXBpbmcuY29tL2hvbGlkYXlzL2NocmlzdG1hcy1pZGVhcy9hMzgzOTM2MTkvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWNocmlzdG1hcy1ob2xpZGF5LWN1cHMtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks' 2021 Holiday Tumbler Cups Are Jeweled and Dazzling in Stunning Christmas Colors,"Starbucks has rolled out most of its 2021 Holiday merchandise collection including coffee cold cups tumblers insulated hot beverage cups and seasonal items like ornaments.

The coffee chain is also restocking some of its most popular coffee cups being released in its larger winter collection.

Social media users have spotted more of these limited edition cups in Starbucks cafés located within retailers malls and some airport locations.

Starbucks' 2021 Holiday merchandise is also being sold online by resellers at a markup.



With Thanksgiving over the holiday season is in full swing. Starbucks fans will be jolly when they hear that the coffee retailer has gone ahead and restocked many of the most popular 2021 holiday merchandise that debuted in November.

The coffee giant unveiled a sampling of its back in October (shortly after revealing the highly anticipated Halloween cups!) teasing at least 10 new cold cups tumblers insulated coffee mugs and seasonal additions like ornaments. As any eagle-eyed Starbucks customer would tell you the amount of new merchandise and coffee-friendly gifts that made it into stores was impressive. Social media users have shared snippets of seasonally appropriate Starbucks cups for the winter season.

There are plenty of stainless-steel infused options for coffee fans to choose from featuring ombré designs in pink and white motifs complete with rainbow-like iridescent shine. Starbucks has also introduced more than a few new gradient cold cups and insulated coffee tumblers that will seamlessly fit into any collector's compendium. Most of these cups are Grande and Venti-sized (16oz and 24oz respectively) and are priced between $19.95 and $24.95 in all Starbucks locations.

Of course coffee aficionados are most excited about the chain's Christmas-themed merchandise including a beautiful trio of jeweled tumblers in an array of festive colors. Social media users have noticed that a few Target cafés have also carried Grande-sized versions of these intricate cold cups which have practically flown off shelves since their debut.

Starbucks' most popular new addition is its new collection of soft-touch bling cold cups — namely this pearlescent white edition (which also comes in an ornament version!). The cup retails for $19.95 but online resellers have been successful in or more.

Chatter online indicates that the bling cups swiftly sold out at both Starbucks cafés and Target locations within days of coming back in November. But social users have hinted that many locations restocked over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend — including a pair of new soft-touch bling cups which shoppers seem to really love. These pastel-themed cups are brand new in the holiday season and have also gone on in online marketplaces.

While Starbucks hasn't officially confirmed most of this merchandise line nor its actual release dates in stores the increase in social activity tells us that a restock likely occurred over the holiday. Most standalone café locations don't receive merch before retail cafés within Target locations do or those stores in third-party retailers. That means you're more likely to track down a holiday cup at Target or a Starbucks within a mall or an airport for example.

If you're lucky enough to live near one of Starbucks' ultra-sleek Reserve Roasteries in select cities across the globe you'll be happy to hear . Each location will carry a line of mugs and tumblers but there will be a local selection as well. Our favorite pick has to be in New York where true coffee lovers can get their hands on a limited edition Starbucks Chemex pour-over coffee system. Now that's truly a collector's item if we've ever heard of one!

The year-end holiday season is always a busy time for Starbucks and its customers in Japan with a constant string of irresistible new offers covering drinkware Frappuccinos and everything in between.

Our resident Starbucks expert K. Masami has been trying out all these new offers and this week she was back to try yet another new treat — a limited-time Bearista customisation for the holidays.

▼ The Santa Bearista Chocolate costs 80 yen (US$0.71)

The customisation first appeared last year in a green Santa hat version but this year they’ve added a new red hat version as well. You can’t choose which colour you get when you add it to your order as they’re randomly selected but ordering at least two will give you a good chance of getting one of each colour.

▼ That’s what Masami did and she was absolutely delighted when she saw the bears in red and green Santa hats at the top of her drink.

The customisation is only available as an add-on with Frappuccino orders because let’s face it — these chocolate bears would melt in the blink of an eye if immersed in a hot beverage.

The only problem with these gorgeous festive bears is the longer you leave them in your drink the more you become attached to them which makes biting into them an un-bearable prospect.

▼ Having learnt her lesson from last year Masami picked up a bear during the early stages of drinking…

▼ …and bit right into it!

She couldn’t help but feel a tiny bit sorry for her beary cute companions but that soon ended when she realised just how tasty they were.

▼ Their light sweetness and crispy texture added a fun element to the otherwise everyday Frappuccino.

▼ Thank you for your service Bearistas!

The Santa Bearista Chocolate customisation is only available for a limited time until stocks last so you’ll want to get in quick to get a taste of the seasonal bears. They make the perfect companions to the limited-edition holiday Frappuccino which is on the menu for a limited time right now as well!

(St. Thomas Ice Arena) – Eric Martin posted three assists and Alex Adam logged a pair of goals to lead the Bemidji State University men's hockey team to a 6-1 victory over the University of St. Thomas Saturday at St. Thomas Ice Arena. The victory allowed the Beavers to claim the series sweep and improve to a perfect 6-0 in Central Collegiate Hockey Association road play.

In all 10 different BSU players recorded at least one point as the Beavers posted their largest margin of victory since a 7-2 win over Ferris State Feb. 6 2021.

For just the fourth time this season BSU's opponent scored first to put the Beavers in a hole early. Bemidji State took two penalties during the first three minutes of play and the second infraction led directly to a power-play goal for the Tommies. Kyler Grundy scored at the 4:49 mark to put UST up 1-0.

It took over five minutes but the Beavers answered. With 9:59 left in the first Ethan Somoza found Will Zmolek on the blueline and the junior defender fired a wrister through traffic to even the score at 1-1. His third goal of the season also stood as the third goal of his collegiate career.

Tied 1-1 to open the second period BSU got the benefit of a power play early and made the Tommies pay. With UST's Andrew Kangas in the penalty box for holding at the 2:36 mark it took BSU just 35 seconds to take the lead. Elias Rosén scored on the team's first power-play opportunity of the evening with help from Owen Sillinger and Ross Armour . The helper extended Sillinger's point streak to nine games.

The Beavers took a one-goal lead into the third period but that that changed quickly. BSU got goals from Alex Adams  Jere Vaisanen  and Lukas Sillinger during the first 9:08 of the period. Adams would add his second goal of the night with 2:17 left to bring the score to 6-1. His second matched a single-game career-high for the senior.

BSU made good on both of its power-play chances in the game while its penalty-kill unit held the Tommies to one goal on five man-advantage opportunities.

Mattias Sholl collected his fifth win of the season in goal for BSU making 21 saves. He moves to 5-1-0 on the season.

The Beavers improve to 10-6-0 overall and 8-2-0 in CCHA play. Bemidji State returns to Sanford Center Dec. 10-11 when it hosts Minnesota State University Mankato in a battle for first place in the CCHA standings. The Beavers and Mavericks open the series at 7:07 p.m. Friday with a 6:07 p.m. opening faceoff set for Saturday.

Nestled in Northern Minnesota's wooded region and located on the shore of Lake Bemidji Bemidji State University sponsors 15 varsity athletic programs with NCAA Division I men's and women's hockey membership in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association and Western Collegiate Hockey Association respectively while its 13 NCAA Division II programs hold membership in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference.

The Eagles got on the board first with a 17-yard touchdown run from Danny Enovitch near the end of the first quarter and with the successful extra point attempt from Dakota Jonke St. Edward was up 7-0.

St. Edward ran up their lead with a safety on Springfield's next drive taking them up 9-0. With the ball back in their possession the Eagles drove down the field and took their lead to 16-0 after a 19-yard touchdown pass from Christian Ramos to Connor Goodall.

Springfield got on the board for the first time after pushing down the field and finding the end zone on a 9-yard rush from Te'Sean Smoot. A successful extra point made the score 16-7.

Back and forth drives and stops kept the score changeless until the end of the third quarter when the Eagles drove down the field in 14 plays ending in a 9-yard rush from Enovitch taking St. Edward's lead to 23-7.

Springfield scored once more on a 20-yard touchdown pass from Smoot to Anthony Brown but a failed two-point conversion made the score 23-13. St. Edward held off Springfield for the remainder of the game and the Eagles took the win.

The victory marked St. Edward's first state title since 2018 and their 70th overall state championship in school history.

Correspondent

FT. LAUDERDALE — St. Thomas Aquinas punched its ticket to the state championship at the expense of visiting Gainesville Buchholz on Friday night defeating the Bobcats 45-7 in the Class 7A state semifinal matchup.

Quarterback Zion Turner and a host of weapons proved too much for Buchholz’s typically-stout defense as the signal-caller gashed the Bobcats with both his arm and his legs.

The 45 points allowed by Buchholz in Friday’s loss was greater than the Bobcats had allowed in all of their regional wins combined.

More Bobcats:Buchholz beats Nease to advance in 7A state football tournament

While the Raiders will prepare for their state championship game on Dec. 17 the Bobcats can take pride in a tremendously successful season part of a complete program turn-around from just two seasons ago.

Here are three takeaways from Friday’s state semifinal.

1. Friday an anomaly for Buchholz’s defense

Friday’s loss may have been accompanied by a skewed score-line but the performance was far from representative of the Bobcats defense according to head coach Mark Whittemore.

“We played really good defense all year and it wasn't indicative of tonight's performance necessarily but our problem really wasn't defense tonight” Whittemore said. “It was the fact that we couldn't produce any offense.

""The defense really started out well. In the first quarter we had some good series there we just couldn't put anything together offensively.”

Apart from Friday’s loss the most points scored against Buchholz came all the way back in September when Cardinal Gibbons scored 16 against them.

Otherwise 2021’s competition was limited to a bevy of one-and-two-score performances a major factor in Buchholz's deep playoff run.

“To talk about that turn-around over that two-year periodwe got really really sharp on defense"" Whittemore said. ""We shored up a lot of positions. Our defensive line: phenomenal athletic. And that really just propelled us to 12-2.”

2. St. Thomas Aquinas electric in home-field finale

In the final home game of the 2021 season the No. 2-seeded Raiders gave their fans plenty of reason to cheer.

“The theme the whole week was to start fast and finish strong” St. Thomas Aquinas head coach Roger Harriott said. “It's important to show homage and love to those that supported us along the way. Obviously this was the last game at home and we wanted to make sure we put an exclamation point on our home field.”

That exclamation point often came in the form of quarterback Zion Turner who added his own punctuation on a standout performance by flipping over a defender into the end-zone off a scramble.

The Raiders scored on virtually every possession with the defense often setting the team up for success by winning the turnover differential.

And now Harriott says the team just needs to stay locked in as they pursue their season’s goal.

“The objective is always to give our best effort and the goal is to win a championship” he said. “We need to stay focused right now and finish strong.”

3. Bobcats bond unfazed by distance slow start

Buchholz may have finished their season 12-2 this year but one doesn’t have to go back very far to find a very different result.

Just two seasons ago the Bobcats finished 5-5 a fact not lost on the players and coaching staff. They’ve come a long way.

“In two years we didn't let quarantine bring us apart” Buchholz receiver Jacarree Kelly said of the time in between those tough seasons. “We still held it together built an even stronger bond and I feel like the team was really close.”

That year Kelly and teammates Creed Whittemore Quan Lee and Adrian Sermons were all part of the team whether as freshman or sophomores.

Two years later they found themselves at the core of a special offense.

“Our receiving core: phenomenal” Whittemore said. “The numbers prove that big plays our ability to produce shot plays really helped us be the 12-2 regional champs that we were. Jacarree Kelly Adrian Sermons and Quan Lee -- those are our guys. Those are athletes that are capable of making big plays.”

All three of Kelly’s teammates are graduating seniors but as a group they can find solace in a year to remember.

“The emotions are pretty raw” Whittemore said. “Somehow you have to remember the fact that you were 12-1 before this point. And so we've just got to remind them of that. It'll sink in.

""We've got a long bus ride home to just recollect all of the good things and just being appreciative of our fans the parents and our seniors — letting them know that hey this was a phenomenal season.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxseXZvaWNlLmNvbS9zdC1qb2VzLXByZXAtYWR2YW5jZXMtcGlhYS02YS1zdGF0ZS1maW5hbC1nYXJuZXQtdmFsbGV5LW1pa2UtcmljY2kv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGhpbGx5dm9pY2UuY29tL3N0LWpvZXMtcHJlcC1hZHZhbmNlcy1waWFhLTZhLXN0YXRlLWZpbmFsLWdhcm5ldC12YWxsZXktbWlrZS1yaWNjaS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Joe's Prep advances to another state final after knocking off Garnet Valley in 6A semis,"Back in early October Samaj Jones kicked the Franklin Field turf put his head down and wiped the tears from his eyes. St. Joseph’s Prep lost to Catholic League archrival La Salle for the first time since 2015 and the Hawks’ sophomore quarterback blamed himself.

Saturday night at Ridley’s Phil Marion Field not enough people could pat him on the back.

Jones scored four touchdowns and threw for three more in leading St. Joe’s Prep to a thorough 49-13 win over previously undefeated Garnet Valley in the PIAA Class 6A state semifinals.

The three-time defending state champion Hawks (11-2) will play District 7 champion Mt. Lebanon (14-0) 49-28 winners over State College next Saturday at 6 p.m. at Hershey Park Stadium for the chance to four-peat as Class 6A state champions.

This is St. Joe Prep’s eighth trip to the state finals in the last nine years. The Hawks ranked No. 1 by PhillyVoice could become the first four-time state champion at the 6A level since Pennsylvania moved to the 6A level in 2016. In fact The Prep has appeared in each 6A state championship game since the 6A system has been implemented.

Jones made it possible.

He’s faced down adversity all season and he could not have shined on a bigger stage so far than against senior-laden Garnet Valley (14-1) which was playing for their legendary coach Mike Ricci who announced his retirement after 35 years as head coach of the Jaguars.

“With a lot of stuff off the field with me and injuries our team didn’t miss a beat and I couldn’t let these guys down” said Jones who completed 10 of 14 passes for 145 yards including touchdown passes of 7 30 and 16 yards while rushing for 83 yards on eight carries. “That’s the great thing I loved to see. I knew when I got in we could be more explosive.

“I loved being doubted. I knew it didn’t come from my coaching staff or my team it came from the outside noise. No one thought we would score more than 10 points (against Garnet Valley). It’s the best thing. I listened to the doubt with one ear and let it out the other.”

Prep never trailed.

The Hawks bolted out to a 21-0 lead before Garnet Valley could get on the board. The turning point came early in the second quarter when St. Joe’s Prep freshman safety Anthony Sacca the son of former Penn State quarterback Tony Sacca intercepted a pass at the 50 and returned it to the Garnet Valley 5-yard line. One play later Jones scored to put the Hawks up 14-0.

By halftime St. Joe’s Prep led 35-7 holding the Jags’ potent offense to 136 yards of total offense—50 coming on the ground. Prep meanwhile had 209 yards of offense.

Jones completed his last six passes including a 30-yard score to sophomore Brandon Rehmann and 16-yard scoring pass to another sophomore Elijah Jones late in the third quarter.

“Losing to La Salle and Milton (Ga.) were real wake-up calls for us earlier this year because a lot of guys on this team never lost before” Hawks’ junior center Julian Cervantes said. “We really matured over the season and we had our best week of practice this past week. We didn’t play our best football. We can still play better.”

This was supposed to be a “bridge season” for St. Joe’s Prep which never really rebuilds. But its youth with a starting lineup offensively and defensively dotted with juniors sophomores and freshmen suggested another trip to the state finals may have been a year away.

Garnet Valley is a team that had seniors everywhere. The Jaguars had run over everyone they faced—and they did at times when weren’t even playing at their best. It’s how dominant they were until Saturday night.

Ricci leaves a coaching legacy in Delaware County rarely matched. The Jags won their first PIAA District 1 Class 6A championship this season. It’s also the first time in school history the team won 14 games.

“I have loved every moment of this season and I just told our guys the true measure of any team is when you get the most out of the ability level that you have” Ricci said. “This team certainly got the most out of the ability level it had. The senior leadership has been spectacular. I told our guys that we’re going to choose to celebrate the awesome season that we had and focus on that. We’re going walk out of here with our heads held up high.

“It was an uphill climb right from the beginning. They’re so explosive and they made plays that were top level. The better team won today. My emotions right now are for the kids on this team and how they invested so much of themselves into becoming the best team that they could.

“If we’re talking in terms of this being my last year to have that kind of effort and that kind of cohesiveness that kind of brotherhood and love shared I couldn’t ask for anything more.”

The metaverse the digital world's Next Big Thing is touted as the internet domain where animated avatars of our physical selves will be able to virtually do all sorts of interactivities from shopping to gaming to traveling — someday. Wonks say it could be a decade or longer before the necessary technologies catch up with the hype. Right now though the health-care industry is utilizing some of the essential components that will ultimately comprise the metaverse — virtual reality (VR) augmented reality (AR) mixed reality (MR) and artificial intelligence (AI) — as well as the software and hardware to power their applications. For example medical device companies are using MR to assemble surgical tools and design operating rooms the World Health Organization (WHO) is using AR and smartphones to train Covid-19 responders psychiatrists are using VR to treat post-traumatic stress (PTS) among combat soldiers and medical schools are using VR for surgical training.

Facebook Oculus and Covid

Since Facebook — now Meta Platforms — acquired Oculus and its VR headset technology in 2014 for $2 billion numerous health-care applications have been developed. One of the latest was a collaboration with Facebook Reality Labs and Nexus Studios and the WHO Academy. The organization's R&D incubator designed a mobile learning app for health workers battling Covid-19 worldwide. One of the training courses involves AR to simulate on a smartphone the proper techniques and sequence to put on and remove person protective equipment. With content available in seven languages the app is built around the needs expressed by 22000 global health workers surveyed by the WHO last year. Oculus technology is used at UConn Health the University of Connecticut's medical center in Farmington Connecticut to train orthopedic surgery residents. Educators have teamed with PrecisionOS a Canadian medical software company that offers VR training and educational modules in orthopedics. Donning Oculus Quest headsets the residents can visualize in 3-D performing a range of surgical procedures such as putting a pin in a broken bone. Because the procedure is performed virtually the system allows the students to make mistakes and receive feedback from faculty to incorporate on their next try. Meanwhile as the metaverse remains under construction ""we see great opportunity to continue the work Meta already does in supporting health efforts"" a Meta spokesperson said. ""As Meta's experiences apps and services evolve you can expect health strategy to play a role but it's far too soon to say how that might intersect with third-party technologies and providers.""

When Microsoft introduced its HoloLens AR smart glasses in 2016 for commercial development early adopters included Stryker  the medical technology company in Kalamazoo Michigan. In 2017 it began harnessing the AR device to improve processes for designing operating rooms for hospitals and surgery centers. Because ORs are shared by different surgical services — from general surgery to orthopedic cardiac and others — lighting equipment and surgical tools vary depending on the procedure. Recognizing the opportunity the HoloLens 2 provided in evolving OR design from 2D to 3D Stryker engineers are able to design shared ORs with the use of holograms. The MR experience visualizes all of the people equipment and setups without requiring physical objects or people to be present. Zimmer Biomet a Warsaw Indiana-based medical device company recently unveiled its OptiVu Mixed Reality Solutions platform which employs HoloLens devices and three applications — one using MR in manufacturing surgical tools another that collects and stores data to track patient progress before and after surgery and a third that allows clinicians to share a MR experience with patients ahead of a procedure. ""We are currently using the HoloLens in a pilot fashion with remote assist in the U.S. EMEA and Australia"" a Zimmer Biomet spokesperson said. The technology has been used for remote case coverage and training programs and the company is developing software applications on the HoloLens as part of data solutions focused on pre- and post-procedures the spokesperson said.

Microsoft's holographic vision of the future

In March Microsoft showcased Mesh a MR platform powered by its Azure cloud service which allows people in different physical locations to join 3-D holographic experiences on various devices including HoloLens 2 a range of VR headsets smartphones tablets and PCs. In a blog post the company imagined avatars of medical students learning about human anatomy gathered around a holographic model and peeling back muscles to see what's underneath. Microsoft sees many opportunities for its MR tech and in March secured a $20 billion contract with the U.S. military for its use with soldiers.

In real-world applications of AR medical technology Johns Hopkins neurosurgeons performed the institution's first-ever AR surgeries on living patients in June. During the initial procedure physicians placed six screws in a patient's spine during a spinal fusion. Two days later a separate team of surgeons removed a cancerous tumor from the spine of a patient. Both teams donned headsets made by Augmedics an Israeli firm equipped with a see-through eye display that projects images of a patient's internal anatomy such as bones and other tissue based on CT scans. ""It's like having a GPS navigator in front of your eyes"" said Timothy Witham M.D. director of the Johns Hopkins Neurosurgery Spinal Fusion Laboratory. At the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine instructors at the Gordon Center for Simulation and Innovation in Medical Education utilize AR VR and MR to train emergency first-responders to treat trauma patients including those who have had a stroke heart attack or gunshot wound. Students practice life-saving cardiac procedures on Harvey a life-like mannequin that realistically simulates nearly any cardiac disease. Wearing VR headsets students can ""see"" the underlying anatomy which is graphically exposed on Harvey. ""In the digital environment we're not bound by physical objects"" said Barry Issenberg MD Professor of Medicine and director of the Gordon Center. Before developing the virtual technology curriculum he said students had to physically be on the scene and train on actual trauma patients. ""Now we can guarantee that all learners have the same virtual experience regardless of their geographic location."" Since it was founded in 1999 the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) has developed VR AI and other technologies to address a variety of medical and mental health conditions. ""When I first got involved the technology was Stone Age"" said Albert ""Skip"" Rizzo a psychologist and director for medical virtual reality at ICT recalling his tinkering with an Apple IIe and a Game Boy handheld console. Today he uses VR and AR headsets from Oculus HP and Magic Leap. Rizzo has helped create a VR exposure therapy called Bravemind aimed at providing relief from PTS particularly among veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. During exposure therapy a patient guided by a trained therapist confronts his or her trauma memories through simulations of their experiences. Wearing a headset the patient can be immersed in several different virtual scenarios including a Middle-Eastern themed city and desert road environments. ""Patients use a keyboard to simulate people insurgents explosions even smells and vibrations"" Rizzo said. And rather than relying exclusively on imagining a particular scenario a patient can experience it in a safe virtual world as an alternative to traditional talk therapy.

Last month the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition Technology and Logistics Dr. Bruce Jette canceled one of the Army's most important modernization programs the competition to build the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV). This decision must be seen as something of a blow for the newly established Army Futures Command (AFC) and for the Army's broader effort to streamline and speed up its ponderous acquisition system. While the Army has promised that the program will be restarted after an ""operational pause"" the problems with the OMFV procurement suggest that reforming Army acquisition maybe even harder than anyone expected. Underscoring this concern is the possibility that the Army is on the verge of repeating the OMFV experience in its effort to design and develop a new turret for its Stryker wheeled infantry vehicle that can carry a 30mm cannon. This is a vital lethality upgrade for the Stryker fleet. A second acquisition failure could prove highly damaging for Army modernization efforts.

The OMFV was one of AFC's signature programs and the top priority for the Next-Generation Combat Vehicle Cross Functional Team. The new platform was intended to replace the Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle which was first produced in 1981. Despite multiple upgrades the Bradley has reached the end of the road when it comes to improvements. The Army wanted a new platform to carry infantry into combat that would be more lethal and survivable than the Bradley could generate greater amounts of electric power be easier to maintain have lots of room to grow and add capabilities and as the name suggests be capable of operating remotely or even autonomously. In addition the Army wanted the new vehicle fast with up to two development contracts awarded in early calendar 2020 a downselect made in 2023 and the first unit equipped fielded in 2026.

The immediate reason for Dr. Jette’s decision to halt the OMFV effort was that only one company General Dynamics Land Systems had submitted a proposal and the required sample vehicle. A second competitor a team of Raytheon and Rheinmetall had failed to meet the Army’s deadline for delivery of its prototype vehicle. But in what perhaps should have been seen as a portent of what was to come a number of major armored vehicle manufacturers had chosen not to participate apparently concerned about the interplay between the program’s aggressive schedule and complex requirements. Dr. Jette acknowledged this dilemma in announcing his decision:

Despite an unprecedented number of industry days and engagements to include a draft request for proposal over the course of nearly two years -- all of which allowed industry to help shape this competition -- it is clear a combination of requirements and schedule overwhelmed industry's ability to respond within the Army's timeline.

A similar situation appears to be occurring in the Army’s program to upgun some of its Stryker wheeled infantry vehicles. Officially called the Stryker Medium Caliber Weapon System (MCWS) the program is to design and develop a turret that can support a 30mm cannon. In 2018 responding to an operational needs statement from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment stationed in Europe for a more capable gun to arm its Stryker vehicles the Army rapidly fielded an interim solution on 83 Strykers.

Based on the experience of operating these modified vehicles the Army sought an improved solution in the MCWS. The processes the Army followed for the MCWS procurement mirrored many of the new acquisition approaches being pioneered by AFC for a streamlined faster approach to acquisition. In May 2019 following a full and open competition the Army awarded a number of relatively small quick turnaround design integration study contracts for a better turret that would equip at least three Stryker brigade combat teams. In a second phase of this effort the participating companies were required to provide by June 2020 a bid sample consisting of their turret mounted on a basic Stryker vehicle and XM813 30mm cannon both provided by the government.

Between May 2019 and February 2020 while the companies worked on their designs the Stryker Program Office proceeded with the development of a final Request for Proposal (RFP) for the MCWS. The current plan is to release the RFP later this year to those companies that successfully complete the design phase. As currently understood the RFP will be for a single contract awardto produce and integrate a MCWS based on the XM813 onto some 269 Stryker Double V-Hull Infantry Carrier Vehicles.

Many of the problems contractors experienced with the OMFV solicitation appear to also be “infecting” the RFP for the MCWS. While the Program Office had initially assured the competing companies that the core requirements for the MCWS would not change in fact they have been revised repeatedly. Also evaluation criteria have been changed in ways that create uncertainty for the companies.

The number of requirements has ballooned many of which have nothing to do with the basic performance of the MCWS. For example each competitor is now required to self-certify that the modified vehicle meets more than 100 technical performance specifications. But a number of potential competitors do not have access to the Stryker technical specifications required for a meaningful certification. In addition a few months ago the Program Office added a requirement that each competitor in the design phase add armor coupons to their June 2020 submission. An armor coupon is representative material of the integrated turret that could undergo parallel blast testing to validate the integrity of the material used. By the time this requirement was levied the companies had already acquired the parts for their turrets. This means that there is no way they can provide armor coupons made from the same batch of steel as the turret. Once again requirements and schedule are in conflict.

This effort is in danger of repeating the OMFV experience. Industry sources have reported that at least one company has pulled out of the competition and others are seriously considering not bidding on the MCWS RFP. Come September 2020 there might only be one or even zero companies willing to provide the Army its new Stryker turret. Can Army acquisition afford two back-to-back failed combat vehicle modernization efforts?

A new 3D hologram system lets orthopedic surgeons at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center be more precise when performing shoulder replacement surgery.

Stryker’s Blueprint mixed-reality technology uploads a digital 3D holographic view of a patient’s pre-operative plan onto headset glasses worn by the surgeon.

“It feels like you are Iron Man moving and referencing the virtual images” Gregory Cvetanovich MD an orthopedic surgeon and shoulder specialist at the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center says.

Surgeons can put that holographic image right next to the patient’s shoulder as they position implants during surgery. The technology provides a way to more closely personalize shoulder replacement surgery based on each patient’s unique anatomy.

“You can move the hologram around you can click right next to the patient’s shoulder you can compare and contrast and we can really make sure that we give them the best replacement that we can” Cvetanovich says.

He performed the first shoulder arthroplasty mixed-reality procedure at Ohio State in April 2021. The Blueprint system is in use at just 15 sites nationwide under a limited release.

“The system is very intuitive to use and takes very little practice” Cvetanovich says. “I practiced on a model shoulder in the lab and felt comfortable to start using it in surgery.”

Using technology to optimize surgical options

In a regular shoulder replacement doctors use the results of a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the patient’s shoulder to choose the replacement implant. These details are entered into a computer program to create the preoperative plan. During surgery doctors typically consult the pre-op plan on a flat 2D computer screen or a printout affixed to the wall.

The hologram system turns those plans into a 3D image which can help surgeons better prepare for surgery. The digital 3D image comes to life in the operating room. It provides more precision and reduces the chance of human error. That’s because doctors can manipulate the hologram in real time during surgery adjusting and making changes as needed based on what they see within the patient’s native anatomy.

Surgeons use hand gestures and voice commands to optimize the position of the 3D models as they work to replicate the pre-operative plan as closely as possible during surgery.

“Technology like mixed reality gives us an opportunity to significantly reduce variability in the way surgery is performed which can help reduce complications and improve overall patient outcomes” Cvetanovich says.

About 53000 people in the U.S. have shoulder replacement surgery each year according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Advancements that mixed-reality 3D holograms provide include:

Ability to place a 3D image next to 3D surgical field

Access to patient medical records and the implant’s technique manual during surgery

Exact positioning of implants through real-time 3D imaging

Meaningful information about surgical options without the surgeon needing to complete manual measurements

Transforming surgical education training and outcomes

Mixed reality is likely to transform shoulder arthroplasty and orthopedic procedures where precision is critically important like spine surgery and joint replacements says Cvetanovich especially “as future developments allow guidance calibrated with instruments to ensure ideal placement of the arthroplasty components.”

The 3D holographic image shows what the surgeon can’t see inside the body. This helps improve surgical accuracy and can significantly reduce surgeries where the implant is placed way out of line.

The technology also allows surgical staff residents and patients to view the planned operation from the surgeon’s vantage point. This helps everyone better understand the operation Cvetanovich says. The surgical team and trainees also can view the procedure in real time.

Cvetanovich expects mixed reality to change how surgeons are trained affect how patients understand the procedure and improve shoulder spine and other joint replacement surgeries overall.

The October deal established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 per cent aimed at curtailing profit-shifting to lower-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland where many large international firms have their European headquarters.

It will eliminate incentives to shift jobs and profits abroad US President Joe Biden in early October.

But some companies could still use Ireland to reduce their tax bills even after the agreement takes effect according to tax specialists and a Reuters review of corporate filings.

Thats because the new agreement wont stop companies benefiting from a strategy widely implemented in recent years that reduces taxes over a period of up to a decade or more.

Irelands relatively generous tax allowances permit multinationals with a presence in the country to sell intellectual property such as patents and brands from one subsidiary to another to generate deductions that can be used to shield future profits from tax.

Companies that have generated deductions to reduce their taxable income by more than $10 billion each in recent years via this tax-minimizing strategy include US technology companies Adobe Inc and Oracle Corp corporate filings show.

Business-software provider Oracle declined to comment and Adobe creator of software such as Acrobat pdf-maker didn't respond to requests for comment. Both companies have said they conform to relevant tax laws.

The agreement brokered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is due to take effect in 2023.

It was signed by more than 130 jurisdictions including Ireland.

The Irish finance ministry said Irelands tax treatment of intellectual property transactions is in line with other OECD countries.

In response to Reuters questions the OECD acknowledged that companies could continue to benefit from profit-shifting strategies already in place but that it expects companies to be unable to build up such tax shields in the future.

The approach typically relies on a company also having a subsidiary in a country with a corporate income-tax rate of zero such as Bermuda that enables the company to conduct the sale tax free.

By phasing out zero-tax jurisdictions for multinationals the OECD expects the global minimum tax of 15 per cent will make the strategy no longer attractive. Were trying to design rules for the future said John Peterson an OECD official.

Peterson added that the OECD cant be certain how each countrys rules would interact with the global minimum tax. But he said the OECD is confident that abuses will be limited by a requirement that countries calculate taxable income in accordance with accounting rules.

Tax specialists say the deals impact remains unclear because key details are yet to be agreed including how to calculate the pot of profit that is to be taxed.

Countries are currently debating carve-outs for certain tax breaks.

In addition jurisdictions could retain wide latitude in how they allow companies to calculate taxable income the specialists said.

Where there isnt accounting consistency there is scope for gaming said Nicholas Gardner a tax partner at law firm Ashurst in London.

The new rules are expected to be finalized next year and require lawmaker approval in some jurisdictions.

That includes the United States where several top Republican politicians have voiced opposition to the deal.

Malta is another country that permits multinationals to minimize taxes via intra-company intellectual property sales.

Maltas finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment on its intellectual property-related tax allowances.

International pressure forced Ireland in recent years to phase out one of the worlds best-known corporate-tax loopholes known as the double Irish.

In response companies have increasingly accumulated tax deductions known as capital allowances via intra-group sales of intellectual property according to tax advisors economists and company filings.

Since 2015 multinationals have moved hundreds of billions of euros worth of intellectual property into Ireland economists say.

This has led to vast annual tax deductions for foreign companies related to so-called intangible assets more than 45 billion euros in 2019 up from under 2.7 billion euros in 2014 according to data from Irelands tax authority.

The data doesnt break down what portion of those deductions were related to intellectual-property transactions within a corporation.

Virtually every multinational has moved intellectual property said Christopher Sibley a senior statistician at Irelands Central Statistics Office.

The profits being shielded from tax by US-based companies typically come from sales to Europe Asia and Africa according to tax specialists and corporate filings.

The US Treasury loses out because the products and services sold are based on research conducted and investment made in the United States academics say.

The US Treasury declined to comment on whether US companies will continue to take advantage of pre-existing tax strategies or benefit from future ones.

Adobe books most of its sales to non-US clients through an Irish subsidiary based in a four-storey block in an office park outside Dublin corporate filings show.

In 2020 Adobe Systems Software Ireland Ltd purchased intellectual property from another subsidiary that was both an Irish-registered company and a resident in Bermuda for tax purposes.

The set-up meant no tax was due on the $11 billion profit from the sale. Meanwhile Irish-tax resident Adobe Systems Software Ireland registered an $11 billion expense that could be used to offset taxes on profits over a period of about eight years because it is an asset that depreciates over time according to the subsidiaries accounts.

Adobe paid $197 million of tax on $3.1 billion of reported profit in Ireland in 2020 and sales of $5.6 billion according to accounts for its main Irish unit.

This equates to an effective tax rate of about half of Irelands current statutory 12.5 per cent corporate income tax rate thanks to the impact of the capital allowances.

Other US companies that have amassed multi-billion-dollar tax deductions from intellectual property sales to affiliates over the last three years include semiconductor maker Analog Devices Inc medical devices maker Stryker Corp and software group Cadence Design Systems Inc publicly available accounts for their Irish subsidiaries show.

Analog Devices and Stryker said they adhere to tax rules and regulations but declined to answer questions on their specific tax arrangements. Cadence declined to comment.",,,

The ‘Gold Standard’ of Client Payment

To kick off the discussion roundtable participants were asked what should be the norm or “gold standard” in how clients pay equine veterinarians for services. Krebs did not hesitate in her response: “The short answer is payment at the time of service.”

That has obviously not been the standard in equine practice Krebs continued but about 15 years ago her hospital decided to change its protocol to getting paid at time of service. They knew they would have to continue to deal with absentee owners and clients who forgot their credit card or checkbook but they made an expectation for immediate payment their default.

“You start to train your clients on [payment at time of service] and you start to train your support staff that they need to get that credit card number on file or make other arrangements for payment when they make the appointment and things eventually fall into place” Krebs stated. “It’s a change of mindset.”

“Absolutely! Exactly like Dr. Krebs said—payment at the time of service” said Zeytoonian. She pointed out that if a service person such as a plumber electrician or gardener makes a house call they expect immediate payment.

“We need to be training our clients that there should be that exact same expectation” said Zeytoonian. “For those absent owners or the training barns [you can] have payment information prior to scheduling those appointments. There’s just no reason that we shouldn’t be doing the same thing that other industry professionals do.”

Of course in a perfect world 100% of clients would pay at time of service. “But we don’t live in a perfect world” Hansen acknowledged. “Not everyone budgets for that type of care. So building transparency around the costs of care and democratizing that information I think is a huge stepping stone in order to push toward compliance around that topic of paying at the time of service.”

Grice noted that horse owners need to be prepared to pay for care “just like when you go to the grocery store—you don’t get to leave with your groceries without paying for them.”

Palmer added that small animal practices provide treatment plans or estimates for most treatments which isn’t common in equine practice. He said veterinarians need to talk with clients about costs up front for wellness care and provide a treatment plan with associated fees.

“It’s not enough in my opinion to make sure they understand they’re going to have to pay” he added. “I know I’m going to have to pay when I go to the grocery store but I also have the benefit of looking at those price tags as I wander through the store and deciding that I don’t want this or I do want that. If I don’t hear the price until the end of my visit and it’s $400 and I thought it was going to be $200 that can be an issue.”

Palmer also noted the importance of making sure clients have their payment method with them. “So many clients go ‘Oh my gosh I left it in the house’” he said. “And a lot of practitioners are so behind that’s the trigger to say ‘Oh I’m just going to go to the next call; we’ll catch you next time or we’ll mail you a bill.’ ”

Getting that transaction done right there on the spot is important Palmer said. “There’s nothing—nothing—better in terms of collecting the debt than not incurring it in the first place” he emphasized.

“There’s nothing—nothing—better in terms of collecting the debt than not incurring it in the first place.”—Kyle Palmer

A Financial Culture Shift: Is It Possible?

Roundtable participants were asked how they handled talking to clients about financial preparedness—and whether they thought they did a good job.

“Absolutely not!” said Palmer. He said the equine practice he managed tried to become “coin-operated”—meaning veterinarians wouldn’t provide service unless payment had been arranged—but they met with only moderate success.

“The impetus is really on the veterinarian … because they’re the ones that are going to arrive at a call and leave a call with or without payment” he said.

He thinks the “pay at time of service” message must be put in front of the client right from the start. Communicate this simple financial policy thoroughly to every client and make sure to stick to the fee schedule.

“I’ve always believed that discounting drives back to guilt that the fees are too high in the first place and that’s a mindset that has to be overcome” said Palmer. “It’s important to understand that what we’re charging is fair; it’s reasonable; it represents the value that I bring as practitioner.”

Krebs agreed noting that equine practice management expert Andy Clark DVM MBA has a saying she finds particularly pertinent in this situation: “Never surprise the client.”

“You should never surprise the client when you ask them for payment at the time of service” Krebs said. “You should not surprise them with the invoice that they’re not prepared for. So you need to start that homework when the appointment is made. Our CSRs (customer service representatives) ask ‘How do you plan to pay today?’ Or better yet ‘Do you have a credit card we can put on file?’ ”

Krebs confirmed that “equine vets are not the best at waiting around. They might be trying to get to another emergency.” But she added “if you already know you have a credit card on file and at the end of that appointment can say ‘We’ll just put those charges on the card you have on file right?’ and 95% of the time the client will agree.’”

Zeytoonian said her practice also makes client education a focus. When they do a new patient visit or general wellness exam they discuss expectations for general horse care and the costs associated with that care. They even include anticipated care in pre-purchase exams. “We say ‘We think this horse is going to need X Y and Z; here are the costs’ ” she says. “Before they even buy the horse they know what a number of those fees will be and I’m proud of doing that.”

In Zeytoonian’s practice payment at time of service is a policy—“and I’m a stickler to it” she said. That means payment must be arranged before a veterinarian will go out on a weekend or see a new client. “They say ‘Once I see that email [about payment] come through with the paperwork then we can get something on the schedule’ ” she said. “That has been super helpful for our team.”

Dr. Kelly Zeytoonian Video—Making a Policy and Sticking To It

Hansen said the AVMA’s Language of Veterinary Care study conducted in mid-2020 was focused mainly on pet owners but featured some important findings for equine veterinarians: “One thing that was loud and clear was that there was an elephant in the room and that was cost. A lot of the pet owners wanted the veterinarian to talk to them about costs up front for the services but they weren’t getting that. And that also deterred them from going to the veterinarian because they didn’t know what to expect.”

Charlotte Hansen Video—Cost of Services: The Elephant in the Room

To help bring about a fundamental shift in this area veterinarians must make their care relational Hansen stated. When veterinarians focus on building the client relationship their recommendations become personalized then conversations about cost become much more comfortable.

Grice affirmed Hansen’s comments adding “Veterinarians really need to do a little soul searching and realize that most of them have a hard time talking about money. It makes them feel kind of squeamish like they don’t deserve to receive payment for taking care of somebody’s horse. It’s almost like they feel it’s wrong to profit from somebody else’s misfortune.

“We’re helpers we’re there to serve” Grice continued. “And bringing money into it sort of dirties it or sullies this feeling of helping.”

The reality is that many horse owners value the services provided by veterinarians she said—veterinarians do themselves a disservice when they feel guilty about the hard work they do every day.

“When I advise veterinarians it tends to be a supportive conversation that you provide an excellent value and feel proud of what you’re doing” said Grice. “Don’t feel weird about the money because the clients don’t feel weird about the money as long as you’re providing that valued service for the animal that they love.”

Zeytoonian succinctly stated “It is not our job to subsidize somebody’s hobby.”

“It is not our job to subsidize somebody’s hobby.”—Kelly Zeytoonian

Krebs said horse owners know horses are expensive adding that in most cases they are paying the farrier more per year than they’re paying the veterinarian.

“I think removing that guilt factor is huge” said Krebs. “We all want to be guilty that’s just our personalities as helpers but get rid of it!”

Proactive vs. Reactive: Client Financial Preparedness

Veterinarians can either have a proactive or reactive approach to client financial preparedness. In light of this roundtable participants were asked what they thought needed to change in the equine industry.

Hansen said she’s had a few experiences as a pet owner where the veterinary team was proactive about discussing costs and she appreciated the transparency. “That’s what I want” she said. “Just tell me straight ‘This is how much it’s going to be; you’ve got to pay this up front right now.’ ”

Grice said she thinks many equine practices do a good job with new clients when it comes to payment policies and collecting credit cards—“they’re sort of slowly turning the cruise ship to a more sustainable and rational financial policy” she said. But legacy clients can be a challenge. “[They’ve] been getting billed at the end of the month for 30 years and they pay whenever they get around to it” noted Grice. “It’s very difficult to convince senior partners to change those legacy clients’ financial agreement with you.”

Palmer said most of the equine veterinarians he has worked with are “100% reactive in financial conversations.” But he said they also practice in a reactive fashion. “That’s somewhat the foundation of why they’re reactionary in general” he said. “To use [an] analogy with farriers most horse owners do pay farriers more than veterinarians. But farriers are also telling them ‘I need to be back in six weeks.’ They’re managing their business proactively not reactively and we are not.”

Krebs added that it’s very easy to fall into the reactive camp. “But as Charlotte touched on animal owners actually appreciate the financial communications” she said. “You start to reformulate that in your head to ‘I need to respect the client enough to have that financial discussion up front with them.’ ”

Dr. Wendy Krebs Video—A Financial Cultural Shift: It Is Possible

When Krebs presents an estimate to a client she tells them she wants to be candid about the financial picture and that it’s only fair that they know what treatment will cost. “And I haven’t had a single person give me a negative connotation when I presented it in that way” she stated.

“I need to respect the client enough to have the financial discussion up front with them.”—Wendy Krebs

She added that veterinarians need to try to get away from the mindset that “it’s rude to talk about money” or “we’re going to make the clients uncomfortable talking about money.”

“It’s really the opposite” Krebs stated. “We’re going to make them uncomfortable if they don’t know how much they’re going to spend.”

Zeytoonian added that veterinarians need to be proactive not only in their policies but also in education. “Where we really need help is shifting the mindset of our clients to change their expectations so that it’s not a surprise when we want to be paid at time of service” she said.

The Working Capital Gap

The roundtable moderator read this quote from equine veterinary consultant Mike Pownall DVM MBA: “Veterinarians have to pay bills and clients owe veterinarians money. This is the working capital gap. The working capital gap describes the time between when suppliers need to be paid by veterinarians and when payments from clients are received. Veterinarians need to close this gap in order to be more profitable.”

Panelists were then asked how this statement resonated with them as well as how they saw late partial or nonpayment of bills affecting their businesses and the veterinary industry.

Zeytoonian said Pownall’s remark hit home. “The way it has affected our practice specifically we start to get to that crunch time and if there’s money being owed then you’re looking at the budget and thinking ‘Well am I going to be able to pay my supplier?’” she said. “Then it turns into this vicious cycle of now the supplier’s giving me delayed billing and they’re having me buy all of these things on credit. … And so it goes.”

She added that when clients don’t pay bills it affects whether veterinarians and support staff get paid. “We need to be starting from the top and shifting the way that we are expecting payments so that we’re not compromising ourselves or our employees” Zeytoonian said.

Hansen reiterated that when clients owe veterinarians payment for services and veterinarians don’t collect veterinarians can’t run their practices the way they want. And this can affect the entire team’s well-being.

“It’s all interrelated” she said. “The affordability and perceived value of veterinary care is the biggest issue when talking about access to care. … Veterinary care isn’t going to get more affordable. And we can take action to bolster the value proposition. But you can implement strategies to address those gaps and help your practice function well. And that is linked to well-being for the whole team.”

Palmer noted that recruiting and retention of young veterinarians into equine practice are two major issues for the industry. When he talks to new vet school grads who work in small animal clinics he often asks them if they ever considered equine practice. He said most new vets say no because of the low compensation and financial instability in the equine industry.

Krebs agreed. “I think Kyle has touched on the real heart of the matter here” she said. “There are practicalities in terms of cash flow certainly and the seasonality of equine practice and those put financial stress on the practice when we don’t get paid at the time of service. But the big picture is that we don’t get to reinvest into our practice and pay our support staff what they need to be paid to stay in the industry or pay the veterinarians what they deserve to be paid to stay in the industry.”

Grice reminded the group that horses are a luxury item and between 50% and 75% of horse owners make more than $100000 a year*: “If we’re not making them pay because we feel uncomfortable about talking about money—uncomfortable about setting expectations that we deserve to be paid—then they’re going to choose to spend their money somewhere else.”

Improving On-Farm Bill Pay

The technology learning curve can impede payment at the time of service particularly on farm calls according to Palmer. “A lot of it comes down to vets feeling that running a card is difficult” he said. “Teaching them how to use things like a Square reader or a credit card reader or to understand [financing] plans and be able to speak that language is important if they don’t have [support staff] to do it for them.

“I think they collect money easier if it’s easy for them to do” he summed up.

Krebs said switching to cloud-based software and taking the time to set up invoicing templates has worked well for her practice. “When you’re on the farm it’s a matter of two minutes to get the invoice and put in your drug amounts and have that total ready to present to the client without having to sit down with your carbon copy invoice and write out the 23 things you did to the horse and get out your calculator. We need to move at a faster pace than that” she said.

Even if a practice can’t get veterinarians on board with swiping the card Krebs continued customer service representatives can still get credit cards on file: “As you leave the farm the client says put it on their card and you’re done.”

Zeytoonian said technology is key in her practice as is having support staff accompany veterinarians on calls. “We have a technician or an assistant with us and when a sedation is being given it’s being entered in the system as we go” she said. “You’re essentially populating that invoice in real time as long as there’s internet that you can access.”

She added that it would be interesting to compare aged receivables for a solo practitioner without assistance to aged receivables for a practitioner with support staff. “I think you could probably pretty quickly make an argument for hiring help just based on your accounts receivable” she said.

Grice noted that younger solo practitioners in her Decade One management group have “started as they intend to continue … they are getting paid at the time of service.” That means they have client paperwork filled out and credit cards on file. They might not get an invoice written till the end of the day but they email it the same night and have permission to charge the credit card within 24 hours.

“Practitioners that have started that way don’t have accounts receivable” Grice said.

The Non-Client Emergency and Other Challenges

Roundtable participants were asked how they handle bill pay for non-clients particularly if they are asked to go out on an emergency call.

Grice noted that it’s important to start with empathy because you don’t already have a relationship with that person. “Maybe say ‘This must be really hard for you. You weren’t expecting this. We can offer you these different options for payment. Do you need a few minutes to think about it?’ ” she said.

Zeytoonian said the non-client emergency is actually her practice’s biggest pain point. “Those are the individuals that we’re not being paid by right away” she said. For example an associate who wants to get out and help a horse and owner in an urgent situation might skip the practice’s step-by-step protocol of getting the paperwork giving an estimate and arranging payment.

“Nine times out of 10 when I run end-of-month—and I share with everybody who we’re running into issues with–it’s those non-clients” she said.

She tries to offer some perspective with her associates: “ ‘You’ve just walked away from your dinner your plans or your partner and you’ve just done it for free. How do you feel about that?’ And when they can put it in that perspective it’s a little easier to stomach telling people ‘I’m sorry; I can’t help you until I get this information.’ ”

Palmer said his response to non-client emergencies would have been completely different 10 years ago compared with today. “Ten years ago our mindset was always build build build” he said. “I can remember saying to our staff ‘There are no non-client emergencies; there are only clients that haven’t become our clients yet. And every person out there with a horse is potentially our client.’ But that left us with higher aging in our accounts. I agree with Dr. Zeytoonian that it’s just not prudent anymore to just be the empathetic doctor who’ll see every case.”

Krebs said her practice is unique in that it handles both referral emergencies and primary care emergencies. “We do fall into that position of having emergencies with non-clients pretty frequently” she said. “I agree with Dr. Zeytoonian that that is our Achilles’ heel. If there are cases that we’re not going to get paid on those would be the ones. We have to start that conversation with them when we take the phone call initially and set up the expectation that we do need to get paid at the time of service.”

Like Grice she noted the importance of empathy and building the relationship while still setting appropriate payment expectations. “When I get out to the call the first thing I do is not hand over the paperwork to get their credit card number; it’s to start with the examination on the horse and show them that I care” she said. “I do a thorough exam and report to them my findings and what my treatment plan is and then I have that conversation about money.

“I think there’s a fine line that we have to walk in showing that money is not our only objective but we do have to get paid or nobody is going to be there to take care of their horses” Krebs said. “It’s a reality that there are some places in the country where there is no one to take emergency calls.”

“There’s a fine line we have to walk in showing that money is not our only objective but we do have to get paid or nobody is going to be there to take care of their horses.”—Wendy Krebs

Strengthening the Veterinarian-Client Financial Relationship

The experts who participated in the roundtable were asked these questions: What does a healthy financial relationship between an equine veterinarian and client look like? How does this healthy relationship affect the veterinarian the client and the horses in that veterinarian’s care?

Palmer said a proactive approach is once again called for. “That healthy relationship has to be defined right out of the gate” he stressed adding that the practice owner must stick to the financial policy like everyone else. “If the doctor completely undermines it even one time there’s no credibility left. It is key to make financial responsibility transparent to begin with then support it at every step along the way.”

Krebs noted that it’s important to establish mutual respect early on. “If it’s a client that expects to treat you as a bank and pay you willy nilly you might want to pass on that client” she said. “It’s OK. We do not need to work for every client. If they are looking for a veterinarian that’s going to give them 60- 90-day terms we’re not the vet for them.”

“If a client expects to treat you as a bank and pay you willy nilly I think you might want to pass on that client. It’s OK. We do not need to work for every client.”—Wendy Krebs

She added that the vast majority of clients—or at least those you want to keep—understand that a veterinarian needs to function as a sustainable business and will agree to pay at the time of service.

“Veterinarians spend a lot of emotional energy on that 5% or 10% of clients that give them trouble and I think we can free ourselves of that guilt and let them go and focus on the good clients that don’t give us trouble” she emphasized.

Hansen stressed that a healthy relationship between a vet and a horse owner leads to veterinary compliance no matter what the level of care. “Having that good VCPR (veterinarian-client-patient relationship) and being transparent about these costs and having horse owners understand the value of veterinary care can relay the importance of being paid on time to keep the practice up and running” she said.

Financial Stress and Veterinary Well-Being

The roundtable participants agreed that financial health and personal well-being are directly related for equine veterinarians. As Zeytoonian put it “being liked by clients is nice but paying your bills at the end of the day needs to happen.” This helps a practice grow and also promotes work-life balance.

“And I do want to double down on livable wages for our support team” she said. “It’s a problem and this is an area where we need to be focusing. I think having that money and having the cash flow can really help to foster appropriate wages for our support team. And that makes everybody’s life better.”

Hansen noted that the 2020 Merck Veterinary Wellbeing Study highlighted financial stress as the leading cause of burnout. “And I know that this refers more to financial stress with student loans but I expect that relationship to be the same in this example” she said. “It goes back to leadership in the practice and the work culture that’s created within that environment.”

Palmer agreed saying “If you’re the owner of the practice living month to month wondering how to pay the next bill is constant stress … I think by and large most veterinarians would love to pay their staff more. I don’t think enough veterinarians understand how vital it is and that they are under-charging chronically and under-collecting regularly. Those two things cause waves of stress that go throughout the practice.”

On top of that he added “having clients not want to pay you for work is emotionally battering.”

“I don’t think enough veterinarians understand how vital it is that they are undercharging chronically and undercollecting regularly. Those two things cause waves of stress that go throughout the practice.”—Kyle Palmer

Grice agreed adding that because veterinarians’ giving flows from wanting to help wanting to make a difference when payment doesn’t occur “it feels like a slap in the face … like making a difference didn’t count.

“It starts to feel for people like they’re sacrificing their life on the altar of veterinary medicine” Grice continued. “They see their friends or people outside of veterinary medicine having a normal life that doesn’t look like that. And they feel trapped in this thing that they love but that is eating them alive.”

The good news is that the profession is finally talking more about emotional well-being and balance. “It’s something that practice owners and managers need to be thinking about—creating an environment that’s safe and healthy for the people that work for them” Palmer said.

Hansen brought up what she calls the “three wicked realities” of the veterinary profession: “We have practices that are inefficient with how they operate. We have pets or horses that aren’t seeing veterinarians. And we have 40% of veterinarians* that consider leaving the veterinary profession.

*Source: Salois M. “Supporting well-being during COVID-19 and beyond” dvm360 November 2 2020 www.dvm360.com/view/supporting-well-being-during-covid-19-and-beyond

“So when we don’t have a viable healthy practice that can cause burnout” she continued. “When we don’t have animals getting the care they need that’s a welfare issue. And when we have burnout we have veterinarians that don’t want to stay in the profession.

“It’s all connected” Hansen concluded. If the equine profession can bring about a cultural shift of payment up front thereby alleviating many financial stressors well-being in the profession will only rise.

Challenges for Ambulatory Practitioners

For many years bad cell service has hindered ambulatory veterinarians from getting paid on the spot. Today with more widespread coverage that’s less of a problem. But there are still a number of issues veterinarians face in collecting payment while out on service calls.

“The challenge a lot of solo practitioners … face is they’re out there alone” said Palmer. “They’re trying to get an invoice done immediately. They’re behind. The client left their checkbook in the house … and the vet thinks ‘I just gotta go to the next call.’”

Having a good support staff member along can help he continued—as long as that person has some administrative prowess.

Krebs echoed the importance of support staff in the field. “Oh my gosh the assistants make us so much more productive and so much safer” she said. “They pay for themselves many times over in both of those factors.

“Our assistants drive for us and then the doctor has the cloud-based system and is sitting there doing notes doing invoicing while we drive to the next appointment” she added. “If you can utilize that drive time well and make it income-generating you’re going to be hugely ahead.”

Grice said she thinks about the solo practitioner racing around with a full book who used to have two associates and now is all alone “and their hair’s on fire” she said. “The way for those people to get payment at the time of service is to have the credit cards on file. And even if they have somebody part-time in the office running those cards once a week that’s going to be better than writing invoices later.

“If you take it in little bites to start to change your work processes you can get back to something where your cash flow sustains you so much better” Grice said.

The Evolution of Financial Care

Equine medical and diagnostic technology has changed quickly in the last 20 years and financial tools for veterinarians have evolved as well. Roundtable panelists discussed where financial needs are being met and where gaps still exist for equine veterinarians.

Hansen said “If I speak to soft skills like communicating to clients around financial matters I think we still have a way to go. I think there are tools out there to help guide the conversations and [there are] more to come.”

Grice added that equine veterinarians often lack business knowledge in general. “A veterinary practice is a small business and that makes veterinarians uncomfortable” she said. “They don’t really have the ability to forecast their cash flow in a seasonal business. They’re feeling challenged by their workload but they don’t know if they can afford to hire somebody. Those [issues] are just understanding basic business management.”

Palmer said the number one financial tool that has evolved and is now being used by many equine veterinarians—but is not widely used enough—is the practice manager. “That’s a position that may be out of reach for a solo practitioner” he said. “But I know several veterinarians who see those records only one day a year when they go to tax meetings for the previous year. So get somebody to do that.”

Participants were enthusiastic about online payments as a financial tool. Krebs said her practice is implementing online payment via the ezyVet practice management system with embedded credit card processing. “It’ll be a link that goes out with the invoice on email and the client can just hit the button” she said.

Zeytoonian said that in her practice “clients can access an online portal at any time where they can access not only their bills but their clinical summaries. It’s been great!”

Palmer said his practices uses the Text2Pay platform and has its own proprietary online portal where people can access and pay bills. “We had it in place before COVID but it really was developed deeper during COVID” he said. “It’s worked very well. It’s a great tool and by all rights the next big evolution in payment processing.”

Wireless payment transmission paperless billing and collaborative work arrangements were additional strategies panelists mentioned that help them get the work done and get paid for it. On collaboration Krebs said “Whether that is group practices or whether that is individual practices that go together to afford a practice manager … I think that truly has to be the way forward for us.”

Handling Client-Driven Financial Stress

Panelists agreed that horse owners sometimes try to make veterinarians feel guilty when it comes to paying for their animal’s care. Krebs says she’s over it.

“As I’ve matured I just don’t let them put that financial stress on me. It is not my responsibility” she said. “I am there to help them to the best of my capability and within their resources but it does not fall on my shoulders to enable them financially. I absolutely acknowledge to them the stress of the situation that they’re under. I acknowledge that it’s expensive and I’m empathetic. I can help provide solutions that are within their means. And that does not mean that I need to be the one that subsidizes their animal’s health care.”

Zeytoonian heartily agreed: “My job is to provide you [the client] with all of the options for care and give you a path to health and wellness for your horse. And my job is to also educate you on insurance opportunities coverage opportunities payment options—none of which involves putting somebody on a payment plan or subsidizing the care of the animals.”

Hansen said this issue goes back to a lack of transparency around costs and trying to avoid sticker shock owners can experience. “If clients can anticipate what they’re going to need to budget for that will be less stressful for them. And it will be less stressful for you and the veterinarian-client relationship” she said.

“If clients can anticipate what they’re going to need to budget for that will be less stressful for them. And it will be less stressful for you and the veterinarian-client relationship.”—Charlotte Hansen

Grice said she suggested that practice owners create an account for each veterinarian that allows them to give away a certain amount of services every year. “That veterinarian … can dribble it out over a lot of cases over the course of the year or they can spend it all on one case. But it feeds their soul. It feeds their heart. That’s why they’re in this business” she said.

Zeytoonian said her practice allocates associates $5000 each year that they can spend how they choose on behalf of clients. “And it does help” she added.

Krebs emphasized that not every client has to have the gold standard. “It is important to offer that to them but it is not always the right solution for every client” she said. “And what truly is the gold standard? Because I think that can be a different answer for every animal and every client. So really our job is to offer them all of the options and what the economics look like associated with that and what the potential outcome differences are amongst those choices. And then the client … gets to choose.”

“Our job is to offer [clients] all of the options and what the economics look like associated with that and what the potential outcome differences are amongst those choices. And then the client … gets to choose.”—Wendy Krebs

“I’ve seen the most success where we’ve offered people a couple of different choices and encouraged them to know that there isn’t a wrong answer here” Palmer said. “There’s just which answer’s right for you. And I can’t make that decision for you. I can provide the education and the support for you to make it yourself.”

Finding Joy: The Good News About Equine Practice

While the equine profession is facing serious challenges roundtable participants also discussed a number of positive developments and rays of hope. For example advanced technologies such as ultrasound are now more affordable for veterinarians Zeytoonian said. This type of equipment can be a revenue-producer for practices and a money-saver for clients who don’t have to travel to a referral clinic.

Grice recently interviewed about 20 veterinarians asking what brought them joy. “They all answered pretty much the same way” she said “which was having their clients let them know that they were making a difference in their horses’ lives … The thank-you note the update on how the horse did feeling like you truly are a part of the team in that horse’s life.”

Palmer said discussions of work-life balance and wellness are making a difference in the equine profession. “I know a couple of doctors specifically who probably would not be in this industry—they’d have transferred over to companion animal work or left—if they weren’t working for a practice that recognized that and started providing structure and boundaries for them in their job” he said. “The more that discussion progresses the better it is for our industry.”

Where We Go From Here

Panelists were asked to discuss changes in the profession that could lead to greater well-being professional reward and a sense of success in veterinary medicine.

“I’m very passionate about the sustainability of equine practice” stated Krebs. “There are fewer veterinarians going into equine practice. I think we need to be extremely proactive if we hope to continue to have people come into equine practice.”

She said she knows of new grads who have gone to work for corporate small animal practices for $120000 a year and been offered signing bonuses of $200000. While the equine veterinary industry can’t compete with that (at least yet) quality of life can be improved.

“New graduates are averse to being on call” she noted. “We have to reinvent the model of equine practice to make it something that people are willing to take on. Part of that is making the fee structure such that we can pay those veterinarians well and that we can support them with well-trained staff that are going to stay in this profession and make our lives better. The staffing model in small animal is something like five support staff to one veterinarian. Whereas we think we’re doing really well in equine medicine if we have one assistant.”

Shared emergency duty will be a major part of making equine practice sustainable in the future Krebs continued and so will group practices that let veterinarians be on call just one night a week.

Zeytoonian said elevating support staff so they aren’t just assistants but actually keep cases moving proactively will help with efficiencies and offset “the drive times that we just can’t fix.”

She added that establishing boundaries is important for practice owners and associates. “That can be stopping work by 5:30 every night so soccer games can be attended or horses can be ridden” she said. “But also thinking outside the box as far as what our workweeks look like. We do a four-day workweek and we have some people that are part time and just do two days a week. You can effectively use and share equipment and resources when you have alternative work schedules to make the practice more profitable and also spread out that emergency coverage.

“I like seeing that practices are picking up on that and we don’t have to fall into that six-day workweek where you work till you drop” stressed Zeytoonian.

“I like seeing that practices are [setting boundaries] and we don’t have to fall into that six-day workweek where you work till you drop.”—Kelly Zeytoonian

Palmer described advising a veterinarian recently that his recruitment ad needed to include three things: “I need to see the words ‘flexible scheduling’ I need to see the term ‘mentorship’ and I need to see the term ‘work-life balance’ ” Palmer said. “I was laughed at and he said ‘That’s all ridiculous.’ I said ‘It isn’t but even if you think it is I promise you you have no chance of hiring somebody if you don’t not only say you’re going to do it but actually do it. You are resigning yourself to being a solo practitioner and probably being out of business at some point because you’ve driven yourself crazy without any help.’ ”

Palmer also said certified veterinary technicians are not being drawn to equine work “because what they get to do for a lot of ambulatory veterinarians is stock the truck put everything away clean the tube put the X-ray machine back. They’re not handed the syringe and told to draw a blood sample or do the bandage change. They’re hardly ever even taking X-rays.” At the same time Palmer noted younger associates want the assistance of a confident technician.

“I think that we are at a moment in this industry where things could go really really bad or we could make some good decisions to change our pay scale our fee schedules increase compensations start making equine work a better prospect for people” stated Palmer. “Otherwise I don’t know what kind of conversation we’re going to be having if we come back in five years and do this again.”

Hansen agreed that staff utilization is important for the future of equine practice. “We see that in companion animal practice utilizing a veterinary technician increases revenue 16% in a practice*” she said. “I would really love to see what those efficiency numbers look like for an equine practice.”

In wrapping up the roundtable discussion Grice noted that consolidation of the industry into group practices is unlikely unless the culture of group practice changes. “Young veterinarians are aware that ownership of a veterinary practice is the path to financial success” she said. “Being a cog in a wheel where the profit that you earn for your practice goes in someone else’s pocket may not make you feel very comfortable and you may want to be that person yourself.”

If the culture of group practices remains that of several owners at the top who reap the benefits of a stable of associates below them and do not provide for their needs through flexible schedules robust salaries good vacation good benefits and a shortened workweek veterinarians will continue “voting with their feet” and not come into equine practice Grice continued.

“Alternatively what I also see is many of them establishing their own practices so they get to make the rules” she said. “Those practices are thriving. Those are the practices where graduates that go into equine practice want to work.”

Bottom line? Equine practitioners need to embrace the value they provide and feel confident in charging appropriately for what they do Grice said. Part of the solution is providing clients with ways to pay for veterinary care and creating financially educated clients from the very beginning so they know what to expect.

“That requires veterinarians to overcome their discomfort talking about money” she said. “And a lot of that comes from … feeling like ‘Yeah I work really hard and I do a great job and this is what the value is and I’m not afraid to ask for that to get paid.’ ”

Grice predicts that instead of consolidation the equine industry will see collaboration. “Collaborative emergency coverage collaborative use of equipment; some of those practices may come together in mergers but they may not” she stated.

Dr. Amy Grice Video—Where Economics and Emotions Meet

In conclusion Grice said “we have the capability to have a positive future. We just have to create new paradigms in equine practice.” A culture shift that empowers financial success and client connection will allow those horse girls who come into veterinary medicine having always wanted to be an equine doctor to thrive said Grice.

BONUS TAKEAWAY TIPS: Experts Share Practical Pointers for Clinic Operations Workflow and Cash Flow

While the roundtable discussion reflected here focused on weighty issues facing the profession and inspiration for a brighter tomorrow these experts from the front lines of equine care were full of practical insights as well. Keep reading for ideas you can apply in your own practice.

Group service calls geographically. Grice said she recently asked some of her networking group members to track their billable and non-billable activities. She found that the efficiency for ambulatory practitioners was about 50%.

So she recommended that multi-doctor practices create “area days” for routine work where veterinarians go to certain geographic locales on certain days and clients understand when a doctor will be in their area and start to plan ahead. Another veterinarian keeps a lighter schedule on those “area days” so they can handle emergencies. The person in the “area” handles the emergencies in that region.

Create a hard stop to the workday. Grice also noted that since most younger veterinarians are female—often with family responsibilities—those vets need a hard stop to the day. Not scheduling routine appointments past a certain time can help them know when they’ll be done. “And that means that somebody needs to start doing emergencies at that time so people’s days don’t get out of control” Grice said.

Be vigilant about capturing fees. “When we’re talking about fees probably more important than anything is managing fee capture” Palmer said. “That’s less of an issue as we start becoming more automated and more and more people have support. But everything you don’t charge for drops right to the bottom line and that’s a disaster.”

“Everything you don’t charge for drops straight to the bottom line.”—Kyle Palmer

Complete invoicing by end of day. Krebs said her practice’s biggest challenge has been getting invoicing completed by doctors in a prompt fashion. “Honestly that adds more to our accounts receivable than clients not paying” she said. “So we are working really hard at trying to get invoicing done by the end of every day. It doesn’t always happen but having shifted to the cloud-based software has helped us with that.”

She added that her practice’s doctors always have a support staff member with them which also helps with invoicing. “It doesn’t matter which of them enters the invoice originally we always have two people check that it is correct” she said. “It’s amazing how much that adds. I think probably 75% of the time it’s an additive process and the technician will be like ‘But you handed them a tube of bute at the end of the appointment’ or ‘You gave them three tubes of Banamine for their first aid kit.’ ”

Grice said research shows that the more time that elapses between the service and the writing of the invoice the more the percentage of missed charges rises. “One of the ways to get people to write invoices is to hit their pocketbook” she said. “You could say ‘If invoices aren’t done within 48 hours that production is not going to be eligible for compensation.’ ”

Bond clients to the practice not an individual. Krebs said her team has worked hard to help horse owners bond with the practice rather than individual doctors. “We work four-day weeks for the most part. So they have to be comfortable with another doctor and have confidence with that other doctor” she said. “That means that Dr. Newton’s notes have to be up to date so I can pick that [case] up and roll with it.”

Zeytoonian said her practice works the same. “We’re two-day workweeks or four-day workweeks” she said. “People get the work done and then pass the cases on which is one more shift in the culture of the practice. That makes it … feel like a team effort versus everybody in their own sandboxes. And that’s been such a game changer.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Plus omicron’s impact on Apple and the company loses yet another car executive.

There was a seismic shift in the mobile-phone industry about eight years ago. That’s when U.S. wireless carriers started eliminating subsidies—deep discounts offered in exchange for a contract—forcing new iPhone buyers to confront the true cost of their devices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvdC1tb2JpbGUtNWctbmV0d29yay1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTgtbW9kZW0tc2Ftc3VuZy1zMjJfaWQxMzY4ODfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile is ready for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 5G modem in Samsung's S22,"







T-Mobile will be able to take advantage of the Qualcomm X65's three-carrier 5G aggregation in several different ways. The carrier has more than 100MHz of mid-band 5G spectrum in a lot of places and in those places it needs 3xCA to do two 100MHz mid-band channels plus a low-band channel for uplink/better range. There are also some cities (like New York) where its mid-band allocation is split in half and can be used like two separate bands. So X65 phones (such as the Galaxy S22) should bring considerable performance improvements on T-Mobile's mid-band.

3.45-to-3.55GHz spectrum which is in the middle of being auctioned should clear in some places by the end of 2022. This means that AT&T and whoever else buys that spectrum will potentially see a considerable boost in C-band performance specifically when used with those X65 modems next year over and above the initial C-band launches.





As far as Verizon's vaunted mmWave 5G is concerned it is now just a few candles on T-Mobile's ""5G layer cake"" instead of a full layer as you can see in the picture from Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit and it is not clear if T-Mobile is just trolling  or it genuinely has given up on the speeds of mmWave.





It is after all the only 5G tech theoretically able to deliver the 10Gbps speeds that Qualcomm's new X65 modem is rated at provided that your network can supply such speeds of course. The mmWave networks are very bad at range and building penetration though so they make more sense at specific crowded places like stadiums just what Verizon has been doing with its NFL 5G contract

The other question is whether you would need 10 Gigabit 5G speeds on your phone in the foreseeable future at all. For instance even 8K streaming video chat wouldn't need as much bandwidth; despite that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 now supports it T-Mobile's execs mentioned in the interview that their top 5G plan called Magenta Max will keep maxing out at 4K streaming and that has nothing to do with deprioritization.





In any case it looks like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor will not only have the more advanced 4nm production node amongst mobile chipset but it is also scoring the best 5G modem of the company that does 5G modems best - Qualcomm. The Galaxy S22 series is shaping up to be at the forefront of 5G connectivity as has become customary for Samsung's flagship phones that usually beat iPhones to the punch in that regard. The iPhone 13 models after all have to make do with Qualcomm's current generation X60 modem and even then the latest iPhones get beat by Samsung's Galaxy phones





With the Galaxy S22 models that can take advantage of the Qualcomm X65 modem's three-carrier 5G aggregation as soon as T-Mobile Verizon and AT&T start enabling the technology on their next-gen networks the 5G connectivity gap between Apple and Samsung is only poised to grow wider and Samsung will have the definite advantage at least until the iPhone 14 rolls off the conveyor belts.

Experts say it will put one of the nation’s most pristine wetlands at risk.

A predawn phone call woke Ron Bledsoe with a jolt. It was his supervisor telling him to come in.

Bledsoe dressed and drove an hour to the power plant near Kingston Tennessee where he worked. He arrived at a shocking sight: A mountain of coal ash covering the road and a set of railroad tracks. It looked like the surface of the moon he recalled.

Hours earlier an embankment at the plant had ruptured flooding the area with gray muck. The spill was an environmental calamity and the fallout was immediate. The ash blanketed up to 400 acres killed hundreds of fish damaged more than a dozen homes and polluted nearby waterways. The clean-up took years and cost more than $1 billion.

Coal ash an umbrella term for the residue that’s left over when utilities burn coal is one of the United States’ largest kinds of industrial waste. It contains metals — such as lead mercury chromium selenium cadmium and arsenic — that never biodegrade. Studies have shown these contaminants are dangerous to humans and have linked some to cancer lung disease and birth defects.

For a time the Kingston incident catapulted coal ash into the public consciousness. But experts say it continues to pose a massive threat throughout the country.

About 400 miles southwest of Kingston a coal ash lagoon — which holds almost four times as much sludge as what spilled in Tennessee — is sitting in the Mobile–Tensaw Delta one of the most biodiverse areas of the United States with flora and fauna not known to exist anywhere else on Earth. Environmentalists community members and scientists fear the pond could someday unleash a Kingston-like catastrophe on southern Alabama and say leaving the coal ash in the delta is shortsighted and dangerous.

“We’ve got an A-bomb up the river” John Howard who lives in Mobile County and said he has been fishing in southern Alabama for decades said. “It’s just waiting to happen.”

‘Horror’ scene in Kingston

Most Americans had likely never heard of coal ash until three days before Christmas 2008 when the Kingston spill news broke.

Before the 1970s many utilities pumped their coal ash into the atmosphere attorney Lisa Evans who has focused on coal ash litigation for more than 20 years said. After Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1970 which regulated power plants’ air emissions some facilities began storing their coal ash in dirt ditches commonly known today as ash ponds or surface impoundments.

Hundreds of these sites now dot the country according to data that federal regulations require pond operators to publish and was compiled by Earthjustice a nonprofit that handles environmental lawsuits. Because coal plants produce electricity by converting large volumes of water into steam many of these waste sites are situated near river systems and flood zones. But 40 or fewer have a protective liner to contain the leftover ash and more than 200 have been shown to contaminate groundwater with toxic substances at levels that exceed federal safety standards the Earthjustice data shows.

With the Clean Air Act the nation traded one environmental problem for another Evans who works for Earthjustice said.

“One could see the billowing black smoke” Evans said. “You can’t see coal ash contaminating underlying groundwater (…) you can’t see the slow pollution of the adjacent river and the dying of the fish (…) It’s likely to be less dramatic.”

After 5.4 million cubic yards of coal ash spilled at the Kingston plant the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated the area as a Superfund site. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) which owned the plant spent more than $1 billion over six years to clean up the spill.

The aftermath “was like nothing I’ve ever seen before” Richard Moore who served as the inspector general for the TVA at the time said. “It was like a scene out of a horror movie.”

Tommy Johnson — like Bledsoe the worker who compared the Kingston spill to the moon’s surface — was at the facility that day. He spent six years working on the clean-up effort and said he believes exposure to the coal ash made him sick.

In 2018 Johnson joined more than 200 plaintiffs in suing Jacobs Engineering a TVA contractor hired to oversee the Kingston cleanup alleging Jacobs lied to workers about the ash’s toxicity. Bledsoe was also part of a suit which was filed in 2013. A jury eventually found that Jacobs failed to keep workers safe during the cleanup and that this failure could have caused the illnesses and injuries they suffered. The parties are now litigating over whether individual workers’ illnesses are a result of coal ash exposure.

“It’s (been) one ailment after another” Johnson said.

Today Johnson said he struggles to breathe and walk. Bledsoe according to court filings signed by his doctor suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease a disease that is typically caused by cigarette smoking. Bledsoe and his doctor have said he was never a smoker.

In a statement Jacobs spokesperson Heather Byrd told CNN the company “stands by its work assisting TVA with the difficult job of cleaning up the Kingston coal ash spill” adding that “the evidence will prove that the plaintiffs’ claimed conditions were not caused by exposure to coal ash at Kingston.”

TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks said in a statement that the utility has become an “industry leader in the safe secure management of coal ash.”

EPA’s ‘tipping point’

In response to the Kingston disaster the EPA set out to review the condition of more than 500 coal ash ponds across the United States.

“(Kingston) was almost a tipping point” Mathy Stanislaus who served as assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response from 2009 to 2017 said. “The reaction (at the EPA) was ‘We need to do something about this.’”

In 2015 the agency implemented its first-ever regulations on coal ash disposal forcing utilities across the country to begin closure and remediation of ponds that were unlined and contaminating groundwater above permitted levels.

The rule gives such ponds’ owners two closure options: seal the ash through a procedure known as capping-in-place or dig it up and move it to a lined landfill.

Depending on a pond’s size the EPA gave utilities between five and potentially 15 years to close them. In 2018 a federal court decision prompted the EPA to amend its rule. Today some utilities may have until 2036 to complete closure of certain ash ponds.

But environmental advocates say capping-in-place is not always an effective option especially for ponds where coal ash sits below the water table the point below which the ground is saturated with water because the cap does not prevent heavy metals from leaching into the surrounding area. They often point to a 2001 report by the Electric Power Research Institute in which researchers studied three unlined closed ponds and found that while groundwater quality improved at two it didn’t improve at the third where some ash sat below the water table.

Moreover they fear that as weather patterns become more extreme and less predictable leaving coal ash in an unlined pond is reckless because the potential for a catastrophic spill will always loom.

A nationwide challenge

There are an estimated 511 coal ash ponds in the United States according to a CNN analysis of the data compiled by Earthjustice. Nearly half — about 46% — are unlined and have been or will be closed in place. The utilities’ self-reported data shows around 160 are known to be contaminating groundwater but groundwater data gathered by the Environmental Integrity Project a nonprofit watchdog that advocates for better environmental law enforcement places that number at closer to 200. It’s unclear how many of those ponds sit below the water table or have direct contact with groundwater but around 60 sit in a flood zone.

Mapping coal ash ponds

Geologist Mark Hutson said that because the majority of the ponds are constructed along rivers — and typically in flood plains — many are likely to pollute the groundwater.

“The science points us clearly to excavation as the only way to protect public health and the environment” Michael Regan who ran North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality and now serves as EPA administrator said about ponds in that state in 2019.

In the 2015 rule the EPA declined to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste instead opting to regulate it as solid waste a category that can include everything from banana peels and candy wrappers to sewage and industrial sludge. That designation effectively allowed utilities to police themselves unless state regulators or private citizens which the law gives standing to seek enforcement through the courts intervened.

Stanislaus the former EPA assistant administrator said the agency declined to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste in part because business leaders raised concerns that doing so would hamstring their ability to recycle the substance which is frequently used in cement grout and other construction materials and because officials felt regulating coal ash as solid waste would still adequately prevent it from contaminating air and water.

That decision meant that initially states could regulate coal ash through existing water and waste programs. But it was a missed opportunity to enact stronger safeguards Dalal Aboulhosn the Sierra Club’s deputy director of policy advocacy and legal said.

“If EPA would have decided to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste we would have gotten the strictest of protections for communities” Aboulhosn said. “From cradle to grave we would be looking at coal ash as something that could harm communities and (making) sure it would be disposed of properly.”

In 2016 the federal government reclaimed some oversight when a new law authorized the EPA to review states’ programs for regulating pond closures. For states that didn’t develop their own programs the law required the EPA to develop one instead.

The EPA must still approve states’ programs but Evans said lax oversight and vague benchmarks — guidelines the agency published in 2017 say mainly that state programs must be “at least as protective as” federal regulations and should ensure public participation — have given states considerable leeway when regulating coal ash.

“The absence of (federal) requirements has left important criteria up in the air and fails to guarantee important safeguards nationally” Evans wrote in an email.

When President Joe Biden chose Regan to lead the EPA last December Evans hoped the pick would usher in more rigorous enforcement. Regan had firsthand experience with the consequences of coal ash pollution; In North Carolina he led the state’s department of environmental quality in the years following a spill.

In an interview with CNN last week Regan signaled the Biden EPA will indeed take a firmer stance on coal ash management.

While Regan did not provide specifics he said the agency is planning to announce details which he said could include additional regulatory actions soon. That announcement Regan said will give a “clearer picture of how the agency plans to move forward” nationwide.

“We’re pretty far down the road on this and we recognize the sense of urgency” Regan said.

Sources familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement is still being finalized told CNN they expect it to include decisions on a handful of applications for closure extensions at coal ash ponds across the country and notices to several facilities about compliance obligations.

In the meantime some state governments have taken it upon themselves and forced utilities to excavate their coal ash pits.

After a broken pipe unleashed more than 46000 cubic yards of coal ash from a retired power plant on the Dan River in 2014 near Eden North Carolina state officials enacted a law forcing the closure of all unlined coal ash ponds in the state ultimately requiring utilities to recycle the ash or put it in a lined landfill.

And in 2019 a Virginia law required Dominion Energy to excavate more than 27 million cubic yards of coal ash from ponds across the state.

But in other states including Alabama utilities still have the option to close ponds through cap-in-place.

‘We love our power company’

Standing behind the wheel of a motorboat in April Ben Raines a former newspaper journalist who offers tours of the Mobile–Tensaw Delta steered with the confidence of a man cruising across the Mediterranean on a yacht.

The Mobile–Tensaw Delta is part of the Mobile River Basin which drains most of Alabama’s water through the delta the Mobile Bay and into the Gulf of Mexico. It is one of the largest and most biodiverse river systems in North America; the region is home to at least 35 kinds of orchids and likely more turtle species than any other river system on Earth. At least 30 types of carnivorous plants live in the delta. Raines who has often referred to the delta as “America’s Amazon” points out one that eats insects.

Alabama’s ecosystems are particularly diverse because glaciers never covered the state during Earth’s last ice age unlike large swaths of what is now North America.

The delta is where Alabama Power’s James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant’s smokestacks tower above the treeline. Many refer to the plant named for the executive who led the utility from 1949 to 1952 as simply “Barry” or “Plant Barry.” It’s about 25 miles north of downtown Mobile sits on the Mobile River and forms a corridor of industrial facilities. At 597 acres Barry’s ash pond is nearly as large as the National Mall. A grassy berm dotted with yellow flowers lines the property’s edge and separates 21.7 million cubic yards of coal ash from the river.

“Coal ash is sitting there right on the edge of (the delta)” Raines said occasionally stopping his boat to pluck a plant from the water and marvel at it.

“If there were an accident (…) we would have lost you know one of America’s treasures and a treasure that people are only beginning to understand and explore.”

Alabama Power spent $30 million to construct Barry which opened in 1954. The plant was intended to meet the area’s rapidly expanding electricity needs. Mobile’s population exploded during World War II as the shipbuilding industry grew Mark VanLandingham a population studies professor at Tulane University said. Mobile was fairly developed by the 1950s; it had 17 movie theaters four hotels and two daily newspapers. The city which had about 174000 residents in 1956 was a manufacturing hub for pulp and paper products lumber and textiles. A guide to Mobile from 1957 boasted that the city was on its way to becoming one of the “great centers of trade and industry.”

But that didn't pan out. The city’s population peaked at roughly 200000 in 1960. As residents moved to suburbs and manufacturing began moving overseas Mobile’s population like many other post-industrial cities’ declined VanLandingham said.

As of 2019 census estimates showed the city of Mobile was home to almost 189000 people. About 18% of the city’s residents lived in poverty. That share was higher — about 21% — for Black Mobilians who made up more than half the city’s population.

With about 6000 employees Alabama Power is a major employer in the state. It provides energy to roughly 100000 customers in the city of Mobile. Its corporate parent Southern Company owns electric utilities in Georgia and Mississippi and is the third largest electric utility company in the country by market value.

In a state where storms are commonplace “the most important person who shows up at our door after a hurricane is the Alabama Power guy who has just turned our lights back on” said Casi Callaway who grew up in Mobile and spent 23 years as the executive director of Mobile Baykeeper an environmental nonprofit that aims to protect southern Alabama’s waters.

“We love our power company” she said.

Alabama Power’s choice

Alabama Power is poised to close the Barry pond through capping-in-place. Its process according to the closure plan filed with state environmental regulators last year would remove water from the pond to shrink its footprint by nearly half before filling the perimeter with soil and sealing the ash with a cover made from plastic crushed rock and artificial turf that the company has said is designed to “virtually eliminate infiltration of surface water.”

Records show the site has been contaminating groundwater for years. In its most recent groundwater monitoring report from 2020 Alabama Power revealed elevated levels of arsenic and cobalt near the Barry plant that exceeded groundwater protection standards by more than eight times and more than five times respectively. In 2018 state officials fined the company $250000 for arsenic pollution saying the company had “caused or allowed the unpermitted discharge of pollutants associated with ash pond wastewater from the Plant Barry Ash Pond to waters of the State.”

In a document filed with the state’s utility regulator last month company officials acknowledged environmental groups’ concerns about the cap-in-place method’s effectiveness toward protecting groundwater and that “the risk of an adverse outcome remains” but wrote the company believes its plans for Barry’s ash pond and about 10 other coal waste sites in the state meet federal requirements and that requiring full ash removal would “dramatically” increase costs and “adversely impact” nearby residents’ quality of life through “decades of constant truck traffic.”

“It’s about the money” Moore the former TVA inspector general who now lives near Barry in Baldwin County said. “I believe the corporate culture and the corporate mindset at most utilities is the same way: If they can do it on the cheap that's what they're going to do.”

Alabama Power has estimated that it will spend about $860 million to close the Barry ash pond by capping it in place and an additional $36 million for post-closure maintenance according to its closure plan. Jack Bonnikson a company spokesperson declined to say what the company estimated excavation would cost.

But no excavation cost would compare to cleaning up a spill Evans the environmental attorney said.

“It is infinitely cheaper to scoop ash out of a pond and truck it to a lined landfill than to excavate it out of a river and out of people’s yards” she said.

Frank Holleman a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) who has litigated against utilities over coal ash contamination for over a decade said utilities often misrepresent how much each method will cost.

“As a general rule they overstate the cost of excavation and they understate the cost of cap-in-place” Holleman said.

In addition Holleman said utilities often prefer capping-in-place to avoid the “managerial hassle” of transporting coal ash.

In written responses to CNN Bonnikson challenged Holleman’s claim. He said cost estimates often change as work on a project progresses and that the engineers and geologists who develop cost estimates are expected to adhere to professional standards.

Closing these ponds has sometimes come at a high price for utilities though often their customers are footing large shares of the bill.

Duke Energy for example has estimated it will spend $8 billion to $9 billion to comply with North Carolina’s law and excavate 31 ponds in that state in addition to four in South Carolina.

Bill Norton a spokesperson for Duke Energy couldn’t say how much of that total pertained to the North Carolina ponds. But he said it made up “the vast majority” of the multibillion-dollar estimate and that about $3.8 billion — or at least 40% — will be passed on to North Carolina retail customers.

But customers’ payments aren’t just going toward the cost of pond closures. They’re also lining shareholders’ pockets.

Because many utilities operate as natural monopolies where state regulators control prices the companies’ profits often depend on how well they control costs. In 1923 the US Supreme Court ruled that to ensure that utilities remain financially sound and can continue to provide services they should be entitled to recoup the costs of certain investments and profit from them.

Utility regulators and courts are supposed to make sure such investments are reasonable and necessary and that the costs passed onto customers are appropriate.

But Dave Rogers a deputy director at the Sierra Club said they are often politicized and customers don’t always get “a fair shake.” Jim Lazar a former senior adviser at the Regulatory Assistance Project said the result is that today’s customers end up paying for earlier generations’ mistakes.

It’s unclear how much Alabama Power stands to profit from the Barry closure. Bonnikson declined to provide a figure but a recent filing with the state’s public service commission outlined financial information related to how the company will comply with government mandates next year.

Anna Sommer a consultant at Energy Futures Group who has advised groups working toward improving Alabama’s public utility regulation process reviewed the filing for CNN and estimated that the utility would likely return around $200 million to shareholders in the coming years as a result of the Barry pond closure. Sommer’s assessment was reviewed by two ratemaking experts for CNN: Lazar and Stephen Hill an independent consultant who has provided expert testimony in ratemaking cases.

Debating Alabama Power’s plan

In an email Bonnikson said the utility’s annual filings “transparently provided estimated costs for compliance and associated rate calculations.” He declined to comment on Sommer’s estimate saying only that the utility “will not validate estimates or calculations (CNN) may have received from a third-party group.”

In March community members environmentalists and coal industry advocates gathered at a Hampton Inn in Saraland a Mobile suburb near Plant Barry for a public hearing to comment on Alabama Power’s closure plan.

Some speakers including Jonathan Hale who runs an Alabama-based mining company supported the utility’s plan. Hale said he was concerned that transporting the waste to a landfill could lead to ash spills on roads and put unnecessary wear and tear on Alabama’s highways.

Many speakers opposed Alabama Power’s plan. One woman became emotional as she recounted learning there was an unlined coal ash pond near her home. A man compared the Barry pond to a rotting tooth that needs to be taken out a cancerous skin lesion that should be removed and mold growing on drywall that needs to be gutted and replaced.

Nicholas Williams a 29-year-old sales and support representative for a small online hunting gear retailer stood at the microphone in a T-shirt and baseball cap.

“Twenty years I’ve been poking around up there looking for deer and hogs and ducks and big ol’ flatheads” Williams said. “Looking for game but also looking for the peace that a vast mass of calm waters and cypress trees brings. Looking for a sense of being and perspective that you find when you stand on top of the Indian mounds (…) and realize that you’re really very small in the grand scheme of things.”

For Williams being in the delta is a way of life. He and his wife Sarah bought a home perched on Tensaw Lake a tributary in the delta three years ago. The couple have chickens in their front yard — the rooster is named Sue after the Johnny Cash song — and a collection of birds Nicholas has killed is mounted on their living room wall. He said he worries that a spill at Barry could destroy the delta that he hopes to one day share with his children.

“I believe leaving the coal ash pond in place is taking a chance with something that should not be left to chance” he said. “We don’t have to jeopardize the Mobile–Tensaw Delta.”

While state regulators approved Alabama Power’s plans for the Barry pond in July EPA Administrator Regan told CNN last month that his agency is “actively investigating (…) the Plant Barry situation.”

“We understand the concerns about this facility in Alabama” Regan said. “The last administration’s leadership failed to act on these concerns. This administration will act to protect communities and based on my prior experience if there is coal ash in contact with groundwater that’s putting the health and safety of communities at risk and requires our attention.”

‘Nothing God can do’

When Hurricane Ida approached the Gulf Coast in late August Cade Kistler and the Mobile Baykeeper staff prepared for the worst.

At their downtown Mobile office they put trash bags over computers and moved them away from windows. They prepared their boat and test tubes to take water samples from the river and check for coal ash. Kistler Baykeeper’s interim director made sure his family had enough food in case the power at their home went out.

After the storm made landfall in Louisiana Kistler drove to Barry to look for signs of damage.

He put a chainsaw in the back of his Subaru in case he needed to cut through fallen trees. The rain was still heavy he said recalling how his car shook from the wind as he crossed Mobile Bay on the highway. Kistler who remembered feeling cautiously optimistic because Ida didn’t directly hit the area said he didn’t see any signs indicating a disaster had struck Barry.

Meanwhile Ida was carving a path of destruction across the country killing at least 80 people across eight states. By any measure it was one of the strongest tropical storms to ever hit Louisiana.

“We got off really light” Kistler said. “It really is just a matter of when a similar storm (…) hits coastal Alabama.”

When Kistler and his staff learn a hurricane has formed in the Gulf they worry about two disaster scenarios at Barry: its dam collapsing or that river water will overtop the dam sending coal ash surging into the delta.

A coal ash spill wouldn’t be southern Alabama’s first brush with environmental disaster. In 2010 an explosion on a British Petroleum (BP) oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers and set off a domino effect that caused oil and natural gas to leak into the Gulf for nearly three months.

The Gulf is still recovering from the calamity which the EPA has called the largest marine drilling-related oil spill in history. As of 2018 researchers were still detecting oil contamination in thousands of fish in the Gulf of Mexico according to one study.

“You couldn't walk on the beach” Mobile resident Madelyn King said. “There were tarballs washing up all the time.”

The BP spill hobbled leisure tourism in the region. Visitor spending in Louisiana dropped by $247 million in 2010 according to a report prepared for the state’s tourism agency by Tourism Economics a consulting firm that analyzes global travel data.

Callaway who was leading Mobile Baykeeper at the time (she left Baykeeper for a job as Mobile’s chief resilience officer in May) said southern Alabama dodged a bullet.

“The power of the Mobile River and the delta pushing water out of the bay made sure we didn't have much oil come into the bay” Callaway said. “If something happens with the coal ash pit there’s no natural protection. There’s nothing God can do to protect us from that.”

If the Barry pond were breached the volume of slurry could eclipse the amount of oil that spilled into the Gulf during the BP disaster.

“They would be dealing with that for God-knows-how-many years“ Keith Johnston an attorney for the SELC said. “It would be devastating for the city of Mobile and the bay. A lot of people rely on that bay for their livelihood.”

When an environmental disaster strikes Black and Brown communities often suffer the worst consequences Aboulhosn the Sierra Club deputy director said.

“Across the board communities that are people of color that don't have the socioeconomic levels of some predominantly White communities are the ones that are shouldering this burden” she said.

Joe Womack who grew up in Mobile runs an environmental advocacy organization in the city’s Africatown neighborhood a historic Black community that is choked by highways and industrial facilities. He said he worries Africatown where residents still talk about the ash from a nearby paper mill that would rain down on the community years ago would continue to bear the brunt of industrial pollution and its consequences.

For “folks that are at the bottom end of the totem pole” Womack said “(it’s) just like anything else: You see things happen to you more in a negative sense.”

“The thing with Barry” he said is “just more of the same.”

In his remarks to CNN last week EPA administrator Regan — the first Black man and second person of color to hold the position — called environmental justice and equity “a pillar” for the administration.

“What we’re saying is ‘We see you we hear you and we’re responding’” Regan said. “Too often whether it’s the coal ash pond or a chemical refinery or a landfill our communities are disproportionately impacted by exposure to pollution.”

The SELC and Mobile Baykeeper have called on Alabama Power to change tack and excavate the pond. The organizations argue the utility’s plan will allow groundwater contamination to continue and that the potential for a disaster will remain if the coal ash is not removed.

Bonnikson declined to say whether the utility has studied how far coal ash might travel if its dam was breached but told CNN in an email that the company’s “structural stability analysis and regular inspections demonstrate the dikes are safe and secure and continue to function as designed.”

In 2010 engineers — hired by the EPA to conduct Barry’s dam safety assessment as part of the national review launched following the Kingston spill — determined that Barry’s dam was in “satisfactory” condition but had a “significant” hazard potential because a failure could cause major damage to the environment wildlife and habitat if coal ash were released into the river.

Alabama Power has modeled potential flooding in the area with the help of third-party experts but Bonnikson declined to provide CNN with the data used to run the model. In an email he wrote that the experts’ models for “extreme river and tropical flood events (showed) no overtopping of the ash pond’s existing dike wall” and that “Even a 500-year tropical flood with an additional 5 feet of storm surge showed no impact on Plant Barry or its ash pond.”

“Since 1965 15 different tropical storms and hurricanes have passed within 50 miles of the plant site with no impact to plant operations or the ash pond” Bonnikson wrote.

Storm path data from 1980 to 2020 shows that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico aren’t necessarily becoming more frequent and an analysis of synthetic aperture radar data which can be used to track how water saturates land showed no notable flooding near Barry after heavy rainfall. A predictive analysis of flood gauge data at Barry didn’t suggest large deviations from the norm in the coming years.

There is some evidence that more storms are reaching a higher intensity although there’s some indication that the frequency of storms may be going down Michael Bell an atmospheric science professor at Colorado State University said. In 2020 for example researchers at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and NOAA looked at nearly 40 years of data and found the probability of storms reaching major hurricane status — Category 3 or higher — increased decade after decade.

Sean Powers a marine scientist and professor at the University of South Alabama said changing weather patterns are his biggest concern about the Barry ash pond.

“Everything now is based on our understanding of the risk that exists now” Powers said.

“Obviously sea level will rise” he said. “Storms will increase at least in intensity if not frequency and all of those pose serious risk for the release of that material.”

While environmentalists keep an eye out for the next Ida some scientists say a less visible and more insidious crisis is already underway.

“Eventually (a disaster) is going to happen” geologist Mark Hutson whom the SELC hired to review Alabama Power’s closure plan for the Barry pond last year said. “In the meantime there will be decades of slow release of metals into the swampy areas.”

In his report for the SELC Hutson concluded that to effectively close any coal ash storage site the waste must be permanently isolated from water including groundwater and that the Barry pond’s location — on a meandering river system’s floodplain — was an unsuitable place to permanently store waste.

“No (new) waste disposal facility” he determined “would be permitted in this physical location.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVjb21sZWFkLmNvbS90ZWxlY29tLXNlcnZpY2VzL21vYmlsZS1uZXR3b3JrLW9wZXJhdG9yLXQtbW9iaWxlLWZhY2VzLWN5YmVyLWF0dGFjay1pbi1wb2xhbmQtMTAyNjk50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mobile network operator T-Mobile faces cyber attack in Poland,"T-Mobile Poland a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom has faced a cyber attack.

529 plans are the most commonly used college savings vehicle among my regular readers. They benefit from higher annual contribution limits than Educational Savings Accounts (Coverdell ESAs) can be front-loaded for up to five years and sometimes offer a break on state taxes. While not as flexible they are superior to a UTMA or other taxable account due to protection from tax drag as the account grows and the tax-free withdrawals for educational purposes.

As a general rule the contribution limit is $18000 [2024]. However there is nothing keeping your spouse father and mother from also opening 529 plans for your child. And they can all front-load five years' worth of contributions to their account if they like. Every state has at least one 529 plan and these plans compete for investor dollars across the country. This generally results in significant improvements over time as fees come down and investment options improve.

Which State Has the Best 529 Plan Tax Breaks?

An investor can mostly use any 529 they please. However many states offer either a state tax deduction or a state tax credit on contributions up to a certain amount. If your state 529 (and remember it's all about the owner's state not the beneficiary's state) offers this you should use it first at least up to the amount of the tax deduction or credit. The following states offer a state tax deduction or credit for contributions to their 529 plan.

Note that the info in this chart [Current 2024] is almost constantly changing. I had to update a half dozen of these the very day of publication and the laws of the various states will continue to change going forward so if you see an error please email us at [email protected] and we'll fix it.

Let's spend just a minute on this chart. If you are located in one of these states the best plan for you is your state plan at least up to the maximum amount in the chart above. Except where specified “per beneficiary” the amounts are per taxpayer. Virginia is an exception where the deduction is per account. That's right savvy Virginians open multiple accounts for additional state tax deductions. Except where specified as a tax credit it is a deduction sometimes “above the line” and sometimes “below the line.” Note that at the time I made this chart some states had not yet published the inflation-adjusted amount of their deduction or credit for 2021. For example my state of Utah offered a 4.85% credit on the first $2135 contributed in 2022. That amount should go up slightly for 2023. I'll try to update those as I get the information.

Judged purely on the size of the deductions or credits the most generous states appear to be Colorado Illinois Mississippi Nebraska New Mexico Oklahoma Pennsylvania South Carolina Virginia and West Virginia.

Your state may not be in the list above. That is the case for one of three reasons:

You have no state income tax (AK FL NV SD TN TX WA WY) Your state offers no tax deduction or credit for 529 contributions (CA DE HI KY NH and NC) Your state offers the same tax deduction for contributions to any 529 plan (AZ- $2000/$4000 per beneficiary KS- $3000/$6000 per beneficiary MN- Either a $500 credit that is phased out for most who read this blog or a $1500/$3000 deduction MO- $8000/$16000 MT-$3000/$6000 PA- $15000/$30000 per beneficiary). Note that Arkansas offers a $3000/$6000 deduction for using an out-of-state plan (less than the $5000/$10000 if you use the in-state plan).

The Best 529 Plans

If you are in one of the seven tax-free states in one of the nine states that don't offer a tax break or in one of the two states that don't care which plan you use this section will be the most important one in this post. If you are in one of the other states you should use your state plan at least up to the amount of the tax break. Unless your state plan is terrible you should probably stick with it even for amounts above the tax break just for the sake of simplicity. The most important difference between 529 plans is clearly the presence and amount of a state tax credit or deduction. There are fewer and fewer “bad 529s” each year and in many cases the states with a bad 529 (usually filled with broker-sold high expense ratio loaded mutual funds) offer a second one direct to investors.

However for those in the other 18 states let's list out the very best of the state 529 plans. For the most part finding the best 529 plan for you should be based on fees and investment options. If a plan offers relatively low plan fees and a nice selection of low-cost index/passive funds from places like Vanguard and DFA it is going to rank higher. The website usability communication and customer service is also going to vary but those are much harder factors to weigh. I'll make an occasional comment on them and leave it to readers to further comment on them in the comments section below the post. I am also going to ignore the “pre-paid college” plans. These vary by state but are primarily designed to be used by those attending state institutions in their state. They are a subject for another post.

The top half of the plans in the table above [click on the table to see a larger version] are all very good plans. The bottom half are good plans but not quite top-notch. I'm going to go through the top 12 of the best 529 plans and discuss them individually.

This was one of the bigger surprises of my review. This plan has made significant improvements (primarily lower costs) over the last few years and is now considered a top-rated plan by most. Costs are low investments are good the website is straightforward and the investment oversight is top-notch. And Morningstar rewarded the plan with its gold star award in 2020 and 2021.

This is the plan I use and so do many people from out of state. They have been rated “gold” by Morningstar for a decade. Expenses ratios are low and seem to get lower every year. Investment oversight is great. I even got the chief compliance officer to take a call from me on his cell phone in the evening. They made an upgrade to their website recently that I considered to be mostly a downgrade (thus the phone call) but they have plans to restore the information I was missing there (price per share info). There are both Vanguard and DFA funds but what I like best about the Utah plan (aside from the tax break for us Utahns) is the ability to really customize your asset allocation.

Illinois has a perennially top-rated plan. My big beef with them is I think they actually offer so many options that it gets confusing. There are 11 different fund companies represented in their line-up. However there are plenty of good ones and it is easy to keep expenses low. I'll be honest though. When I think of state governments that I trust Illinois does not spring to mind as being at the top of the list.

Like many states New York has both a direct and an advisor-sold plan. Make sure you're in the right one! The direct plan is frequently in the top five lists of savvy investors. I love that it is straightforward and low cost. You don't quite have the flexibility you get in the Utah plan but you generally save a few basis points in expenses.

California has also been in and out of the top five over the years. Expenses have always been quite low. I ding them for not having Vanguard funds and for having so many active funds available.

Here's another big surprise from my research. This plan does not get the credit it deserves for out-of-state investors. Good funds low expenses straightforward website. As for state income tax earnings are tax-deferred until they're withdrawn and distributions for higher education expenses are free. I wouldn't be surprised to see people considering this one a top-tier plan soon.

Nevada is another state with more than one 529 plan; make sure you pick the right one. This one run by Vanguard is often considered a top plan. The big advantage for out-of-state investors is that you can look at it while logged in to your regular Vanguard account simplifying your financial chores.

I have seen this one in top five lists before as well. I don't think they've really changed anything it's just that the competition has gotten more fierce. Costs are low just be careful because they use a few actively managed funds in there.

This is another plan many people don't know about. This plan actually dropped a few Vanguard funds for DFA funds recently but that's probably a good thing since the dropped ones were actively managed. Overall expenses tend to be a notch higher than most of the plans above.

This one is not a bad little plan filled with Vanguard funds and reasonable expenses. Probably not going to be on anybody's top-5 list though.

Be careful in Virginia they have a broker-sold 529 too that is actually used by a lot of brokers. You don't want that one. You might not want this one either. It was a favorite of Morningstar's for a while but they downgraded it recently as they changed their rating process. My biggest complaint is simply the sheer number of fund companies used. I like flexibility but too much complexity is not helpful.

Again beware the broker-sold option in this state. I'm not sure if this direct option is new or if Morningstar just missed it the last couple of years. It looks like a pretty decent plan and I wouldn't be surprised to see it move up the rankings in the next few years.

The Others

I don't see any reason for most to go much past #12 when trying to decide which 529 to use. But I'll make a few comments about the others on the chart anyway. If you're really careful you can make really great use of the Massachusetts plan (or the New Hampshire plan which could also go into the list above/next to Massachusetts). They're typical Fidelity—if you know where to look you can get the index funds with rock bottom costs but they're going to do everything they can to try to get you into the high expense actively managed funds. Most of the others are occasionally ranked highly by others but I dislike the lack of Vanguard funds. I've never been very impressed with the T. Rowe Price plans. Some people seem to like the changes that Oregon has been making but I found their site to be one of the most confusing out there. They recently changed from a deduction to a tax credit that will hurt high-earner residents too. South Carolina doesn't have the most straightforward website but it could be a really good plan for a few of you. . . .i.e. those who live in South Carolina. Nobody else is welcome. There are only about three or four plans that don't want out-of-state investors and South Carolina is one of them. I'll leave it on the list for South Carolinians to include in their search.

The Best 529 Plans: The Bottom Line

Look to your state plan first to see if you are eligible for a tax break there. Otherwise pick a plan out of the top 12 above and go with it. Certainly those who took my advice a few years ago and went with the Utah plan have had little reason to regret it. But there's no reason to be dogmatic about it. Enough other 529s have lowered expenses that there are now lots of good options out there. By carefully selecting investment options at any of the top 12 you can keep your expenses low enough that they won't be a significant drag on your returns.

What do you think? Which 529 plan do you use and why? Which would you use if you didn't get a state tax deduction or credit? Comment below!",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hazelight had issued a notice of abandonment back on 25 March 2021 the day before It Takes Two’s launch on all platforms. The official statement from the US Patent Office entailed that the company had respectfully abandoned ownership over the game’s name. In a statement with Eurogamer a Hazelight spokesperson said that the studio could not comment on the ongoing issues but remains “hopeful it will be resolved.”

Over the past year Take-Two has been on a rampage trying to file trademark claims against an array of companies and products. According to the US Patent Office’s records the disputes were targeted at businesses using generic words like “rockstar” “starrocks” “mafia” “social club” and “max fayne” (Max Payne) among others. Take-Two claims that the companies have been trying to profit off of their brand(s).

Take-Two isn’t saying that Hazelight is infringing but it doesn’t want them to be able to protect the name (and put it out of TT’s reach since it is so close to their company name). Imagine if they wanted to make their company motto “It’s Take-Two.” — Mike Futter (@Futterish) December 3 2021

In a tweet Industry analyst Mike Futter stated that the overreaching disputes were inclined towards future-proofing the names. Hazelight can still continue to use the name but it doesn’t have legal ownership anymore. “They could still use the name but so could anyone else without Hazelight being able to do anything about it” it reads.

“Take-Two isn’t saying that Hazelight is infringing but it doesn’t want them to be able to protect the name (and put it out of TT’s reach since it is so close to their company name)” said Mike. “Imagine if they wanted to make their company motto ‘It’s Take-Two.’”

Directed by Josef Fares It Takes Two is a fun rom-com platformer about two dolls – Cody and May. Players take control of each of them and complete a set of puzzles and other minigames in a split-screen co-op gameplay system. The game features an overarching emotional story about divorce and comes with a ‘Friend’s pass’ which allows the owner of the game to invite their friend to play for free. Meaning only one of you need to own the game.

It Takes Two recently got nominated for The Game Awards 2021 under five categories including the prestigious Game of the Year award. The title is currently available to download for free on the Xbox Game Pass subscription system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vY2FybC1qb2huc29uLXNwaWRlci1tYW4tZ3RhLXNhbi1hbmRyZWFzLXRyaWxvZ3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WATCH: Carl Johnson With Spider-Man Powers In GTA: San Andreas,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vY2FybC1qb2huc29uLXNwaWRlci1tYW4tZ3RhLXNhbi1hbmRyZWFzLXRyaWxvZ3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3JlZC1kZWFkLXJlZGVtcHRpb24tMi11bmNsZS1qb2tlLWFnZS1kZWF0aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Red Dead Redemption 2: Uncle's Darkest Joke Turns Out to Be True,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3JlZC1kZWFkLXJlZGVtcHRpb24tMi11bmNsZS1qb2tlLWFnZS1kZWF0aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYXlzdGF0aW9ubGlmZXN0eWxlLm5ldC8yMDIxLzEyLzA0L21vcmUtYmlvc2hvY2stNC1kZXRhaWxzLWxlYWtlZC_SAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbmxpZmVzdHlsZS5uZXQvMjAyMS8xMi8wNC9tb3JlLWJpb3Nob2NrLTQtZGV0YWlscy1sZWFrZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More Info About New BioShock Game Leaked Reportedly Set in Fictional 1960s Antarctic City,"Folks over at Video Games Chronicle and Sacred Symbols podcast host Colin Moriarty have lent some credence to recent reports of BioShock 4 which is in development at Cloud Chamber.

As previously reported the upcoming BioShock will be set in a “new-to-franchise isolated dystopian city.” According to both Moriarty and VGC’s sources the setting will be a 1960s fictional Antarctic city. Story-wise the game will be tied to the previous three entries.

“It takes place in a 1960s Antarctic city called Borealis” Moriarty said in a podcast for his Patreon subscribers per VGC. “[The game is] code named ‘Parkside’… I’ve been told that the development team has incredible latitude to get it right. That seems and sounds right to me.”

Worth noting that last week’s report claimed that BioShock 4 is tentatively titled BioShock Isolation but the leaker did say that this is subject to change. It’s possible that Parkside is just the code name whereas Isolation is what it’ll end up being called at retail. Or maybe it’ll be titled something entirely different altogether. You get the picture.

“Internally the game is very secret and apparently totally locked up” Moriarty continued. “Apparently the inclination there is that they understand full well that this game will be compared to what [BioShock creator] Ken Levine does. And by the way [Take-Two] is also publishing Levine’s next game.”

If Moriarty’s report is accurate BioShock 4 will release sometime in 2022. The game’s existence was confirmed back in 2019 but while a current-gen release is all but confirmed it remains to be seen if the game will land on the PS4 and Xbox One or not.

The five Syrians pulled from their homes by secret police on the same night last year were not insurgents spies or suspected of being disloyal to the country’s president Bashar al-Assad.

Instead they were targets in a desperate new phase of Assad’s battle to survive: the hunt for cash.

All five were executives at Syria’s second-largest cellphone company MTN Syria according to individuals familiar with the episode. Their arrests were part of a ruthless campaign by the president to seize MTN’s assets along with almost every other meaningful source of revenue in Syria’s shattered economy.

MTN was ultimately brought to its knees four months ago after protracted pressure in which those arrests were followed by demands for multimillion-dollar payments threats to revoke the company’s operating license and a dubious court ruling that put an Assad loyalist in charge of the company.

The South Africa-based corporation announced in August that it was abandoning the Syrian market under conditions that its chief executive called “intolerable.” MTN’s cellphone towers are still working its 6 million subscribers still paying their monthly bills.

“But where that money is going no one knows” said a Syrian executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “Honestly no one knows.”

Similar events have played out repeatedly over the past two years as Assad and his financially strapped regime have raided or outright seized dozens of businesses including foreign corporations and family enterprises that rode out Syria’s decade-long war in government-held territory according to U.S. and other Western officials as well as Syrians with firsthand knowledge of the regime’s actions. Neither the Syrian government nor the Syrian presidency responded to requests for comment.

Companies that had survived the war have been raided by teams of regime “auditors” and agents who scour their accounts for supposed tax and customs violations or other pretexts for hefty fines. Business leaders who stuck by Assad have been detained and pressured to cough up money to supposed charities that are widely seen as Assad slush funds.

The moves are part of what one Dubai-based Syrian executive called a “mafia-style money grab.”

The most brazen cases amount to corporate decapitations in which top executives are forced out under duress and replaced by Assad loyalists. Among them is a relative newcomer Yasar Ibrahim who in a two-year stretch has acquired control of MTN and other Assad-targeted companies.

Even members of the Assad family have not been spared. Last year Assad stripped his cousin Rami Makhlouf of companies and assets that had once been part of a massive portfolio estimated by Syria experts to be worth as much as $10 billion.

The regime’s campaign to commandeer wealth has only intensified since then. U.S. officials and Syria experts said it has been driven by the intense financial pressure on a regime that has been bankrupted by war daunting debts to Iran and Russia a meltdown in neighboring Lebanon’s financial sector and continuing economic sanctions from the West.

Assad needs the money officials and experts said to meet payroll for his military and security services to buy fuel and food for the capital and other areas still under regime control and to reward some Syrian elites who remained loyal to him through the war.

Against this backdrop an endgame has begun to unfold. U.S. officials and Syria experts said that Assad has so effectively consolidated his control over the country’s security apparatus and economy that he is poised to emerge from the war with a firmer grip on power than when it started. But after a decade of conflict he is left in charge of a dismembered and decimated state where nearly half of Syria’s territory is beyond his government’s reach entire towns lie in ruins and the currency has lost 85 percent of its value since the start of the war.

“In an era of a shrinking economic pie the fight for resources becomes even more ferocious” said Robert Ford who served as U.S. ambassador to Syria from 2011 to 2014. The climate of desperation “actually gives Assad even more leverage” Ford said because so few potential rivals have the wherewithal financial or otherwise “to contest Assad’s control.”

Assad has portrayed the asset seizures as part of his promised fight against corruption. “There will not be any suspension to this process or leniency with any person involved because … ending [corruption] is an economic social and patriotic necessity” he said at a ceremony in July marking his inauguration to a fourth seven-year presidential term.

And Ammar Waqqaf a Britain-based Syrian businessman who supports the Syrian government said that the targeted executives “are beneficiaries of privileges not open to the ordinary people. The state sees justice in getting them to pay more.”

Bashar al-Assad Asma al-Assad Maher al-Assad Rami Makhlouf Samer Foz Yasar Ibrahim Assad's shifting inner circleAs Assad has struggled to retain power in Syria and his hunt for cash has grown more desperate he has repeatedly shaken up his inner circle — even as the regime shakes down former loyalists.Scroll to continue ArrowDown At the center of power the Assads have remained a constant. Bashar 56 has ruled since 2000 when he assumed power following the death of his father. Bashar’s wife Asma 46 is a British-born former banker who heads Syria’s largest charitable organization. His brother Maher 53 is an army general who commands the elite 4th Armored Division which was behind some of the most brutal campaigns against protesters and rebels. Rami Makhlouf 52 is Bashar’s cousin and used his power to amass a fortune estimated to be worth billions of dollars. After a public falling-out with Bashar last year Makhlouf was stripped of control of Syriatel the country’s largest cellphone service and other companies in his empire. Samer Foz 48 is a businessman who built substantial wealth during the war acquiring companies from others who fled the conflict and picking up prize real estate holdings including the former Four Seasons Hotel. His standing seemed to wane after the United States imposed sanctions on him. Foz is rarely photographed. Yasar Ibrahim 38 has risen faster and higher than perhaps any other businessman. Virtually unknown before the war he has emerged as Bashar’s favored frontman over the past two years displacing Makhlouf outmaneuvering Foz and gaining control of the cellphone industry and other economic sectors. No photos are available of Ibrahim.

But the outcome adds to the bitter legacy of the Arab Spring which had raised hopes of political reform across the Middle East and expanded economic opportunity. In Syria the opposite has happened. Assad and his shrunken inner circle have found ways to cling to power and maintain aspects of their elite lifestyles while much of the rest of the population faces a deepening humanitarian crisis.

More than 90 percent of Syrians now live in poverty according to the United Nations. Many of the country’s hospitals schools and roads outside Damascus have been reduced to rubble. And drought has raised fears of famine with humanitarian groups estimating that 12 million Syrians’ access to adequate food is at risk.

The United Nations has estimated that rebuilding Syria will cost at least $250 billion. U.S. sanctions are already a major barrier to foreign investment and the Biden administration has signaled they will remain in place until Assad agrees to substantial political reforms.

The treatment of MTN and others may further undermine the prospects of any money flowing into Syria. “No sane and rational foreign investor would think of doing anything in Syria under the current operating environment” said the executive who described the assault on MTN.

A longtime kleptocracy

The mafia-like elements of Assad’s strategy go beyond the seizures of companies.

The Syrian regime has also become an alleged drug trafficker accused by U.S. and Western officials of producing mass quantities of the amphetamine Captagon at facilities in loyalist areas along Syria’s coast. In 2020 European and Arab authorities seized shipments with an estimated street value of $3.4 billion — more than Syria’s annual budget — according to the Center for Operational Analysis and Research a global risk and development consultancy.

The regime is also accused of diverting tens of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid intended for impoverished Syrians.

A recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies for instance documented how the Assad government has pocketed more than half of every dollar brought into the country by aid organizations — charging what CSIS said were artificially inflated exchange rates for Syrian pounds that aid groups need to buy supplies and operate. The Syrian central bank diverted at least $100 million between 2019 and 2020 CSIS concluded by accepting dollars from aid groups and returning Syrian currency at a fraction of its worth on the open market.

Even before the war Syria was widely perceived as a kleptocratic country in which the Assad family enriched itself by exploiting access to state-controlled assets and imposing parasitic partnerships on businesses.

But that approach has been upended dramatically over the past two years as Assad turned on formerly trusted insiders and abandoned any pretense of entrepreneurial partnership.

Among the main targets has been the telecommunications industry a singularly reliable source of revenue in a country where the poorest Syrians often carry cellphones even if they can’t count on reliable access to electricity or clean water.

Pressure on cellphone companies

The regime began targeting companies on the periphery of the industry as early as 2018 according to Syrians with direct knowledge of the matter.

In one early case a company that provided support services to the country’s main cellular carriers was told that its clients would sever their contracts unless the smaller firm’s owners relinquished control.

The company had more than 200 employees and revenue of several million dollars each year according to a Syrian executive knowledgeable about the episode. Senior managers were encouraged to stay and the business continued to operate largely as it had for years. But the company’s contracts were taken over by a new entity Al-Burj Investment Company the executive said. Al-Burj was controlled by Ibrahim a financier and businessman who has gained favor with Assad in recent years. Ibrahim’s sister Nasreen was listed on corporate records as an Al-Burj executive according to Syrian individuals familiar with the case.

“We were hoping to be one day be part of the new Syria — to be part of the reconstruction and that this regime would not be there” said an executive with knowledge of the takeover. “We no longer have any hope of going back.” The executive spoke on the condition of anonymity and asked that the name of the company not be published saying that relatives and employees still in Syria remain vulnerable.

The Assad regime soon shifted its attention to larger corporations that dominate the cellphone business.

MTN had entered the market in 2008 with the acquisition of a company that had been started by a Lebanese businessman Najib Mikati who is now Lebanon’s prime minister. MTN invested heavily and came to hold roughly 45 percent of the Syrian cellphone market.

Then in late 2019 the company was informed by Syria’s main telecommunications regulatory agency that the 20-year license it had acquired just four years earlier would be canceled without an additional payment of $40 million. When MTN balked regime pressure intensified a second Syrian executive said.

In May of last year the company executives were arrested. These five top employees including four men and one woman were detained in simultaneous 2 a.m. raids and taken to a prison run by the internal security branch of Syria’s General Intelligence Directorate according to Syrians familiar with the case. A sixth employee was taken into custody the next day from his office in Damascus.

The employees included MTN’s senior managers in Syria but not its chief executive who had left the country earlier in the year. The arrested executives were interrogated for nearly three weeks and faced threats to themselves and their families before being released Syrian individuals said.

“The main purpose was not to get information” one person familiar with the case said. “It was a message being sent.”

MTN began negotiating to sell its 75 percent stake in its Syria operation to a company called TeleInvest that was controlled by Ibrahim the Assad associate who had previously acquired the other 25 percent from a Saudi investor.

But the deal with TeleInvest was delayed by concerns about Ibrahim’s ability to secure the money for the transaction an executive said and then collapsed when the United States imposed sanctions on Ibrahim in mid-2020. The Treasury Department referred to Ibrahim as Assad’s “henchman” and said that “using his networks across the Middle East and beyond Ibrahim has cut corrupt deals that enrich Assad while Syrians are dying from a lack of food and medicine.”

MTN which operates in 21 countries across Africa and the Middle East worried that it might face U.S. financial penalties if it were caught doing business with the sanctioned Syrian the executive said.

When the deal fell through Assad’s government moved to seize control of MTN through different tactics. In a lawsuit Syria’s regulatory agency accused MTN of violating the terms of its license tax evasion and other charges and secured a ruling that put the company under control of a court-appointed guardian.

The company disputed the allegations and challenged the ruling in court in Syria but lost that case. An MTN spokesman in South Africa said that the company “declines to comment any further on this issue.”

The court then handed that role as guardian to TeleInvest the same Ibrahim-controlled company that had tried and failed to negotiate a purchase of MTN.

The South African company surrendered bowing out of a business that had generated nearly $1 billion in annual revenue before the war though earnings had contracted significantly during the conflict. The company still had 6 million subscribers when chief executive Ralph Mupita declared in August that MTN would “abandon” its business in Syria after having “lost control of the operations through what we feel was an unjust action.”

Dismantling a cousin’s empire

While still stalking MTN Assad orchestrated a more audacious takedown within his own family.

Rami Makhlouf is the scion of an elite clan that Assad’s father — Syria’s longtime leader Hafez al-Assad — married into. With virtual free rein over the country’s economy for nearly two decades Makhlouf used his influence to build an empire reputed to be worth billions though it was widely suspected that he was holding much of that wealth on behalf of his cousin the president.

Makhlouf’s most valuable asset was Syriatel the dominant mobile phone carrier in the country though he also held lucrative stakes in Syria’s oil banking and real estate sectors.

Makhlouf’s exploitation of state power was so conspicuous that he was put under U.S. sanctions years before the civil war broke out accused of having “manipulated the Syrian judicial system and used Syrian intelligence officials to intimidate his business rivals.” The U.S. Treasury Department in 2008 called Makhlouf “one of the primary centers of corruption in Syria.”

Last year Assad began publicly denouncing his profligate cousin in terms similar to those used by the U.S. Treasury.

The attacks on Makhlouf came as Assad sought to deflect blame for a deepening crisis in Syria’s already ravaged economy. A collapse in neighboring Lebanon’s banking system left thousands of Syrians unable to access their savings and sent the country’s currency into a tailspin.

Syrians also saw other reasons for Makhlouf’s reckoning. His family’s flaunting of its wealth — his sons have a habit of posing on Instagram with exotic cars — triggered outrage among impoverished Syrians.

There has also been speculation among Syrian expatriates that Assad’s wife Asma who was born in London and worked as a banker with J.P. Morgan before their marriage in 2000 was asserting more control of the regime’s finances to secure a fortune for the first family’s three children.

The dismembering of Makhlouf’s empire began in 2019 when Asma was put in charge of the assets of Al-Bustan Association a Makhlouf-run charity that claimed to support families of regime loyalists killed in the war but became known as a conduit for funding for private militias. In 2017 the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on Al-Bustan for “recruiting and mobilizing individuals to support and augment Syrian military forces.” The organization was at the center of “a vast private network of militias and security-linked institutions” the Treasury Department said.

Asma who survived breast cancer in 2019 also heads the Syria Trust for Development which serves as a major conduit for U.N. assistance money flowing into the country and as a key source of patronage for the Assad family giving it a powerful say over who receives aid.

Several Syrian businessmen who fled the war said that Asma was behind the push to seize revenue from the cellphone industry in Syria and sideline Makhlouf in part to ensure that her own eldest son Hafez is in a strong position to someday succeed his father.

Last year Makhlouf suffered the biggest blow yet when he was stripped of his shares of Syriatel one of the most profitable businesses in the country with control of 55 percent of Syria’s cellphone market.

A humiliated Makhlouf resorted to pleading for mercy from his cousin in a series of jarring videos posted on Facebook. He said Syriatel regularly turned over half its revenue to the state and could not pay more without facing collapse. He expressed disbelief that security agencies he once wielded against business rivals were now raiding his own companies. He pleaded with Assad to end his financial “suffering” and blamed a “cadre” close to the president for “framing me as the one who is wrong.”

In his most recent video in July Makhlouf ranted against the new owners of Syriatel accusing them of “thievery.” He obliquely compared himself to Moses suggesting that he would deliver Syria’s poor from the predations of the “war profiteers” who had taken over his former company. Makhlouf did not respond to a request for further comment.

Shell companies and stockpiled properties

The videos marked a staggering fall for Makhlouf while creating an unexpected opening in the position he had long held as Assad’s money man.

Several ambitious Syrians auditioned for the job. Among them was Samer Foz who had grown rich during the war by stockpiling properties including the former Four Seasons Hotel in Damascus which has continued making money by catering to leaders of aid organizations and U.N. delegations that visit the country.

Foz 48 had inherited a holding company from his father that billed itself in online brochures as an “international group operating in a wide range of industries” from pharmaceutical supplies to a Lebanese television station. Foz has homes in Dubai and Latakia Syria according to the U.S. government and is a Syrian national who also holds citizenship in Turkey and the Caribbean nation Saint Kitts and Nevis.

Syrians with knowledge of Foz’s operations said he amassed much of his wealth by exploiting his network of connections and ingratiating himself with Assad during the Syrian conflict.

Foz used a private jet to crisscross the Persian Gulf region soliciting funds for Assad from donors according to Syrians familiar with his activities. He also delivered ultimatums to wealthy Syrians who had fled the conflict that they could either sell to him the companies they had left behind or risk losing everything.

Secret financial records unearthed as part of the Pandora Papers which were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with The Washington Post show that Foz used the offshore financial system to set up shell companies outside Syria during the war to hold a yacht a jet and other assets. In 2017 documents show Foz changed the name of one of his offshore companies from “Foz Holdings” to “Skyy Capital Limited” possibly to avoid attracting attention.

But his rising profile and involvement in a brazen real estate scheme put in him the crosshairs of the U.S. Treasury Department. He was the lead private investor in a real estate project called Marota City which involved the planned construction of luxury high-rises in a Damascus suburb on expropriated land where the regime had bulldozed thousands of homes previously occupied by Syrians who fled the conflict.

The contract was valued at $312 million according to the Treasury Department and appeared aimed at attracting money from Persian Gulf investors. But the project foundered after Syrian backers faced a flurry of U.S. sanctions. Among them was Foz whom the Treasury Department accused of having “leveraged the atrocities of the Syrian conflict into a profit-generating enterprise.” Foz did not respond to a request for comment.

‘Moneyman duties’

Foz has since been eclipsed by another Assad-backed upstart.

Yasar Ibrahim a 38-year-old businessman who was virtually unknown before the war has presided over the shakedowns of major Syrian firms from an office in Assad’s presidential complex according to Syrian executives and experts.

There are conflicting theories about what accounts for Ibrahim’s rising influence. An expert on Syria’s economy noted that Ibrahim’s father had served as a consultant to Hafez al-Assad and that the Ibrahim family is from the same minority Alawite sect as the ruling family. “He is Alawite and they are loyal to Bashar not Asma” who was raised Sunni the expert said.

But others believe that Asma is Ibrahim’s main patron in part because of her reported close ties with two of Ibrahim’s sisters. “He gained Assad’s trust by that connection” said Joel Rayburn who until last year served as special envoy for Syria at the State Department. “Little by little he took on the moneyman duties.”

Either way Ibrahim now sits at the center of a remarkable constellation of companies in oil food construction and other sectors. One Hokoul SAL Offshore was hit with U.S. sanctions in 2019 and described by the Treasury Department as a “front company” for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

Most importantly Ibrahim has amassed near-monopoly power over Syria’s cellphone market having displaced the family owners of the support services company pried control of Syriatel away from Assad’s cousin and seized the reins of MTN after the company’s capitulation in August.

The regime has portrayed these forays as a crackdown on corruption a ploy that has won some public support experts said. In that vein Ibrahim has cast himself as a benefactor to targeted companies even as he displaces their owners and commandeers their cash.

A Syrian executive said Ibrahim had summoned senior employees of the seized telecommunications support company to his office trying to win their loyalties by saying he had intervened to rid the firm of corrupt bosses. He sought to convince the employees that he was “a good guy a gentle guy and a patriot” the executive said. In reality the executive said “Yasar is the bully” an enforcer for Assad.

Ibrahim did not respond to a request for comment made via the Syrian presidency where he works as an economic and financial adviser.

Ibrahim and his sisters Rana and Nasreen were also put under U.S. sanctions last year for their allegedly predatory roles in the regime. The designations forced them to remove their names from the boards of directors of Syriatel and other companies. But their standing with Assad appears undiminished. Earlier this fall Foz was forced to hand over his stake in the former Four Seasons hotel to Ibrahim according to Syrians with knowledge of the matter.

“The Ibrahims are by far the rising stars — it’s boggling how far their influence is spreading” said Karam Shaar a consultant on Syria and research director at the Operations and Policy Center in Turkey. Even so Shaar said Ibrahim’s standing is as precarious as that of any of his predecessors. The Assads “use people like him as pawns as fronts for the regime” Shaar said. “If you get too strong you will be chopped and replaced by someone else.”

Most in Syria face deprivation

Syria today faces a “humanitarian catastrophe [that] is now among the largest in the world” according to a senior U.S. official. The vast majority of the population lives on less than $1.90 a day and 6.2 million are listed as “internally displaced” by the United Nations meaning they remain in Syria but were forced from their homes by a conflict in which Assad used poison gas and barrel bombs against his own people.

In recent months there have been growing signs that other Middle East leaders who once worked toward Assad’s ouster are resigned to his survival. But U.S. officials and Syria experts said the prospects for postwar recovery in Syria remain distant. The Biden administration has cautioned countries across the Middle East not to aid Assad financially or otherwise. And while Russia and Iran helped rescue Assad militarily when he seemed most at risk of losing the war neither country has signaled any willingness to cover the projected cost of Syria’s rebuilding.

[After backing Assad Iran and Russia compete for influence]

Meanwhile life for ordinary Syrians continues to deteriorate. Soaring prices put all but the most basic foods beyond the reach of ordinary people. In Damascus lines for fuel stretch for blocks on end from the early morning hours till late at night residents say. Blackouts are common.

“We have deadly poverty high prices people cannot pay their rent” said Salwa a Damascus resident who asked that her full name not be used. “Everyone wants to leave she said. “People would give anything to leave the country.”

The shakedowns have padded regime accounts with the Finance Ministry claiming that government revenue had tripled during the first nine months of this year. But Assad may be undermining the country’s longer-term prospects said Shaar the consultant. “He thinks you can coerce businessmen to do what he wants but that’s not how economies work” he said. “They will run away.”

The country has indeed seen an exodus of business owners — possibly thousands of them according to Syrian media reports. Many are taking what remains of their capital and expertise to Egypt and other Arab countries.

Assad however remains ensconced in an upscale neighborhood of Damascus a city largely unscathed by the conflict. Elites who have profited from the war continue to dine out and drink in bars and restaurants.

Even the Makhloufs appear to be clinging to aspects of their privileged lifestyle. Rami Makhlouf continues to live at his villa in a suburb of the city. His son Ali surfaced on social media in October in Beverly Hills behind the wheel of a $300000 Ferrari.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sold a massive stake in his company over the past several weeks. And yet he owns 564000 more shares than he did at the start of the selling spree.

An analysis of his filings shows Musk is not backing away from his holdings in Tesla despite his promise to follow a poll he sent to his Twitter followers who called on him to sell 10% of his stake. So far he’s sold 10.1 million shares — about 7 million shares short of the goal.

That’s because at the same time he is selling shares he’s also exercising options to buy additional stock. And he’s doing so at a bargain exercise price of $6.24 a share well below 1% of Tesla (TSLA)’s current share price. Since Musk’s Twitter poll on November 6 he has exercised options to buy 10.7 million shares of Tesla (TSLA). To be clear he would have done so with or without the poll — the options were due to expire by August of 2022 if he didn’t exercise them.

And Tesla is poised to award Musk even more options pending its upcoming financial results. His stake in the company is the reason Musk is the richest person on the planet.

Taxes not Twitter main reason for sales

Whenever he exercises options he becomes subject to a large income-tax hit because he received those options as his primary form of compensation.

He owes about $5 billion in federal income taxes on the new shares he has purchased since November 8. He also will probably owe some amount of state taxes. Musk sold off Tesla stock specifically to cover that tax hit according to the filings.

Musk also plans to exercise additional options that are set to expire next year. He still has 12.2 million of those soon-to-expire options that he has not yet exercised.

If past practice is any indication he’ll sell about 5.3 million of those newly acquired shares to cover his tax bill. But that will still leave him with nearly 7 million more shares than he has today.

Musk is keeping most of the shares he’s acquiring rather than selling them all as other executives have been known to do when exercising options including Robyn Denholm the chair of Tesla’s board.

Once he’s done with these soon-to-expire options Musk will have 22.9 million fewer options than he had at the start of this process. But he’ll still have 50.7 million other options that will allow him to buy that many additional shares albeit at a higher exercise price than options he is now purchasing. He’s not likely to exercise them soon as virtually none of those options will expire until January of 2028.

More options on their way

The number of options Musk holds is likely to grow significantly in the coming year.

Musk’s pay package was designed to give him 12 different blocks of options once the company hits certain financial performance and market value targets. With the company now worth $1 trillion the market value targets are all already accomplished so it’s a matter of revenue and profit targets being hit.

Tesla has already accounted for three additional blocks of 8.4 million options each going to Musk soon for a total of 25.3 new options more than making up for the ones he is in the process of exercising. Company filings state that it is “probable” that the needed financial targets will be achieved soon.

Analysts agree. Musk could qualify for one block of 8.4 million options with the fourth-quarter results and two more with first quarter 2022 results according to Wall Street’s consensus forecasts. And if analysts’ estimates are correct he could get an additional 8.4 million options in the second or third quarter of 2022 and yet another blog early in 2023.

Additional stock sales

Musk sold a block of 5.4 million Tesla shares that he had previous held in trust over the course of three days shortly after the completed his Twitter poll.

Most of the shares sold in those transactions were probably ones he has held since the company’s 2010 initial public offering. So almost all of the $5.8 billion he received for those sales were probably judged to be long-term capital gains taxed at a lower 20% rate not the higher tax rate he’ll pay on the exercise of the options.

To hit the target of selling 10% of the Tesla shares he owned as of the date of the poll he might need to sell about 2 million more shares to cover the tax bill for his additional 12 million options.

But even if he does that with even more options due to come his way he’s still likely to have a bigger stake in Tesla than when he began this process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzg0MTQ2ODIvdGVzbGEtbmV3LWNoZWFwZXItYmF0dGVyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Model 3 Model Y Got New Battery Chemistry and Here's What It Means,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a38414682/tesla-new-cheaper-battery/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzg0MTQ2ODIvdGVzbGEtbmV3LWNoZWFwZXItYmF0dGVyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vZnV0dXJpc20uY29tL3RoZS1ieXRlL21hbmlhYy10ZXNsYS10aHJvdWdoLW9jZWFu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch This Maniac Drive His Tesla Through the Ocean,"Wait do Teslas float?

Amphibious Vehicle

One brave Tesla owner took what appears to be a red Model 3 off-road this week posting a video of the car driving around a beach. At first the water is shallow but the driver slogs through hood-deep water pretty easily halfway through the short 30-second clip.

It's unclear whether the driver is the owner of the YouTube channel that posted the clip. The Tesla is also surrounded by cheering viewers a handful of other vehicles and a small crowd in what appears to be some kind of friendly meetup.

Superfan or employee?

The YouTube channel called ""Wu Wa"" is dedicated to information about the Shanghai location and says the channel owner is based in Japan.

Most videos feature drone shots taken over the Shanghai facility so it's not clear if the poster is an employee or just a dedicated Tesla superfan.

Although the Model 3 seems to handle the water just fine the clip is short and doesn't show the aftermath of the all-terrain expedition.

While the aquatic adventure does look fun we're not sure we'd recommend driving your Tesla through the ocean any time soon. If the channel is run by a Tesla employee it's possible they were just showing off for the benefit of their employer — which would explain the vid's friendly title ""Tesla's amazing performance.""

The Roadster isn’t here yet but Tesla hasn’t changed its plan to still offer this array of 10 booster rockets as an option for the upcoming sports car.

The idea of what an electric vehicle that gets extra propulsion not via more torque sent to the wheels is quite intriguing and we really don’t know a great deal about how exactly it will work. Sure there have been racing cars with fans around the vehicle but those were there for aero reasons not providing extra forward motivation.

So how about strapping jet engines to the back of an electric vehicle? Do they actually give it a meaningful performance boost or are they pointless to have? Well Warped Perception’s Matt Mikka set out to answer just that and he created a very well made custom array featuring three small jet engines.

He first tried running the vehicle using the engines alone and with two of them working his Tesla Model S P85 could maintain about 60 mph (96 km/h) on the highway. Then he proceeded to test how big an effect they have on the EV’s straight line acceleration - he did runs just on electric power alone as well as with all three engines at maximum thrust and his findings are interesting but not surprising.

With the engines running the vehicle was around one second quicker to sprint to sixty although there were some variables that may have affected the result. However the answer still seems to be that they do indeed improve acceleration and shaving one second off the benchmark sprint time is still pretty impressive."

A surge in demand for semiconductors in areas such as automotive computing and communications has resulted in an acute shortage of these products globally. Chipmaker Texas Instruments (TI) is working to address the supply gap globally as it ramps up production capabilities and strengthens distribution channels according to Santosh Kumar president & MD TI India . Excerpts:

TI is said to be rapidly expanding production capabilities. Any plans for a wafer fab in India?

Strengthening our production capabilities is part of our capacity planning for the future. We are continuing to expand production lines at a global level and our recent acquisition of Lehi fab [in Utah from Micron] is expected to boost our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology.

More from a strategic standpoint the Lehi facility is focused on 65-nm (nanometer) and 45-nm production for our analog and embedded processing products. India is a critical R&D centre for TI and we continue to increase our investments here in building products.

We will leverage the strength of our talent here for local as well as global markets as we keep adding more product lines.

How are you responding to the surging demand for semiconductors/chip shortages in the global market?

The Lehi fab came to the TI stable as our fourth 300-mm wafer fab manufacturing unit. This investment is a great asset and will help us ramp up advanced semiconductor processor manufacturing. A few months ago we also introduced new purchasing features on TI.com for our customers in India to facilitate a localised faster and convenient buying experience.

These include payment options through online banking credit cards and a line of credit purchasing options in local currency to make it as easy as possible to get authentic TI products.

The chip industry is fast consolidating; will you opt for a more aggressive and acquisitive posture?

TI has been steadily growing every year and we have been recording strong results with increasing market share. We remain focused on investing in our people R&D and manufacturing.

We continue to strengthen our presence in industrial and automotive driving innovation and building products that customers want.

What is TI’s contribution towards making electronics more affordable through semiconductors?

TI has market leadership in power electronics. We work on a complete set of products for electric and hybrid-electric automotive markets including power electronics for motor drives real-time control units and various sensors. Market adoption of EVs in this decade has definitely pushed more technology innovations to be made available at the right price points.

Along with a strong market presence in ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) we have several plays in automotive markets where semiconductor content is continually rising.

Rapid progress is also being made on medical signal chain and we are delivering competitive products for markets such as CT X-rays and ultrasound. Communication markets are accelerating with 5G+ technology and we contribute to signal chain and RF technologies.

What makes analog increasingly relevant today?

Quite simply — all real-world signals are analog and these need to be processed. We need to condition and process these signal chains for humans or machines and that means there will always be a need for analog signal processing. That said TI also does a lot of work in the digital space and for thousands of our products we need analog digital and software competencies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy90ZXhhcy13aWxsLWJlLWhvbWUtb2Ytc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLWFtaWQtY2hpcC1zaG9ydGFnZS1nb3YtYWJib3R00gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3RleGFzLXdpbGwtYmUtaG9tZS1vZi1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctYW1pZC1jaGlwLXNob3J0YWdlLWdvdi1hYmJvdHQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas will be 'home of semiconductor manufacturing' amid chip shortage: Gov. Abbott,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared Sunday that his state ""will be the home of semiconductor manufacturing going forward"" as the chip shortage has been affecting companies around the globe.

""The country made a mistake over the past one or two decades to farm out manufacturing of all these essential supplies whether it be now semiconductors or could be health care supplies that we needed during the time of COVID whatever the case may be we need to not depend upon China or other countries for our essential needs for things like semiconductors"" the Republican governor argued during an exclusive interview on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

""That is exactly why Texas actually is leading the way becoming the home for semiconductors that go into everything that people use"" he added.

""It’s not just your iPhone or your laptop or whatever the case may be"" he went on to say. ""It’s also in all of these vehicles where you have manufacturing going on.""

As Abbott had stated on Sunday the semiconductor chip shortage was sparked by some regulations implemented – and decisions made – during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The shortage affected the auto sector heavily throughout the year. General Motors announced that it had to reduce some truck production in North America due to the global chip shortage. Ford has also pulled back production at several factories.

FORD GLOBAL FOUNDRIES TEAM UP ON CHIP SHORTAGE: ‘JUST THE BEGINNING’

Abbott and Samsung Electronics Co. announced late last month that the South Korean tech behemoth will build a $17 billion semiconductor factory in Taylor Texas.

The governor touted the move during a news conference as ""the largest foreign direct investment in the state of Texas ever.""

Samsung Electronics Device Solutions Division Vice Chairman and CEO Dr. Kinam Kim said Samsung expects to create more than 2000 high-tech jobs directly with the plant in Taylor and thousands more related to the plant once it is fully operational.

The chip-making factory coming to Taylor will also be the largest investment made by Samsung in the U.S. the company said in a news release bringing the firm's ""total investment in the U.S. to more than $47 billion since beginning operations in the country in 1978.""

Tesla also revealed last week it is now a Texas company according to paperwork filed with the SEC on Wednesday.

The automaker announced that its corporate headquarters is now located at its Gigafactory in Austin.

Elon Musk announced plans to relocate Tesla's headquarters from California during October's shareholder meeting following a year of friction with the state's government over COVID rules and a tweet from California state Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez that said ""F--k Elon Musk""

Musk also said the company was reaching the limits of expansion at its original Fremont California factory and that the expansive Texas facility offered more opportunity for growth.

Abbott told host Maria Bartiromo that in the first 11 months of 2021 ""there have been 70 businesses and corporations that have relocated their headquarters to the state of Texas.""

""If you look on average that means there’s a new headquarters in Texas every five days"" he continued noting that Tesla was one of those companies.

Abbott also pointed to Samsung’s investment in Taylor.

""That is in addition to the announcement the week before where Texas Instruments announced a $30 billion investment for semiconductors"" the governor added.

""Those semiconductors will help in the supply chain process.""

Abbott said the economy in Texas is ""growing and thriving"" stressing that businesses are moving to the state ""because Texas is the land of economic opportunity and innovation.""

Part of the reason ""so many businesses"" are moving to Texas he said is there are ""no mandates infringing upon individual liberty.""

""Texas has been very aggressive about legally challenging all of these mandates that the Biden administration has put in place concerning COVID"" he told Bartiromo.

""And whether it be vaccine mandates or mask mandates — whatever the case may be — we’ve been winning them all in the courts.""

""The only mandate that applies is my executive order saying that nobody in the state of Texas can be mandated to take a vaccine shot"" Abbott said noting that a COVID vaccine is ""available for anybody who wants it but there can be no mandates infringing upon individual liberty.""

Nine normal liver tissue samples were collected from parahemangioma sites of hepatic hemangioma patients without hepatitis and paired fibrosis samples were obtained from hepatitis B virus-infected alcohol-induced and secondary biliary liver fibrosis patients during operations before any therapeutic intervention. All of these tissues were diagnosed by histopathology. The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. Written informed consent was obtained from each study participant before this study.

Study approval and mouse treatment

All animal experiments were conducted at The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University in accordance with the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-Sen University (IACUC-F3-19-0311). Animal studies are reported in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines [57]. A total of 120 C57BL/6 mice were used for animal experiments in a blinded manner. Briefly 6-week-old male mice (20–25 g) were randomly allocated to the indicated groups and housed in cages with ad libitum access to food and water following habituation to a 12 h light/dark cycle. The experimenter was blinded to the group allocation. The mouse liver fibrosis model group was established via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with TAA or carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) for 6 weeks [58 59]. The control group was injected i.p. with the same volume of olive oil or saline only. For the BBR group a dose of BBR (200 mg/kg/day) was given by oral gavage [10]. In addition to the i.p. injection. with TAA or CCl 4  the mice in the treatment group received BBR intragastrically. In the inhibitor group besides the injected i.p. with TAA and BBR oral gavage treatment mice were injected i.p. with a dose of Fer-1 (1 mg/kg/day). Mice were sacrificed under 3% isoflurane anesthesia after 6 weeks of treatment; blood and liver tissue samples were taken and processed for subsequent analyses. At least five mouse hepatic sections were utilized in every group.

The beads were removed by centrifugation and the final samples were analyzed by western blot using the indicated antibodies.

Liver histologic and HSC staining

Masson’s trichrome staining Sirius red H&E immunohistochemical (IHC) and IF staining and double IF staining were performed as previously described [3]. Masson’s trichrome staining and Sirius red staining were used for collagen investigation and semiquantitative analysis was performed using Image-Pro Plus 8.0 (Media Cybernetics Rockville MD USA). For IHC after antigen retrieval 3 μm-thick paraffin-embedded sections were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 followed by PBS washes and incubation with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Next the targeted protein was detected using a secondary antibody and then incubated in DAB for intensification and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For IF staining the targeted proteins were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by the related biotin-conjugated secondary antibody and streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488® or 594® (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The nuclei were stained with 46-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). For double staining after completing the first protein staining the sections were then re-incubated and the secondary protein was detected. The liver fibrosis stage was assessed by the Ishak scale [60].

Perls’-DAB staining

Liver tissue sections were histochemically incubated in Perls’ solution (5% potassium ferrocyanide/5% hydrochloric acid) for 30 min. Then the sections were washed with PBS 3 times incubated in DAB for intensification and washed with deionized water to stop the reaction. Next the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.

Briefly after treatments HSCs were collected and washed in cold PBS three times. Then 200 µl iron assay buffer was added to each well of the cells on ice. Cell lysates were collected and iron reducer was added to reduce the switch from Fe3+ to Fe2+ mixed carefully and reacted for 30 min. Subsequently the iron probe was added and mixed thoroughly and then incubated for 60 min. The output was measured immediately at 593 nm by a spectrophotometer (BioTek-Epoch2).

Detection of lipid ROS

Lipid ROS level was determined using 5 µM C11-BODIPY 488 dye [35]. Briefly cells were seeded in 6-well plates treated with or without the indicated concentrations of BBR for 24 h with or without either the indicated inhibitors or agonists. Twenty-four hours later the culture medium was replaced with 2 ml of C11-BODIPY 488 medium. After incubation for another 15 min the cells were harvested in 15 ml tubes and washed with PBS twice. Then the cells were resuspended in 500 µl PBS. The cell suspension was filtered through a cell strainer (40 µm nylon mesh) and subjected to flow cytometric analysis to examine the amount of ROS within the cells. The fluorescence intensities of the cells per sample were determined by flow cytometry using a BD FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

Glutathione (GSH) assay

The GSH concentration in the cell lysates was determined using a GSH assay kit (Sigma CS0260) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly after treatments HSCs were homogenized in 50 mM MES buffer (Sigma–Aldrich M8250) containing 1 mM EDTA (Sigma–Aldrich 03620). The samples were centrifuged at 10000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C the supernatants were subjected to the GSH assay kit and mixed with GSH detection working solution along with standards and the samples were incubated for 25 min at room temperature. Then the output was measured immediately at 412 nm by a spectrophotometer (BioTek-Epoch2).

BALDWIN COUNTY Ga. — Jury selection begins Monday in the murder case of 38-year-old John Shane McAfee who was shot at his home over a year ago in Milledgeville according to District Attorney Wright Barksdale.

40-year-old Ray Pollard was arrested in Bartow County and charged with murder.

McAfee’s family told 13WMAZ a year ago that although they’re relieved an arrest was made there’s now a gap in their family that cannot be filled.

His family says he picked up and moved from Cartersville to Milledgeville to be closer to them. His grandmother Patsy Popp says he was adjusting well to being in a new city.

McAfee spent four years in Korea as a member of the US Army.

His family says what they’ll miss most about him is his sense of humor and how much he loved each of them.

McAfee also worked at the Sinclair Marina and Tractor Supply Company – both in Baldwin County.

Barksdale says he expects opening arguments to begin Monday afternoon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tY2FsbC9uYW1lL3JpY2hhcmQtc2NoYWVmZmVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxNzU1NjI20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Richard Schaeffer Obituary (2021) - Hamburg PA - Morning Call,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/mcall/name/richard-schaeffer-obituary?id=31755626 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tY2FsbC9uYW1lL3JpY2hhcmQtc2NoYWVmZmVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxNzU1NjI20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

One such perk is top-tier frequent flyer status that comes with free upgrades lounge access and chauffeurs.

Amazon and Microsoft even have dedicated check-in counters at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

Loyalty has its perks especially when loyalty means spending hundreds of millions of dollars on airline tickets every year.

Business travel is a leading revenue source for airlines and the top corporate spenders are frequently given extra benefits in exchange for their continued business. Some of the perks go way beyond what even the most frequent individual traveler could ever hope to receive.

Tech companies are among the top spenders on airline travel given as Big Tech giants have offices and facilities around the world. China for example is a top destination for Silicon Valley-based firms like Apple.

United Airlines in 2018 revealed that Apple was buying 50 business class seats every day on flights to Shanghai China. Apple's business with United at the time was worth more than $150 million in revenue.

Airlines however lost a big chunk of that revenue during the pandemic as international borders started to close in January 2020. Cost-minded leisure travelers tend not to spend as much as business flyers and are less likely to pay for premium cabin travel or costly last-minute fares when vacationing.

When big business does return to the skies these are the perks that will likely await them.

Expedited access to elite status

Employees that travel enough will often earn elite status with an airline that gives them extra privileges when flying.

""The basic idea is you get to bypass a lot of the hassles"" Brett Snyder founder of the aviation blog CrankyFlyer told Insider.

Acquiring elite status requires loyalty to a particular airline to the tune of a few thousand dollars in purchased tickets and tens of thousands of miles flown. But airlines can also offer elite status memberships to corporate travelers as a ""sweetener"" in a contract even before the first flight Snyder said.

Most of the perks will come from having that elite status but airlines can still go above and beyond for top corporate clients.

Dedicated check-in lanes

For some companies spending millions of dollars on travel means never having to wait in line at certain airports. At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for example Delta Air Lines has dedicated check-in desks for Amazon and Microsoft employees.

While check-in counters are becoming obsolete given improvements to self-serve kiosks and airline mobile applications employees can use them to quickly check their bags or have airline staff assist with any flight issues.







The scheme isn't replicated at every Delta airport for Microsoft and Amazon employees but they will still likely have access to priority check-in areas. Business travelers often earn elite status on the airlines they frequent and can often use priority check-in lanes as a result especially when traveling in a premium cabin as Insider found when testing out the lowest tier of Delta's elite status.

Some US airlines have private check-in areas altogether for elite status holders and premium cabin travelers away from the main check-in desks such as Delta's Sky Priority check-in area at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Access to invite-only programs

While elite status is a common perk of frequent business travel the highest echelons of those programs are reserved for an airline's top spenders. Attaining membership in the unlisted programs is the dream of any frequent traveler and top corporate clients may be given an allotment of memberships for their top travelers.

American Airlines has ConciergeKey United Airlines has Global Services and Delta Air Lines has 360°.

""These are highly coveted programs there's a mystery to them"" Henry Harteveldt a travel analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group told Insider.

Even if a member of these programs purchases the cheapest economy ticket on a given flight they will still reap the benefits of complimentary lounge access priority check-in lanes early boarding and a host of other secretive amenities that airlines won't discuss publicly.

Airlines have different requirements for who is invited into their programs and limits on the number of memberships they can distribute each year according to Harteveldt. Companies seeking to get memberships for their flyers would have to spend a significant amount on yearly air travel with spend requirements varying from city to city.

""Delta 360° is an annual invitation-only program for our top SkyMiles Members offering an exclusive suite of benefits and services even beyond Diamond Medallion Status"" Delta writes on its website. ""An invitation into Delta 360° is based on your overall investment with Delta. If you're selected to join we'll contact you directly.""

A certain number of memberships are then given to corporate travel managers to distribute to employees Harteveldt explained with airlines being incredibly mindful of how many are allocated.

Lounge access

Airline lounges are exclusive hideaways that offer private and comfortable seating when waiting for a flight as well as complimentary snacks beverages and food items. Corporate customers flying internationally in business class will often have access to these lounges included in their tickets.

Airlines will also give complimentary lounge memberships to their most frequent flyers. On American for example executive platinum status holders can choose to receive an Admirals Club membership as one of their free perks.

ConciergeKey Global Services and Delta 360° members also receive complimentary lounge access for their respective airlines according to Harteveldt Upgraded Points and SFGate.

Members of the ConciergeKey Global Services and Delta 360° programs need not worry about running from one flight to another when passing through an airline hub with a tight connection. Rather they'll be escorted down to the ramp and driven to their next flight in a luxury vehicle.

American will chauffeur passengers in a luxury General Motors vehicle while United transfers its passengers in a Mercedes-Benz and Delta in a Porsche according to Upgraded Points. [not sure this blog is reputable enough to cite on its own] Cadillac was formerly American's vehicle manufacturer of choice for airside transfers until the switch was made to GM the airline confirmed to View from the Wing. [caddy is owned by GM — so need different wording here]

It's a ""surprise and delight"" perk Snyder said that isn't guaranteed for everyone with a short layover. Airlines may also be more accommodating to passengers on delayed flights by holding their connections Harteveldt said depending on the customer and corporate client.

Priority Boarding

Elite status holders are often among the first passengers to board a flight whether they're seated in a premium cabin or not. ConciergeKey members for example can board ahead of first class customers and active duty military members even if they've booked a basic economy ticket according to American's boarding priority list.

Early boarding gives flyers first pick at overhead bin space and more time to get settled before the rest of the plane boards.

Better opportunities for first class upgrades

Complimentary upgrades to first class are among the most valuable perks for an elite status holder. A single upgrade can be worth more than the price of a ticket and instantly elevate a travel experience especially on longer flights.

In many frequent flyer programs any elite status holder can request an upgrade and they'll accommodate if there is a seat available. But oftentimes there ends up being people that don't make the cut because there aren't enough seats available for all elite status holders.

Corporate travelers however have a better shot at upgrades because airlines consider a variety of factors when determining who to upgrade. The level of elite status and how much a traveler's company spends with the airline in a given year are also taken into consideration.

""Generally if you have all things being equal the person who works for a large corporate account that may have a major business relationship with an airline would likely get the nod for the upgrade ahead of the person who is an individual traveler"" Harteveldt said.

An airline also might give a certain number of upgrade coupons to a corporate client that can be used to get a premium cabin seat Harteveldt added.

Drink coupons and free snacks

Not all of what corporate clients get are grand gestures however and sometimes a free drink can make the difference. Coupons for a complimentary alcoholic beverage are sometimes included in a corporate contract according to Harteveldt and offered on certain fares geared towards business travelers.

Airlines like Delta and American also offer complimentary alcoholic beverages in their extra legroom sections which companies may be willing to purchase for their employees. Southwest Airlines' ""Business Select"" fare also comes with a free drink coupon.

Some US airlines aren't currently offering alcohol in regular economy sections until the pandemic subsides but the perk will likely return.

Some airlines also might offer complimentary meals or snacks to corporate flyers even if they're sitting in economy on domestic flights. American offers Executive Platinum status holders a complimentary snack and an alcoholic drink in economy Snyder said.

Dedicated reservation lines

Airline hold times have markedly increased as airlines sought to shed their staff during the pandemic. Travelers can find themselves waiting on hold for hours.

Elite status holders however have special phone numbers to use when calling the reservations desk with shorter hold times and corporate travelers with elite status can also use them. Some companies were so important to airlines however that special phone lines were created just for their employees.

""In the past some airlines would create basically special toll-free numbers for their largest corporate accounts where the employees would call in and get a dedicated sub-group of agents within a reservations office so that they were served faster"" Harteveldt said.

Harteveldt noted that the perk likely doesn't exist anymore and those phone lines have been merged into the dedicated lines for top frequent flyers. ""If you put somebody into the higher tiers of a frequent flyer program they're going to get expedited service anyway"" he said.

Travel agents however including those with corporate accounts still have lines to many airline reservation desks Snyder said. ""It's for the travel planners the people that are doing the work"" he said.

Free or discounted extra legroom seats

Not all companies pay to fly their employees in a premium cabin on every flight but airlines can help make the economy experience more enjoyable by offering favorable rates on extra legroom seats according to Harteveldt. Delta's ""Comfort+"" seats for example offer extra legroom as well as complimentary alcohol and premium snacks.

Some airlines also offer complimentary upgrades into extra legroom sections for their elite status holders.

Airlines also block certain regular economy seats that don't offer extra legroom but have a more preferable location in the cabin. Snyder says that corporate clients may be given advance access to those seats ahead of the public.

Waived checked bag fees

A basic perk of earning elite status is getting a complimentary checked baggage allowance which can save travelers and their companies money when a trip requires checked baggage. Companies may also be able to negotiate lower fees for checked baggage Harteveldt said.

More flexibility for corporate travelers

Many US airlines have abandoned change fees for domestic flights but tickets can still be restrictive. The nature of corporate travel however requires additional leeway that airlines are willing to give to high-spending clients.

""You get much more flexibility as a corporate [client]"" Snyder said noting that some airlines have a system for clients where points can be redeemed for perks. Common perks include things like name changes on tickets flight changes and converting non-refundable tickets into refundable tickets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcmFtc2V5cXViZWluLzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvaG9saWRheS1naWZ0LWd1aWRlLTIwMjEtdGhlLWJlc3Qtc2VjcmV0LXNhbnRhLWdpZnRzLWZvci10cmF2ZWxlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Holiday Gift Guide 2021: The Best Secret Santa Gifts For Travelers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ramseyqubein/2021/12/05/holiday-gift-guide-2021-the-best-secret-santa-gifts-for-travelers/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcmFtc2V5cXViZWluLzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvaG9saWRheS1naWZ0LWd1aWRlLTIwMjEtdGhlLWJlc3Qtc2VjcmV0LXNhbnRhLWdpZnRzLWZvci10cmF2ZWxlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb253b3JsZC9oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtbmV3LXUtcy10cmF2ZWwtcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLWJlZ2lubmluZy1tb25kYXkv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9rdGxhLmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbndvcmxkL2hlcmUtYXJlLXRoZS1uZXctdS1zLXRyYXZlbC1yZXN0cmljdGlvbnMtYmVnaW5uaW5nLW1vbmRheS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are the new U.S. COVID-19 travel restrictions beginning Monday,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/here-are-the-new-u-s-travel-restrictions-beginning-monday/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb253b3JsZC9oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtbmV3LXUtcy10cmF2ZWwtcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLWJlZ2lubmluZy1tb25kYXkv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9rdGxhLmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbndvcmxkL2hlcmUtYXJlLXRoZS1uZXctdS1zLXRyYXZlbC1yZXN0cmljdGlvbnMtYmVnaW5uaW5nLW1vbmRheS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9nYWxsZXJ5L2Rlc3RpbmF0aW9ucy9hLXBob3RvLXRvdXItb2YtbWFsdGFzLXRvcC1oaWdobGlnaHRzLWZvci10cmF2ZWxlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Photo Tour of Malta's Top Highlights for Travelers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelpulse.com/gallery/destinations/a-photo-tour-of-maltas-top-highlights-for-travelers on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9nYWxsZXJ5L2Rlc3RpbmF0aW9ucy9hLXBob3RvLXRvdXItb2YtbWFsdGFzLXRvcC1oaWdobGlnaHRzLWZvci10cmF2ZWxlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZ3JpdGRhaWx5LmNvbS9ob3RlbC1lbmdpbmUtcmVhY2hlcy11bmljcm9uLXN0YXR1cy1hZnRlci1yYWlzaW5nLTY1bS10by1jb25uZWN0LWNvbXBhbmllcy10cmF2ZWxlcnMtYW5kLWhvdGVsLXBhcnRuZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hotel Engine Reaches Unicorn Status After Raising $65M to Connect Companies Travelers and Hotel Partners,"Hotel Engine a hospitality startup based in Denver has raised $65 million in Series B funding to expand its lodging performance network to help the tourism sector continue its recovery.

The story has been updated to remove that reference.

Chicken tenders may be the next casualty of supply-chain-generated shortages according to a report by NBC News.

Chicken tenders require more processing and packaging which makes them harder to find and more costly the report said.

The price of breast tenders has gone up to $3.54 a pound this week from $3.44 a pound at the same time last year according to a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture released on Dec. 3. Last week the price rose to $3.98 a pound the report said.

Chicken and other forms of meat have already been subject to higher prices for the past year.

The reasons behind the meat shortage vary depending on whom you ask.

With meat prices skyrocketing in grocery stores the Biden administration cited illegal price fixing by the meat-processing industry.

""USDA is conducting an ongoing joint investigation with the Department of Justice into price-fixing in the chicken-processing industry"" the White House said in a post in September.

Meat manufacturers cited extreme weather labor shortages and high demand.

""Multiple unprecedented market shocks including a global pandemic and severe weather conditions led to an unexpected and drastic drop in meat processors’ abilities to operate at full capacity"" Tyson Foods said in a news release in September. ""Labor shortages are also affecting the nation’s pork and poultry supply.""

Chicken shortage 2021: Is there a chicken shortage? How COVID chicken sandwich war and chicken wing demand are impacting restaurants

Not all experts agree the shortage exists.

""There is no chicken tender shortage. Like almost all goods right now supplies are somewhat tight but I would say it falls short of any 'shortage'"" says Tom Super senior vice president of communications at the National Chicken Council. ""Like almost anything right now some products might take longer than usual to get to where they need to be but in most cases they get there.""

Chicken tender prices have been declining since early September Super says which would indicate an increase in supply. Wholesale tender prices are down 18% from highs in early September according to the USDA.

""We’re dealing with the same rise in input costs labor shortages and trucking challenges as most other industries right now. In the face of all of these supply chain challenges chicken production will actually be up this year according to USDA"" Super says.

Plant-based alternatives have boomed during the coronavirus pandemic as the prices of meat have gone up.

Plant-based meat company Beyond Meat launched Beyond Chicken Tenders in July to hundreds of restaurants nationwide.

Companies with plant-based meats cut prices to be more competitive with meat prices and Beyond Meat experienced record sales during the pandemic The New York Times reports.

Plant-based meat interest experienced a 1320% increase in U.S. menu mentions since before the pandemic according to a report in August by Tastewise an AI-powered food intelligence company.

But what is certain is that meat will be part of it because if the pandemic revealed anything it was the enduring popularity of meat and poultry among consumers according to the 2021 Power of Meat consumer survey which was revealed at the 2021 Annual Meat Conference hosted by FMI – the Food Industry Association and the North American Meat Institute (NAMI). Innovation unveiled at the conference also confirmed this trend.

Currently in its 16th year the Power of Meat sponsored by Cryovac a division of Sealed Air and conducted by 210 Analytics delves into the meat buying and consumption habits of consumers.

The meat department had strong sales in 2020 despite growth in flexitarian eating and a decline in the number of meat eaters during the pandemic the report said.

Citing data from Information Resources Inc. (IRI) the report said “Meat department sales reached $82.5 billion in 2020 an increase of 19.2%. Volume increased 11%. The sales increases were driven by more meat trips and a higher spend per trip while maintaining very high household penetration at 98.4%. Gen Z millennials and Gen X all had above average contributions to growth.”

“The most profound change was in trips and baskets” said Anne-Marie Roerink principal at 210 Analytics. “Very early on we had a flurry of activity as people raced from store to store trying to fill their pantries their freezers their fridges. But right after that we had a lot of trip pressure and that meant while people were in the store they were buying a whole lot more each and every time and that same pattern is lasting all the way into February this year.”

Beef especially had a strong showing in 2020. Roerink said beef recorded not only the highest dollars among proteins but the category also saw the most growth.

“We don’t often see that happening to higher percentages” she said “but it’s incredible to see the industry pull together. Of course we have to recognize the declines that happened in foodservice as well but we certainly hope 2021 will be a better year for all of us.”

Keen for case-ready

Consumers’ perception of case-ready meats changed dramatically with favorability reaching a study high according to the report.

“In 2008 when we first asked that question we had quite a few folks wondering about the quality of case-ready and they thought that meat cut in-store might be of better quality” Roerink said. “But by 2020 case-ready favorability had advanced 70% over 2008 and the number of consumers who perceived case-ready was not as good declined almost 20%.

“This is moving to an 81% favorability and that is an important message for our industry today.”

Meat dollars at home

With consumers cooking at home during the pandemic 43% of shoppers bought more meat and poultry for lunch and dinner occasions. The increased demand during these dayparts was driven by the work-and-school-from-home trend according to the report. Additionally 4 in 10 shoppers bought differently because they were looking for better value cooking more meals and making fewer store trips.

Shoppers continued to make the majority of their meat and poultry purchases at supermarkets although online shopping received a big pandemic boost according to the study with 56% of shoppers having purchased groceries online in 2020.

“Additionally occasional online orders made way for steadier purchase patterns” the report said. “Meat also landed in online baskets much more frequently with 31% of all meat shoppers having ordered meat online up from 19% the year prior. Fresh meat trails frozen in online purchases with the exception of fresh chicken.”

Roerink noted that 29% of consumers have now bought meat online.

“We see not only more engagement but we also see people buying more frequently” she said. “IRI measured a 90% increase in meat e-commerce and now make up 10% of the total meat purchases.”

Among the key findings about online meat purchases mentioned in the study was that brands mattered more in the pandemic year with online ordering driving greater brand loyalty. In fresh meats perceptions of taste and quality were drivers for consumer preference for manufacturer brands the report stated.

“In fresh meats 52% have preference for purchasing national or private brands” the report said. “Brands are even more popular in processed meats at 67%.”

Roerink said other factors of concern to consumers included confidence in food safety and consistency and a company’s values regarding animal welfare and social responsibility concerns.

Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon projected confidence in the company's inventory levels and reported that supply-chain delays are improving during a meeting with President Joe Biden this week.

Speaking virtually at a roundtable with business leaders McMillon told the president that Walmart's inventory level is up more than 10% and transit and port delays are getting better.

""We'll keep working to make sure that we're in a good in-stock position as we go all the way through the season. We do expect it to be strong"" McMillon said according to a White House transcript.

The business leaders' meeting came on the same day the Federal Trade Commission announced it was ordering Walmart Kroger Co. Amazon.com Tyson Foods and other large companies to hand over detailed information in an effort to identify the causes behind the supply-chain issues.

The study will look at whether the supply-chain disturbances are leading to shortages anti-competitive practices and specific bottlenecks. The agency will require the companies to give internal documents on pricing and profit margins.

On the national level over the past four weeks Walmart has seen about a 26% uptick in throughput when it comes to getting containers through ports McMillon said at the meeting Monday.

""That's helped a lot as it relates to categories like toys which are so important for Christmas"" he said according to the transcript.

But supply-chain disruptions are still an issue shaping the economy according to the Federal Reserve. Labor shortages and supply-chain issues have constrained growth in several parts of the country despite strong demand a Fed report said this week. The report also concluded that the economy grew at a ""modest to moderate"" rate in October and early November in most of the Fed districts.

""The outlook for overall activity remained positive in most [areas] but some noted uncertainty about when supply chain and labor supply challenges would ease"" the report said.

Meanwhile more than 20 House Democrats issued a letter Thursday saying they are concerned about the supply-chain disruptions arguing that the U.S. House of Representatives should take further action.

The disturbances they said are increasing inflation and bringing about delays.

""It is imperative Congress acts to address the needs of the nation through additional action to specifically address the supply chain and resulting higher prices experienced by families across the country"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter.

The Biden administration has faced criticism from Republicans over its response to the supply-chain issues.

Best Buy Samsung Etsy Mattel and other companies were represented at the meeting with Biden earlier this week. McMillon appeared virtually.

Kroger Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen attended the meeting in person. The grocery retail executive said in a statement that the company is aiming to attract and retain employees.

""We feel great about our ability to serve our customers' needs through the holidays"" he said in the statement.

Biden has highlighted his efforts to rev up operations at two Southern California ports Los Angeles and Long Beach according to the White House.

Biden outlined his administration's role in a speech on Wednesday arguing the U.S. avoided a ""potential crisis"" and there have been financial incentives aimed at alleviating the supply-chain issues.

""The first thing we had to do was speed up the operations at our ports"" Biden said during the speech. ""Americans are buying more goods than ever and a lot of those goods come through our ports.""

In the FTC orders Walmart Kroger Tyson Foods and other large companies will be required to outline which factors are disrupting their capacity to transport and distribute products along with what they are doing to alleviate the issues.

Agency Chairwoman Lina Khan issued a statement saying ""supply chain disruptions are upending the provision and delivery of a wide array of goods"" including things like meat lumber and computer chips. Khan said she hopes the study will bring more information on ""market conditions and business practices that may have worsened these disruptions or led to asymmetric effects.""

Groceries can most definitely be classified as an essential good that people need on a regular basis but this doesn't mean it's easy to buy them. They simply aren't equally accessible to all shoppers. Per CNN the prices for groceries are expected to get even worse in 2022. The pandemic has led to a sharp increase in these rates.

Consider this: prices were perceived to be stable for four years or so before the pandemic hit and were said to be 3.7% more expensive in 2020 compared to 2019. Logistics such as transportation and labor were harder to arrange during COVID-19. This has impacted shoppers from low-income backgrounds in a big way. Unfortunately it's difficult to predict when things will get better.

Various companies food producers and retailers have been impacted. In response to soaring meat prices a recent statement from Tyson Foods read ""We continue to face accelerating levels of extraordinary inflation."" Even the popular supermarket chain Aldi hasn't been spared. Customers are now saying that some of their favorite items at the store are getting more expensive (via Reddit).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vNjc4MjYxL3RoZS1icmFuZC13aXRoLXRoZS1iZXN0LWZyb3plbi1jaGlja2VuLWFjY29yZGluZy10by00Ni1vZi1wZW9wbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Brand With The Best Frozen Chicken According To 46% Of People,"The Brand With The Best Frozen Chicken According To 46% Of People

Frozen foods have become a hot commodity. According to Supermarket News 2020 saw sales rise by double digits for most categories of frozen foods. Among the three biggest draws was poultry which brought in nearly 35% more money than in 2019. So there's a good chance a lot of people out there – maybe even you – are buying a lot of frozen chicken.

Maybe you love juicy chicken nuggets dipped in ketchup. Maybe you're a fan of crispy fried chicken with a side of mac and cheese. Maybe you're more into chicken tenders as a quick lunch. Or maybe you can't get enough of chicken wings slathered in buffalo sauce while you watch football on Sunday. Whatever your preference you can find a frozen version or prepare your desired meal using frozen chicken.

There are plenty of frozen chicken options that simply require popping in the oven microwave or air fryer. But of all the brands out there which one is the best? Mashed polled 604 people across the U.S. to find out what they think. Nearly half of respondents dubbed one of them their top pick for satisfying their chicken cravings."

Ralph was a distinguished fellow wearing that signature bow tie and reigning over his beloved Covington from offices at the People’s Liberty Bank building on Madison Avenue.

He had that warm ever-present smile and like so many terrific community-engaged businesspeople was fully committed to community service — and didn’t mind roping me into some of his favorite projects. He had plenty of them — everything from city beautification to good government to urban rehab to downtown vibrancy. If it was good for Covington Ralph was there.

Times changed and Ralph sold the bank enjoyed a wonderful retirement with his beloved Carol Ann — who had a special fondness for the arts — and when they died they left our region an amazing legacy — The Carol Ann and Ralph V. Haile Jr. Foundation.

They had started their Foundation originally to deal with their generous annual giving. But when Ralph followed Carol Ann in death in 2006 the Foundation was fully funded by their estate. They had no children but they did have special friends they considered family Tim and Leslie Maloney. And it was Tim and Leslie that they entrusted with the stewardship of their significant foundation. “Just have fun with it” Ralph said — and he and Carol Ann were confident they had put their legacy in good and responsible hands.

I was an early consultant to the foundation in my immediate post-retirement life after serving as president of the Scripps Howard Foundation so I too became an admirer of Tim and Leslie as they earnestly put themselves to the task of fulfilling the Hailes’ philanthropic wishes. They were indeed committed to advancing a legacy of generosity — and to serving the community in a special way.

And that they have done with amazing success.

This week Tim and Leslie have announced that they plan to retire from the foundation in March of 2022 some 16 years after starting with a blank slate. Today the slate is more than full — and the region is richer for it in so many ways.

Consider 2600 grants totaling more than $185 million. Consider the Haile College of Business at NKU the extraordinary Carol Ann’s Carousel at Cincinnati’s Smale Park consider BLINK an art and light event that drew more than a million visitors in each of its two years to Cinci and NKY the renovation of Music Hall — and so much more. Consider the hundreds of life-changing grants enabling nonprofits around the region to advance human services community development education and arts and culture.

“The impact that the Haile Foundation has made in our region over the last 15 years is remarkable” said Vickie Buyniski Gluckman a Foundation Advisory Committee Member in a public statement. “The vision of Tim and Leslie has helped create equity in education support of innovative entrepreneurship and the building of big ideas like BLINK. They have built a legacy that would have made Ralph and Carol very proud.”

Proud indeed.

The Maloneys said in making their announcement:

• “It is critically important to Leslie and me that we honor the wishes traditions and gifts of Carol Ann and Ralph. They were our mentors and friends and I feel that they would be proud of our choices and accomplishments. It’s a joyous obligation to keep their legacy alive” said Tim Maloney.

• “Carol and Ralph gave us the one-of-a-kind opportunity to make positive and lasting change in the region we call home” said Leslie Maloney. “It’s been a terrific responsibility and we are eager to see the continued investment and innovation of the next generation of Haile Foundation leadership.” (Leslie famously wore Carol Ann’s wedding dress at her own wedding.)

Tim who served as the Foundation’s president and CEO spent over 25 years in banking himself his last role as Senior Vice President and Region Manager for the U.S. Bank Private Client Services Group. He has served on numerous community boards and helped found the Kentucky Commission on Philanthropy. He is the consummate team player — and a valued community leader.

Leslie who oversees the Foundation’s educational investments as well as its human resources and communications activities spent 27 years in human resources as a consultant with Hewitt Associates LLC. She too has served on a number of community boards.

They have two sons and are undoubtedly looking forward to a well-deserved retirement.

While change is inevitable it’s hard to imagine the Haile Foundation without them — without the special love and care they brought to it inspired by the special connection they had with its founders.

This community owes them a big debt of gratitude for their stewardship of an incredible community asset.

They mean to leave the Foundation in good hands and they have set the precedent. Efforts are underway to hire a new CEO. The Foundation board is working with Lynn Mayfield Consulting in the search process. Inquiries or questions can be directed to lynnmayfield62@gamil.com 513.332.3556.

Godspeed Tim and Leslie. And thank you.

The writer is an economics professor at Rutgers University

One of the great misnomers in the crypto world is stablecoins. These digital assets are meant to provide a safer exposure to crypto with coins pegged to stores of value such as the dollar or gold to limit price fluctuations and facilitate transactions.

But they are far from stable. My research has shown 2016 and 2019 vintages of new stablecoins had failure rates of 100 per cent and 42 per cent respectively. The problem for broader financial stability is that even the successful coins that have seen explosive growth have flaws.

The Biden administration has recognised the risks and a working party advising the US government this month issued a series of recommendations it says are urgent given the rapid expansion of the sector.

There are five stablecoins with market capitalisations of more than $5bn — Tether USD Coin Binance USD Dai and TerraUSD. Overall there are about $140bn of stablecoins outstanding. If ranked purely by asset size the market would be equivalent to a top 30 US bank.

Stablecoins were used in $1.77tn of transactions in the second quarter of 2021. While this turnover is still less than 10 per cent of the $18.4tn of payment volumes in the same quarter through Automated Clearing the main system for US electronic fund transfers stablecoin transactions have grown more than 1100 per cent year over year.

A primary issue of concern is transparency and quality of collateral for stablecoins. If doubts about the securities backing the coins trigger a rush of redemptions that could damage the entire payments mechanism as well as the prices of assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum with a combined market capitalisation of more than $1.5tn.

Tether the stablecoin leader with about $75bn in coins has been accused in the past of making misleading claims about the assets backing them. Last month it agreed to pay a $41m penalty to resolve a charge by a regulator that it had falsely represented that its digital tokens were fully backed by dollars. Earlier this year Tether and a linked exchange Bitfinex also agreed to pay an $18.5m penalty after New York’s attorney-general accused them of covering up “massive” financial losses.

The backing of USD Coin a stablecoin leader launched by a consortium including cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and technology firm Circle has also come under scrutiny. The Coinbase website has claimed in the past that each coin was backed by dollars held in government-backed US depository institutions. It now says its coins are “backed by fully reserved assets”.

Dai backs its stablecoin with collateralised debt positions in Ethereum network assets but according to data from CoinMarketCap it appears to have deviated from its peg during rapid changes in Ether prices. Dai — which should trade at par with equivalent of $1 of asset backing — fell below $0.97 on February 20 2020 and rose as high as $1.11 on March 13 2020.

The Biden administration report recommends that stablecoin issuers become institutions covered by insurance from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. While a few coins such as Binance USD are partially collateralised by bank deposits backed by FDIC current law may only protect the issuers not the coin holders.

There are additional risks to the stablecoins aside from collateral. Turbocharged by high-frequency trading there is more than $100bn in daily turnover of Tether on exchanges. That is a level comparable with the trading volume of the NYSE.

Unfortunately the infrastructure for stablecoin trading is not as robust as some might hope. The two largest exchanges Binance and Coinbase had platform outages on May 19 when China banned most crypto payments and Bitcoin prices fell more than 30 per cent. Investors have little regulatory protection from the fallout of such incidents.

There are also risks as the number of stablecoin blockchains diversifies. Most stablecoins originated on the Ethereum network. But fee rises on that are spurring the migration of tokens on to other platforms. Median fees for transferring holdings on the network have risen more than 3500 per cent for Tether year over year. This is because fees are priced in Ethereum and its price jumped from $226.31 to $2274.55 in the year to June 30.

The payments mechanism needs to be modernised and blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies made more secure and cheaper. A central bank issued digital currency with major financial institutions as intermediaries can accomplish these goals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpa2luZ3MuY29tL3Bob3Rvcy80OXRoLWFubnVhbC1taW5uZXNvdGEtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtZm9vdGJhbGwtc2hvd2Nhc2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,49th Annual Minnesota High School Football Showcase,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.vikings.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /photos/49th-annual-minnesota-high-school-football-showcase (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000230020F8510>, 'Connection to www.vikings.com timed out.

Concepts such as decentralisation distributed ledgers and symmetric encryption can befuddle the outsider. Scholars and regulators may therefore have been relieved to spot parallels between the burgeoning world of stablecoins—digital tokens that are pegged to an existing currency or commodity—and America’s free-banking era of the 19th century. Indeed recent discussions about stablecoins have sparked a lively debate around the history of privately issued money.

Together the dozens of stablecoins in existence which include Dai Tether and USD coin have a market capitalisation of close to $150bn. As they have exploded in value their similarity to banks has begun to exercise regulators. Like banks they in effect take deposits and promise immediate redemption; if many holders want to withdraw their money at the same time and the issuer holds risky assets then the digital coins could be in danger of collapsing. On November 30th Janet Yellen America’s treasury secretary said that the tokens presented “significant risks” and pressed for more regulation."

With the devastating effects of COVID-19 all around the world women and those in marginalized communities are even more at risk.

I’ve seen firsthand the reverberating effects of gender-based violence on communities during my time working on federal gender and diversity initiatives in Canada. From my experience the most effective way to make a difference is working together in a comprehensive sustained way across government business and the non-profit sectors to prevent educate and innovate.

Uber has taken its commitment to improve safety in our industry and in our communities seriously. We continue to work with experts in safety and gender-based violence to refine our policies and processes so that we are a more survivor-centric company.

R360

R360 is an invite-only club for individuals with a net worth of $100 million or more.

The Denver-based club offers access to investment opportunities and exclusive getaways.

Its founder and managing partner told Insider that members want to become ""responsible stewards.""

There's rich and then there's uber-rich.

R360 a Denver-based invite-only investment and networking club caters to people in the latter category.

There are three things people need to do to become members of the club which launched this year its founder Charlie Garcia and managing partner Michael Cole told Insider.

First they must have attained a net worth of $100 million or more. Second participants must be able to afford a three-year fee of $180000. And third they must meet the strict requirements set out by a membership committee who always get the final say.

""We are very focused that they align with our purpose and most importantly our values"" Garcia said.

The purpose of R360 is to create an ""oasis"" for these high-net-worth individuals and their families to flourish according to Garcia. The core values of the group include honor entrepreneurial grip curiosity and generosity of spirit he added.

Essentially the goal of the club is for members is to become knowledgeable across six kinds of capital: financial intellectual spiritual human emotional and social.

Both Garcia and Cole said they have been involved in working with wealthy families for decades and found common ground with them all inspiring the evolution of R360.

When people achieve a wealth of $100 million or more ""the issues they face the concerns they have the risks they worry about and their opportunities are just frankly unique than someone of lesser wealth"" Cole said.

A lot of those individuals grew up very poor or were very lower-middle class according to Garcia. ""They had an entrepreneurial gene and a fear of being poor. The one thing they didn't want is to have their families experience what they experienced"" he said.

Many go on to achieve great wealth due to this mentality and when they do so become ""immigrants to the land of great wealth"" Garcia said. ""They want to make sure that they're responsible stewards and that they raise socially responsible children"" he continued.

According to Cole the uber-rich tend to feel very isolated over time too. This is sometimes due to their lack of trust in people because they might feel like they're being ""sold.""







As a result Garcia said he had a keen interest in working with such individuals to help direct their ability skills and wealth towards a significant legacy for themselves and those around them.

Bringing a group of like-minded individuals together in similar circumstances where they can let down their guard and be open and vulnerable was another reason to create the exclusive club the pair said.

""These individuals have a great desire to learn from to share with and collaborate with people in similar circumstances to them"" Cole said. Therefore having a facilitated model that focuses on more than just making money was a gap that R360 filled.

While there isn't a headquartered private space members still receive various perks. These include access to experts at Ivy League universities and medical schools such as Harvard Columbia and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Group trips to exotic locations that are ""fun with a purpose"" are part of the package too.

In July Cole said about 30 members went on a five-day retreat on Richard Branson's private Necker Island. There they were treated to a lineup of influential speakers. They also played tennis with Branson and visited parts of the island that are home to endangered species.

R360's key ambition is to curate a league of 1000 of the rarest individuals to inspire and challenge future generations Garcia said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZ3VlMS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyLzA0L3BzZy1oYWtpbWktZXZlcnktZ2FtZS1pcy10b3VnaC1pbi1saWd1ZS0xLXViZXItZWF0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hakimi: 'Every game is tough' in Ligue 1 Uber Eats,"With experience in La Liga the Bundesliga and Serie A Hakimi knows of what he speaks. The 23-year-old is enjoying an excellent season with PSG who have a 12-point lead atop the standings but the defender is keen to underline that this is no mean feat given the quality of the competition in France's top tier.

'Very tough'



""It's a very tough league very physical and the level is very very high even if people don't always think so"" he said in the press conference ahead of Saturday night's Round 17 clash in Lens. ""There are a lot of games and a lot of difficult stadiums with great players here. Every game is tough to play.""

The Spanish-born Moroccan international hasn't been caught off guard but the quality in France however.

""I had already seen a lot of Ligue 1 matches"" he explained. ""I also knew a lot of players from my national team who play here and I also played against French teams so I expected it. The teams and the level here are very high.""

'The atmosphere is electric'

And one side who are impressing with their quality this season are RC Lens who despite having the 16th-highest budget of Ligue 1 Uber Eats's 20 clubs are looming as serious contenders for a European finish. PSG's trip to the always electric Stade Bollaert-Delelis on Saturday come hot on the heels of PSG's mid-week stalemate at home to Nice (0-0) and Hakimi feels that the club's busy schedule can be an asset at times.



""It's a good thing to play at a big club that plays every three or four days between the Champions League the championship and the Coupe de France that is coming up because it allows us to quickly move on and to immediately start working to improve"" he said. ""We have a game tomorrow and it is an opportunity for us to show everyone what we are capable of that the last match is behind us now and we are in the present more motivated than ever to chase more victories. I was told that the atmosphere is electric in Lens so we will have to be prepared for that! ""

Having given refuge to a goat farmer with over 100 goats Kilmer-Purcell a marketing exec and Ridge a physician started Beekman 1802 by selling bars of soap made of goat milk to their neighbors the pair said during their presentation at the 2021 Beauty CEO summit.

“You cannot say no to a homeless farmer or 100 homeless goats so we said sure come on and join us. That single act of kindness set the course for Beekman 1802” Ridge said.

The brand extends that ethos to every aspect of its operations from its internal culture to its marketing and product development. “Kindness is not just a tagline to us it’s not just a seasonal marketing initiative. It is truly our purpose” Kilmer-Purcell said.

Although simple the game plan is paying off. “This is not a luxury this is our purpose this is our competitive advantage. This is our strategy. And last year we actually hit for the first time $150 million in retail sales” Kilmer-Purcell added.

The brand was an early entrant to the explosion in microbiome-friendly skin care as goat milk promises to not disrupt it. “If you treat your skin’s microbiome with a little bit of kindness it stays healthier and more balanced. We call this clinically kind skin care” Ridge said. “We believe that microbiome health is the new clean beauty. Now clean beauty of course has no definition. And it typically focuses on what a product isn’t the things that it doesn’t contain. Microbiome health focuses on what a product does.”

Beekman 1802 is the first microbiome-certified skin care line at Ulta Beauty and the only one at QVC and HSN Ridge said.

Kilmer-Purcell added that the clinical effects of kindness on the human psyche also have implications in beauty calling it a “revolutionary wellness platform” and describing how it moderates stress hormones which can impact cellular function repair and renewal.

The pair have opened up their farm to others too. This past year in celebration of Pride month they hosted a marathon of weddings for 37 couples in a single day. “We provided everything from music to photography and several Beekman team members actually certified themselves to officiate the services” Ridge added.

The year prior in the earlier days of the pandemic they created a socially distanced event space for closed restaurants to revive their revenues. Now the brand is going as far as to work with Oxford University’s Dr. Oliver Scott Curry to study the impacts of kindness in the workplace and is allowing consumers to apply for $500 “kindness grants” to help fund acts of goodwill.

“We spread kindness like we spread moisturizer — it’s everywhere” Kilmer-Purcell said.

The United State ranks dead last in the world for paid maternity leave for new moms. Ignoring the ""humanity"" aspect of caring for pregnant female employees by caring for employees better businesses will ultimately enjoy better long-term returns as the cost of high-turnover rates can ultimately cost anywhere from 1.5 to 2 times more than a worker's salary.

The fact that some 53% of US families live in dual-income households also points to the overwhelming necessity for folks to keep jobs. And just from a large-scale ""continuation of society"" standpoint by investing in ensuring children and their mothers are well taken care of means there's a greater chance of creating productive efficient upstanding members of society that can contribute to the world as a whole.

While there are certainly instances of employees who may abuse their benefits there are tons of evidence-driven arguments that highlight the benefits of focusing on worker loyalty. According to these two TikTok-ers @theshelbsshow and @maddiebwells along with some other TikTok users the Ulta stores that they worked at don't appear to prioritize the health of their pregnant female employees leading to negative workplace experiences.

In a viral clip uploaded by Maddie she and Shelbs shared their experiences of working at Ulta. In the clip Shelbs can be seen holding her infant son in her lap as she spoke about her experience at Ulta. She claims that she told her manager ahead of her pregnancy that she wouldn't be able to perform manual labor tasks but was forced to do so anyway.

She adds that while she was placed on bedrest her manager took disciplinary action against her docking her a point despite the fact that Shelbs was ordered by her doctor to not over-exert herself. ""They would ask me to get on ladders to put like backstock items up they would have me bend over and put things on and off shelves like push a big cart around.""

Shelbs added ""It was pretty much just a complete disregard for all the things I told them I couldn't do."" Maddie's uploaded several videos delineating her negative experiences working at Ulta too. She called the workplace a ""toxic"" one and that there were hundreds of comments posted to her clips from other users who also worked for the retailer and echoed her sentiments.

Maddie said that ""leniency"" when it came to sick days was pretty much non-existent even if an employee was pregnant. Their joint video racked up thousands of comments with many people citing US laws regarding pregnancy discrimination.

Others suggested that Maddie and Shelbs sue the store as forcing a pregnant employee to perform manual labor tasks that may jeopardize the health of their baby is ""highly illegal.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8wNC9mbGFzaC1tb2Itcm9iYmVyaWVzLW9yZ2FuaXplZC1jcmltZS1ub3Jkc3Ryb20tYmVzdC1idXktcmV0YWlsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flash mob robberies are a multibillion dollar problem for retailer,"A spate of brazen sometimes violent robberies by organized rings descending on stores to steal everything from $5000 handbags to $10 razor-blade packs in lightning-quick attacks is the latest challenge for a beleaguered retail industry already grappling with high employee turnover supply chain headaches and skittish shoppers.

Last month dozens of ski-mask wearing thieves swarmed a Nordstrom in tony Walnut Creek Calif. They blocked road access with their cars before proceeding to smash display cases and take whatever they could off of the racks then escaped to awaiting getaway cars all in matter of minutes. It was hardly an isolated occurrence for the upscale retailer: smaller scale organized ‘flash mob’ robberies hit two Nordstrom stores in the Los Angeles area a few days later. These came soon after similar thefts last month at Louis Vuitton Burberry and Bloomingdale’s stores in San Francisco’s upscale Union Square. Lululemon Athletica and Ulta Beauty have also been targeted by these groups while Walgreens has closed five stores in San Francisco because of the problem.

The incidents continued over the holiday weekend: Best Buy found itself in the crosshairs of ‘flash mobs’ at three stores in suburban Minneapolis over the Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday weekend the busiest of the year for retailers. The problem has led retail industry leaders to sound the alarm noting the threat to attracting and retaining the workers they desperately need to staff stores adequately as well as the feeling of safety essential to keep shoppers coming.

But the problem is not likely to go anyway anytime soon. The robberies are a tactic of well-established organized crime syndicates looking to replenish inventory of ‘hot’ goods they can sell on resale sites during the holiday season shopping rush.

“The people you see running out of the stores with their merchandise are actually people who are recruited by the criminal organizations profiting from this” said Ben Dugan president of the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail a trade group focused on fighting crimes committed at retailers. “There are tiers to it from soldiers to captains to crew leaders — the whole deal.” Just like the mob he added. The groups he leads has estimated that organized retail crime is responsible for around $45 billion in annual losses 50% more than a decade ago.

The crime syndicates typically recruit locally paying participants about $300 to $500 each in the case of the Nordstrom attack Dugan estimates. They might even provide them with the getaway cars. And reflecting the gravity of these crimes the ‘retail mob’ robberies are typically treated as felony crimes since they are planned events and involve the resale of stolen goods moving across state lines. In contrast someone independently shoplifting a tube of toothpaste for personal use is committing a misdemeanor.

And like everything else these days product shortages are playing a role in exacerbating the spate of retail flash mobs Dugan said. “I don’t think there’s any mistake that that happened before Black Friday and before Cyber Monday” he said. “I mean the criminal organizations that control the online markets needed product. And there’s a supply chain crisis right?”

A new source of worker anxiety

The problem has caught the attention of political leaders particularly on the West Coast where the attacks have been more concentrated and more brazen. “They’re not just stealing people’s products and impacting their livelihoods they’re stealing a sense of place and confidence” California Governor Gavin Newsom said while announcing an increase in funding to law enforcement to fight organized retail crime.

That sense of place and confidence is key to retailers in protecting stores which are increasingly important to supporting their e-commerce as they compete with Amazon. Target for instance relied on its stores for 95% of sales last quarter when including their roles in filling online orders be it a customer coming in to pick the order up or the store mailing an item to the customers.

“These mobs attacking stores suggest to people ‘I’m not going there.’ And if they were predisposed to shop online only this is a hell of a motivation to do that” said Columbia Business School retail professor Mark Cohen.

Retailers aren’t sitting idly by for the problem to go away. Target declined to quantify the potential hit to its business from organized theft or detail how it combats the problem but a spokesman told Fortune that “our security teams in every store are trained to maintain a safe shopping environment and protect against theft” and is in regular contact with law enforcement “on an ongoing basis to address organized retail crime.”

At Nordstrom a spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement that “we’re heightening our in-store security presence and implementing additional protective measures to keep everyone safe.” Best Buy’s Barry said last week that the retailer might put more items under lock much as drugstore giants CVS pharmacy and Walgreens do with items like razor blades. Columbia Business School’s Cohen however cautions retailers against turning their stores into fortresses or adding too many new hassles to shoppers who could easily shop online.

For CEO’s like Barry one of the biggest worries in this crisis has to do with attracting and keeping top retail talent. The attacks on the Best Buy stores sometimes involved people entering the stores armed with crowbars and guns Barry told reporters last week. That has frightened many workers who already had to deal with mask-adverse customers and the fear of being exposed to coronavirus. It’s all making it even harder for retailers to find and keep good workers amidst the great resignation and labor shortage.

“When we talk about why there are so many people looking for other jobs or switching careers this of course would be something that would play into my concerns for our people” Barry told reporters.

Best Buy has been just one of many large retailers in the last year to raise minimum wages in the war for front-line talent. (Macy’s last month raised its own lowest wage and sweetened the pot by promising employees it would help with college tuition and student debt.

“This has got to bring fear to both customers and store associates who basically don’t want to be in a position where they’re at risk for 15 bucks an hour” said Cohen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZXZpbGxlZXllLmNvbS9uZXdzLWNvbW1lbnRhcnkvZW1lcnl2aWxsZS1zb3V0aC1iYXlmcm9udC1icmlkZ2Utb3BlbmluZy1jb25jbHVkZXMtbmVhcmx5LTIwLXllYXItb2R5c3NleS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emeryville’s South Bayfront Bridge Opening Concludes Nearly 20 Year Odyssey,"The City of Emeryville held an official ribbon cutting event for the long-awaited South Bayfront Bridge on Friday evening. The well-attended ceremony concluded a long planning process that spanned nearly two decades at a cost of over $21000000.

The completed bridge provides a bike-friendly east-west connection over the railroad tracks near 53rd Street to the Bay Street Shopping Center. A connection that will connect housing to jobs and residents to amenities.

Project Initiated in 2002

The initial idea of the bridge actually goes all the way back to the 1980’s when it was included in a General Plan update. Development for the bridge began in 2002 when the city was awash with Redevelopment money.

By 2008 planning for the project was well under way following community meetings and environmental review. The location a designated EPA Brownfields site also required significant environmental remediation.

Emeryville City Council at the time consisted of Ruth Atkin Nora Davis Ken Bukowski John Fricke and Richard “Dick” Kassis.

As the engineering design phase of the project was underway Councilmember Fricke and members of a design committee pushed back on the initial design deeming it not bike-friendly enough due to the inclusion of stairs/elevators and lack of ramps. The project was redesigned to incorporate the gently sloping approach ramps that would better allow bikes wheelchairs and strollers to access the bridge without the inclusion of elevators (similar to the Berkeley Pedestrian Overcrossing).

Projects Hits Snag in 2011

While the eventual design is indeed favorable to cyclists the additional time in the design phase and community feedback may have set the timeline of the project back longer than anyone could have foreseen.

In 2011 amid a state budget crisis then California Governor Jerry Brown successfully abolished local Redevelopment Agencies throwing the project in limbo.

The City of Emeryville sued the state to recoup the $12000000 allocated for the bridge and other projects. The legal battle spent several years in state courts with the city of Emeryville ultimately prevailing.

Following the successful lawsuit the project was reactivated in 2015. The right-of-way negotiations with the Union Pacific Railroad and other stakeholders would take an additional four years.

Councilmember John Bauters serving his appointed term as Mayor in 2017 committed to “putting a shovel in the ground” in a since deleted 2017 tweet. This proverbial “shovel” would not touch dirt for another three years. The project took on almost a mythical status within the community.

The bidding process began concurrently in 2018 with the winning bid going to Ghilotti Construction of Santa Rosa. Ghilotti officially kicked-off construction of the bridge in early 2020. It reached a significant construction milestone at the end of 2020 when the bowstring truss was hoisted into place.

The bridge pieces were fabricated and painted in Arizona and shipped to Emeryville. The distinct red hue is the same “International Orange” as the iconic Golden Gate bridge. The signature arch span is comprised of materials and components fabricated in three continents and six states.

Work Remains for Seamless Connection to other Bikeways

While the bridge is finally complete work remains to provide the seamless connection to the Bay Trail to the West and Emeryville Greenway/Mandela Parkway to the East.

“The Emery” housing project at the former Sherwin-Williams site is well underway and is one of the largest under-construction housing projects in the East Bay with 500 units.

Bay Street remains in a delicate state with the new owners pinning their hopes on the addition of a Grocery Store to help revitalize the declining shopping center and encourage consistent use of the bridge.

The stakes for the fate of the Roe v. Wade decision have never been greater as the Supreme Court weighs whether to uphold a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks.

The stakes for the fate of the Roe v. Wade decision have never been greater as the Supreme Court weighs whether to uphold a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks.

WASHINGTON -- When the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday over a Mississippi law that would ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy a headline-making line of questioning came from the court's newest justice Amy Coney Barrett.

Barrett a conservative justice appointed last year by former President Donald Trump questioned whether adoption rather than abortion could resolve the ""burdens of parenting"" noted in Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood the two major Supreme Court rulings on abortion that protect a woman's right to end a pregnancy before fetal viability.

Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 the Supreme Court has never allowed states to prohibit the termination of pregnancies prior to fetal viability outside the womb roughly 24 weeks according to medical experts.

During Wednesday's arguments Barrett a mom of seven with two adopted children questioned Julie Rikelman a Center for Reproductive Rights attorney arguing against Mississippi's 15-week ban about safe haven laws which protect parents from criminal prosecution if they leave unwanted infants at designated places like hospitals. All 50 States the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have enacted safe haven legislation but rules and regulations vary by state according to the Department of Health and Human Services' Children's Bureau.

MORE: Supreme Court Justices signal they may toss Roe v. Wade allow new abortion limits

The Supreme Court's six conservative justices hearing the biggest challenge to abortion rights in decades have indicated they will uphold a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

""Insofar as you and many of your amici focus on the ways in which forced parenting forced motherhood would hinder women's access to the workplace and to equal opportunities it's also focused on the consequences of parenting and the obligations of motherhood that flow from pregnancy"" said Barrett. ""Why don't the safe haven laws take care of that problem?""

""It seems to me that the choice more focused would be between say the ability to get an abortion at 23 weeks or the state requiring the woman to go 15 16 weeks more and then terminate parental rights at the conclusion"" she said. ""Why -- why didn't you address the safe haven laws and why don't they matter?""

Rikelman responded by pointing out the unique risks that pregnancy alone carries saying in court ""We don't just focus on the burdens of parenting and neither did Roe and Casey. Instead pregnancy itself is unique. It imposes unique physical demands and risks on women and in fact has impact on all of their lives on their ability to care for other children other family members on their ability to work.""

It is a point echoed by reproductive physicians who say talking about adoption in place of abortion misses the realities of people's lives and the dangers of pregnancy.

If the Supreme Court were to uphold the Mississippi ban as the conservative majority appeared headed toward legal scholars say it could clear the way for stringent new restrictions on abortion in roughly half the country.

""'I'm unfortunately not surprised that adoption was brought up so much because I think people feel that pregnancy is this non-issue medical condition"" said Dr. Leilah Zahedi a Tennessee-based maternal fetal medicine specialist and fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. ""It's very infuriating to be honest because it shows their ignorance in the fact that pregnancy is not an uncomplicated condition for the majority of the United States.""

""Pregnancy is probably one of the most dangerous things a woman does in her life bar none"" she said.

The U.S. is also a particularly dangerous place to give birth. It has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed countries according to a 2020 study from the Commonwealth Fund a healthcare policy-focused nonprofit organization.

Black women are three to four times more likely to die during childbirth or in the months after than white Asian or Latina women while Indigenous women are two to three times more likely according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Physicians like Dr. Nisha Verma a board-certified OBGYN who provides abortion care point out that abortion on the other hand is ""incredibly safe.""

""The risk of childbirth is as high as 10 times higher than the risk of abortion"" said Verma also a fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. ""That's a lot of risk to ask someone to take on.""

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists was among 25 medical organizations who together filed an amicus brief in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health case that is now before the Supreme Court arguing the Mississippi law is ""fundamentally at odds with the provision of safe and essential health care with scientific evidence and with medical ethics.""

Providers like Verma also point to statistics showing that restrictions on abortion impact people who are the most vulnerable to complications from pregnancy and childbirth.

Around 75% of abortion patients are low-income residents and nearly 60% of U.S. women of reproductive age live in states where access to abortion is restricted according to the Guttmacher Institute a reproductive rights organization.

In her response to Barrett Rikelman cited the maternal mortality statistics in Mississippi alone saying ""It's 75 times more dangerous to give birth in Mississippi than it is to have a pre-viability abortion and those risks are disproportionately threatening the lives of women of color.""

In addition to the physical risks people face during pregnancy there are also other factors to consider like the lack of safeguards for pregnant people in the U.S. experts say.

The U.S. does not have universal health care and does not provide universal child care. And as the Supreme Court weighs its decision on the Mississippi law the U.S. remains the only industrialized modernized country in the world without federally mandated paid family leave according to data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The House of Representatives last month passed a social spending plan that includes four weeks of paid family leave eight weeks less than what was in the original spending package proposed this year by President Joe Biden. But that bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate with Sen Joe Manchin D-W.Va. a critical vote opposed to the paid leave provision.

""Abortion is not an isolated political issue"" said Verma weighing in on Justice Barrett's specific comments on adoption. ""I think the way that adoption was presented as just this easy alternative to abortion completely disregards the real experiences that people are having. It's a decision that's happening in the context of people's lives.""

In the majority of cases when providers talk to pregnant people about the option of abortion they also provide them with information on the option of adoption according to Verma. She said in her experience a person's decision on their own pregnancy is not one made lightly and is not one made without considering all options.

""The decision-making process is different for every person but it is a decision that people are making carefully and intentionally with all of the information and in the context of their own lives"" she said. ""It's not something that we can impose on people.""

Verma continued: ""I see patients all the time making decisions to have an abortion from a place of love and compassion.""

There were over 62000 legal induced abortions in the U.S. in 2019 the most recent data available according to the CDC. At the end of the same year 2019 there were around 122000 children waiting to be adopted out of the U.S. foster care system government data shows.

Overall just over 110000 adoptions took place in the U.S. in 2014 the most recent data available according to the National Council for Adoption a national advocacy organization that promotes adoption.

Ryan Hanlon acting CEO and president of the National Council for Adoption said the organization does not have a position on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health.

Speaking specifically on safe haven laws Hanlon said the goal should be to meet pregnant people and provide them with comprehensive information before they would find themselves in what he described as the ""crisis"" of leaving a child under the law.

""Safe haven laws can be a really wonderful thing but by the time we've gotten to that point we've already experienced a crisis"" he said. ""What I would hope for any woman who's experiencing an unplanned pregnancy is that she's getting information and support well before then and for those women who do choose to place their child for adoption that they are getting support before during and after the birth.""

La cifra total de las ventas ascendió a 531000 millones de dólares (469.251 millones de euros) después de seis años seguidos de subidas.

“Los gigantes de la industria estuvieron ampliamente protegidos por la demanda sostenida de los gobiernos de bienes y servicios militares” reza el informe.

“En muchas partes del mundo el gasto militar creció y algunos gobiernos aceleraron pagos a la industria para mitigar el impacto de la crisis” escribe el SIPRI.

A pesar de la subida generalizada la pandemia hizo que algunas compañías sufrieran alteraciones en la cadena de suministro y retrasos en las entregas y otras sufrieran caídas en las ventas por los confinamientos como fue el caso de la francesa Thales.

Estados Unidos mantuvo su hegemonía mundial: las 41 compañías de este país incluidas en el top 100 acapararon el 54 % de las ventas totales con 285000 millones de dólares (251.858 millones de euros) un 1.9% más interanual.

Al igual que ocurre desde 2018 las cinco primeras compañías del “top 100” son estadounidenses: Lockheed Martin Raytheon Boeing Northrop Grumman y General Dynamics en orden decreciente.

La industria armamentística estadounidense atraviesa una ola de fusiones y compras sobre todo en el sector espacial resalta el SIPRI que cita el ejemplo de Northrop y KBR.

Las cinco empresas chinas incluidas en el ránking vendieron por valor de 66800 millones (59032 millones de euros) lo que representa el 13 % del total y un 1.5 % más interanual.

El estudio explica que las firmas chinas se han beneficiado de los programas de modernización impulsados por Pekín y del foco en la fusión militar-civil convirtiéndose en “unos de las más avanzados productores de tecnología militar en el mundo”.

La venta conjunta de las nueve compañías rusas entre las cien primeras bajó un 6.5 % anual hasta 28200 millones (24921 millones de euros) siguiendo la tendencia descendente iniciada en 2017 debido al fin del programa estatal de armamento y a retrasos provocados por la pandemia.

Veintiséis firmas europeas figuran en la clasificación con unas ventas totales de 109000 millones de dólares (96.325 millones de euros) un 21 % del total mundial.

Cerca de 70% de comerciantes manifestó aumento en ventas

La tercera y última jornada del Día sin IVA de este año dejó ventas por encima de los $12 billones cifra récord comparada con las evidenciadas en la primera y la segunda jornada donde el resultado fue de $94 billones y $107 billones respectivamente.

María Ximena Lombana ministra de Comercio Industria y Turismo explicó que con corte a las 12 del día de ayer ya se registraban niveles de ventas superiores a $28 billones.

Dicha cifra analizando ese mismo periodo de tiempo frente a las otras jornadas representaron un aumento de 177% frente al primer Día sin IVA de este año y de 196% frente al resultado obtenido en el primer día del año pasado 2020.

Discriminando las cifras tan solo analizando los datos a mitad de la jornada se reportó un crecimiento en el valor de las ventas de 31 % frente al segundo día del año en curso.

Por otro lado con corte a ese momento la intención de búsqueda de los consumidores sobre el tercer Día sin IVA a través de los canales virtuales evidenció un crecimiento de 27 % respecto al segundo Día sin IVA.

LOS CONTRASTES

María Ximena Lombana Ministra de Comercio Industria y Turismo “En la jornada se respetaron los protocolos de bioseguridad. Algunos de los departamentos que registraron aumentos en ventas fueron Valle del Cauca y Antioquia”

Así Lombana destacó que “no hubo reporte de alteraciones en termas de orden público aglomeraciones o filas digitales por lo que esperamos que la jornada fuera un éxitos así como lo fueron las dos primeras”.

El gremio de comerciantes que ya tenía puesta la mirada en superar el umbral de los $12 billones expresó que evidenció muy buenos indicadores.

De esta manera lo dio entender Jaime Alberto Cabal presidente de la Federación Nacional de Comerciantes (Fenalco) quien hizo hincapié en el crecimiento esperado en las ventas de entre 15% y 20%.

“El comercio organizado reforzó los protocolos de bioseguridad. Hubo un tráfico muchísimo mayor en todo el país ya que 70% de los comerciantes reportaron ventas mayores a las del segundo Día sin IVA. Las ventas están diversificadas en pequeños y medianos establecimientos de comercio” dijo.

Por el lado del comercio electrónico la presidente de la Cámara Colombiana de Comercio Electrónico María Fernanda Quiñones expresó que hubo un aumento de más de 7% en las transacciones cibernéticas.

En noviembre destacaron los segmentos utilitario comercial de carga menor y comercial de carga mayor aal registrar variaciones del 24.0% 92.6% y 33.4% respectivamente.

Un dato a destacar en las cifras de noviembre es que por segunda vez en el año el segmento de utilitarios supera al segmento de automóviles que tradicionalmente ha liderado el mercado.

Para Oliverio García presidente de Andemos: ""la reactivación de las ventas de carros y motos continua su aceleración en noviembre pues frente a octubre que era el mejor mes hasta ahora las ventas de vehículos crecieron un 5.7%. Los resultados de noviembre ratifican los pronósticos de un cierre de 250 mil unidades”

En cuanto a los vehículos eléctricos e híbridos cabe resaltar que registran el segundo mejor mes de la historia del país con 2.260 unidades matriculadas.

En total el segmento matriculó un 119.4% más vehículos que hace un año. De ellos 216 fueron eléctricos 1.868 fueron híbridos y 176 fueron híbridos enchufables.

Toyota está en el liderazgo con 615 carros matriculados y un aumento del 97.1% seguido de Suzuki con 466 unidades y Ford con 364 vehículos. En el acumulado el segmento de cero y bajas emisiones cuenta con 15.804 unidades.

Con respecto a las marcas premium durante noviembre presentaron una caída del -13.2% a causa de la falta de disponibilidad de producto.

En el top de marcas premium destacan BMW con 256 unidades (11.3%) seguido de Mercedes Benz con 168 (-29.1%) y Volvo con 107 registros (-5.3%)

""Al desorden que causó la pandemia en la cadena logística del sector automotor se suma la crisis de los contenedores y la dificultad para re establecer el flujo naviero lo que está limitando la disponibilidad de productos y vehículos especialmente en el segmento premium"" manifestó Oliverio García Oliverio García.

En la zona del mercado de abasto policías municipales de Oaxaca de Juárez efectuaron la detención de un sujeto al ser acusado de robar en un establecimiento donde se apoderó del dinero de las ventas del día.

Los hechos ocurrieron el miércoles a las 15:35 horas elementos de la Subdirección de Proximidad Social participaban en un operativo de prevención disuasión y vigilancia en las inmediaciones del mercado de abasto.

De pronto fueron alertados vía radio para brindar un auxilio en un puesto de venta de semillas y chiles secos ubicado en pasillo 1 de la zona de tianguis por lo cual se trasladaron al lugar.

Al arribar fueron abordados por el propietario del establecimiento quien junto con sus trabajadores tenía sometido a un sujeto a quien acusó de haber robado dinero en efectivo producto de la venta del día.

Precisó que minutos antes uno de sus empleados escuchó un ruido en el mostrador del establecimiento pero al asomarse no observó a ninguna persona por lo cual revisó la grabación de las cámaras de seguridad.

Fue así como descubrió a un sujeto que había brincado el mostrador para apoderarse de 3 mil 500 pesos en efectivo que guardaban en un cajón para enseguida salir del local.

El propietario dijo que cuando era informado sobre el robo el presunto ladrón regresó a su establecimiento por lo cual lo retuvo junto con sus empleados y pidió su detención.

Ante el señalamiento los policías procedieron a la detención del presunto responsable quien dijo llamarse Omar P. J. de 36 años de edad quien quedó a disposición de la Fiscalía General del Estado donde se encargarán de resolver su situación jurídica."

Enacted on July 30 2021 H.B. 171 provides an addition modification for “[a]ny deduction for a net operating loss carryforward calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code provided however that the deduction may not exceed the amount claimed on the federal return filed for the taxable year in which the taxpayer was included as a party.”

According to the bill’s original synopsis this new language “codifies the long-standing practice of the Division of Revenue to limit Net Operating Loss deductions to those deductions that were claimed on a federal return. Because Delaware tax law starts with the income reported and deductions available at the federal level any net operating loss that exceeds that claimed on a federal return is not permitted in the calculation of Delaware tax.”

Observation: H.B. 171 does not provide an effective or applicable date. Accordingly it is uncertain to which tax years the law change will be deemed to apply. Due to the absence of retroactive language taxpayers may argue that the new law should not apply to tax years prior to enactment. Taxpayers should note that the Superior Court invalidated the policy under Delaware’s Uniformity Clause and that the Delaware Supreme Court did not reach a constitutional review.

Accordingly even if the Division seeks to apply H.B. 171 taxpayers may want to raise constitutional challenges under the Delaware Uniformity Clause or the federal Commerce Clause.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The program which Verizon appears to automatically opt customers into is called Verizon Custom Experience and its controls lay buried in the privacy settings on the My Verizon app.

The program introduces two different options that appear in the app Custom Experience and Custom Experience Plus each of which varies in terms of invasiveness. Verizon provides additional information about both settings within the app as well as on a FAQ page on its website. It appears that the Custom Experience option is a stripped-down version of Custom Experience Plus and as Verizon states directly in the app it helps Verizon “personalize” its “communication with you” and “give you more relevant product and service recommendations” by using “information about websites you visit and apps you use on your mobile device.”

Meanwhile Custom Experience Plus has the same stated purpose — to help Verizon provide you with a more “personalized” experience. However it not only uses information about the websites and apps you use on your mobile device but it also says it uses your “device location” along with “phone numbers you call or that call you” to help Verizon “better understand your interests.” This also includes your CPNI which tracks the times and duration of your calls and because Verizon is your wireless network provider it can track your location even if you’ve turned off location services on your phone.

It doesn’t appear that users are getting the chance to opt-in

As Verizon explains on its site it might use your information to say present you with an offer that includes music content or give you a music-related option in its Verizon Up reward program if it knows you like music. Verizon explicitly states that for the more invasive Customer Experience Plus tracking you “must opt-in to participate and you can change your choice at any time.” Signing up for those Up Rewards or other promotions with consequences buried in the fine print may have opted customers in unknowingly.

After checking the privacy settings on my own app I found that “Custom Experience” and “Custom Experience Plus” were both already toggled on. I don’t recall ever turning either of these features on or being asked about it. As Andrew Paul of Input notes he only discovered the feature after mistakenly opening a promotional email from Verizon that describes the new program.

To opt-out of the Custom Experience altogether open your My Verizon app and then hit the gear icon in the top-right corner of the screen. Scroll down and select “Manage privacy settings” beneath the “Preferences” heading. On the next page toggle off “Custom Experience” and “Custom Experience Plus.” To erase the information that Verizon has already collected about you through the program tap “Custom Experience Settings” and hit “Reset.” The company says that it won’t sell your information to advertisers and that it will “use it only for Verizon purposes” but it’s still unnerving either way.

In April T-Mobile started automatically enrolling users in a program that shares your data with advertisers unless you manually opt-out from your privacy settings. On AT&T’s privacy center the company says that it collects web and browsing information along with the apps you use and that you can manage these settings from AT&T’s site.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY29tYmRhaWx5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzA1L3Zlcml6b24tY2FuY2Vscy1wbGFuLWZvci01Zy11dGlsaXR5LXBvbGUtaW4tbWFjb21iLXR3cC1zdWJkaXZpc2lvbi_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5tYWNvbWJkYWlseS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8wNS92ZXJpem9uLWNhbmNlbHMtcGxhbi1mb3ItNWctdXRpbGl0eS1wb2xlLWluLW1hY29tYi10d3Atc3ViZGl2aXNpb24vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon cancels plan for 5G utility pole in Macomb Twp. subdivision,"Residents of the Cross Creek subdivision were recently able to breathe a sigh of relief when they learned that a 5G utility pole slated to be erected in their subdivision had been reconsidered.

On Nov. 29 a spokesperson from U.S. Rep Lisa McClain’s office weighed in on the issue in a statement to The Macomb Daily.

“Representing my constituents and addressing any issues they have regarding the federal government is my top priority in Congress. When local residents called my office to express concerns about a proposed Verizon cell tower in their neighborhood my team and I contacted Verizon to request they reconsider the current permitted location and consider alternative locations. I’m pleased the permits have been pulled and the issue has been resolved” McClain said.

On Oct. 27 Matt Elwart a resident of Anthony Drive located near 22 Mile and Garfield roads brought to the Board of Trustees concerns regarding the 5G utility pole and presented officials with a petition of over 150 residents against the pole location.

“We have signed petitions to protest to the installation of a 40 foot Verizon 5G wireless utility pole that was intended to be erected on the boulevard of my yard surrounding my home” Elwart said adding he contacted township state and county officials with the concern.

Elwart cited health and environmental concerns and decreases in home values should the pole be located in the subdivision. Trustee Peter J. Lucido III said that he had heard residents concerns on the issue and had reached out to other government officials as well as the Trileaf Company and Verizon. Lucido said he was referred from Trileaf to Verizon who responded with a form letter.

“I do understand your frustration. I do feel the same way as you I don’t necessarily want them in the township. But unfortunately it does look that way that there is not much that we can do but I will continue to look into it as much as I can” Lucido said.

Supervisor Frank Viviano said he was also working with other governmental officials at multiple levels and would persist despite the frequent obstacles.

“The challenge we face is that the federal government the FCC has literally taken jurisdiction out of this out of our hands. That does not mean like Trustee Lucido had said we will stop asking our state and federal legislatures if there is any way to change any of those current laws and we will continue to do so. But it is an extremely difficult thing to take on a utility company. I have done it. I have tried and it is very very very challenging” Viviano said. “They make it they do it by design because the federal government wants the utility companies to be able to add all of these services and in the process our voice often gets left behind.”

Elwart returned to the board on Nov. 10 with four other nearby residents all requesting the township assist in preventing the 5G pole from being located in the subdivision.

“The installation of these 40 foot utility towers will not stop at Cross Creek subdivision. It is coming to your neighborhood next” resident Cheryl Rutkowski said.

Trustee Frank Cusumano said that as an attorney he contended with public utilities all the way to the Supreme Court for several years. Lucido said the Sept. 13 letter referred to only offered the township an opportunity to respond or object if the pole was slated to be located on a site of historical significance and offered to assist and support residents in the matter. Trustee Nancy Nevers also offered to lend support to residents.

“I understand that when a national or international company is going to be putting in a series of these towers across the country their first stop is not here. Their first stop is the federal government to preempt here. Because they don’t want this happening in thousands of town halls. They want to prevents us from being able to do anything. Otherwise they would not roll out these projects. So the first stop is you know U.S. Congress. To set up a legal framework that neuters us from being to have an effect on these things” Treasurer Leon Drolet said.

Clerk Kristi Pozzi also said the Sept. 13 letter only requested that the township confirm the site for the pole was not historical and that she responded accordingly.

“We agree that the state controls the jurisdiction of the towers and we don’t control that or have a say in it. If you asked this board right now to vote on it I could probably assume that all of us would vote no. We have not stopped” Pozzi said.

Pozzi added Viviano had been in contact with McClain and that the township could better respond to residents when it had gleaned more information. She also agreed to meet with a resident delegation.

“I live on the south side of the township so you’re right it is probably coming to my neighborhood as well” Pozzi said. “So I am for I am totally for trying to find a solution.”

On Nov. 23 Elwart came to the board to thank them for their efforts to stop the 5G utility pole from being located in his neighborhood. He said he had received information from McClain that the pole was cancelled. Viviano showed Elwart a copy of the cancelled permit.

“I certainly don’t want it to look like I was able to change Verizon’s mind I did reach out to Verizon along with their contractor Trileaf and I did voice concerns and ask some questions but I was responded to with little new information” Lucido told the Macomb Daily on Nov. 27.

Lucido also said that unfortunately the technology is likely to come to the township in some way.

“The harsh reality for the residents is this technology is coming to the township and it is possible they choose this site again but for now I will take this as a bit of luck and will take the win for the residents” Lucido said.

Viviano said resident concerns are something the township is continuing to examine as the rollout of 5G technology continues nationwide.

“It’s worth noting that the 5G antennas at issue are not the same type of ‘cell tower’ that we have come to understand. These are smaller pieces of equipment that can get mounted on existing utility poles or as in the case of Anthony Drive be installed on a newly placed wooden pole. Cell towers by contrast are typically very large and tall metal structures. Something as large as a cell tower would normally require some level of township permitting and building inspection however a utility pole driven into the right of way does not” Viviano said on Nov. 29.

Viviano also said that it would only be a matter of time before another pole was installed in the township.

“The effort on the part of the public officials involved was only just beginning. Verizon pulled the permit from the county before we even had much of an opportunity to discuss the issue and we hadn’t yet come to any conclusions. I am hoping that the discussions we started will continue even though this one antenna was canceled. While the township doesn’t have jurisdiction over where and when these things are installed I am hoping that we can facilitate an open dialogue with other agencies and residents affected” Viviano said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2xldHRlcnMvMjAyMS0xMi0wNS9hcHBsZS12ZXJpem9uLXQtbW9iaWxlLWF0LXQtaXBob25lLTEzLWFwcGxlLXdhdGNoLWlwYWQtcmViYXRlcy1ub3Qtd29ya2luZy1rd3RtMGh1bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple Verizon T-Mobile AT&T iPhone 13 Apple Watch iPad Rebates Not Working,"Some customers are finding that wireless carriers are denying rebates used to promote Apple Inc.’s newest iPhones iPads and watches.

Social Security doesn't provide enough income for most Americans to retire comfortably. It wasn't designed to do so. You need additional sources of retirement income.

Dividends can help supplement Social Security. But it can be difficult to pick from the thousands of stocks that offer dividends. Some especially stand out because of their high yields though. Investing a total of $100000 in these three dividend stocks could give you annual income of close to $6300.

1. Enterprise Products Partners

Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.59%) ranks as one of the top midstream energy companies. The company's dividend yield currently stands at nearly 8.6%. If you invested one-third of an initial $100000 in Enterprise stock you'd receive annual income of a little over $2850.

But is Enterprise's dividend reliable? My Motley Fool colleague Kody Kester views Enterprise as one of the safest high-yield dividend stocks on the planet. I think Kody is probably right.

Enterprise has increased its dividend for 23 consecutive years. Its near-term prospects appear to be solid as the global economy bounces back from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company's long-term prospects are also better than you might think. Global energy demand will grow over the coming decades. Demand for oil and natural gas will likely increase even though there will be a shift toward renewable energy sources. Enterprise should be in a strong position to profit from this trend.

2. Medical Properties Trust

Medical Properties Trust (MPW 1.92%) stands out as another great alternative to generate retirement income. With its dividend yield of nearly 5.3% an initial investment of $33333 would provide more than $1750 in annual income.

The real estate investment trust (REIT) owns around 440 hospital facilities most of which are in the U.S. and Europe. It's the second-largest non-government owner of hospitals in the world.

MPT's portfolio is diversified across 52 hospital operators. Its largest property makes up only 2.6% of its total gross assets. The company's biggest tenant Steward Health maintains a strong liquidity position.

The hospital REIT has increased its dividend for eight consecutive years with a compound annual growth rate of 4.2%. Its stock has performed well also jumping more than 80% over the last five years.

3. Verizon Communications

Between Enterprise Products Partners and Medical Properties Trust you could make around $4600 in annual income. That amount can be boosted to more than $6300 by investing the remaining one-third of your initial $100000 in Verizon Communications (VZ 1.53%) stock.

Verizon offers a dividend yield north of 5.1%. And that dividend is relatively safe. The telecommunications giant currently uses less than half of its earnings to fund the dividend program.

Don't expect Verizon to deliver jaw-dropping share appreciation. The stock's performance over the last five years is barely in positive territory. Next year could be tough for wireless carriers in general and Verizon could face challenges competing for customers.

However the adoption of high-speed 5G networks should be a growth driver for Verizon over the rest of this decade. Even if the stock isn't a huge winner its dividend will be.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcnN0b29sc3BvcnRzLmNvbS92aWRlby1wb2RjYXN0LzM0MjQ2OTIvZGotYWthZGVtaWtzLXdlbnQtZnJvbS12ZXJpem9uLXdvcmtlci10by15b3V0dWJlLXNlbnNhdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DJ Akademiks Went From Verizon Worker to YouTube Sensation,"Few guys in the world of media are more connected to the game than DJ Akademiks.

The Knights’ experienced a cold spell toward the middle of the second half but they went on to unlatch a tie with less than four minutes remaining to slip away with an 88-82 victory over the tenacious Mustangs.

CMCC’s switch to a zone defense had a lot to do with slowing down the Knights who found away around the Mustangs’ defensive push.

“We switched to a zone which we think we have pretty good zone; that helped a little bit” CMCC coach Dave Gonyea said. “We forced them to shoot outside but at the other end we couldn’t convert offensively.

“Our decision-making wasn’t really good. We didn’t handle the pressure that well and some of our players … didn’t step up tonight. You are only going to be as good as your best players take you (there).”

With just under four minutes left in the game Daquan Jackson scored two of his 11 points to break a 78-78 tie then Aaron Walker Jr. (25 points) landed a 3-pointer and Dontel Henry (25 points) dropped in another two providing Berkeley with an 85-80 lead with 2:37. From that point the Knights’ defense held the high ground for the win.

“What we did was stick together” Berkeley guard Foday Saccoh said. “I made sure my teammates were in sync made sure we ran a lot plays and we just never gave up. That’s what we do.

“We took a seven-hour trip and now we are here. (The Mustangs) gave us a run for our money. They came back on us. As you can see they have good program and were able to stay with us but we fight we fight and we fight.”

What also made the difference in Berkeley’s win was good old-fashioned foul shooting The Knights shot 73.3 percent from the charity stripe with Walker going 11-for-14 and Henry 7-for-9.

“Our guys really pulled it through” Berkeley coach Jonathan Pena said. “ We got lazy then. This is early on (in the season). This is only our third game so we try to get comfortable and teach our guys how to consistently play and keep up the momentum for more than four or five minutes.”

In the first half the lead kept changing hands before Berkeley built a 45-39 lead heading into halftime.

The Knights then opened up on the Mustangs early in the second half building a 55-42 cushion. But CMCC rebounded and put a stop to the Knights’ outside shooting and tied the game at 78-78.

“I thought our group effort was pretty good” Gonyea said. The kids rallied down the stretch. We were down by 12. They rallied down the stretch to tighten it up. They didn’t quit. They played hard.”

The Mustangs who shot 47% held the Knights to 38% shooting from the field and outrebounded Berkeley 46-29. But the Knights only turned the ball over six times while CMCC coughed it up 29 times.

“We knew (the Knights) were very athletic” Gonyea said. “They get to the basket and rebounded. We knew all that was going to happen. We tried to prepare for that but at the end of the day the better team wins and they were better today.”

Josh Chery was the CMCC’s leading scorer with 17 points followed by Corey David DeMarco McKissie and Marshall Evans who each came away with 13 apiece and Malik Farley with 12 points including three 3-pointers.

It was taken off the table during negotiations for the past two five-year contracts and this year the company has once again refused the proposal.

How badly do these workers need dental?

“I’ve seen a worker welding with a swollen face and an ice pack. Another guy asked for my needle-nose pliers and pulled his own tooth in front of me” says Glenn Ybanez one of the Erie Strayer ironworkers who has now been on strike for ten weeks.

The Iron Workers Regional Shop Local 851 began negotiating a new contract with Erie Strayer in March of this year and their prior contract expired in April. They want a 3 percent raise which amounts to around 60 cents an hour — a modest proposal in a moment when inflation is running well above that rate — and dental which would cost the company roughly another 3 percent.

But Erie Strayer has no interest in the needs of these workers who make an average of $19.10 an hour to produce heavy-batch concrete-making machinery. Despite the high skill required for such labor the union says they make less than the area median salary. Instead of accepting the workers’ proposals the company offered a nickel-an-hour raise for the first year of the contract and no dental provoking the strike.

“My wife and I are trying to figure out how we’ll come up with money to buy our kids Christmas gifts because the company says I’m not worth more than a nickel” said Tim Donnell one of the strikers. “Meanwhile they’ve got no problem spending money on landscaping projects.”

“They were offering nothing in the first year 5 cents in the second year and 5 or 10 cents in the third year” says Local 851 vice president and business representative Tracy Cutright. “The whole thing amounted to less than 90 cents over the five-year contract. We took a strike vote in September and we went on strike on October 4.”

Cutright says workers also want a three-year rather than five-year contract given that the latter locks them in for far too long leaving them unable to enact much-needed changes. Further the workers are pushing for a change in the company’s draconian attendance policy.

Workers currently get three days for bereavement for example but they must call into a call center to report their absence on every one of those days. Failure to do so is considered a no call no show and docks them attendance points. “I’ve had people in the emergency room have to call from the ICU” says Cutright.

When the strike began it encompassed forty-two workers. In the weeks since several workers have quit or retired and five have crossed the picket line leaving twenty-eight ironworkers manning the 24/7 picket line (they say that if you’d like to support them you can stop by the line at 1851 Rudolph Avenue in Erie or donate to their strike fund). Despite the length of the strike the workers believe the company has only been able to hire at most two replacements a shortage that workers attribute to the company’s low wages as well as widespread local support for labor which makes the prospect of scabbing unacceptably shameful to potential hires.

“The company’s mantra early on was ‘We’re not interested in paying GE [now Wabtec] wages.’ Well they’re not even in the same ballpark as GE” says Cutright. The plant ran seven days a week through the pandemic and did not lack for contracts. Erie Strayer also received a $1.2 million Paycheck Protection Program grant for payroll.

“I shouldn’t have to choose between spending time with my family or earning enough to make ends meet” said David Miller one of the strikers. “Working forty hours a week should be enough but I can’t cover the mortgage and provide for my family on my regular salary. The company knows we can’t make ends meet on our regular salary. Instead of giving us a decent raise they push us to work extra hours — sometimes seven days per week. It feels like economic blackmail.”

Three bargaining sessions have taken place since the strike began but Erie Strayer remains intransigent.

“We bargained this week and they put across an offer of 25 cents a year for five years no dental no back pay no signing bonus no changes to the attendance policy” says Cutright. The next bargaining session is scheduled for December 17. Community support remains steady with locals stopping by to join the picket line or donate food and drinks. Other unions too have been reinforcing the line and a rally last month saw local and state-level elected officials in attendance as well. As for the strikers they’re prepared for the long haul.

“They’re in it all the way” says Cutright. “It can be cold. It can be pouring down rain. They say ‘We don’t care. We’re here.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTEyLTA0L3Utcy1zaGlwLWxvZ2phbS1zdHJldGNoaW5nLWZhci1pbnRvLXBhY2lmaWMtaXMtbG9uZ2VyLXRoYW4tZXZlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Ship Logjam Stretching Far Into Pacific Is Longer Than Ever,"Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks Covid-19’s impact on trade.

The parent company of Boots is reportedly considering putting its pharmacy chain on the market next year for an estimated £10 billion.

According to Sky News the US retail giant Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA) is lining up Goldman Sachs advisers to look into a potential sale of the pharmacy.

A potential stock market listing could also be considered as well as a private sale.

In a statement WBA said that while it does not comment on “market speculation” and said Boots which employs 55000 people and has 2200 stores is “an important part” of the group.

However the company said it is “accurate” that the WBA announced a “renewed set of priorities and strategic direction” for the group in October which includes a more pointed focus on North America and on healthcare.

“As underlined during the last WBA investor conference the group continues to be very pleased with the performance of Boots and the international division as a whole” the group said.

“In line with the group’s long-term healthcare strategy Boots UK continues to expand its healthcare offering.

“Furthermore Boots.com continues to grow above expectations having more than doubled sales when compared to pre-pandemic levels.”

The news comes as Boots reported a sales rebound in October as a result of lockdown restrictions being eased.

In the final quarter of its financial year to August 31 the company saw like-for-like sales increase by 12.8 per cent to $34.3 billion (£25 billion) for the period.

WBA highlighted that it benefited from a strong operational performance from Boots with growth for both its retail and pharmacy arms.

Boots managing director Sebastian James said sales through its online business had doubled against pre-pandemic levels with the firm maintaining this growth despite returning high street footfall.

Walgreens Boots Alliance was formed in 2014 after Walgreens bought the 55 per cent stake in the UK and Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own.

Giving women with a mix of backgrounds and experiences a seat at the corporate table makes good business sense all around. A 2020 McKinsey & Co. study showed that companies in the top quartile for gender and ethnic diversity were 25 percent more likely to have above-average profitability compared with those in the bottom quartile.

These corporate trailblazers have boldly pushed for inclusion and taken chances in their careers — switching industries helming startups and encouraging their businesses to embrace new markets — to create opportunities for themselves their companies and future leaders:

Bridging the Gap

It’s difficult to find a company that’s pledged to double the representation of Black and Latino workers at all levels by 2025 or to increase the representation of Black employees in store leadership roles by 2025 but Gap Inc. has done both.

“We take this issue very seriously” says Sonia Syngal the company’s CEO. “We were also the first Fortune 500 company to announce equal pay for men and women.”

Out of more than 7000 companies across the world Gap was named one of the top five most diverse companies by the Thomson Reuters Global Diversity and Inclusion Index for two consecutive years. “Our north star is that we are inclusive by design” says Syngal who is now considered the highest-ranked Indian American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company since Indra Nooyi stepped down from her post at PepsiCo in 2018.

Even when she was at the helm of sister brand Old Navy where she led the company to record-breaking growth between 2016 and 2020 Syngal relied on the same principles to guide her often referring to the company’s goal of offering “affordable fashion to anyone regardless of gender income and body shape.”

Last year Gap became the first retailer to require all suppliers to pay garment workers electronically which Syngal says is “a critical path to financial freedom.” She’s also the head of one of the only retailers to claim a workforce that is 55 percent Black Latino Asian American or something other than white.

This year Gap announced it was regularly hosting diversity and inclusion workshops and includes mandatory racial equity training in its employee onboarding. “We started out as an inclusive company” Syngal says. “Creating opportunities for the people and communities connected to our business inspires us to this day.”

Making a Difference

Rosalind Brewer may have grown up the daughter of assembly-line workers but she is no stranger to the C-suite. In fact she’s helped lead retail giants twice before her current position as CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance the company that owns Walgreens drugstores having served as chief operating officer at Starbucks and president and CEO at Sam’s Club.

But her current position comes with one giant distinction: It makes Brewer the only Black woman at the helm of an S&P 500 company. “I take my role as one of the very few Black female CEOs very seriously” Brewer says. “However I look forward to the day when I’m no longer the first.”

In 2019 Brewer became the only Black woman to sit on Amazon’s board. A year prior she shut down all Starbucks stores for mandatory racial bias training after two Black men were arrested for trespassing at a Philadelphia Starbucks when they were simply sitting at a table. “For me making a difference and positively impacting the bottom line are complementary rather than an either/or proposition” Brewer says. “Being able to do both is important to me because at this point in my career purpose is my driving force.”

Connecting Others

Deborah Liu knows what it’s like to be the token person of color in a room. She also knows what it’s like to be the only woman.

“I can’t tell you how many times throughout my career I have been both” says the 18-year tech industry veteran and new president and CEO of Ancestry who also serves on the company’s board of directors.

Even today 72 percent of women in tech are outnumbered by men in business meetings by a ratio of at least 2-to-1 according to Trust Radius a business-to-business review site that funds industry surveys. “One time a Black colleague and I were presenting to a group of white men and when I told my career coach about it she says ‘Well when you were looking at them they were looking at you right?’ She had a point. It’s very hard to be the ‘only’ anything but just being in the room represents a step in the right direction.”

Prior to taking the helm at Ancestry in March 2021 Liu was a senior executive at Facebook where she came up with the idea for Marketplace the hugely successful platform that allows millions of people to buy and sell products. She previously spent several years in product roles at PayPal and eBay.

Despite her own success the lack of women and people of color in her field was so obvious to her that in 2016 she launched Women In Product a nonprofit that connects women in product management and advocates for equal representation. “I think the interest in diversity is greater now than ever especially for women and people of color.”

Taking Risks

Even before many brands began waking up to the idea that diversity and investment in multicultural markets were worthwhile Nestlé USA had long been hailed as a model for both and it’s in large part because of Alicia Enciso’s leadership.

“When you bring diverse perspectives to the table it enhances a team’s overall abilities” says Enciso the company’s chief marketing officer. She should know; her team is as diverse as the strategies it implements. Across the Nestlé marketing team 65 percent are female and one-third are people of color.

“Being Latino or part of any other diverse group today is a strength” Enciso says. “There’s never been a better time to lean into your culture.”

Nestlé’s massive success in the Hispanic market began with the community’s most beloved beverage: café. “Years ago we noted that Latinos were missing their coffee so we seized the opportunity to market Nescafé” Enciso says. “When that proved successful we applied the same multicultural marketing strategy to Coffeemate. Today more than 10 percent of our budget is dedicated to Hispanic marketing.”

As a point of reference most companies invest somewhere between 2 percent and 7 percent of their marketing budget to reaching Hispanics according the Hispanic Marketing Council.

Enciso has long had a knack for seeing opportunities where others thought they didn’t exist. After spending the first decade of her career at Procter & Gamble (P&G) where she helped lead the company’s largest Latin American acquisition at the time she shocked her colleagues by handing in her resignation. “It was the internet go-go years so I went home to work at a small startup in Mexico” she recalls. “My friends at P&G were like ‘Why are you doing this?’ ”

Enciso eventually became general manager and shareholder of the company that was later sold to a Silicon Valley investment group. “Sometimes to really broaden your skill set you have to take a leap” Enciso says. A few years spent consulting eventually led to a position in Nestlé’s Mexico office and the rest is history. Today she heads up the company’s marketing efforts from its base in Washington D.C.

“My career has always been about taking risks” she says adding that there’s never been a better time for all people of color to do the same. “A friend said recently ‘It’s a time like no other for multicultural talent.’ ”

Driving Diversity

In business timing can mean everything and for Ingrid Otero-Smart the start of her career couldn’t have come at a better time. It was the 1980s and brands were just beginning to recognize that marketing to Latinos could be good for business.

“I joke with friends that we have the same conversations with clients that we’ve been having for decades” says the president and CEO of Casanova//McCann one of the most prominent minority-owned Hispanic marketing agencies in the country. At the time Otero-Smart was working for advertising agency McCann Erikson in her native Puerto Rico but an itch to move to the mainland led her to take a position with an independent agency in California where she’d stay for 18 years and eventually became president.

Loyalty she says is one of her strong suits a trait that’s helped her build long-lasting relationships in an industry known for wearing people out. “We still spend a lot of time educating corporate America about marketing to Latinos but we have better tools now” she says half-jokingly. “Some marketers cast a Latino in a commercial and say ‘Check! We are diverse!’ but consumers know when there’s just a token face in the crowd.” Instead Otero-Smart works with brands like Coca-Cola to market to Latinos with culturally relevant messaging.

Her expertise has led to several industry awards and distinctions including induction into the Hispanic Advertising Hall of Fame. Under Otero-Smart’s leadership the agency also doubled its revenue she says welcoming an impressive roster of clients that includes the U.S. Army Cigna and Nestlé. “It’s OK to celebrate your accomplishments” she says. “As women and as Latinos it’s about being prideful. It’s also our responsibility once we reach certain positions to bring up other Latinos too.”

Seizing Opportunities

Carla Vernón understood at an early age that for society to succeed at all levels representation is paramount. At just 7 years old in 1978 she and her mother traveled across the country to join the women’s march in Washington D.C. in support of the Equal Rights Amendment.

As one of the most senior Afro Latinas in the food industry most recently at Amazon where she oversees a multibillion-dollar portfolio that includes grocery and household and beauty products Vernón’s determination has served her well. “I don’t care why I’m at the table but now that I’m here I’m bringing my ancestors and the communities that aren’t in the room yet into everything I do” she says.

Born to a Black mother from New Orleans and a Black father from Panama Vernón was taught at an early age that she already had what it takes to succeed in life. “Immigrants know how to lean into opportunity and ambiguity. We have hustle” she says. “That’s why there’s no one better equipped to deal with this moment.”

As a Minneapolis mother of two teenagers the moment she’s referring to is the social justice movement that followed George Floyd’s killing in the city in May 2020. “That changed my family and my teens’ lives forever” she says. “It was a crucial moment of realizing there still isn’t equal justice in this country and once again we are all called to accountability.”

Corporate America’s subsequent call for diversity was a welcome message to Vernón but “the truth is diversity has always been the reality in the U.S. — that’s not new” she says. “We’re all a piece of the economy. We all should be represented in how it’s talked about shown and built.”

Less than a year into her tenure at Amazon Vernón says diversity equality and inclusion (DEI) are key to her business strategy. “I am excited to take DEI from what many think of as a recruiting strategy to a real business driver. There’s a whole demographic with a lot of influence right now. It’s an untapped audience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vZnVsbC1saXN0LW9rb25qby1pd2VhbGEtdG9wcy1maW5hbmNpYWwtdGltZXMtMjUtbW9zdC1pbmZsdWVudGlhbC13b21lbi1vZi0yMDIxL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vZnVsbC1saXN0LW9rb25qby1pd2VhbGEtdG9wcy1maW5hbmNpYWwtdGltZXMtMjUtbW9zdC1pbmZsdWVudGlhbC13b21lbi1vZi0yMDIxLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Full list: Okonjo-Iweala tops Financial Times’ 25 most influential women of 2021,"Nigerian-born Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has been named among Financial Times’ 25 most influential women of 2021.

WMT,Walmart,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlYmlnZGF0YS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8wNC93aGF0LXdhbG1hcnRzLWRhdGEtbW9uZXRpemF0aW9uLXN0cmF0ZWd5LW1lYW5zLWZvci1jcGdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Walmart's Data Monetization Strategy Means for CPGs,"by

Near the end of 2020 Walmart began discreetly promoting its new data arm “Walmart Data Ventures (WDV).” Focused on productizing Walmart’s data assets its suite of products is said to eventually “deliver actionable customer-centric insights” in order to “help merchants and brands make better business decisions.” By monetizing a once free offering to CPG brands however it has many anxious about what that will mean for their own bottom lines and competitive edge upon the — currently undisclosed — launch.

While the monetization of retail data is certainly not a new concept — just look at the likes of IRI Albertson’s and 84.51° from Kroger — Walmart had been one of the biggest proponents of free access to rich intelligence for years. With more data the thought has been CPGs and suppliers can drive greater efficiencies stronger merchandising and more impactful marketing plans that increase overall sales.

By productizing that data though Walmart is making a smart move to boost its revenue. In fact according to AdAge this venture is projected to generate $1 million in data and analytics for every $1 billion of sales and $400 million projected annually for the U.S alone. It would be an understatement to say it’s a massive opportunity in today’s market. Not to mention that once monetized this could help with faster access to cleaner standardized and more well-managed data sets.

But this strategy has created concerns from CPGs and suppliers with regard to budget allocations planning capabilities and competition. Data budgets for many companies have grown over the years but the pace of monetized data has simultaneously increased alongside it — and this move from Walmart could catalyze others to price against them with uncertain results.

The retailer/manufacturer relationship has also historically been a complex one to begin with. While inherently dependent upon each other the two are often at odds with conflicting agendas and their own profitability targets. It remains to be seen how much of their valuable data Walmart will actually be willing to share with each CPG given that this data could presumably help them ‘win’ against the retailers’ own store brand products. In a bit of a Catch 22 the ability for CPGs to gain retailer trust and demonstrate category captaincy – or the position for them to make decisions for all category products – is dependent upon solid data and sound decision making that they otherwise might not have.

The cost of this data is of particular concern to small- and mid-sized brands (generally $1-10 billion in revenue). Often lacking the deeper pockets of some of their big-named peers that may have five times that revenue or more the burning questions on their minds now are “Do we earmark funds solely for an influential and valuable retailer like Walmart or do we split between the myriad of other companies to maximize our access to hard data?” This question of course is then promptly followed by “Can we afford either?”

While these are important questions to ask an even bigger one should be whether or not CPG companies are getting high quality insights out of their ‘data subscriptions’ at all or are they paying substantial amounts of money for a lot of extraneous information. There’s no denying the power of the Walmart Big Data machine their 245 million customers and 2.5 petabytes of unstructured data generated from over one million customers each hour. Nor is it easy to overlook the extensive analysis of point-of-sale trends that come with that data. But for many CPGs that utilize these insights the potential that just a fraction of this narrower more-targeted intelligence could enable stronger results than what is currently derived from existing super broad datasets is very appealing.

To succeed companies need to place their bets on the data that will make the most impact. For decades CPGs have relied heavily on off-the-shelf software historical insights manual calculations and even gut instinct to drive critical decision-making. While a brand might sustain 5% year-over-year growth through these techniques and deem it a success if they knew a different approach could secure 35% and take a bigger slice out of the market pie against competitors – they might not maintain that approach.

Considering today’s unprecedented product landscape global supply chain disruption inflation and evolving consumer preferences – new technologies and strategies that incorporate data-backed forecasting and predictive analytics have become increasingly essential for category growth management. In order to enable visibility around sensitivity analyses incremental demand transfer and price elasticities CPGs need to know the exact shape of data needed to help them optimize.

Before brands are required to pay for any data from Walmart and others in the future then it’s important that CPG category and revenue growth managers take a hard look at the data they currently have access to in their own systems match it against what they are getting from those big retailers reduce any redundancies and implement the right tech to make sense of it all now and in the future. To start they should:

Prioritize their data: CPGs should consider the most important elements of data they have access to and where they’re getting the most bang for their buck today

CPGs should consider the most important elements of data they have access to and where they’re getting the most bang for their buck today Rationalize their data: Of that data they should understand what info will prove most meaningful towards making their business decisions and more accurately and reliably predict key KPI’s against sales volume loyalty expansion customer conversions etc. and scrap anything that won’t.

Of that data they should understand what info will prove most meaningful towards making their business decisions and more accurately and reliably predict key KPI’s against sales volume loyalty expansion customer conversions etc. and scrap anything that won’t. Hyperlocalize their data: CPGs should consider if there is an opportunity to further subsegment data and only purchase a snapshot that will empower their decision-making (i.e. subcategories store level insights points of distribution pricing etc.)

With a more strategic approach CPGs can unlock stronger insights that help them understand their category challenges and opportunities. By forging their proprietary operational IP with the right data from those like Walmart brands will be much more agile continuously innovative and empowered to win across everything from assortments trade promotions and pricing to help them realize long-term success.

GREELEY Colo. — A Walmart in Greeley was closed for several hours after police said a suspected shoplifter assaulted employees with bear spray Sunday afternoon leading to the evacuation of the store.

According to the Greeley Police Department (GPD) officers were called to the Walmart at 10th Street and 47th Avenue just after 1:30 p.m. on a report of someone who had sprayed employees with bear spray.

While officers were on their way GPD said dispatchers started getting calls reporting there was a man with a gun in the store. GPD said when they got there officers quickly determined bear spray had been used but there was never a man with a gun.

GPD said an investigation showed that three store associates attempted to detain Vince Joe Pacheco 29 for shoplifting. A struggled ensued and Pacheco deployed the bear spray at the store employees police said.

A fourth employee described as a 70-year-old man was struck in the head with bear spray causing the can to rupture and contaminate the store according to GPD.

Greeley Fire and EMS treated at least five people for bear spray exposure according to police.

Before officers arrived Pacheco fled the store in a vehicle and and went to a nearby store to wash his face due to the bear spray exposure GPD said. He was later located by Greeley patrol officers in the 100 block of East 20th Street and taken into custody without incident about 9:20 p.m.

Pacheco was transported to a local hospital to be medically evaluated before being transported to the Weld County jail police said.

GPD said the store was evacuated as a safety precaution and was closed while Greeley Fire helped remove the residual spray from the store. The store reopened about 7:40 p.m. according to police.

Anyone with information on the case or who witnessed it and has not already been interviewed by officers is asked to call GPD's front desk at 970-350-9605.

Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon projected confidence in the company's inventory levels and reported that supply-chain delays are improving during a meeting with President Joe Biden this week.

Speaking virtually at a roundtable with business leaders McMillon told the president that Walmart's inventory level is up more than 10% and transit and port delays are getting better.

""We'll keep working to make sure that we're in a good in-stock position as we go all the way through the season. We do expect it to be strong"" McMillon said according to a White House transcript.

The business leaders' meeting came on the same day the Federal Trade Commission announced it was ordering Walmart Kroger Co. Amazon.com Tyson Foods and other large companies to hand over detailed information in an effort to identify the causes behind the supply-chain issues.

The study will look at whether the supply-chain disturbances are leading to shortages anti-competitive practices and specific bottlenecks. The agency will require the companies to give internal documents on pricing and profit margins.

On the national level over the past four weeks Walmart has seen about a 26% uptick in throughput when it comes to getting containers through ports McMillon said at the meeting Monday.

""That's helped a lot as it relates to categories like toys which are so important for Christmas"" he said according to the transcript.

But supply-chain disruptions are still an issue shaping the economy according to the Federal Reserve. Labor shortages and supply-chain issues have constrained growth in several parts of the country despite strong demand a Fed report said this week. The report also concluded that the economy grew at a ""modest to moderate"" rate in October and early November in most of the Fed districts.

""The outlook for overall activity remained positive in most [areas] but some noted uncertainty about when supply chain and labor supply challenges would ease"" the report said.

Meanwhile more than 20 House Democrats issued a letter Thursday saying they are concerned about the supply-chain disruptions arguing that the U.S. House of Representatives should take further action.

The disturbances they said are increasing inflation and bringing about delays.

""It is imperative Congress acts to address the needs of the nation through additional action to specifically address the supply chain and resulting higher prices experienced by families across the country"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter.

The Biden administration has faced criticism from Republicans over its response to the supply-chain issues.

Best Buy Samsung Etsy Mattel and other companies were represented at the meeting with Biden earlier this week. McMillon appeared virtually.

Kroger Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen attended the meeting in person. The grocery retail executive said in a statement that the company is aiming to attract and retain employees.

""We feel great about our ability to serve our customers' needs through the holidays"" he said in the statement.

Biden has highlighted his efforts to rev up operations at two Southern California ports Los Angeles and Long Beach according to the White House.

Biden outlined his administration's role in a speech on Wednesday arguing the U.S. avoided a ""potential crisis"" and there have been financial incentives aimed at alleviating the supply-chain issues.

""The first thing we had to do was speed up the operations at our ports"" Biden said during the speech. ""Americans are buying more goods than ever and a lot of those goods come through our ports.""

In the FTC orders Walmart Kroger Tyson Foods and other large companies will be required to outline which factors are disrupting their capacity to transport and distribute products along with what they are doing to alleviate the issues.

Agency Chairwoman Lina Khan issued a statement saying ""supply chain disruptions are upending the provision and delivery of a wide array of goods"" including things like meat lumber and computer chips.

Animation wouldn’t be what it is today were it not for Walter Elias Disney (or Walt Disney as we know him). The Chicago-born animator theme park visionary and business tycoon is responsible for making “the Most Magical Place on Earth” as well as giving us the characters we grew up loving—and still do!

Born on December 5 1901 Walt celebrates his 120th birthday today December 5 2021 and as much as we all know about the man there’s still plenty of interesting Walt Disney facts that we continue to uncover.

To celebrate the life of the legend and look back on his numerous contributions let’s check out these eight facts about Walt Disney. Chances are you’ll learn something about him in this Disney trivia that you never knew before.

[metaslider id=”75305″]

1. A Heart for Animals

Even early in his career Walt was known for the remarkable way he was able to bring animals to life on the page giving them charming human characteristics. His anthropomorphic characters—including Mickey Mouse and the gang—are an homage to his love of animals.

Walt’s inclination toward depicting lovable creatures actually was facilitated by a tragic event in his young life. When he was seven years old Walt had a run-in with an owl that resulted in its death.

Without going into the distressing details of the incident suffice it to say that the encounter had a monumental impact on him. His remorse motivated him to have more tenderness toward animals and even humanize them in his drawings.

However there was one animal of which Walt wasn’t too fond: cats. He was quoted as saying “You can’t tell them what to do.” Anyone who’s lived with a finnicky feline can say that Walt is right about that!

Fun Walt Disney fact: Despite not being crazy about cats one of Walt’s favorite characters from his films was Figaro from Pinocchio which is why he decided to keep Figaro a staple of the Disneyverse as Minnie Mouse’s cat.

2. Why You Should Never Give Up

If Walt had given up on his dreams the first times he encountered opposition we wouldn’t have the movies and parks we cherish today.

Early in his career Walt worked at The Kansas City Star a newspaper still in circulation today. His employment began with the task of delivering papers which he did for six years with his father.

He eventually applied for the role of a cartoonist but that job didn’t last long. The story is that Walt was fired from his role because—according to the words of his editor—he “lacked imagination and had no good ideas.”

His following venture Laugh-O-Gram Studios went bankrupt but Walt continued moving forward until he eventually found success in Hollywood. It’s a good thing he didn’t lose heart before then.

3. The Men Behind the Mouse

Most people attribute the creation of Mickey Mouse to Walt Disney assuming the man associated with the mouse was the sole creator. They go hand in hand—literally as they’ve famously depicted holding hands in the Partners statue at Magic Kingdom.

Although Walt did voice Mickey for almost 20 years and came up with the idea of the cartoon—wanting to name the character “Mortimer Mouse”—he was not the person who created Mickey’s official design. The rodent’s iconic look was first scribbled by Ub Iwerks Walt’s chief animator.

Ub became known in the studio as the go-to Mickey Mouse animator though his skill for depicting the figure was eventually surpassed by his protégé Les Clark.

Still the majority of credit goes to Walt for bringing the mouse to life as he was awarded an honorary Oscar for the creation of Mickey Mouse by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences in 1932.

4. That’s Not His Signature

This is perhaps the most shocking of all the Walt Disney facts we’ve yet to uncover. Brace yourselves …

Think back on those times when you watched the Walt Disney Pictures logo glow on your television screen as you replayed your favorite VHS tape of your favorite Disney animated classic for the umpteenth time. For many years that castle—inspired by the real-life Neuschwanstein Castle in the German Alps—was accompanied by Walt Disney’s signature … or was it?

While you may assume that the handwritten script was the official autograph of Walt himself it actually was a specially designed typography by one of the studio’s animators.

While the design was inspired by Walt’s actual signature the final version was carefully refined for its marketability and visual recognition. I wonder if that means the capital letter D was purposefully made to look like a backwards G …

5. Canned Chili Connoisseur

Even though his fame and success reached colossal heights during his lifetime Walt still retained some of the down-to-earth preferences that he grew up with. That especially applied to his dining habits.

While many people would indulge in the finest cuisine were they ever to become as successful as Walt the entertainment entrepreneur stuck with what he loved most: canned chili.

According to his family Walt preferred simple chili over hifalutin dishes—to the extent that he often travelled with a supply of canned chili and asked chefs to warm it up for him.

It’s no surprise then that Walt’s famous chili plays such an integral role on the Walt Disney World 50th anniversary menus across the resort.

6. A Revolutionary Invention

Walt wasn’t just an animation visionary or futurist; he also had a hand in developing some revolutionary technology.

The multiplane camera was revolutionary in propelling animation techniques to new heights—and depths. By using stacking multiple panes of drawings atop each other and focusing on certain levels Walt was able to give flat-looking cartoons a visual perspective never seen before.

He developed this technique in many short films before using it in his first feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

This may not sound like a big deal but the multiplane camera was influential enough to earn Walt a place in the National Inventors Hall of Fame as he was inducted posthumously in 2000.

The creation of the multiplane is one of our favorite Walt Disney facts. We’ll be exploring this technology in detail in our March 2022 issue on the Visual Arts. Start your annual subscription today to make sure you get your copy!

7. Visionary of Tomorrow

Another way that Walt applied his ability to envision new creative technology and manifest it in real life was through his involvement in the New York World’s Fair. Running 1964 to 1965 this highly successful and noteworthy gathering of visionaries led to a flourishing of creative ideas.

Walt was heavily involved in the World’s Fair and many of his contributions to the festival made their way to Florida where they became staples in EPCOT (the Carousel of Progress for the General Electric exhibit) Liberty Square (Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln for the Illinois exhibit) and Fantasyland (“it’s a small world” for Pepsi Cola).

8. Gold Statue Collector

Walt’s groundbreaking contributions to cinema clearly never went unnoticed by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. During his prolific career Walt was attached to many projects at his animation studio which resulted in many awards.

As of 2021 Walt is the current record-holder for the most Academy Awards boasting an incredible 22 Oscar statues with his name on them. In total he was nominated 59 times!

He also holds the record for the most Oscar nominations in a single year. Back in 1954 Walt won four out of six nominations due to his involvement in feature-length and short documentaries as well as multiple nominations in various “Best Short Subject” categories.

In addition Walt holds a record of earning the most consecutive awards: eight years straight bringing home at least one trophy from 1932 to 1939.

You need more than a big mantle to display all those awards; you need an entire room!

In honor of the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World Imagineers have hidden gold statues of iconic Disney characters across all four parks. Is this a nod to Walt’s trophy case of golden awards?

Walt Disney: An Animation Legend

These Walt Disney facts barely scratch the surface of the iconic animator. You can spend weeks—nay months—reading about Walt and still have so much to learn.

It’s hard to understate the impact that Walt has left in Western animation and how the American animation industry has been shaped by his contributions. The next time you visit Walt Disney World consider how none of it would exist were it not for one man’s legacy.

What’s your favorite Mickey Mouse cartoon? One of mine has to be “Mickey’s Service Station” from 1935 because it combines my love of cars with classic Disney characters.

Multiple award-winner Mills whose father is legendary actor Sir John Mills and mother novelist-playwright Mary Hayley Bell got her start in acting at the age of 12 in the British crime drama ""Tiger Bay."" Hailed as a child screen prodigy Mills went on to star in six Disney films in six years including ""Pollyanna"" and ""The Parent Trap"" making her a breakout star in the early 1960s – not unlike the Beatles.

Mills met the band twice at the London Palladium in 1963 and 1964 where they both were performing (the second time Judy Garland was also famously on the bill) and described all four members as ""charismatic special and different"" and their music as ""so unique."" As Beatlemania swept across Britain she says they ""represented [our generation] very well"" though as she's discovered with her own grandsons who are now Beatles fans that sentiment has stretched across generations.

Those boys may be impressed to hear their grandmother also once went on a date with one of the band members. As Mills tells Womack (and also details in her new memoir ""Forever Young"") she was set to attend a Red Cross charity function at a cinema in Henley in March of 1964 (one month after the Beatles played ""The Ed Sullivan Show""). Her parents insisted she have an escort and as all her friends were in school her mother said ""I'll call George Harrison"" who happened to be Mills' favorite Beatle and who happily agreed to go.

What ensued that night in addition to being mobbed by screaming girls and Beatles fans clutching autograph books at the theater was an event that Mills calls ""absolutely surreal"" and that years later George Harrison himself would recall as ""one of his very favorite memories.""

Where would we be without our oval-eared cinematic overlords over at Disney? The modern landscape of cinema is decorated with its impact at every turn from Marvel’s juggernaut superhero franchise to Star Wars’ wobbling empire to the iconic animation studio that continues to churn out pop culture classics and countless items of merchandise. Though the modern dynasty of Disney has taken many years to flourish struggling through many years of hardship as it grew from humble beginnings as a mere animation studio.

Though the very first Disney feature film is considered to be Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in actuality the debut of animator Walt Disney was the short film titled Alice’s Wonderland a partly-animated movie starring the young child actor Virginia Davis. After his own studio behind the project Laugh-O-Gram Studio went bankrupt in 1923 Disney moved to Hollywood to join his brother Roy who quickly formed Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio and made a name for themselves making further animated Alice adventures.

Changing their name to the now iconic Walt Disney Studio the company struggled to get off the ground suffering a financial loss with their next venture Oswald the Lucky Rabbit before coming up with the character Mortimer mouse whilst on a train ride to California. Under the character’s revised name Mickey Mouse Disney released their first sound film starring the new character in 1928 Steamboat Willie.

An immediate film sensation thanks to the synchronised sound and animation that was previously unprecedented in cinema the Disney brothers began the Silly Symphony series in 1929 which saw the popularisation of the Mickey Mouse character alongside the introduction of a comic strip of the character. By December 1929 the company was recognised as a corporation with a merchandising division a recording company and more. The popularity of the Mickey Mouse series allowed the company to plan for their first feature-length animation in 1937 after enjoying years of animation success under a new Technicolor palette.

Soon enough Disney released their very first feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 becoming the highest-grossing film of the time by 1939. As pioneers of the art form the impact of the film’s release would truly not be realised until a generation to come as Disney ploughed on with a flurry of film releases including Pinocchio Fantasia Dumbo and Bambi that would cement their impact on a 20th-century landscape of cinema.

Such success continued following WWII as Disney proved that audience appetites were still whetted with a craving for animation releasing Cinderella Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan in the 1950s. This led to the creation of Disneyland on July 18 1955 a relatively new concept that began to grow rapidly and attract visitors from all over the world shortly after its grand opening. Whilst the films of Walt Disney may fluctuate in quality from decade to decade Disneyland is the one constant of the brand acting as an eternal totem to the power and significance of the brand and cinematic empire.

As the company continued to grow and expand its empire Disney blossomed into a media conglomerate that dwarfed the initial expectations of the brotherly duo. Passing away on December 15th 1966 the cinematic legacy that Walt Disney left behind upon his death is truly unparalleled with his name still holding a great deal of influence for fans of the mouse house worldwide.

A humble and well-liked individual Walt Disney used to insist on queueing just like all the guests of his park when he visited Disneyland a token of his honesty and respect for those that helped him achieve his dreams. One wonders what the same man would make of the media empire that his small animation company has mutated into particularly with its contemporary stranglehold over the modern industry.

Though the modern landscape of the Disney nightmare may be unsavoury it’s undoubted that the early works of Walt Disney the pioneering master of animation helped to create a brand new art form of cinema.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjEvMTIvd2FsdC1kaXNuZXktYmlydGhkYXktbGQxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Happy Birthday Walt Disney!

Born on December 5 1901 Walter Elias Disney was always full of ambition drive and a passion to entertain Guests. As Walt famously stated “It’s kind of fun to do the impossible” and the Walt Disney Company has really embraced this sentiment. Whether it be the new Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge expansion to Disney’s Hollywood Studios Park all of the amazing animated movies such as Walt Disney Animation Studios’ newest film Encanto or the upcoming brand-new vision of possibly Walt’s favorite project EPCOT and its exciting transformation that is currently taking place the Walt Disney Company has taken this message to heart.

Walt got his start as an illustrator when he was only five years old after his neighbor commissioned him for a drawing of a horse. Did you also know that Walt actually voiced Mickey Mouse himself in over 100 cartoons and shorts? Talk about multitasking!

Disney Parks (@DisneyParks) the official Twitter account for all of the Disney Parks and Resorts around the globe posted a video where they reveal they are working on a brand new statue of Walt that will go along with EPCOT’s exciting transformation:

If only he could have seen just exactly how Walt Disney World in Orlando would change evolve and blossom into what it has become today. As Walt is probably most famous for saying “Disneyland will never be completed.

The woman did not break the rules by taking her cat on the plane but she failed to comply with the code after refusing to put her cat back into its cage. According to their site the airlines permit animals such as small dogs cats and household birds to board domestic flights and ""must be able to fit in a small ventilated pet carrier."" As for the airlines' policy of women breastfeeding children the website stated ""Delta fully supports a woman's right to breastfeed onboard Delta and Delta Connection aircraft and in Delta facilities.

Sure WB paid $500 million for the exclusive streaming rights over a 5-year period but what’s Viacom going to do now?



If they can’t stream “South Park” episodes on Paramount Plus how are they going to draw the audience in? But then the answer came to them; movies. South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone made a deal to make 14 original movies for Paramount Plus and on November 25th the first of them premiered: “South Park: Post Covid.”

South Park: Post Covid – ViacomCBS

Clocking in at just under an hour “Post Covid” doesn’t feel like a movie in any sense of the word not even a TV movie. If you were expecting an uptick in animation quality or a musical-comedy like what we saw in “South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut” then you’re not going to find that here. Basically what we have here is a long-form episode of the show that doesn’t cut for commercial and tells a story with more plot threads. Yet even with its nearly triple the average runtime it’s still not a self-contained tale.

This is not to say that any of this is bad but it would’ve been nice to see the film take chances. After what Stone and Parker did with “The Book of Mormon” it would be amazing to see them return to another “South Park” musical. Maybe we’ll still get that in a future film but at least this is a case where what we don’t have in this movie doesn’t negatively impact what we do have. And what do we have? Well it’s more “South Park” basically. But it’s “South Park” in THE FUTURE!

South Park: Post Covid – ViacomCBS

Yeah that’s the big draw to “Post Covid” it takes place 40 years in the future when the pandemic has finally been almost beaten and we’ve returned to normal; there’s your first satirical stab from Parker and Stone right there. Without going into spoilers we follow the lives of Stan Kyle Cartman and Kenny as they reunite back in South Park for the first time since the pandemic. Where are they now? What’s happened to them? In a way it’s almost like the later years of Stephen King’s “It” when the Loser’s Club has to return to Derry. And while it doesn’t have anything to do with a extradimensional being in the form of a clown there is a terrible inciting event that draws everyone back to South Park despite some of them having left the town years ago.

The typical libertarian humor of Stone and Parker is there which will be sure to provoke a reaction from people. For example the duo are pretty clear on the ridiculousness of anti-vaxxers and especially Aaron Rodgers. They also double down on their feelings about political correctness in the world of comedy and the idea that it robs jokes of their impact and punch. None of this should be too surprising though considering the likes of PC Principal and the last two specials that South Park aired regarding COVID and vaccines.

While not an uproariously funny movie it is an interesting one in how we have so much character development. It’s fun and intriguing to see these characters that we’ve already spend decades with actually age and change like real people would. Just as the characters themselves are checking in with each other for the first time in 40-years so are we. This isn’t the case of seeing someone gradually change in personality over time; in a way we’ve already seen that through the writing and evolution of Parker and Stone’s takes on their characters. Now we’re seeing a very different change in them some for better some for the worse.

South Park: Post Covid – ViacomCBS

So if you don’t want to continue reading for the sake of spoilers then I’ll leave you with this: don’t expect anything truly great from “Post Covid.” Instead expect an interesting episode that takes some great shots at the current state of the world and the idea of what the future will be like. Don’t watch it for the laughs so much as to be drawn in by what the denizens of South Park would be like if they aged 40 years and what the state of their lives would be like given all of their personality flaws and quirks. Also go in knowing that this is not a complete story there are many plot threads intentionally left dangling. As frustrating as this is I do have a feeling it’s going to lead up to a much stronger finale because of all the set-up being done here.

SPOILERS AHEAD: YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

Something Parker and Stone have been consistently strong on is knowing how to raise the stakes when it comes to special episodes. Things like “Imaginationland” “200” and even the “South Park” video games “The Stick of Truth” and “The Fractured But Whole” all feature satisfying narrative arcs with strong escalating action. Right now it’s hard to tell if “Post Covid” will follow that trend but given some of the teases and unresolved narrative threads there’s a good chance this will follow suit.

The inciting incident that brings everyone back to South Park is the death of Kenny. Having become a massively famous and successful scientist Kenny’s death was big news. However because of the things that Kenny was working on Token thinks that there’s something else behind all of this and Kyle joins with him on that thought. Kyle calls up Stan for the first time in decades to tell him about Kenny dying. While he’s somewhat reluctant to go back to South Park he still chooses to for the sake of the funeral and nothing else.

South Park: Post Covid – ViacomCBS

Having an adult Stan be the kind of central figure for the episode makes a lot of sense considering how much of the limelight Randy has taken in the recent years of the show. Older Stan shows a lot of similarities to his father in terms of his drunken lazy attitude but replaces his father’s insane shenanigans with cynicism and bitterness. The fact that Stan’s only meaningful relationship at this point is with his Amazon Alexa which has taken on a human holographic form makes perfect sense. Stan is not a pleasant person to be around and the traits that made him frustrated with the world as a kid have only magnified in intensity.

Case in point we find out that the thing that drove him away from his father was the death of his sister and mother. Stan blames his dad for it while Randy blames Stan. The bombshell drop of what happened is rather hilarious in how nonchalantly they discuss it. Stan was tired of his mom and dad fighting about the weed farm so Stan just decides to burn it all to the ground; something indicative of just how exaggerated Stan’s “pragmatism” was becoming. The resulting fire burned his sister alive in the barn a barn she couldn’t escape because Randy had locked her in there for not doing her weed farm chores. The trauma of this caused Stan’s mom to kill herself and neither of them forgiven each other for being responsible for it.

South Park: Post Covid – ViacomCBS

It’s one of many interesting things that have happened to the characters since their childhood. The least interesting of them is Kyle but it’s still worth watching him because of just how embittered he’s grown as well. He holds an incredible grudge against Stan for something that happened during the pandemic and seems to lead an incredibly lonely and empty life having never left South Park.

It’s only fitting in that regard to have Cartman be the only of them to seemingly come out of childhood being normal and well-adjusted emphasis on seemingly. Cartman is married has three kids and has become a rabbi. Kyle thinks this is all an act just to mess with him 40-years later. Because Cartman is Cartman it’s hard not to side with Kyle on this but his vitriolic anger only serves to make him look like an increasingly horrible person. Perhaps this is part of Cartman’s plan? Maybe so. He does do some things to rub his success and family in Kyle’s face but at the same time the ending of the episode reveals that Cartman does legitimately seem to be living an honest life. When it’s revealed that time-travel may be the answer to the problems of the future Cartman doesn’t want the plan to succeed given that altering time could take away his current life and his kids.

South Park: Post Covid – ViacomCBS

Speaking of time-travel that’s where Kenny comes in. Kenny becoming a bearded eccentric scientist is a good twist for his character. During the superhero story arc we come to discover that there’s a strong sense of nobility and desire to do right by others within Kenny’s heart. Here that’s what he’s trying to do again. Kenny wasn’t just trying to stop COVID he wanted to stop it from happening and stop the future from turning into some craptastic world. For all the conspiratorial stuff being passed around regarding his death it was a refreshing thing to see that his death actually was completely natural from COVID.

However the idea that the thing that caused the future to be so awful was Stan Kyle and Cartman themselves is a bit less satisfying. Maybe the sequel will expose more of that regarding what they did to make things fall apart but it still feels a bit too easy of an answer; the fault was with ourselves. I guess it’s self-reflective in a way these kids have always had some negative and toxic elements to them having them called out for being so detrimental could result in some introspective character development.

South Park: Post Covid – ViacomCBS

Of all the threads left dangling though they saved the best for the last in the form of Butters. Notably absent from the entire film the hint is dropped earlier on when several of the characters are trying to track down a research scientist who worked with Kenny. The scientist’s name is Victor “Chowse” which is of course a bastardized pronunciation of “Chaos.” This is confirmed to us in the very last scene as we revisit the mental hospital Victor is locked up in and we see the nameplate next to his cell door “Chaos Victor.” We don’t see anything of Butters/Victor at all not a silhouette not a hand not a voice clip nothing. Since his expanded role in the show Butters has become the kind of ace-in-the-hole for elevating South Park episodes from “good” to “great.” Teasing his future self like this can only lead to something fantastic or at the very least chaotic.

South Park: Post Covid – ViacomCBS

There’s a lot going on in this movie which is why it’s so enjoyable despite its lack of laughs for me. Overtime I feel as if “South Park” has become less funny for the most part but far more clever and cutting in its humor and satire. This follows with that trend. It’s a very clever film that holds things together through the strength of its character writing and world building as opposed to its comedy. I am eager to spend some more time in this future version of South Park and sincerely hope that whatever comes next for them all builds off of this solid foundation to create something epic that sets these movies apart from the series as a whole.",,,

By Space Coast Daily // December 4 2021

New deal Effective January 1 2022

BREVARD COUNTY • MELBOURNE FLORIDA – The Melbourne City Council is awarding a new franchise agreement to Waste Management for the collection of solid waste and recyclables in the City of Melbourne.

The new franchise period starts January 1 2022. This contract award followed the City’s formal bidding process. The City received four responsive bids with Waste Management being the lowest.

Rates however will increase. In January residents’ monthly bills will be $15.99 for garbage recycling yard and bulk waste. Previously they were paying $11.39 per month.

This is a 40 percent increase and is in line with what unincorporated Brevard County residents are paying and it is lower than many municipalities in Brevard.

Besides Waste Management there were three other bidders. Their bid amounts had increases that ranged from 101 percent to 197 percent.

Following the first 90 days of the new service contract which will be April 1 Melbourne residents will have the option to exchange their garbage and recycling carts to a different size if they choose to do so at no charge.

The sizes available are 96 64 and 35 gallons. After one free exchange container swaps could incur a $25 charge. If containers are broken there is no charge for repair or replacement.

In the new Waste Management contract commercial rates will increase 15 percent from $3.69 per cubic yard to $4.25 per cubic yard.

The City’s previous franchise agreement started in 2016 and was for a five-year period.

That contract allowed for a five-year renewal. However in preliminary negotiations it was determined that rates could not increase as requested by Waste Management because they did not fit within the language of the agreement.

This led to the City putting the contract out for bid. The new agreement is for a seven-year period with the option to renew for an additional three years.

The City’s website www.melbourneflorida.org has a citizen’s request form that can be used for requests for service and/or sharing concerns. The website also includes an interactive map for collection days and details on what can be recycled. For more information call the ECO Division at 321-608-5080.

Makani Tabura however sees the strain every day.

Tabura is the director of cultural activities and education at Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center and his work in the pain management and substance abuse recovery clinics has revealed to him an identity crisis among his Waianae clientele.

For decades Westside residents have shouldered the burden of hosting the island’s public utilities and the negative perceptions that come with it. Often seen as a dumping ground the stereotype of the Westside being dangerous and desolate has permeated the community.

But health professionals and residents say in order for this perception to change the entire island has to acknowledge the history and impact of the Westside’s sacrifice.

“Sometimes the people of Waianae feel like they have a reputation to uphold that they have to be tough” Tabura said.

The Dumping Ground?

Laurel Mei-Singh grew up hearing stereotypes about people from the Waianae Coast a narrative she explored during her time as an ethnic studies professor at the University of Hawaii Manoa.

“We don’t just dump material waste on the Westside but we kind of ‘dump on’ that side of the island psychologically” Mei-Singh said.

Pre-Western contact Waianae was a lush sustainable community with acres of loi kalo or taro patches and inland crops as well as many fishponds. All of these were fed by the perennial streams along the Waianae mountain range.

Then came the multiple waves of commercial agriculture. The sandalwood trade of the early 1800s rapidly stripped the land of iliahi for Chinese markets. When sugar plantations boomed in the latter part of that century Waianae Sugar Co. was the first plantation to open on Oahu. Plantations diverted millions of gallons of water a day depriving local crops and foodways.

Mei-Singh said this stole both economic and ecological wealth from the area. Followed by a boom in military bases post-World War II and the push to develop and urbanize the Ewa Plain all of these changes to the land impacted the people who lived there and how the area was understood.

No longer was it a prosperous place to live and work but an outlier way out west. Too dry too hot and too far from the hubs of Oahu. These factors made it economically viable to build public works projects such as landfills waste management sites and power plants on the Westside.

Lasting Effects

“I know the community I grew up in indirectly benefits from the economic and environmental oppression of people on the Westside” said Mei-Singh who was raised near Diamond Head and now teaches environmental justice at the University of Texas.

Up and down the Waianae Coast there are multiple public utilities that service the entire island of Oahu. The only municipal landfill Waimanalo Gulch welcomes drivers into Nanakuli. Next door is Hawaiian Electric’s Kahe Point power plant. PVT the only construction waste landfill is a couple of miles down the road. Campbell Industrial Park with the island’s only waste-to-energy burning facility sits one town over.

A 2014 report from the U.S. Environmental Survey found these Westside power plants landfills and industrial parks emitted thousands of tons of pollutants like volatile organic compounds heavy metals and carbon monoxide.

Studies show people who live near landfills are more likely to have cancer asthma and birth defects.

Current federal regulations only require landfill companies to monitor 62 contaminants. However a recent evaluation from the University of Missouri found 584 contaminants present in landfill leachate and 322 are known to be highly toxic.

“Regulatory lists are decades old and are not taking into account all of the newer classes of pollutants such as pollutants from electronic waste or pharmaceutical compounds” said Liz Rogers a doctoral student at the University of Missouri who is working on a database of common toxins found in landfills.

Some common contaminants found by Chung-Ho Lin the researcher leading the toxicity project include a common wood preservative and fire retardant which can cause neurological problems. He’s most concerned about endocrine disruptors a class of chemicals that can affect human hormones in very low amounts.

Lin and Rogers said that it’s not enough for regulators to rely on the Environmental Protection Agency’s list of contaminants. Instead they said regulators need to monitor the urine or blood of nearby residents for toxic contaminants and install specific mitigation efforts based on which contaminants are most prevalent.

“We are not anti-landfill because we need these landfills but we need to develop processes to protect people living near landfills” Lin said.

Concern for all these physical health effects are the reason why Westside community members pushed for Act 73 to pass in 2020 enforcing buffer zones around landfills to protect nearby residences and schools.

But while studies show how landfills can affect the physical health of a community the potential toll on behavioral health is not well studied. That includes the mental strain and stress that community members experience when they feel unfairly burdened by public facilities.

Mei-Singh the environmental justice expert said that the forces of militarism colonialism and racism have changed the meaning of land — from something sacred to this “dumping ground” moniker. But she hopes that understanding history can change negative perceptions.

“It’s important for people on the Westside to know this history so they can recuperate and reclaim their mo‘olelo (story)” Mei-Singh said.

‘Survival Mode’

The fluctuations in the people’s relationship to land also affect who they are said Tabura.

“As Hawaiians if you alter our environment it changes us as well” he said.

A lot of factors can influence someone’s mental health including genetics personal history and diet. However the social determinants or the nonmedical conditions that people live and work in can also affect their well-being. Do they have access to clean water and food? Can they get a quality education? According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services one social determinant is a person’s neighborhood and built environment.

Multiple studies have shown that improvements to built environments can positively affect mental health. When people have access to better housing infrastructure and waste management systems these “interventions can positively improve mental (and physical) health by reducing risks of stressors injury and transmission of disease” according to a World Health Organization report.

Census data shows that the Waianae Coast has the highest concentration of adults suffering from poor mental health on Oahu. According to Dr. Nikki Wright a clinical psychologist and director at Waianae Coast Comprehensive Center three of the biggest issues plaguing the behavioral health of their clients are substance abuse disorders homelessness and poverty.

Another social determinant of health — economic stability — shows that poverty or low socioeconomic status negatively affects mental health. There’s an inverse correlation between socioeconomic status and access to mental health services and healthy foods which can then trigger depression and anxiety.

These two determinants feeding into each other create a spiral that may be hard for some people to escape.

Wright has worked at the hospital since 2014 and said it saddens her to see the children and grandchildren of her former patients coming in for the same mental health and substance abuse issues. But she’s trying to break those intergenerational cycles.

“Everyone is just in survival mode so we encourage them to think long term” Wright said. “We point out their strengths and show them skills for a different path.”

Tabura hopes that Waianae residents can change the perceptions of their home by first transforming themselves. When he works with recovering drug users he urges them to channel that tough persona into the grit and determination required for their recovery.

“You have to be beyond tough to sit with who you really are” Tabura said.

Healthy Land Healthy Mind

When Kealailiahi Ford looked around her high school classroom she could see her classmates were struggling.

“They didn’t know how to express themselves or ask for help because they were really hurting” Ford said.

Growing up in Nanakuli Ford recognized a lot of the labels that people put on the Westside and can understand why some of those labels could be true — sometimes the label of being a dangerous dumping ground protects her home from outsiders.

As a psychology major at UH West Oahu she thinks environmental issues and mental health go hand in hand and wants to focus on the social determinants to mental health in her studies.

“It’s unfortunate that we have to live around sewers and landfills and all these things that are polluting our lives” Ford says.

She also noticed that there are more liquor stores near her home than there are health food stores and she knows that her community deals with high rates of diabetes asthma and cancer. Ford posits that living near so many fast-food chains and industrial complexes doesn’t help residents make healthy choices.

But fixing these problems is going to be hard. As a member of the newly founded Honolulu Youth Commission her goal is to mitigate the stigmas around mental health first so it’s easier for her peers to ask for help.

She hopes that her Westside community can be more self-sustainable in the future to rely on and beautify the land instead of using and polluting it.

“We are so connected to this land that if our environment is healthy then we can in turn be healthy” Ford says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vY29zbW9zbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvcGh5c2ljcy8zLXJlYXNvbnMtd2h5LXJhZGlvYWN0aXZlLXdhc3RlLWluLWtpbWJhLWlzLXByZW1hdHVyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 reasons why radioactive waste in Kimba is premature,"Radioactive waste from nuclear medicine facilities around Australia will be trucked to and buried near the South Australian town of Kimba the federal government announced this week.

The site Napandee comprises 211 hectares of government-acquired land with radioactive waste set to be stored for over 100 years in deep trenches.

The announcement comes after six years of consultation with the local community – but as federal Resources Minister Keith Pitt noted the problem of managing radioactive waste has been on the national agenda for 40 years.

There is a good reason it has taken so long: storing radioactive waste is a complex issue.

Radioactive waste is extremely hazardous to people and the environment. It emits radiation which can pollute water kill wildlife and cause a number of deadly human health issues such as cancer. Even waste with low potency levels needs to be stored away for centuries so the community should be assured the repository is well designed and properly managed.

Currently radioactive waste – which results from the radiation needed to perform diagnostic imaging and cancer treatment – is scattered in dedicated storage facilities in hospitals across the country but the majority is secured safely at Lucas Heights in Sydney.

While Pitt is celebrating what he regards as a resolution there are three reasons this announcement is premature.

1. Legislative and regulatory hurdles

Twenty years ago The Olsen government of SA passed legislation to prevent radioactive waste being brought into the state. When the Howard government proposed storing radioactive waste in the state soon after the subsequent Rann government strengthened that legislation.

This means the new proposal will require the current SA government to repeal or amend the current law. This will be difficult as Premier Steven Marshall runs a minority government and with an MP defecting in October he’s likely to struggle to get the support he needs.

There is also a regulatory hurdle. A proposal such as this needs the approval of the regulator the Australian Radiation Protection And Nuclear Safety Authority (ARPANSA) which will assess the proposal to determine whether it ensures the safety of people and the natural environment.

ARPANSA took the previous proposal by the Howard government very seriously. The process included public hearings at which the Director of ARPANSA was assisted by two scientists – I was one and the other was a Canadian expert in radioactive waste management.

It became clear in the assessment process that the federal government had made no attempt to calculate the risk of transporting radioactive waste from the various sites where it’s now stored to the more secure centralised facility. It simply asserted that the risk was minimal.

ARPANSA was not impressed by this data-free approach. Faced with opposition by the state government and questions raised by the regulator the federal government withdrew the proposal.

2. The waste is more dangerous

The second serious hurdle is that “intermediate level” waste from a nuclear reactor temporarily stored at Lucas Heights will be sent there.

The new Napandee facility will mostly store the comparatively benign “low-level waste”. This includes residues from nuclear medicine scientific research and industrial applications. Once buried in deep trenches this poses relatively little risk to humans or wildlife.

Intermediate level waste is much nastier and demands much greater levels of security. It contains long-lived radioactive isotopes that need to be isolated and contained for periods of thousands of years – effectively permanent disposal. This is generally seen as requiring engineered underground containment facilities rather than the near-surface repositories used for low-level waste.

No such facility to safely and permanently house this waste has been built in Australia and the regulator will undoubtedly require assurances it could be safely constructed and managed.

It will also be much more difficult to justify transporting this waste along the roads of three states given it’s now securely held at Lucas Heights. Transporting nuclear waste comes with risks of accidents or possible theft by terrorists of the dangerous material.

There seems to be no point moving intermediate waste from its temporary storage in Lucas Heights to temporary storage in Napandee.

3. No consent from Traditional Owners

The third hurdle for the proposal is the opposition of the Barngarla Traditional Owners who have made clear they do not support the proposal for radioactive waste to be stored on their land.

After the consultation process in SA a ballot showed 60% of the local residents supported the proposal. But the Barngarla people say they have not been included in consultations.

In previous decades our governments have ridden roughshod over the wishes of Traditional Owners and imposed developments they did not want. Today the Australian public is generally more respectful of the wishes of Traditional Owners.

There will certainly be legal challenges to the government’s scheme. But even if the Barngarla people don’t have the law on their side they have the moral authority. It will be politically difficult for any government to justify going ahead with a scheme that is totally opposed by the relevant Indigenous group.

The storage of radioactive waste is the extreme example of an issue that demands long-term thinking. Finding a site must involve serious discussion with Traditional Owners as well as current landholders. There is no need to rush as the intermediate-level waste is securely held in temporary storage at Lucas Heights.

The National Water Company awarded Veolia (Paris:VIE) the Management Contract for water and wastewater services in the capital Riyadh and 22 outlying municipalities. The 7-year contract represents revenues of €82.6 million. It covers a population of nearly 9 million people which is expected to double by 2030. The contract covers the management of a 30000 km drinking water network and a 10000 km wastewater network with a large number of production and treatment units.

Veolia together with Saudi Arabia's Alkhorayef Water and Power Technologies will take on the operational and technical challenge of developing water services in Riyadh and its region and is committed to a series of concrete objectives. These include halving losses in the water distribution network ensuring continuity of service and access to quality drinking water 24 hours a day and implementing a training program for more than 5000 local employees.

In addition Veolia has signed a strategic agreement with the Ministry of Investment and Water Transmission and Technologies Company. Under this new partnership Veolia will support the Kingdom in improving the operational energy and commercial performance of the water sector throughout the country. This cooperation will focus on the deployment of innovative solutions including digital ones and on building skills in the operation and maintenance of facilities.

Veolia is also becoming Saudi Aramco's exclusive partner for the treatment of its industrial and non-hazardous waste. Estimated at 200000 metric tons per year this will be in addition to the 120000 metric tons of hazardous waste that will soon be treated in Jubail where Veolia is finalizing the construction of an incinerator for Sadara Chemical Company and other nearby industrial companies.

With its long-standing presence in Saudi Arabia where the Group has been operating for more than 35 years in the water waste and energy sectors for both municipal and industrial clients Veolia continues to increase its contribution to the ecological transformation of the Kingdom in line with its Vision 2030 plan.

On the sidelines of the second Franco-Saudi investment forum held in Jeddah on December 4 2021 Antoine Frérot Chairman and CEO of Veolia said: ""The strong commercial momentum Veolia has experienced in Saudi Arabia in recent years as evidenced by the recent signing of several municipal and industrial contracts in all of our business lines is a very clear indicator of the Kingdom's desire to achieve the very ambitious environmental objectives it has set for itself. In this context Veolia is proud to be Saudi Arabia's preferred partner for its ecological transformation.""

Check in every week for the unfiltered opinions of our writers and editors as they break down the hottest topics in the sport and join the conversation by tweeting us @golf_com. This week we discuss Tiger Woods’ first public press conference since his car accident wonder where he might tee it up next and recap an eventful final round of the Hero World Challenge.

1. Tiger Woods first in an interview with Golf Digest then in a press conference ahead of this week’s Hero World Challenge gave his first public statements since his car crash in late February. Among the various takeaways were that Woods was not even at the “halfway point” in his recovery from various injuries; he would “never full-time play” the PGA Tour again; and he faced a “damn-near” 50-percent chance of losing his right leg. As the 15-time major champion returns to the public eye what is your biggest takeaway from his comments?

Nick Piastowski senior editor (@nickpia): This quote struck me: “I’ll just have a different way of doing it and that’s OK and I’m at peace with that. I’ve made the climb enough times.” To hear a player who’s spent his entire life — not just career — climbing and climbing come to that conclusion was jarring. No one ever thought that Woods would play forever but to have him say the ride might be over was a bit stunning.

Alan Bastable executive editor (@alan_bastable): There were sobering elements to his remarks to be sure but still let’s celebrate this moment for what is: just nine months after we saw those horrifying images of that mangled Genesis and learned of the extent of Woods’ injuries he appears to be on the verge of strolling fairways again and hitting full-swing shots alongside his peers. Whether or not he contends on the PGA Tour again feels secondary. Tiger is back playing period. If in February you predicted we’d be at this point in December you had way more foresight than me.

Michael Bamberger senior writer: Well said Alan. But given what Tiger has been through his physical recovery — the prospect of maybe maybe playing a handful of events each year — is really just about the least of it. His life changed permanently as a result of that crash. The will he has shown to carry on as he has is both astounding and not surprising.

Dylan Dethier senior writer (@dylan_dethier): Well said. From a golf perspective there were his comments which were sobering and there were the subsequent on- and off-camera range sessions which have golf fans frothing at the mouth. The truth is Woods is further along than we thought at the beginning of the week but probably not as far along as public perception would suggest. He’s swinging it pretty well. He’s also having a hard time walking more than a short distance. Progress!

2. As the Hero progressed Woods was spotted at various times hitting on the range ramping all the way up to driver at one point. While of course only he knows for certain when do you think we will see Woods on the PGA Tour? And bonus question will he team up with son Charlie at the parent-child PNC Championship in two weeks?

Bastable: Actually I doubt even Woods knows that for certain. There’s a lonnnng way between playing a parent-child event (presumably with the aid of a cart and yes I do think he’ll play) and walking a 7500-yard PGA Tour setup for four-plus consecutive days. If you’re trying to predict which venues might suit Woods’ near-term plans you might want to think less about a certain Alister MacKenzie design a couple hours east of Atlanta and more about flatter more walkable courses. Looking at you Old Course!

Bamberger: On or at? On Riviera. Playing? The Old Course IF the weather forecast is favorable.

Piastowski: The St. Andrews prediction makes a lot of sense. When he comes back it’s not going to be to tie for 50th it’s going to be to win and he would have more than a fighter’s chance at a venue where he’s won twice before. As for the PNC he’s playing no doubt. Charlie wants to prank JT again so he’s dragging his pop back.

Dethier: Yes he’ll play the PNC. Yes he’ll play some on the PGA Tour. I think he’ll try his damnedest to beat the odds and the doctors and play the Masters even though he won’t admit it publicly. St. Andrews still seems more realistic but I’ve sworn off doubting Woods in any circumstance.

3. Among Woods’ comments what was something that maybe flew under the radar that you found interesting?

Bastable: I was intrigued by the military tactics Woods said he used to help him through his recovery. Tiger’s late father Earl who was a Green Beret told Tiger that he would get through firefights by “living meal to meal” or in other words by setting short-term survival goals. Tiger said he used the same principle in the hospital. “I would focus as much as I possibly could to get from breakfast to lunch” he told Golf Digest. “That was a success. Then we’d regroup after lunch run more batteries of tests and I’d say I just need to make it to dinner. So I’d just shorten up the window. Instead of saying ‘God this is going to be nine months of hell it’s just two to three hours.’” Earl’s teachings live on.

Bamberger: That he doesn’t eat potato chips. I can’t imagine a tuna fish sandwich even if the toast is well-toasted without the crunch that comes with some inserted potato chips.

Piastowski: That he said on the NBC telecast on Saturday that Collin Morikawa reminds him of “an athletic Jim Furyk.” I’ve been trying to unpack that comment for a good day now.

Bamberger: Jim Furyk was a star on his very good high school basketball team!

Dethier: I asked the question so I was particularly invested in his answer but I found it interesting that Woods said he completely avoided coverage of the crash. “I refused to turn on the local channels and news and stuff like that I didn’t want to go down that road. I wasn’t mentally ready for that road yet” he said. “I didn’t want to have my mind go there yet it wasn’t ready.” I’m always intrigued with the way famous people consume coverage of themselves. We never hear it from Woods but this was a tiny window into his thought process.

4. Brooks Koepka after 36 holes of the Hero told reporters that his 2018-19 stretch in which he won four majors was not his peak adding: “Just wait.” While Koepka is never bashful do you believe him? Can he eclipse his run from a few years ago?

Bamberger: I believe that he believes it and what else matters? Or at the least he semi-believes it. In any event an entertaining and meaningless thing to say.

Bastable: Like few players from his generation Koepka has proven he can turn it on at will at least four times a year (five when you include Vegas grudge matches) even when he’s seemingly out of form. The biggest question is whether Brooks can stay healthy enough to transcend his peers. In that regard the last year has raised many troubling questions.

Piastowski: Yes I believe him but no I don’t think he wins more than two majors in a year. That’s obviously not a knock on Brooks and more a comment on the level of play across the Tour at the moment. But I do think he’s found something in his swing — he noticed that his feet had begun to move apart more as he began to compensate for injury and he just recently made the fix — and he’ll be in contention in not only the majors next year but a host of other events too.

Dethier: No he can’t eclipse his run from a few years ago. But I do think he’ll eclipse his play the last few months. Golf is a more interesting place when Brooks Koepka is ranked better than No. 15. The jock swagger hits harder when his play backs it up. And while we’re at it I don’t think the Match did anything to quell the real Koepka-DeChambeau animosity. An actual PGA Tour pairing with a tournament on the line would be more intriguing than ever.

5. At the Hero Sunday’s final round took a turn for the wild with the seemingly indestructible Collin Morikawa coughing up a five-shot lead to begin the day; Patrick Reed twice(!) hitting left-handed; Sam Burns needing five chips to reach a green; and Jordan Spieth and Henrik Stenson hitting from the wrong tee box. In the end after starting the day six shots back Viktor Hovland won by a stroke. Whew. From one of the more bizarre Tour Sundays in recent memory what will most stick with you?

Bamberger: Viktor Hovland’s goofy smile after hitting that scoopy pitch into the 18th green and getting away with a lousy one. It let him win the tournament. Given the rhythm of the summary above it would have been more fitting for him to blade it right on over the green.

Bastable: And let’s not forget about P-Reed — two years from Bunkergate on this very course — weighing his drop options in the sand on the 72nd hole as Hovland and his caddie looked on with some degree of urgency. Hovland wasn’t asked about it after his round but love to know what if any impact that delay had on his blocked approach. Reed was of course well within his rights but given the excellent lie he had he seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time ultimately deciding to accept his situation and move on.

Piastowski: Morikawa. Not so much that he coughed up the large lead. More that that will stick with him for the next month. He’s shown an ability to find problems and solve them and I’m believing he comes out better because of what happened. Which should be scary for the rest of golf.

Dethier: Sam Burns. His game can look bulletproof at times and he could do no wrong for about 13 holes on Sunday. Then he hit it greenside at the drivable 14th. Then he chipped once twice thrice and so on. He still wasn’t on the green when he played his seventh shot — and then he holed it. A drive and six chips makes a seven. (It was with a putter but still.) Hovland took it from there.

6. Lee Elder the first Black golfer to play in the Masters died this week at the age of 87. His impact on the game — in particular how he broke down its barriers — was profound. “He was the first” Tiger Woods said of Elder in 1997 soon after Woods had won his first green jacket. “He was the one I looked up to. Because of what he did I was able to play here which was my dream.” What most moves you about Elder’s legacy?

Bamberger: Wow. So many things but the fact that as a rookie Tour player in 1968 at age 34 without any of the advantages that Jack Nicklaus had he was able to play 76 holes on a long course (Firestone) in the same number of strokes as Jack before losing in a playoff. In a manner of speaking that launched Jim Thorpe’s career just as Tiger in ‘97 at Augusta launched Tony Finau’s.

Piastowski: Woods said it well on NBC on Saturday. “For him to endure what he had to endure week in and week out and especially that week all the threats moving to different homes — it was a different era and different time — for him to go out there the courage it took for him to get out there and play and the dignity that he played with and the way he held himself throughout all these years — he was never a bitter man very humble. We lost one of the great heroes of the game.” Thank you Lee.

Bastable: In reading several Elder obits and tributes this week I was reminded that his PGA Tour win in 1975 was only half the battle in terms of his breaking down the walls at Augusta. Even after Elder had secured his invite there were many observers who did not want him playing in the Masters — and who made that clear by way of death threats. “Sometimes it was sent to the course where I was playing sometimes it came to my house” Elder said. Imagine trying to hit greens and hole 10-footers with that hanging over your head. Elder’s courage was awe-inspiring.

Dethier: His attitude. Elder never ever succumbed to bitterness despite seemingly endless opportunities to do so. It would have been easy to dismiss his role as honorary starter at last year’s Masters as too little too late — but Elder was thrilled and touched to be there. He had only positive things to say. Golf is better off for Elder’s life.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbGlnaHRuaW5nLzIwMjEvMTIvMDUvbGlnaHRuaW5nLWRvbWluYXRlLWZseWVycy1pbi1sb3BzaWRlZC13aW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Moose' answers call for Lightning in rout of Flyers,"PHILADELPHIA — During the previous four seasons while he was with the Flyers Lightning goaltender Brian Elliott learned to block out the “Mooooose” calls at Wells Fargo Center.

“You never know if it’s a boo or ‘Moose’ "" Elliott said of the Philadelphia fans calling out his nickname. “So you try not to listen to them. It was the same when I was playing here. So you try to kind of zone it out.”

Philadelphia fans may be finicky but they are faithful. And while there were plenty of boos in South Philadelphia on Sunday during the Lightning’s 7-1 rout of the Flyers sprinkled in — especially in the waning minutes of Elliott’s 38-save performance — were some distinguishable “Moose” calls.

In matching their largest margin of victory in franchise history the Lightning made easy work of the struggling Flyers who have lost eight in a row and are two losses away from tying the club record of 10 consecutive defeats. And though it was a night when everything seemed to go right for Tampa Bay the tone was set by Elliott’s strong play out of the gate.

The Lightning were coming off a game they were lucky to win the previous night in Boston. Goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy carried them as they mounted little sustainable offensive zone time in a 3-2 overtime win.

For the second of back-to-back games the Lightning arrived in Philadelphia around 1:30 a.m. Sunday knowing the Flyers would try to pounce on them early.

The Flyers tested Elliott right away sending nine shots his way in the first 4:12. But Tampa Bay overcame Philadelphia’s early surge took control and never looked back in their most commanding win of the season.

“We actually talked about that as a staff and a team” coach Jon Cooper said. “We knew we had to weather that for six minutes. Short turnaround for us kind of a tough trip sneaky back-to-back (games) long airport rides. (The Flyers) pushed and Moose was there for us.”

Goals on back-to-back shifts in the first period from Ryan McDonagh and Corey Perry seemed to take the steam out of the Flyers.

“They’re a desperate team over there” Elliott said. “We knew they were going to come hard with a little bit of a push and I thought we did a really good job weathering and moving on from that.”

Lightning rookie forward Boris Katchouk scored his first NHL goal in the second period a day after linemate Taylor Raddysh netted his first. Raddysh scored again Sunday and third-line forward Perry had his first multigoal game of the season getting two and also getting an assist.

“It’s all about how they’re playing away from the puck and it’s all kind of coming together for them” Cooper said of the bottom two lines. “(Sunday) was probably a little bit of an aberration. You don’t see this too often a lot of pucks were going in for us.”

When Katchouk buried a puck from the doorstep 6:47 into the second period to put the Lightning up 4-0 his look was one of relief more than excitement. After the game Elliott joked that the rookie “needs to work on his celebration a little bit.”

“I may not have showed it but it was really good” Katchouk said. “Our line’s been working really hard. I was fortunate. I had an easy tap-in but it’s cool to cherish with those guys.”

Three of Elliott’s first five starts with the Lightning have been against former teams of his — he also made road starts in Ottawa and St. Louis — something Cooper said is coincidental.

Elliott admitted however that the Lightning’s trips to Philadelphia — their win here 2½ weeks ago started by Vasilevskiy began the Flyers’ skid — were games he had circled on his calendar.

“If you get a chance to play you want to do your best” Elliott said. “And we were coming off a game that we probably didn’t play our best in Boston. (Playing) back-to-back (games) while (the Flyers) were waiting for us (they didn’t play Saturday) it’s sometimes a recipe for disaster but I thought our guys really responded.”

KANSAS CITY KAN. – A Kansas man was sentenced to prison Friday for his participation in a pair of armed bank robberies in which he fired several shots including one at a customer about to enter the bank according to the United State's Attorney.

In August 2021 a federal jury convicted Michael Shiferaw 23 of Olathe of two counts of armed bank robbery and two counts of discharging a firearm in connection with a bank robbery. A federal judge sentenced Shiferaw to 28 years in prison.

Prior to Shiferaw’s trial accomplice Kenya Breakfield 23 of Olathe pleaded guilty to one count of armed bank robbery and one count of discharging a firearm in connection with a bank robbery.

Breakfield was sentenced in September 2021 to 76 months in prison.

In October 2018 Shiferaw and Breakfield went into a Wells Fargo bank in Leawood Kansas wearing Venom face masks and carrying handguns. Shiferaw fired a shot into the ceiling upon entering. He then pointed a gun at the tellers and forced them to fill a duffel bag with money. As they left the bank Shiferaw fired another round into the ceiling yelling “happy holidays”.

In March 2019 the men robbed the Commerce Bank in Roeland Park Kansas. This time Breakfield stayed in the vehicle as the getaway driver and Shiferaw entered the bank alone. Shiferaw fired four rounds during the robbery. When tellers attempted to hide under the counter Shiferaw pointed his gun at them demanding to get into the vault. When one of the tellers attempted to get up Shiferaw shoved him and pointed a gun at his head.

The defendants were arrested shortly after the second robbery.

Here are some examples:

Tyler Sherman co-owner of Odyssey Gastropub said the downtown Colorado Springs restaurant closed its second location called The Bench in July when an apartment developer wanted to buy out the restaurant's lease. He said he made that decision in part because hiring and retaining enough staff to stay open proved next to impossible even as The Bench was attracting plenty of diners.

""It was so hard to keep staff that when we had the opportunity to sell it was too good to turn down"" Sherman said. ""Every day we had to shift the schedule when somebody called in sick didn't show up for work or just quit.""

Many employers are significantly boosting wages to attract staff. Sherman raised the starting wage for kitchen workers at Odyssey 25% to $15 an hour to slow the rapid turnover that plagued the restaurant earlier in the year. He said sometimes potential job candidates wouldn't show up for an interview or once they were hired they wouldn't show up to work or quit on the first day if they found a higher-paying position elsewhere.

Jake Topakas owner of Jake & Telly’s Greek Taverna on Colorado Springs' west side suffered worker shortages in the summer as his staff entered other industries.

But business typically declines in the winter months as visits from tourists school kids and others slow so staffing isn't currently an issue. Still he has had to raise wages.

“The people in this industry work harder than any other industry in our society I believe” Topakas said. And as the cost of food housing and utilities have gone up so does the need to boost workers' pay to make ends meet. Just as he's had to raise prices to offset his costs.

“I think these are changes that have happened in our country and across the globe itself are going to be permanent” Topakas said. “There's a whole new era ahead of us.”

Darek Barnes who owns five Ace Hardware stores in Colorado Springs has the employees he needs to handle current work and sales loads.

The summer however was a different story; the retailer never was able to fill 20 to 25 seasonal jobs he said.

“When people were still getting free government money and there was no incentive to go back to work it was fighting a losing battle” Barnes said expressing an opinion shared by some other business people.

When he couldn’t find the seasonal help existing employees were tasked with a bigger workload. Barnes said he paid them multiple bonuses over the summer and higher wages to match the marketplace.

“It was very difficult on the stores and the employees who were here” Barnes said of the labor shortage’s impact on his workforce.

But the summer labor shortage is just one issue he faced Barnes said. Profit margins haven’t increased as fast as costs and his only alternative is to raise retail prices he said.

“We’re in a pickle” Barnes said. “I’m not sure exactly what to do but we know pricing is kind of the only solution that we have at our disposal. We can’t take labor down any further; it’s kind of got a new artificial floor. We can’t take rent down because it’s going up. We can’t take insurance down because it’s going up.”

American Furniture Warehouse based in suburban Denver and one of the state’s largest furniture retailers has several hundred drivers and its own fleet of more than 800 tractors and trailers and 250 delivery trucks said Nolan Morrison who heads real estate development for the company. The combination of those vehicles pick up furniture from distributors haul it to company warehouses and deliver it to customers.

The size of its fleet and staff make American Furniture Warehouse possibly one of the state’s largest privately held trucking companies Morrison said.

But at any given time of late American Furniture Warehouse might be 30 to 40 drivers short which has been the retailer’s biggest labor struggle he said.

Without those drivers deliveries that traditionally have taken two days might take five to seven days though the company has done better of late getting purchases to customers faster Morrison said.

“It does affect business” he said. “It affects our consumers. Our goal is to be able to get the consumer their product in the fastest time that we can possibly do that. Without that labor that does start to affect our ability to take care of the customers which is our No. 1 focus.”

American Furniture Warehouse has experienced the driver shortage over the last three to four years but it’s gotten worse over the last 1 to 1 ½ years Morrison said.

He’s not sure why the company hasn’t found the drivers it needs. Drivers are paid on commission and can earn $60000 to $80000 a year and even more he said.

The company has boosted commissions over the last few years enhanced its driver training and operates newer and nicer vehicles Morrison said.

But picking up and delivering furniture is a physically demanding job he acknowledged. The trucking industry and its drivers also are heavily regulated when it comes to how long someone works while some potential employees might not want to be on the road and away from home he said.

“There’s other jobs out there so someone has to kind of choose to do that” Morrison said.

The retailer also has struggled to find employees in some skilled positions — mechanics to maintain its fleet of vehicles along with furniture upholstery and wood repair.

“Even though we do teach that that’s another one where we struggle finding people that want to do that” Morrison said.

Diane Price president and CEO of Early Connections Learning Centers in Colorado Springs said she had to freeze student enrollment in July because of a shortage of teachers.

The child care industry was already struggling with staff shortages before COVID-19 struck but the pandemic has exacerbated the shortage Price said. The loss of older teachers — baby boomers — to retirement has been felt keenly in recent years.

“We didn’t think of a creative way to create a pathway to fill those positions when the baby boomers retired"" Price said. ""We should have been forward thinking and innovative and I don’t think we were.”

Price is fighting back in many ways from greater use of teacher assistants to ""significant"" pay hikes and signing bonuses.

When child care is lacking that affects the ability of other workers to return to their industries as well Price noted.

""If we don’t have enough child care that’s going to stifle business from robustly turning around.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9mbHllcnMvZmx5ZXJzLTIwMjExMjA1Lmh0bWwtMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Flyers played well early but deflated after the Lightning's first goal,"Tampa Bay Lightning's Corey Perry (10) celebrates with Pat Maroon (14) and Pierre-Edouard Bellemare (41) after scoring a goal against Philadelphia Flyers' Carter Hart (79) during the first period of an NHL hockey game Sunday Dec. 5 2021 in Philadelphia.

In 2018 the Flyers lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning in overtime sending them into an eight-game losing spiral. On Nov. 18 2021 the Flyers lost in a shootout to the Lightning starting a skid that extended to eight games with the Flyers’ 7-1 loss on Sunday — also to the Lightning.

The Flyers started strong dominating puck possession and creating chances through the first five minutes. Lightning goalie Brian Elliott held strong in the goal against his former teammates’ onslaught to keep the game scoreless and give Tampa Bay the chance to take the lead.

Almost nine minutes into the game the Lightning’s Ryan McDonough opened the scoring by capitalizing on a mistake by the Flyers’ defense. Exactly one minute of game time later the Flyers gave up a second goal this one to Corey Perry. With that the Flyers deflated.

The Lightning had an even stronger second period with three unanswered goals. The Flyers finally got a puck past Elliott in the final minutes of the second period but the officials determined the puck had been high-sticked disallowing the goal.

After the Lightning went up 6-0 the Flyers finally got on the board in the third while on the power play. Cam Atkinson’s tip-in ended a power-play scoring drought that lasted six games and 17 power plays.

The Flyers fell to 8-10-4 extending their losing streak to eight. It is the longest skid since the 2018-19 season as well as the longest since Alain Vigneault became head coach.

Struck by Lightning

The Flyers’ losing streak to the Lightning is longer than their losing streak this season. They dropped all three games of the series against the defending Stanley Cup champions and are now 0-6-4 in the last 10 meetings. The last time they beat the Lightning was Dec. 29 2017.

The Flyers’ closest shot to beat the Lightning this season came in the first game of the series the Nov. 18 shootout loss that Flyers captain Claude Giroux had sent to overtime by scoring with 8 seconds left in regulation.

The Lightning went into Sunday’s game recovering from an overtime win over the Boston Bruins the night before. They had their backup goalie (Elliott) in net. Even though the Flyers started with more energy they weren’t able to capitalize on the situation.

The Flyers are aware of how bad they played and how bad their losing streak is. Giroux called the game “embarrassing” — but he also said hope is not gone.

“Personally I’ve been on a team here we lost 10 in a row and made the playoffs” Giroux said. “So I know it’s maybe weird to say but we do have confidence in each other. We know we can be a dangerous team. We know we can win some hockey games. It’s just right now we need to find our swagger.”

Cheap chances

When the puck dropped the Flyers came out with energy and fired off 10 shots in the first five minutes. They outshot the Lightning 14-9 in the first period and 10-9 in the second period. However they were down 5-0 by the end of two.

The zero on the scoreboard came from some things they couldn’t control like unlucky bounces and an outstanding performance by Elliott (38 saves). However the lack of confidence evident throughout this losing stretch was the Flyers’ biggest opponent.

“Most of the time it looks like we’re trying to pass the puck in the net” Atkinson said. “We need to shoot the puck.”

For as many shots as the Flyers had they could have had a number more but they kept trying to squeeze in an extra pass or move rather than make the simple play.

“We’re trying to be a little too cute” Atkinson said. “We’re not in a position to try making those plays.”

They also hesitated to shoot even just to get the puck toward the net for their teammates to rebound. As a result they lost out on high-quality shot opportunities. James van Riemsdyk said the team is filled with a lot of guys who care deeply and because of that the losing streak has “creeped in” and prevented them from playing with their instincts “and that’s usually when you play your best.”

Hart out Jones in

Unlike other games when Flyers goalie Carter Hart gave up a large number of goals unlucky bounces didn’t play a huge part. The first goal was a tough stop to make. But on the second Perry rebounded off the back wall and tucked it inside the post with Hart stranded too far out of his net. The third was a good shot on an odd-man rush but Hart’s positioning could be questioned. On the fourth he lost track of a rebound and the Lightning once again tucked it into a wide-open net.

The fifth one was his worst mistake of the night. The Flyers were on the power play and the Lightning cleared the puck. Hart came out of the net and tried to pass it to a teammate but passed it to Mathieu Joseph instead. Joseph subsequently flipped it right into the Hart-free net.

With that Hart came off the ice and Martin Jones stepped into the goal. It’s the first time this season the Flyers have replaced their goalie during the game. This season opponents have only scored more than four goals once when Hart started.

What’s next

The Flyers are right back in action Monday night at Wells Fargo Center at 7 against the Colorado Avalanche. “Sometimes when you have a game like this when you lose 7-1 it’s good to get a game the next day and get a little fire into you and get going” Giroux said. “So I expect us to answer tomorrow.”"

We want pharma companies to develop drugs and vaccines for the developing world. But people in the developing world can’t pay as much money as people in the rich world obviously.

Pharma R&D is expensive: sometimes billions of dollars to research one drug. And for every drug that is successful there might be 20 that aren’t and the research into those needs to be paid for as well. That money needs to come from somewhere. At the moment it comes from patients in rich countries paying sometimes hundreds of dollars for pills that might individually cost a few cents to make. The “marginal cost” of each dose is tiny — Jacobin and Oxfam fume that the Covid vaccines for instance are priced at many times the manufacturing cost — but that cost needs to cover the “fixed cost” of all the R&D (and marketing staff costs etc) you’ve put in.

The ideal solution to this would be selling the drug to everyone at the maximum cost they’re willing to pay. Charge hundreds of dollars in the US a bit less in the UK and EU much less in Bulgaria and almost nothing in Malawi. “If you could perfectly price-discriminate you’d be charging above the marginal cost in lots of countries and at the marginal cost for the ones who couldn’t afford more than that” says Barder.

But that’s not possible. For one thing if they tried it people would buy the pills in Malawi for a few cents and fly to the US and sell them at a profit. But more important Congress or Parliament (and the press) would kick off – why are our citizens paying hundreds of times over the odds? It would be politically impossible to do. So instead they make the drug at a single price which only rich countries can pay until the sales in those countries have paid off the R&D costs. “Drug companies are just responding to the incentives we’ve set” says Barder. “They’re doing the thing we asked them to do.”

The temptation when faced with problems like these is to argue that big pharma should be destroyed and all drug research run by publicly funded university laboratories. And maybe that would work – but it’s a huge gamble. Pharma companies do some bad things but they objectively do make drugs that are hugely valuable to society. And it’s not that publicly funded bodies are free of bad incentives. Academica has huge problems of its own — academics are rewarded for publishing lots of papers rather than for necessarily finding out true things. Government’s incentives are to remain popular rather than to fund the most effective things: it would be easy to imagine lots of money going to fund treatments for picturesque children with cancer rather than for say diabetes even if it were a much less effective way of saving lives.

Still it might work. At the moment as Barder says there’s a tendency to “socialise the losses and privatise the gains”: private companies get rich off research that is often begun in university departments. A starting point might be to pump lots of money into university research let them bring drugs to market and see if they can outperform big pharma. What would be crazy though is to destroy big pharma first and then hope that our new nationalised version can keep new drugs coming through.

A more low-key version says Gulati might be for academic institutions to become better at demanding equity in pharmaceutical products that are based on their early research. He also suggests that countries such as the UK could negotiate cheaper drugs by offering the NHS as a source of clinical trial subjects — as has happened with Novartis’s new cholesterol drug inclisiran aka Leqvio. That’s hugely valuable to pharma companies and it’s something the NHS can do easily and safely with its huge centralised well-protected data systems.

Those ideas might help make drugs cheaper in the UK and other rich countries: getting them to poorer countries is a different problem with different solutions. Governments could buy out patents — if a firm thinks it can make $10 billion over the next 10 years for its product we could say that we’ll give them the $10 billion now (or a bit less) in exchange for the rights to make the drug available at cost.

Barder likes one idea put forward by the late economist Jean Olson Lanjouw. “Her suggestion was” says Barder “that if I’m AstraZeneca and I show up at the UK patent office asking for IP protection for a new drug the patent office should say ‘Well done. Can you tell me what you expect the market value for this drug to be in all 200 countries in the world?’”

Then AstraZeneca or whoever would say “I expect most of my revenue to come from the US UK EU and Japan and relatively little from sub-Saharan Africa and Bangladesh.” And the patent office would grant them a patent on the condition that they license it for free use in those countries that make up the bottom 2% of their revenue. “It’s like a tax of 2%” says Barder “but those countries might well make up 80% of the disease burden.” It hasn’t been tried as far as I know but it’s worth thinking about and it would avoid the problems of Congress or Parliament demanding that the drug be made cheap here — although it would only work for global diseases that affect the rich world as well as the poor — diseases like cancer or heart disease or hypertension. It wouldn’t help incentivise research into diseases like malaria or dengue which have no impact on the rich world. The “advanced market commitment” which I discussed here and involves Western governments promising to give pharma companies a bonus for every dose bought by developing nations might be more effective for that.

Andrey Zarur the CEO of the biotech firm GreenLight[1. I have done several pieces of paid writing for GreenLight over the last two years] who are producing their own mRNA vaccine for Covid at the moment comes at the whole thing from a different angle“Pfizer was not designed to make low-cost therapeutics available to every corner of the world” he says: it’s a 150-year-old company with settled investors and a particular way of working.

He compares it to Apple. “You have a $1000 iPhone 13” he says. “Who’s that designed for? My children. Idiot teenagers with rich parents.” Poorer countries need smartphones too but the solution is not to force Apple to sell smartphones to Ethiopia at a discount. “What you need is an innovative company with different processes.” Instead of demanding changes from 150-year-old companies that are very good at the specific things they do create smaller newer companies which do the thing you want. “There’s six billion people in the developing world” says Zarur. “You should be able to figure out a way to turn a reasonable profit with reasonably priced drugs.”

It’s obviously true that pharma companies have done bad things. It’s also obviously true that they’ve done marvellous things — I have relatives who are alive today who wouldn’t be without the pharmaceutical industry’s products.

Perhaps there are other systems which could have produced those drugs other than the undeniably cutthroat capitalist system we have today. But any system would have bad incentives and obvious easy-to-publicise disasters.

The job of government in this situation should be to find the bad incentives the market failures and to patch them; to make it work to decide which end of the balloon to squeeze. The Indian government for example decided a few years ago that it would not accept evergreening any more — it passed a law saying that it would only offer new patents on drugs that were sufficiently different from existing ones.

In 2013 the government won a court case against Novartis which had tried to get a new patent on a cancer drug imatinib mesylate — a crystalline version of an existing cancer drug imatinib. The government said that the new version was no better than the existing one and was simply an attempt to squeeze more money out of the healthcare system.

It worked. You could argue (as Novartis did) that it will reduce innovation; but the point is you can change the system change the incentives encourage the behaviour you want without smashing the system entirely.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We are slowly getting new capacity tiers. Recently we covered Western Digital 20TB ePMR Hard Drives with OptiNAND and WD Gold 16TB 18TB and 20TB models. Seagate is now getting into shipping 20TB hard drives with a duo intended for storage servers and NAS gear.

Seagate Exos X20 and IronWolf Pro 20TB HDDs Shipping

In search of more capacity Seagate announced that it will be shipping two 20TB drives this month just making it in 2021. For higher-end NAS units there is the IronWolf Pro 20TB drive. For larger storage servers there is the Seagate Exos X20.

The Seagate Exos X20 is available in 18TB and 20TB capacities with both SATA 6Gbps and SAS 12Gbps models available. Here is the spec sheet for these:

The Seagate IronWolf Pro 20TB is part of the performance-optimized NAS line. That is different segmentation from the Exos X20. The Exos X20 is more for storage servers and arrays. The IronWolf Pro 20TB falls into the category of personal NAS storage at Seagate. Here are the specs for the IronWolf Pro:

Both have a maximum sustained transfer rate of 285MB/s but the IronWolf Pro does not have a SAS3 option. One interesting note is that the AFR reliability rating of the Exos drive is much higher and it also uses considerably less power.

Final Words

Pricing is set to be $669.99 for the Exos X20 20TB and $649.99 for the IronWolf Pro 20TB. Those are list prices and we have seen supply challenges mean that drives do not always sell for list. One of the biggest benefits we tend to see is that as new capacity points become available and somewhat competitive it sometimes pushes down prices of lower capacity drives. We hope that is the case with this new release.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhemVkZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vbXVzaWMvYXJ0aWNsZS81NDk3MS8xL3dhdGNoLXRoZS1kaXJlY3RvcnMtb2YtamVlbi15dWhzLWRpc2N1c3MtZG9jdW1lbnRpbmcta2FueWUtd2VzdC1zLWNhcmVlctIBgQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXplZGRpZ2l0YWwuY29tL211c2ljL2FydGljbGUvNTQ5NzEvMS93YXRjaC10aGUtZGlyZWN0b3JzLW9mLWplZW4teXVocy1kaXNjdXNzLWRvY3VtZW50aW5nLWthbnllLXdlc3Qtcy1jYXJlZXI_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch the directors of Jeen-Yuhs discuss documenting Kanye West’s career,"For their upcoming Netflix documentary Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy filmmakers Coodie Simmons and Chike Ozah followed Kanye West’s career for more than two decades capturing “both his formative days trying to break through and his life today as a global brand and artist”.

Experts say it will put one of the nation’s most pristine wetlands at risk.

A predawn phone call woke Ron Bledsoe with a jolt. It was his supervisor telling him to come in.

Bledsoe dressed and drove an hour to the power plant near Kingston Tennessee where he worked. He arrived at a shocking sight: A mountain of coal ash covering the road and a set of railroad tracks. It looked like the surface of the moon he recalled.

Hours earlier an embankment at the plant had ruptured flooding the area with gray muck. The spill was an environmental calamity and the fallout was immediate. The ash blanketed up to 400 acres killed hundreds of fish damaged more than a dozen homes and polluted nearby waterways. The clean-up took years and cost more than $1 billion.

Coal ash an umbrella term for the residue that’s left over when utilities burn coal is one of the United States’ largest kinds of industrial waste. It contains metals — such as lead mercury chromium selenium cadmium and arsenic — that never biodegrade. Studies have shown these contaminants are dangerous to humans and have linked some to cancer lung disease and birth defects.

For a time the Kingston incident catapulted coal ash into the public consciousness. But experts say it continues to pose a massive threat throughout the country.

About 400 miles southwest of Kingston a coal ash lagoon — which holds almost four times as much sludge as what spilled in Tennessee — is sitting in the Mobile–Tensaw Delta one of the most biodiverse areas of the United States with flora and fauna not known to exist anywhere else on Earth. Environmentalists community members and scientists fear the pond could someday unleash a Kingston-like catastrophe on southern Alabama and say leaving the coal ash in the delta is shortsighted and dangerous.

“We’ve got an A-bomb up the river” John Howard who lives in Mobile County and said he has been fishing in southern Alabama for decades said. “It’s just waiting to happen.”

‘Horror’ scene in Kingston

Most Americans had likely never heard of coal ash until three days before Christmas 2008 when the Kingston spill news broke.

Before the 1970s many utilities pumped their coal ash into the atmosphere attorney Lisa Evans who has focused on coal ash litigation for more than 20 years said. After Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1970 which regulated power plants’ air emissions some facilities began storing their coal ash in dirt ditches commonly known today as ash ponds or surface impoundments.

Hundreds of these sites now dot the country according to data that federal regulations require pond operators to publish and was compiled by Earthjustice a nonprofit that handles environmental lawsuits. Because coal plants produce electricity by converting large volumes of water into steam many of these waste sites are situated near river systems and flood zones. But 40 or fewer have a protective liner to contain the leftover ash and more than 200 have been shown to contaminate groundwater with toxic substances at levels that exceed federal safety standards the Earthjustice data shows.

With the Clean Air Act the nation traded one environmental problem for another Evans who works for Earthjustice said.

“One could see the billowing black smoke” Evans said. “You can’t see coal ash contaminating underlying groundwater (…) you can’t see the slow pollution of the adjacent river and the dying of the fish (…) It’s likely to be less dramatic.”

After 5.4 million cubic yards of coal ash spilled at the Kingston plant the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated the area as a Superfund site. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) which owned the plant spent more than $1 billion over six years to clean up the spill.

The aftermath “was like nothing I’ve ever seen before” Richard Moore who served as the inspector general for the TVA at the time said. “It was like a scene out of a horror movie.”

Tommy Johnson — like Bledsoe the worker who compared the Kingston spill to the moon’s surface — was at the facility that day. He spent six years working on the clean-up effort and said he believes exposure to the coal ash made him sick.

In 2018 Johnson joined more than 200 plaintiffs in suing Jacobs Engineering a TVA contractor hired to oversee the Kingston cleanup alleging Jacobs lied to workers about the ash’s toxicity. Bledsoe was also part of a suit which was filed in 2013. A jury eventually found that Jacobs failed to keep workers safe during the cleanup and that this failure could have caused the illnesses and injuries they suffered. The parties are now litigating over whether individual workers’ illnesses are a result of coal ash exposure.

“It’s (been) one ailment after another” Johnson said.

Today Johnson said he struggles to breathe and walk. Bledsoe according to court filings signed by his doctor suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease a disease that is typically caused by cigarette smoking. Bledsoe and his doctor have said he was never a smoker.

In a statement Jacobs spokesperson Heather Byrd told CNN the company “stands by its work assisting TVA with the difficult job of cleaning up the Kingston coal ash spill” adding that “the evidence will prove that the plaintiffs’ claimed conditions were not caused by exposure to coal ash at Kingston.”

TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks said in a statement that the utility has become an “industry leader in the safe secure management of coal ash.”

EPA’s ‘tipping point’

In response to the Kingston disaster the EPA set out to review the condition of more than 500 coal ash ponds across the United States.

“(Kingston) was almost a tipping point” Mathy Stanislaus who served as assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response from 2009 to 2017 said. “The reaction (at the EPA) was ‘We need to do something about this.’”

In 2015 the agency implemented its first-ever regulations on coal ash disposal forcing utilities across the country to begin closure and remediation of ponds that were unlined and contaminating groundwater above permitted levels.

The rule gives such ponds’ owners two closure options: seal the ash through a procedure known as capping-in-place or dig it up and move it to a lined landfill.

Depending on a pond’s size the EPA gave utilities between five and potentially 15 years to close them. In 2018 a federal court decision prompted the EPA to amend its rule. Today some utilities may have until 2036 to complete closure of certain ash ponds.

But environmental advocates say capping-in-place is not always an effective option especially for ponds where coal ash sits below the water table the point below which the ground is saturated with water because the cap does not prevent heavy metals from leaching into the surrounding area. They often point to a 2001 report by the Electric Power Research Institute in which researchers studied three unlined closed ponds and found that while groundwater quality improved at two it didn’t improve at the third where some ash sat below the water table.

Moreover they fear that as weather patterns become more extreme and less predictable leaving coal ash in an unlined pond is reckless because the potential for a catastrophic spill will always loom.

The Mobile–Tensaw Delta in southern Alabama is one of the largest river systems in the United States. It has been referred to as “America’s Amazon.” Matthew Gannon/CNN

A nationwide challenge

There are an estimated 511 coal ash ponds in the United States according to a CNN analysis of the data compiled by Earthjustice. Nearly half — about 46% — are unlined and have been or will be closed in place. The utilities’ self-reported data shows around 160 are known to be contaminating groundwater but groundwater data gathered by the Environmental Integrity Project a nonprofit watchdog that advocates for better environmental law enforcement places that number at closer to 200. It’s unclear how many of those ponds sit below the water table or have direct contact with groundwater but around 60 sit in a flood zone.

Mapping coal ash ponds

Geologist Mark Hutson said that because the majority of the ponds are constructed along rivers — and typically in flood plains — many are likely to pollute the groundwater.

“The science points us clearly to excavation as the only way to protect public health and the environment” Michael Regan who ran North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality and now serves as EPA administrator said about ponds in that state in 2019.

In the 2015 rule the EPA declined to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste instead opting to regulate it as solid waste a category that can include everything from banana peels and candy wrappers to sewage and industrial sludge. That designation effectively allowed utilities to police themselves unless state regulators or private citizens which the law gives standing to seek enforcement through the courts intervened.

Stanislaus the former EPA assistant administrator said the agency declined to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste in part because business leaders raised concerns that doing so would hamstring their ability to recycle the substance which is frequently used in cement grout and other construction materials and because officials felt regulating coal ash as solid waste would still adequately prevent it from contaminating air and water.

That decision meant that initially states could regulate coal ash through existing water and waste programs. But it was a missed opportunity to enact stronger safeguards Dalal Aboulhosn the Sierra Club’s deputy director of policy advocacy and legal said.

“If EPA would have decided to regulate coal ash as hazardous waste we would have gotten the strictest of protections for communities” Aboulhosn said. “From cradle to grave we would be looking at coal ash as something that could harm communities and (making) sure it would be disposed of properly.”

In 2016 the federal government reclaimed some oversight when a new law authorized the EPA to review states’ programs for regulating pond closures. For states that didn’t develop their own programs the law required the EPA to develop one instead.

The EPA must still approve states’ programs but Evans said lax oversight and vague benchmarks — guidelines the agency published in 2017 say mainly that state programs must be “at least as protective as” federal regulations and should ensure public participation — have given states considerable leeway when regulating coal ash.

“The absence of (federal) requirements has left important criteria up in the air and fails to guarantee important safeguards nationally” Evans wrote in an email.

When President Joe Biden chose Regan to lead the EPA last December Evans hoped the pick would usher in more rigorous enforcement. Regan had firsthand experience with the consequences of coal ash pollution; In North Carolina he led the state’s department of environmental quality in the years following a spill.

In an interview with CNN last week Regan signaled the Biden EPA will indeed take a firmer stance on coal ash management.

While Regan did not provide specifics he said the agency is planning to announce details which he said could include additional regulatory actions soon. That announcement Regan said will give a “clearer picture of how the agency plans to move forward” nationwide.

“We’re pretty far down the road on this and we recognize the sense of urgency” Regan said.

Sources familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement is still being finalized told CNN they expect it to include decisions on a handful of applications for closure extensions at coal ash ponds across the country and notices to several facilities about compliance obligations.

In the meantime some state governments have taken it upon themselves and forced utilities to excavate their coal ash pits.

After a broken pipe unleashed more than 46000 cubic yards of coal ash from a retired power plant on the Dan River in 2014 near Eden North Carolina state officials enacted a law forcing the closure of all unlined coal ash ponds in the state ultimately requiring utilities to recycle the ash or put it in a lined landfill.

And in 2019 a Virginia law required Dominion Energy to excavate more than 27 million cubic yards of coal ash from ponds across the state.

But in other states including Alabama utilities still have the option to close ponds through cap-in-place.

‘We love our power company’

Standing behind the wheel of a motorboat in April Ben Raines a former newspaper journalist who offers tours of the Mobile–Tensaw Delta steered with the confidence of a man cruising across the Mediterranean on a yacht.

The Mobile–Tensaw Delta is part of the Mobile River Basin which drains most of Alabama’s water through the delta the Mobile Bay and into the Gulf of Mexico. It is one of the largest and most biodiverse river systems in North America; the region is home to at least 35 kinds of orchids and likely more turtle species than any other river system on Earth. At least 30 types of carnivorous plants live in the delta. Raines who has often referred to the delta as “America’s Amazon” points out one that eats insects.

Alabama’s ecosystems are particularly diverse because glaciers never covered the state during Earth’s last ice age unlike large swaths of what is now North America.

The delta is where Alabama Power’s James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant’s smokestacks tower above the treeline. Many refer to the plant named for the executive who led the utility from 1949 to 1952 as simply “Barry” or “Plant Barry.” It’s about 25 miles north of downtown Mobile sits on the Mobile River and forms a corridor of industrial facilities. At 597 acres Barry’s ash pond is nearly as large as the National Mall. A grassy berm dotted with yellow flowers lines the property’s edge and separates 21.7 million cubic yards of coal ash from the river.

“Coal ash is sitting there right on the edge of (the delta)” Raines said occasionally stopping his boat to pluck a plant from the water and marvel at it.

“If there were an accident (…) we would have lost you know one of America’s treasures and a treasure that people are only beginning to understand and explore.”

Alabama Power spent $30 million to construct Barry which opened in 1954. The plant was intended to meet the area’s rapidly expanding electricity needs. Mobile’s population exploded during World War II as the shipbuilding industry grew Mark VanLandingham a population studies professor at Tulane University said. Mobile was fairly developed by the 1950s; it had 17 movie theaters four hotels and two daily newspapers. The city which had about 174000 residents in 1956 was a manufacturing hub for pulp and paper products lumber and textiles. A guide to Mobile from 1957 boasted that the city was on its way to becoming one of the “great centers of trade and industry.”

But that didn't pan out. The city’s population peaked at roughly 200000 in 1960. As residents moved to suburbs and manufacturing began moving overseas Mobile’s population like many other post-industrial cities’ declined VanLandingham said.

As of 2019 census estimates showed the city of Mobile was home to almost 189000 people. About 18% of the city’s residents lived in poverty. That share was higher — about 21% — for Black Mobilians who made up more than half the city’s population.

With about 6000 employees Alabama Power is a major employer in the state. It provides energy to roughly 100000 customers in the city of Mobile. Its corporate parent Southern Company owns electric utilities in Georgia and Mississippi and is the third largest electric utility company in the country by market value.

In a state where storms are commonplace “the most important person who shows up at our door after a hurricane is the Alabama Power guy who has just turned our lights back on” said Casi Callaway who grew up in Mobile and spent 23 years as the executive director of Mobile Baykeeper an environmental nonprofit that aims to protect southern Alabama’s waters.

“We love our power company” she said.

Alabama Power’s choice

Alabama Power is poised to close the Barry pond through capping-in-place. Its process according to the closure plan filed with state environmental regulators last year would remove water from the pond to shrink its footprint by nearly half before filling the perimeter with soil and sealing the ash with a cover made from plastic crushed rock and artificial turf that the company has said is designed to “virtually eliminate infiltration of surface water.”

Records show the site has been contaminating groundwater for years. In its most recent groundwater monitoring report from 2020 Alabama Power revealed elevated levels of arsenic and cobalt near the Barry plant that exceeded groundwater protection standards by more than eight times and more than five times respectively. In 2018 state officials fined the company $250000 for arsenic pollution saying the company had “caused or allowed the unpermitted discharge of pollutants associated with ash pond wastewater from the Plant Barry Ash Pond to waters of the State.”

In a document filed with the state’s utility regulator last month company officials acknowledged environmental groups’ concerns about the cap-in-place method’s effectiveness toward protecting groundwater and that “the risk of an adverse outcome remains” but wrote the company believes its plans for Barry’s ash pond and about 10 other coal waste sites in the state meet federal requirements and that requiring full ash removal would “dramatically” increase costs and “adversely impact” nearby residents’ quality of life through “decades of constant truck traffic.”

“It’s about the money” Moore the former TVA inspector general who now lives near Barry in Baldwin County said. “I believe the corporate culture and the corporate mindset at most utilities is the same way: If they can do it on the cheap that's what they're going to do.”

Alabama Power has estimated that it will spend about $860 million to close the Barry ash pond by capping it in place and an additional $36 million for post-closure maintenance according to its closure plan. Jack Bonnikson a company spokesperson declined to say what the company estimated excavation would cost.

But no excavation cost would compare to cleaning up a spill Evans the environmental attorney said.

“It is infinitely cheaper to scoop ash out of a pond and truck it to a lined landfill than to excavate it out of a river and out of people’s yards” she said.

Frank Holleman a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) who has litigated against utilities over coal ash contamination for over a decade said utilities often misrepresent how much each method will cost.

“As a general rule they overstate the cost of excavation and they understate the cost of cap-in-place” Holleman said.

In addition Holleman said utilities often prefer capping-in-place to avoid the “managerial hassle” of transporting coal ash.

In written responses to CNN Bonnikson challenged Holleman’s claim. He said cost estimates often change as work on a project progresses and that the engineers and geologists who develop cost estimates are expected to adhere to professional standards.

Closing these ponds has sometimes come at a high price for utilities though often their customers are footing large shares of the bill.

Duke Energy for example has estimated it will spend $8 billion to $9 billion to comply with North Carolina’s law and excavate 31 ponds in that state in addition to four in South Carolina.

Bill Norton a spokesperson for Duke Energy couldn’t say how much of that total pertained to the North Carolina ponds. But he said it made up “the vast majority” of the multibillion-dollar estimate and that about $3.8 billion — or at least 40% — will be passed on to North Carolina retail customers.

But customers’ payments aren’t just going toward the cost of pond closures. They’re also lining shareholders’ pockets.

Because many utilities operate as natural monopolies where state regulators control prices the companies’ profits often depend on how well they control costs. In 1923 the US Supreme Court ruled that to ensure that utilities remain financially sound and can continue to provide services they should be entitled to recoup the costs of certain investments and profit from them.

Utility regulators and courts are supposed to make sure such investments are reasonable and necessary and that the costs passed onto customers are appropriate.

But Dave Rogers a deputy director at the Sierra Club said they are often politicized and customers don’t always get “a fair shake.” Jim Lazar a former senior adviser at the Regulatory Assistance Project said the result is that today’s customers end up paying for earlier generations’ mistakes.

It’s unclear how much Alabama Power stands to profit from the Barry closure. Bonnikson declined to provide a figure but a recent filing with the state’s public service commission outlined financial information related to how the company will comply with government mandates next year.

Anna Sommer a consultant at Energy Futures Group who has advised groups working toward improving Alabama’s public utility regulation process reviewed the filing for CNN and estimated that the utility would likely return around $200 million to shareholders in the coming years as a result of the Barry pond closure. Sommer’s assessment was reviewed by two ratemaking experts for CNN: Lazar and Stephen Hill an independent consultant who has provided expert testimony in ratemaking cases.

Debating Alabama Power’s plan

In an email Bonnikson said the utility’s annual filings “transparently provided estimated costs for compliance and associated rate calculations.” He declined to comment on Sommer’s estimate saying only that the utility “will not validate estimates or calculations (CNN) may have received from a third-party group.”

In March community members environmentalists and coal industry advocates gathered at a Hampton Inn in Saraland a Mobile suburb near Plant Barry for a public hearing to comment on Alabama Power’s closure plan.

Some speakers including Jonathan Hale who runs an Alabama-based mining company supported the utility’s plan. Hale said he was concerned that transporting the waste to a landfill could lead to ash spills on roads and put unnecessary wear and tear on Alabama’s highways.

Many speakers opposed Alabama Power’s plan. One woman became emotional as she recounted learning there was an unlined coal ash pond near her home. A man compared the Barry pond to a rotting tooth that needs to be taken out a cancerous skin lesion that should be removed and mold growing on drywall that needs to be gutted and replaced.

Nicholas Williams a 29-year-old sales and support representative for a small online hunting gear retailer stood at the microphone in a T-shirt and baseball cap.

“Twenty years I’ve been poking around up there looking for deer and hogs and ducks and big ol’ flatheads” Williams said. “Looking for game but also looking for the peace that a vast mass of calm waters and cypress trees brings. Looking for a sense of being and perspective that you find when you stand on top of the Indian mounds (…) and realize that you’re really very small in the grand scheme of things.”

For Williams being in the delta is a way of life. He and his wife Sarah bought a home perched on Tensaw Lake a tributary in the delta three years ago. The couple have chickens in their front yard — the rooster is named Sue after the Johnny Cash song — and a collection of birds Nicholas has killed is mounted on their living room wall. He said he worries that a spill at Barry could destroy the delta that he hopes to one day share with his children.

“I believe leaving the coal ash pond in place is taking a chance with something that should not be left to chance” he said. “We don’t have to jeopardize the Mobile–Tensaw Delta.”

While state regulators approved Alabama Power’s plans for the Barry pond in July EPA Administrator Regan told CNN last month that his agency is “actively investigating (…) the Plant Barry situation.”

“We understand the concerns about this facility in Alabama” Regan said. “The last administration’s leadership failed to act on these concerns. This administration will act to protect communities and based on my prior experience if there is coal ash in contact with groundwater that’s putting the health and safety of communities at risk and requires our attention.”

‘Nothing God can do’

When Hurricane Ida approached the Gulf Coast in late August Cade Kistler and the Mobile Baykeeper staff prepared for the worst.

At their downtown Mobile office they put trash bags over computers and moved them away from windows. They prepared their boat and test tubes to take water samples from the river and check for coal ash. Kistler Baykeeper’s interim director made sure his family had enough food in case the power at their home went out.

After the storm made landfall in Louisiana Kistler drove to Barry to look for signs of damage.

He put a chainsaw in the back of his Subaru in case he needed to cut through fallen trees. The rain was still heavy he said recalling how his car shook from the wind as he crossed Mobile Bay on the highway. Kistler who remembered feeling cautiously optimistic because Ida didn’t directly hit the area said he didn’t see any signs indicating a disaster had struck Barry.

Meanwhile Ida was carving a path of destruction across the country killing at least 80 people across eight states. By any measure it was one of the strongest tropical storms to ever hit Louisiana.

“We got off really light” Kistler said. “It really is just a matter of when a similar storm (…) hits coastal Alabama.”

When Kistler and his staff learn a hurricane has formed in the Gulf they worry about two disaster scenarios at Barry: its dam collapsing or that river water will overtop the dam sending coal ash surging into the delta.

A coal ash spill wouldn’t be southern Alabama’s first brush with environmental disaster. In 2010 an explosion on a British Petroleum (BP) oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers and set off a domino effect that caused oil and natural gas to leak into the Gulf for nearly three months.

The Gulf is still recovering from the calamity which the EPA has called the largest marine drilling-related oil spill in history. As of 2018 researchers were still detecting oil contamination in thousands of fish in the Gulf of Mexico according to one study.

“You couldn't walk on the beach” Mobile resident Madelyn King said. “There were tarballs washing up all the time.”

The BP spill hobbled leisure tourism in the region. Visitor spending in Louisiana dropped by $247 million in 2010 according to a report prepared for the state’s tourism agency by Tourism Economics a consulting firm that analyzes global travel data.

Callaway who was leading Mobile Baykeeper at the time (she left Baykeeper for a job as Mobile’s chief resilience officer in May) said southern Alabama dodged a bullet.

“The power of the Mobile River and the delta pushing water out of the bay made sure we didn't have much oil come into the bay” Callaway said. “If something happens with the coal ash pit there’s no natural protection. There’s nothing God can do to protect us from that.”

If the Barry pond were breached the volume of slurry could eclipse the amount of oil that spilled into the Gulf during the BP disaster.

“They would be dealing with that for God-knows-how-many years“ Keith Johnston an attorney for the SELC said. “It would be devastating for the city of Mobile and the bay. A lot of people rely on that bay for their livelihood.”

When an environmental disaster strikes Black and Brown communities often suffer the worst consequences Aboulhosn the Sierra Club deputy director said.

“Across the board communities that are people of color that don't have the socioeconomic levels of some predominantly White communities are the ones that are shouldering this burden” she said.

Joe Womack who grew up in Mobile runs an environmental advocacy organization in the city’s Africatown neighborhood a historic Black community that is choked by highways and industrial facilities. He said he worries Africatown where residents still talk about the ash from a nearby paper mill that would rain down on the community years ago would continue to bear the brunt of industrial pollution and its consequences.

For “folks that are at the bottom end of the totem pole” Womack said “(it’s) just like anything else: You see things happen to you more in a negative sense.”

“The thing with Barry” he said is “just more of the same.”

In his remarks to CNN last week EPA administrator Regan — the first Black man and second person of color to hold the position — called environmental justice and equity “a pillar” for the administration.

“What we’re saying is ‘We see you we hear you and we’re responding’” Regan said. “Too often whether it’s the coal ash pond or a chemical refinery or a landfill our communities are disproportionately impacted by exposure to pollution.”

The SELC and Mobile Baykeeper have called on Alabama Power to change tack and excavate the pond. The organizations argue the utility’s plan will allow groundwater contamination to continue and that the potential for a disaster will remain if the coal ash is not removed.

Bonnikson declined to say whether the utility has studied how far coal ash might travel if its dam was breached but told CNN in an email that the company’s “structural stability analysis and regular inspections demonstrate the dikes are safe and secure and continue to function as designed.”

In 2010 engineers — hired by the EPA to conduct Barry’s dam safety assessment as part of the national review launched following the Kingston spill — determined that Barry’s dam was in “satisfactory” condition but had a “significant” hazard potential because a failure could cause major damage to the environment wildlife and habitat if coal ash were released into the river.

Alabama Power has modeled potential flooding in the area with the help of third-party experts but Bonnikson declined to provide CNN with the data used to run the model. In an email he wrote that the experts’ models for “extreme river and tropical flood events (showed) no overtopping of the ash pond’s existing dike wall” and that “Even a 500-year tropical flood with an additional 5 feet of storm surge showed no impact on Plant Barry or its ash pond.”

“Since 1965 15 different tropical storms and hurricanes have passed within 50 miles of the plant site with no impact to plant operations or the ash pond” Bonnikson wrote.

Storm path data from 1980 to 2020 shows that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico aren’t necessarily becoming more frequent and an analysis of synthetic aperture radar data which can be used to track how water saturates land showed no notable flooding near Barry after heavy rainfall. A predictive analysis of flood gauge data at Barry didn’t suggest large deviations from the norm in the coming years.

There is some evidence that more storms are reaching a higher intensity although there’s some indication that the frequency of storms may be going down Michael Bell an atmospheric science professor at Colorado State University said. In 2020 for example researchers at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and NOAA looked at nearly 40 years of data and found the probability of storms reaching major hurricane status — Category 3 or higher — increased decade after decade.

Sean Powers a marine scientist and professor at the University of South Alabama said changing weather patterns are his biggest concern about the Barry ash pond.

“Everything now is based on our understanding of the risk that exists now” Powers said.

“Obviously sea level will rise” he said. “Storms will increase at least in intensity if not frequency and all of those pose serious risk for the release of that material.”

While environmentalists keep an eye out for the next Ida some scientists say a less visible and more insidious crisis is already underway.

“Eventually (a disaster) is going to happen” geologist Mark Hutson whom the SELC hired to review Alabama Power’s closure plan for the Barry pond last year said. “In the meantime there will be decades of slow release of metals into the swampy areas.”

In his report for the SELC Hutson concluded that to effectively close any coal ash storage site the waste must be permanently isolated from water including groundwater and that the Barry pond’s location — on a meandering river system’s floodplain — was an unsuitable place to permanently store waste.

“No (new) waste disposal facility” he determined “would be permitted in this physical location.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc3R5bGUvY2hhbmVsLWZyYWdyYW5jZS1hcnQtYmFzZWwtbWlhbWktYmVhY2gtbGFieXJpbnRoLTEyMzUwNTcyODQv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zdHlsZS9jaGFuZWwtZnJhZ3JhbmNlLWFydC1iYXNlbC1taWFtaS1iZWFjaC1sYWJ5cmludGgtMTIzNTA1NzI4NC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pharrell Williams Alana Haim Visit Chanel Labyrinth at Art Basel Miami Beach,"Artist Es Devlin wanted guests to engage in all their senses when she designed “Five Echoes” the public installation commissioned by Chanel to honor the 100th anniversary of the house’s iconic No. 5 fragrance. More than 2000 fragrant trees grasses and other plants were sourced to create a forest-like environment at Jungle Plaza in Miami’s Design District with a walkable labyrinth 100 feet in diameter — its shape inspired by a French abbey from Coco Chanel’s childhood — rising from its center.

While Devlin sought myriad ways to honor the codes of Chanel in the experience sustainability was also top of mind said the British-born artist and stage designer. “We began with a conversation about how a temporary artwork can be made without polluting the planet” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “Sadly many of them end up in landfills. Once I saw this huge beautiful space my immediate thought was to turn it into a temporary forest and then when all is said and done replant that forest here in Miami.”

All trees and plants will be donated to public parks in Miami-Dade County while Devlin adopted the same approach with the labyrinth. Crafted with stretched fabric and timber the installation’s materials will be donated to local theater companies once the public event concludes Dec. 21. (More information about visiting the space can be found here.)

To celebrate the installation’s opening Chanel hosted a splashy dinner in Jungle Plaza on Friday evening Dec. 3 with guests who included Pharrell and Helen Williams Joe Jonas Venus Williams Rebecca Dayan Dylan Penn Maluma and the Haim sisters.

For the L.A.-based rock trio the night’s event was a first for them with both Chanel and Art Basel Miami Beach and they were quick to agree that they’re big fans of Devlin’s work. “We’ve followed her for a long time” Danielle Haim said. “The pieces she’s done for rock shows for U2 or Adele are incredible. We’ve always been in awe and so inspired by her.”

Like other guests the three sisters wore head-to-toe Chanel. They also appear in one of the year’s hottest films Paul Thomas Anderson’s Licorice Pizza. Did they have any idea that the movie ultimately would generate so much buzz during production? “It’s not surprising because I was so in love with the script the first time I read it” Alana Haim told THR. “Doing something you’re passionate about and you really believe in was important to all of us and we really believe in Paul. It was such an amazing experience; I wish I could go back and do it again 40 million times.”

Maluma who’s starring in Marry Me with Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson (expected to release Feb. 11 2022) likewise embraced the spirit of the evening pairing a pink-and-white knit cardigan from Chanel’s Spring 2021 collection with white sequined trousers and a group of pearl necklaces. “With my [styling] team we always think ahead and want to change the game” he said of his look. “I’m not afraid of trying different things; I love pink and I love pearls that’s why I’m wearing this. I like to create trends not follow them.”

Guests toured the labyrinth and surrounding forest before a seated dinner that included citrus-poached lobster and candy squash risotto while desserts of basil sorbet and chocolate-chai mousse were being served Devlin appeared at the center of the labyrinth to introduce the night’s surprise musical guest: Rosalia.

The Barcelona-born singer and songwriter who won a Grammy in 2020 for best Latin rock urban or alternative album shared her own Chanel memories in the middle of a four-song set. “My grandmother Lucretia she was obsessed with this perfume” she told the crowd. “She used to wear it all the time and let’s be honest it wasn’t a little. Every time she came to visit us we all knew Lucretia was there before we saw her because [the scent of Chanel] was all over the house.”

This final night of Art Basel Miami Beach ultimately capped a week of events hosted by the legendary French label starting with a drone show Wednesday evening Dec. 1 at Faena Beach. Also designed to celebrate the Chanel No. 5 anniversary the light show at that event included more than 500 drones creating a rendering of the No. 5 bottle that stretched more than 600 feet in the night sky.

On Thursday Dec. 2 the brand opened its first boutique in the Miami Design District with architect and interior designer Peter Marino present to sign copies of his just-released book The Architecture of Chanel (Phaidon Press $125) which chronicles his many collaborations with the house. “We’ve done more than 400 boutiques together but they’ve also given me 12 architectural commissions and that to me is meaningful” Marino explained to THR. “Twelve buildings for a brand with the same architect just doesn’t happen and I wanted to record it.”

How did he approach the look of the Design District boutique? “Chanel waited to be the last brand in the neighborhood so I created a white cube the same height and width on all sides and put all the drama on the inside” he said. “The design is the cleanest and the simplest of everything we see here and it’s the one people will relate to the most.” (Among Marino’s upcoming projects is the redesign of Chanel’s Rodeo Drive boutique expected for completion in 2022.)

From a white cube to a verdant forest the messages communicated by the brand via art and design throughout the week were wholly intentional. “Every generation that comes along we have a responsibility to explore our relationship with nature and our surroundings” Devlin said. “I work with Chanel because I know they take a similar view. I’ve been working with them since 2016 since the first time I met [house perfumer] Olivier Polge so I’ve experienced that dedication for several years. I feel really supported by them.”

The logo is red because of old tax laws

John Stith Pemberton who created Coke in 1886 had originally billed the soda as a ""temperance"" drink or an alternative to alcohol. And because alcohol was heavily taxed in the 19th century Coca-Cola wanted to make sure its (non-alcoholic) drink wasn't subject to those taxes.

""We began painting our barrels red so that tax agents could distinguish them from alcohol during transport"" a Coca-Cola spokesperson told Business Insider. The bright color is still an easy way for fans to recognize Coke cans and bottles today.

The iconic bottle design was created to help Coke stand out from its competitors

As Coca-Cola explains on its website there were plenty of imposter sodas trying to cash in on Coke's fame in the early 1900s. (Some of them had seriously funny names too like Koka-Nola and Toka-Cola.) So in 1915 the Trustees of the Coca-Cola Bottling Association asked glass bottling companies to design a ""bottle so distinct that you would recognize it by feel in the dark or lying broken on the ground.""

The winning company the Root Glass Company created the now-iconic green bottle. With the ridges on each bottle and the embossed Coca-Cola logo the design set the soda apart from its competitors. These days you're more likely to find Coke in a plastic bottle or a can but you can still find the glass bottles at some retailers.

Coke really did contain cocaine at one point

This isn't just a viral legend—The New York Times confirmed it in a 1996 article that included comments from a Coca-Cola spokesperson.

It all goes back to the coca plant which cocaine comes from the Times explained. While Coke contained actual cocaine in the late 19th century when it was first invented it now includes a ""non-narcotic extract"" derived from the coca plant.

""Ingredients from the coca leaf are used but there is no cocaine in it and it is all tightly overseen by regulatory authorities"" a Coca-Cola spokesperson told the Times in 1996. Still the paper confirmed that wasn't the case in Coke's earliest days.

As History.com points out though cocaine and other drugs weren't illegal until 1914. So while the idea of drinking it in soda seems pretty foreign now it wasn't as weird at the time.

While the term ""six-pack"" tends to conjure images of beer nowadays it was originally a way to buy and carry multiple bottles of Coke. According to the company's website Coca-Cola invented the six-pack in 1923.

The company helped popularize open-top coolers

If you've packed a tub of soda or beer in a cooler for a road trip or beach day you have Coca-Cola to thank. While metal buckets had been used to hold water for years Coca-Cola helped modernize the cooler.

According to a PDF from the company Coca-Cola debuted ""the first standardized open-top cooler"" in 1929. The rolling metal contraption held up to 72 Coke bottles promising to keep them cool.

Coca-Cola later hired industrial designer Raymond Loewy in the 1940s and he helped create a more portable version of the cooler. The designer even thought to put a bottle opener on the cooler making it easier to take the drink on the go.

Coca-Cola is at least partially responsible for Santa as you know him

When you picture Santa is he a plump bearded older man who's wearing red? You can thank Coca-Cola for that image at least in part. In 1931 the company hired Haddon Sundblom to paint images of Santa holding Coke bottles. According to Coca-Cola those pictures helped ""create the modern interpretation of St. Nick.""

The Coca-Cola recipe is kept in a secure vault

You can't see the recipe itself but you can see where it's kept. At the World of Coca-Cola museum in Atlanta you can visit The Vault of the Secret Formula exhibit where the recipe is held.

Before it (well the vault) was on display at the museum the recipe was in a vault in an Atlanta bank. Coca-Cola is quite literally keeping its signature formula under lock and key.

And in case you're curious here are 17 Things That Happen to Your Body When You Drink Soda.

Coke was the first product featured on a Time magazine cover

In 1950 Time featured a cover illustration that showed the Earth drinking from a Coke bottle. The artwork shows just how popular Coke had become. But according to the company the illustration wasn't what the magazine originally wanted.

""The magazine wants to have a photo of Robert Woodruff on the cover but he refuses stating that the product is the only important element in the company"" Coca-Cola explained in a PDF about its history. Woodruff's intuition seems to have paid off; the cover is definitely a memorable one.

The backlash to New Coke was swift

Stranger Things fans were excited to try New Coke when the company re-released it last summer in partnership with the '80s-set Netflix series. But when New Coke hit the scene in 1985 consumers weren't happy with the new soda formula. In fact it had only been on sale for 79 days before the company brought back ""Coca-Cola Classic"" to appease fans.

The Coca-Cola bears have only been around since the '90s

It's hard to think of Coke without its holiday advertising and special-edition polar bear cans. But the bears didn't become synonymous with the brand until 1993 when the Coca-Cola Company released its ""Northern Lights"" commercial. The polar bears have been a part of Coke's holiday campaigns ever since.

Coke was the first soda in space

In 1985 astronauts drank Coke on the Challenger space shuttle. That marked the first soft drink consumption in space according to the company.

(One thing you won't find on astronauts' missions though is astronaut ice cream. It's never been in space in part because its crumbs could pose safety risks.)

The Coca-Cola Company once thought the soda could replace your morning coffee

In the late 1980s the company's ""Coke in the Morning"" campaign urged people to replace their morning coffee with a Coke The New York Times reported in 1988.

And while drinking soda might sound weird it was more common at the time than you might expect. Citing figures from the Coca-Cola Company the Times reported that 12% of soft drink sales included ""morning consumption."" The ad campaign may not have led coffee fans to give up their morning java entirely but it did put a new spin on drinking soda.

A pharmacist invented Coke—and it was advertised as having medical properties

John Stith Pemberton a pharmacist in Atlanta created Coke in 1886 as we mentioned above. But the earliest ads for the soda suggested that it had medical benefits for consumers too. One early print advertisement bills the soda as ""a cure for all nervous affections"" including hysteria. Yeah that's probably not something modern doctors would agree with.

The original Coke bottle got its shape from a cocoa bean—but there's no cocoa in the soda

Remember how Coca-Cola created its unique bottle to stand out from the competition? Well the earlier bottle designs might have led to a lot of confusion. As the company explains its designers were inspired by ""an illustration of a cocoa bean"" with the ridges and round shape. But at the time Coke was made with trace ingredients from the coca plant not the cocoa plant. Whether or not it was actually a mistake it's still pretty funny.

A Coke employee once got a prison sentence for trying to sell secrets to Pepsi

This might sound like something that's straight out of a TV drama but it really happened. In 2007 former Coca-Cola secretary Joya Williams received an eight-year prison sentence for trying to sell company secrets to rival soda maker Pepsi.

Williams allegedly tried to send ""confidential documents and samples of products"" from Coke to Pepsi The Associated Press reported at the time.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

As AP reported Pepsi went to the FBI rather than accepting the trade secrets. An undercover investigation led to charges for Williams and two co-defendants.

There was once White Coke for a very specific reason

As the story goes Russian general Georgy Zhukov who fought in World War I and World War II had a weakness for Coke. Not wanting his fellow Russians to see him drinking American Coke he personally asked the company for a discreet version Atlas Obscura explained. Coca-Cola went along with the plan creating a ""White Coke"" in clear bottles for Zhukov to enjoy.

Mexico is the world's top consumer of Coke products

A 2013 PDF on the Coca-Cola Company's website puts Mexico at the front of its consumption numbers. The average person in Mexico drinks 745 servings of Coke a year according to the chart; in the United States that number is 401. That includes all Coca-Cola Company products not just soda but it's still a huge figure.

Coca-Cola invented coupons

You may have heard that the first Coke servings were given away for free but did you know there was a science behind it? As Wired reported Coke became popular in the late 19th century in part thanks to ""tickets"" that could be redeemed for free servings. They weren't much different from the coupons shoppers use today.

Coca-Cola once tried its hand at ""drinkable advertising""

In 2015 Coca-Cola created ads that allowed viewers to use music service Shazam to get free Coke Zeros at local retailers.

The same year Coca-Cola also created a Coke Zero billboard at the NCAA Final Four event in Indianapolis. The ""Taste It"" sign featured a tube of Coke Zero that fans could sample right from the billboard. That's one way to introduce people to your product.

Coca-Cola's holiday cans have hidden images on them

Sure you know Coca-Cola's adorable polar bears. But the company actually likes hiding other images within the cute illustrations. Look at this 2017 Coca-Cola holiday can for instance. The bears' noses feature white Coke bottles and their eyes are shaped like upside-down bottle caps.

Coca-Cola's typography is trademarked

You won't see other logos with the Coca-Cola font and that's not an accident. In 1893 the company registered the trademark for ""Spencerian script"" with the U.S. Patent Office.

Coca-Cola is one of the Olympics' longest-running sponsors

Coca-Cola has sponsored the Olympic Games since 1928. Sure Coke isn't the most hydrating option for athletes during a workout but fans and Olympians alike have been enjoying Coke for decades thanks to this partnership.

Coke can be used as a makeshift bug repellent

No we don't mean that you should douse yourself in soda before going outside. But bugs are attracted to sugar and you can use that to your advantage. Setting out a Coke (or any other sweet drink) at a healthy distance away from where you're eating could draw the bugs toward the soda and away from you.

People swear by using Coke in recipes too

Cola chicken is a popular dish as is Coca-Cola cake. It's essentially a fudgy chocolate cake but with the sweet taste of Coke added to the mixture.

Fanta came way before Diet Coke

You might assume that when Coca-Cola started branching out into other drinks Diet Coke would have been a natural fit. But Fanta Orange was introduced in Italy in 1955 and in the United States in 1960 the company notes on its website. Even Sprite hit the soda scene pretty early in the game making its debut in 1961. Diet Coke meanwhile was introduced in 1982.

Another thing that came before Diet Coke? The company's acquisition of Minute Maid which happened in 1960.

Diet Coke wasn't the company's first diet soda

Yes there were decades between Fanta's release and Diet Coke's. But the Coca-Cola Company actually entered the diet soda game in 1963. Tab which was advertised as having ""just one calorie"" was launched that year. When Diet Coke was launched the company used a similar ""only one calorie"" phrasing to sell the new product.

Coca-Cola once ran a seriously gross giveaway promotion

Coke's ""MagiCans"" weren't so magic at all. It's hard to explain this 1990 promotion because it's just so odd but essentially Coke was selling cans that weren't actually filled with soda.

The Coca-Cola Company wanted to run a promotion where certain cans held cash or coupons instead of Coke. But it also wanted to discourage users from lifting them and determining that the lighter cans would contain prizes. So instead of filling the cans with Coke they filled them with water that was combined with ""chlorine and foul-smelling ammonium sulfate"" The New York Times reported.

The ""foul smell"" was supposed to stop people from drinking them but some of course did anyway. Lesson learned: Don't put something in a drink container if you don't want people to drink it.

North Korea is one of the only places where you can't buy or sell Coke (at least officially)

In 2017 the Associated Press reported that Cuba and North Korea are the only countries in which Coca-Cola ""doesn't officially operate."" Still the outlet pointed out that there are plenty of Coke knockoffs for sale in North Korea. And imported Coke from China makes its way into ""upscale grocery stores"" in parts of the country AP noted. Where there's a will there's a way.

The St. John the Baptist church in Mexico uses Coke in religious services

Colloquially known as the ""Coca-Cola Church"" St. John the Baptist uses Coke during religious ceremonies. (Really!) Business Insider reported that the church's followers think burping ""purges evil from the soul."" And what better way to induce burps than by drinking soda?

Some people swear by drinking ""milk Coke""

Sure you've heard of a Coke float but milk Coke? If this Twitter thread is any indication it's a real thing. If you're looking for a creamier way to enjoy the classic soda this could be worth a try.

Now that you know so many delicious facts about Coca-Cola why not sit back and enjoy a glass of the sweet stuff? It's maintained its popularity for a reason and the history behind the drink just makes it that much better.

Mainland authorities’ issuance of an arrest warrant for Chau has also landed the Macau government in a dilemma over whether to transfer the city’s permanent resident across the border in the absence of an extradition agreement with the mainland.

The message was plain – behave and do not cross the line by engaging in grey-area or criminally risky activities such as luring mainland Chinese punters into betting illegally online as these would no longer be tolerated by Beijing which has issued a number of anti-gambling edicts in recent years.

The weekend arrest of Alvin Chau Cheuk-wa the head of Macau’s biggest casino junket operator over alleged links to illegal cross-border gambling is a shot across the bow to the city’s gambling industry including its American casino operators according to analysts.

Without naming him in full police said a 47-year-old Macau businessman surnamed Chau was among the arrested. They called Chau the head of the syndicate.

Nicknamed “Wash Rice Wa” a moniker borrowed from a 1980s Cantonese sitcom character with his surname and good looks Chau is now in pre-trial detention to prevent him from fleeing the casino hub. Netizens meanwhile were gleeful in realising the irony that “wash rice” is also Cantonese slang for money laundering.

As Suncity’s shares plunged 50 per cent last week pulling down all of the city’s casino stocks Macau’s Gaming Supervision and Coordination Bureau said on Wednesday it had been notified by gaming enterprises that they had stopped working with the conglomerate and had temporarily closed its VIP gaming rooms.

The CEO of gaming and hospitality investor Suncity Group Chau was first questioned by Macau police on Saturday after the public security department in Wenzhou Zhejiang province a day earlier issued an arrest warrant over his suspected involvement in running illegal cross-border gambling activities.

Suncity Group is the largest junket operator in Macau with a market share of 40 per cent according to an industry insider. Junket operators are go-betweens who bring high rollers on all-expenses-paid trips to play at casinos extending them credit and collecting on their debts.

Ben Lee managing partner of the gambling consultancy IGamiX in Macau noted the central role played by Suncity in the casino hub. “The revenue Suncity generated was larger than some of the casino operators. No property would be viewed as a serious destination if it did not receive the imprimatur of having a Suncity VIP room in it” Lee said.

Chau grew Suncity from operating high-roller tables in Macau casinos into a sprawling conglomerate in less than two decades with thousands of employees and interests ranging from property development to travel agencies and resorts.

He recently made it into seventh place on a list of the 50 most powerful people in Asian gaming compiled by media group Inside Asian Gaming.

Eilo Yu Wing-Yat a political scientist at the University of Macau believed that Macau police’s high-profile actions were in response to Wenzhou authorities’ issuance of the arrest warrant for Chau.

“Chau’s arrest and Wenzhou authorities’ actions presented strong signals that Beijing no longer tolerates the activities of Macau’s casino junket operators targeting mainlanders including the luring of mainland punters into betting illegally online” Yu said. “Obviously Chau is not the only target.”

Lee said despite Beijing’s ongoing crackdown on gambling Chau’s arrest shocked the gaming industry as the junket business pioneered by the late Macau casino mogul Stanley Ho Hung-sun was not only vital to the industry but had long been tolerated by the mainland.

“Currently junket operators are licensed for such activities in Macau” he said. “The conduct of the activities outside Macau falls into a grey area and until now China has tolerated these.”

Lee expected the junket business – estimated to make up about half of gaming revenues before the pandemic – would shrink in the wake of the arrest accelerating the decline which began in the past two years as Macau’s gambling industry was haunted by the mainland’s crackdown on gambling.

In 2020 for example the central government introduced legislation banning marketing to attract mainland gamblers who formed the bulk of high rollers or ‘whales’ as they are known in the business.

“Beijing had issued a number of anti-gambling edicts in the past few years. They also started taking action against underground money channels” Lee said.

He added that Beijing’s tough stance was long in the making as it had “sent numerous warnings since 2012 with the advent of the anti-corruption as well as anti-ostentation campaigns [along with] strong suggestions that our gaming industry should not grow faster than China’s own GDP [gross domestic product]”.

But these warnings he said had been repeatedly ignored. Lee noted that junket business once accounted for more than 60 per cent of Macau’s gross gambling revenue but this plunged to just 30 per cent recently.

He said the arrest was a signal to Macau that “it is no longer business as usual”.

“From now on you cannot and should not focus on mainland China as a key gaming market. And you really need to diversify your industry. Macau should also diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on gambling” he said.

Macau’s gambling industry contributes 80 per cent to the city’s tax coffers every year.

In July last year when rumours surfaced he was the target of investigations Chau released a video denying all illicit activity as he declared that his company had “never sent anyone to promote gambling on the mainland and never participated in any underground money-laundering business”.

A mainland official said according to investigations Chau’s statement was “not true” at all. “There is clear evidence showing Chau has an extensive gambling network in mainland China. As for the other allegations there’s no smoke without fire” the source said.

A Macau official source familiar with the situation said Chau had lost support from the mighty Ho family after the death of its Hong Kong-born patriarch at age 98 last year.

“His operation faced a big cash crunch after Beijing imposed travel restrictions to Macau since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic ” the mainland insider added.

The Macau government liberalised the gaming market in 2002 breaking the monopoly of SJM Holdings owned by Stanley Ho who was dubbed the “King of Gambling”.

Authorities in the casino hub went on to give three American operators Sands China Wynn Macau and MGM China (a joint venture with Stanley Ho’s daughter Pansy Ho Chiu-king) the casino concessions changing the industry dramatically.

Gambling revenue in Macau now surpasses that of Las Vegas making the city the world’s biggest casino hub.

All the concessions along with those of three Macau and Hong Kong operators will expire in June next year and the local government has already said it is “actively working” on terms for a new licensing system for the casinos.

The six licences that require renewals are Sands China Wynn Macau Galaxy Entertainment SJM Holdings Melco Entertainment and MGM China.

The American casino operators have helped modernise Macau’s gambling industry but with no signs of tensions between the United States and China abating whether and how the friction between the world’s two biggest economies would affect American casino licences in Macau has emerged as a US$1 billion question.

Macau academic Eilo Yu pointed to a recent ruling by the city’s top court under which casino operators could be liable for any debts left by defunct junkets as another worrying sign for American casino operators.

The court ordered Dore Entertainment Limited on November 19 to return HK$6 million plus interest to one of its VIP room clients. According to a statement issued five days later the top court ruled that Wynn Resorts (Macau) needed to share responsibility for the case by helping Dore return the money to the client.

Yu said there had been some grey areas in the city’s gambling industry where intermediaries did some business for casino operators. “From now on casino operators can no longer hide behind junket operators for dubious gambling activities” he said.

In September the Macau government solicited public opinion about overhauling the city’s gambling laws with the proposed revisions signalling heightened scrutiny of capital flows and daily operations.

The consultation which has ended sought views on a raft of rules including additional government oversight permission requirements for the remittances of dividends and a proposal to slash the number of gambling tables.

The proposal also suggests casinos increase the shareholdings held by Macau permanent residents. In sum the net effect of the changes would make it much more difficult for foreign operators to send profits back to their home countries.

The amendments are expected to come into effect before Macau’s six casino concessions expire in June 2022 even as city leader Ho Iat-seng had floated the idea of a temporary extension of the licences if the laws were not passed in time.

The gambling crackdown came even as the industry in Macau was reeling from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and while revenue had picked up this year it was still less than a third of previous years’ highs.

Gambling which is banned on the mainland because it is anathema to Communist Party doctrine has been legal in Macau since 1850 when the city was under Portuguese colonial administration. When it reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1999 the gambling operations and the concessions were maintained.

Chinese President Xi Jinping made Macau’s casinos a target of his anti-corruption campaign in 2012 banning party cadres and government officials from gambling.

The arrest warrant for Alvin Chau that Wenzhou police issued two days ahead of his arrest in Macau has sparked suspicion from certain quarters in the special administrative region on whether its police were taking orders from mainland authorities.

Macau judiciary police spokesman Chong Kam-leong maintained the arrests were unrelated to the mainland warrant.

Prosecutors in Wenzhou have accused Chau of being in charge of a gambling syndicate that “causes severe damage to the social order of the country”. Chau and a person named Zhang Ningning is also suspected on the mainland of setting up casinos there.

The syndicate is alleged to comprise 199 shareholder-level representatives and over 12000 agents tasked with promoting gambling and it is said to have developed a network of more than 80000 mainland bettors according to the Wenzhou authorities.

Announcing the issuance of the arrest warrant for Chau on its Weibo account Wenzhou’s public security department said it had been investigating the allegations since July last year and urged him to “surrender as soon as possible” to secure a lenient punishment.

Chong said Macau police had launched their probe after receiving intelligence indicating that Chau was using his VIP junket business to establish gaming operations elsewhere and was trying to entice mainlanders into online gambling. Funds from those operations were then transferred through underground channels Chong said.

Suncity had been in the cross hairs of the authorities for some time. In 2019 Suncity was singled out for criticism by mainland state media which said online gambling could harm China’s social-economic order. Chau shrugged off the accusations at the time.

Jason Buhi a constitutional law scholar who has written extensively on Macau said it was not yet clear why the mainland authorities chose to act at this particular juncture.

“One could speculate that prosecutorial discretion may be partially influenced by a policy decision to enhance supervision of Macau’s lucrative gambling junkets during a period when gambling revenues and cross-border intercourse are already low due to the pandemic or by Chau’s crossing the wrong person(s) at the wrong time” he said.

Buhi said there had been ad hoc transfers of fugitives from Macau to the mainland despite a ruling by the city’s Court of Final Appeal in 2007 that local authorities could not transfer criminal suspects across the border in the absence of a formal extradition agreement.

In 2008 Macau authorities handed over to the mainland a Hong Kong permanent resident who was detained upon arrival at the Macau ferry terminal for crimes allegedly committed on the mainland and for which Interpol “red notices” had been issued.

Buhi who teaches at Barry University’s school of law in Florida said in 2015 the Macau authorities handed Wu Quansen – former party secretary of Dadun village in Guangzhou – over to Guangdong police.

Wu had been granted non-permanent residence status in Macau but was returned to face corruption charges after his permit expired in 2017.

Buhi said it was possible that the Macau government would transfer Alvin Chau to the mainland in the absence of an extradition agreement. “But there is a wild card” the academic said adding that none of the people handed over to the mainland previously were Macau permanent residents.

Although this case may be the impetus for a new extradition law it is more likely that an ad hoc arrangement will be reached. Such a move would avoid retroactive application and has been the local practice for centuries.

Buhi author of The Constitutional History of Macau said another possible scenario was that Chau faced trial and punishment in Macau.

“That would be a symbolic boost to the SAR’s autonomy and perceived rule of law. However it is also possible that the mainland authorities will insist upon a handover for either the symbolic status of venue or to circumvent the limited punishments available under Macau’s inherited legal system” the law scholar said.

A Macau-based lawyer who declined to be named said the arrest took place at an important moment when the local government was expected to introduce “new rules for junkets and the new casino concessions are also coming up”.

“I think they want to clean up the casino industry – or at least to do as much as possible. They want to put things in order” he said noting this was consistent with the mainland authorities’ focus on “combating corruption and illicit money transfers”.

He said he expected Chau’s case to be dealt with by the authorities in Macau given the lack of the extradition agreement with the mainland.

I think that is what the authorities want … The evolution is diversification which is also being facilitated by Hengqin Glenn McCartney University of Macau

While analysts pointed to Chau’s arrest as the beginning of the end of the once-thriving junket business an academic suggested the reinvention of Macau’s economy was what Beijing was after.

Glenn McCartney associate dean of the University of Macau’s faculty of business administration said the concept of integrated resorts and entertainment was the future of the Cotai strip – a stretch of reclaimed land where most gambling developments are located.

“I think that is what the authorities want … The evolution is diversification which is also being facilitated by Hengqin” McCartney said referring to a neighbouring Chinese island that has been transformed into a new tourism haven.



“I do see Macau stepping up” the professor said. “The diversification won’t happen as quickly because of Covid-19. In order to reactivate and bring back concerts and theatres will take some time. But I am optimistic.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Twin Cities campus cut its greenhouse gas emissions 51% from 2008 levels last year a year earlier than its goal of a 50% reduction by 2021. That puts the campus at No. 2 in the Big Ten for carbon cuts according to Boston-based Second Nature a nonprofit that works with colleges and universities on climate action and tracks their progress. University of Maryland at College Park ranks No. 1.

""I think for northern climate large research-intensive universities it's a significant achievement"" said Second Nature senior manager Steve Muzzy.

About 76 of the 450 campuses that Second Nature works with in the U.S. have hit their reduction goals for planet-warming emissions Muzzy said.

The U's results are better than those of the state of Minnesota which has missed long-standing legislated targets by a wide margin and is scrambling for strategies to catch up.

The U posted the milestone on its website last month. In September after years of pressure from students the U disclosed that it plans to withdraw its investments from fossil fuel-related companies in five to seven years.

Shane Stennes the U's director of sustainability said the Twin Cities campus — the largest campus of the state's flagship school — wants to be an example and resource for other schools institutions and businesses for taking concrete measures to cut planet-warming emissions. ""Aggressive climate action is really needed"" he said.

""The schools of the Big Ten are really taking this seriously"" Stennes said.

Most of the U's emissions drop came from the low hanging fruit in carbon reduction: energy efficiency and electricity generation. The single largest contributor was transforming the former Old Main Heating Plant on the East Bank into a much more efficient facility that generates both electricity and steam used to heat and cool buildings. That move got the U closer to the goal line slashing the campus carbon footprint by about 10% Stennes said.

COVID had little effect on results he said because the time period measured ended June 30 2020 and included only three months of the pandemic slowdown.

The rest of the emissions cuts came from an assortment of strategies mainly increasing energy efficiency in new and existing buildings and buying and generating electricity from renewable sources. Crews retrofitted older buildings upgrading to LED lighting and automating building systems to improve performance.

""The HVAC system is by far the biggest user of energy"" Stennes said.

Additional reductions came from the campus participating in community solar gardens and installing solar arrays including one over the parking lot at the U's law school now generating two megawatts of electricity. The effort also benefited from Xcel Energy's power getting cleaner as the utility generates more of its electricity from renewable sources.

This spring a sustainability committee will start crafting a new climate action plan for the U's Twin Cities campus with strategies to drive emissions to net zero by 2050 an enormous challenge.

""The next 50% is harder than the first"" Stennes said.

The next phase will focus more heavily on emissions from transportation — student and employee commutes as well as university-sponsored air travel — and finding ways to heat campus buildings without natural gas or other fossil fuels.

There are myriad opportunities. Take freezers. The campus has many ultra-low temperature freezers for biological samples and reagents used for medical and research purposes he said. Some keep samples at a chilly minus 80 degrees Celsius.

""Every time we plug one of those in it's like adding a house"" Stennes said.

Madeline Miller a senior at the U and environmental accountability committee director for the Minnesota Student Association said she's frustrated by the slow pace of change given the magnitude of the climate crisis and damage being wrought.

""It's something we should have been taking a lot more aggressive action on way earlier"" Miller said. ""Climate change is happening right now.""

""Once we hit 2030 or 2050 … what state is the world going to be in at that point? It's getting to the point where going carbon neutral is only going to do so much. We need to be going carbon negative.""

Jessica Hellmann director of the U's Institute on the Environment agreed there's no time for laurels. But the milestone is noteworthy she said because the university is demonstrating concrete actions and measurements that could help other institutions.

""These are actual tons of carbon"" she said.

Mark Muro senior fellow at the Brookings Institution said the university is doing exactly what cities states and other entities need to be doing: setting clear goals developing strategies to shrink emissions and take inventories of them — getting on the scale to see if the diet is working.

A report out last year by Brookings looked at the 100 largest U.S. cities and found that less than half have set greenhouse reduction goals. Of those that had 12 met the targets with two-thirds lagging. On average the cities had reduced their emissions just 10% from their baselines.

""We have a proliferation of commitments gestures pledges and exciting announcements about emissions reductions"" Muro said. ""And what we don't have is rigorous follow-through.""

Minneapolis hit its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2025 five years early in 2020. However the city's sustainability director called that a ""pandemic-influenced anomaly"" and said energy use forecasts indicate the city won't meet its goal of an 80% reduction by 2050.

About 25 cities around Minnesota have set community-wide greenhouse gas reduction goals according to Kristin Mroz GreenStep Cities coordinator with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The voluntary program a public-private partnership works with cities on climate goals but can't say how many are hitting targets because it doesn't collect that information.

Muro said universities resemble mini-cities albeit ones that are centrally controlled have a good deal of money and resources and don't have to deal as frequently with leadership changes.

But not always.

Tuesday when the Wild was tied 1-1 with the Coyotes after one period at Xcel Energy Center the staff left the players alone. They responded by taking control of the game in the second period scoring three goals en route to a commanding 5-2 win.

""A couple guys our leaders stepped up and we addressed what we had to do"" center Ryan Hartman said. ""We know. It felt like we were down [in the game]. We addressed it as a group and I think that shows a lot of the character of our team.""

The players-only heart-to-heart also showed the leadership style of coach Dean Evason and his colleagues a guidance that allows multiple voices to be heard.

""We can bark until we're blue in the face about doing the right things"" Evason said. ""But if somebody in that dressing room one of their peers stands up and says it it means a lot more.""

It's not only players who speak up. Assistant coaches have also had the microphone and the coaches decide who meets with the players and when.

""As a coaching staff you always try to find different ways"" Evason said.

When no one has a conference with the players between periods it isn't always because the team is playing poorly. Sometimes the coaching staff has the players talk among themselves when they're doing well.

""The coach is important but the players are the most important people right?"" said Evason who finished second in Jack Adams Awards voting last season for the NHL's Coach of the Year honors. ""We're all support staff just trying to get them on the ice to play to their best abilities. I hope we all don't forget when we were players and we understand that it's the players that the people come to watch.

""It's just something that we've always done as a staff here and it's worked out.""

Injury update

Evason said he anticipates captain Jared Spurgeon to accompany the team on its coming four-game road trip that starts Tuesday at Edmonton before stops in San Jose Los Angeles and Vegas.

Spurgeon missed a seventh straight game on Saturday with a lower-body injury.

""He hasn't had a true real practice with us yet so that's the next step"" Evason said.

On Friday the Wild sent defenseman Calen Addison back to Iowa in the American Hockey League and recalled defenseman Kevin Czuczman. But the team didn't make any changes to its forward group and defense against the Maple Leafs.

The only change came in net with goalie Cam Talbot starting — his first appearance since Nov. 28. Backup Kaapo Kahkonen started the previous two games winning both.

The Wild is still without forward Frederick Gaudreau (COVID protocols).

As for Toronto it was missing one of its top producers in winger Mitch Marner; he didn't play after colliding with teammate Jake Muzzin at practice on Friday.

World Junior invites

Wild prospects and defensemen Daemon Hunt Carson Lambos and Ryan O'Rourke have been invited to Canada's selection camp ahead of the 2022 World Junior Championship which begins Dec. 26 in Alberta.

The selection camp starts Thursday in Calgary.",,,

Photo supplied

The prevalence of daily fast food consumption and incremental demand for the convenient meals has emerged as a major incontrovertible trend in the modernisation of living conditions in the Kingdom.

The Cambodian pizza market has seen explosive growth in recent years generating no less than $100 million in revenue in 2019 and forecast to grow 15-20 per cent each year according to projections made by local food chain corporation United Food Group Co Ltd (UFG) the operator of the US-based Pizza Hut franchise in Cambodia.

All the while new franchises are entering the market as existing chains roll out expansions. The first branch of Pizza Hut opened in August to much fanfare in the capital’s Tuol Tompoung I commune.

UFG has its work cut out for it to contend with the increasing strength of profitable competitors notably the Bangkok-based The Pizza Company a major player whose founding company Minor Group had been Thailand’s Pizza Hut franchisee from 1980-2000.

The Post business editor May Kunmakara sat down with UFG group CEO Heng Sengly to discuss the journey of bringing the brand to the Kingdom and the company’s strategies to acquire a bigger slice of the Cambodian pizza market.

How did the ball get rolling in the first place for Pizza Hut’s foray into the Kingdom?

The story began in 2020 when an advisory firm in Cambodia approached us showing intent to bring Pizza Hut into the Kingdom. At the time Yum! Brands Inc Pizza Hut’s parent company was looking to expand the brand in the Asia-Pacific and the advisory firm had been in charge of finding a potential partner for the venture.

We joined in the bidding with several other candidates most of which were subsidiary firms of Cambodian conglomerates – one was a company from a nearby country. After a lengthy process we were honoured and proud to be chosen as the operator of the world-class Pizza Hut in Cambodia.

And why was UFG chosen over competing bids?

We were chosen because we’d clearly know how to make the brand successful in Cambodia. We have two decadesof experience in food and beverages and this is proof that we have the credentials to ensure the smooth operation of Pizza Hut in the Kingdom.

UFG is the owner of the leading Cambodian restaurant chain Park Cafe – which runs 20 stores in the Kingdom – and is majority owned by V-Trust Group with Singapore-based EMIA Investments Cambodia.

That being said with enough capital resources expertise and a clear vision we were a trusted candidate and we commit to making Pizza Hut the pizza brand of choice among the Cambodian youth who prefer a modern lifestyle.

Where do you see Pizza Hut Cambodia in the next few years?

Although pizza is Western food eating it in Cambodia is very common especially among young people. UFG’s projections in 2019 suggested that the pizza market would generate at least $100 million in revenue in the Kingdom that year with an annual growth rate of between 15 and 20 per cent.

We believe that Pizza Hut will be able to obtain a larger slice of the Cambodian pizza market and we plan to open as many stores over the next three years as existing chains have in 15.

We aim to promote modern pizza eating culture in Cambodia with the good quality of the original pizza brand.

How does Pizza Hut stack up against its industry peers?

Pizza is neither Cambodian nor ASEAN food but a western meal. Pizza Hut is originally from the US although there are many existing pizza brands from the ASEAN bloc.

Unlike its peers Pizza Hut Cambodia has the superior advantage of best-practice sharing across the globe which enables us to innovate new products deliver world-class food safety and apply the best concept-store designs.

Pizza Hut has 18703 restaurants in over 110 countries worldwide. You can imagine that if one new product were to be developed annually in each country we’d have at least 110 new services and products that could enhance customers’ satisfaction.

We were the first brand to roll out “cheese bites” and “pan pizza” and we’ll keep introducing new products new tastes new looks so our customers will experience world-class quality products that they’d never be able to taste at other chains.

In term of food safety we source vegetables with Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) certificates and only use water that is filtered and has been tested by the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge.

What does the brand’s debut mean for the market landscape?

For many pizza lovers the arrival of Pizza Hut to Cambodia will provide a better choice but it will also be a wake-up call for the competition to beware the legacy of the new brand.

Want it or not our rivals will have to improve their services and quality to hold on to their slices of the market because they wouldn’t want to be forced to accept thinner portions.

Hence the benefits will go to end-users.

Again the original taste of world-class pizza has arrived and it may very well be a nightmare for existing players.

The metaverse the digital world's Next Big Thing is touted as the internet domain where animated avatars of our physical selves will be able to virtually do all sorts of interactivities from shopping to gaming to traveling — someday. Wonks say it could be a decade or longer before the necessary technologies catch up with the hype. Right now though the health-care industry is utilizing some of the essential components that will ultimately comprise the metaverse — virtual reality (VR) augmented reality (AR) mixed reality (MR) and artificial intelligence (AI) — as well as the software and hardware to power their applications. For example medical device companies are using MR to assemble surgical tools and design operating rooms the World Health Organization (WHO) is using AR and smartphones to train Covid-19 responders psychiatrists are using VR to treat post-traumatic stress (PTS) among combat soldiers and medical schools are using VR for surgical training.

Facebook Oculus and Covid

Since Facebook — now Meta Platforms — acquired Oculus and its VR headset technology in 2014 for $2 billion numerous health-care applications have been developed. One of the latest was a collaboration with Facebook Reality Labs and Nexus Studios and the WHO Academy. The organization's R&D incubator designed a mobile learning app for health workers battling Covid-19 worldwide. One of the training courses involves AR to simulate on a smartphone the proper techniques and sequence to put on and remove person protective equipment. With content available in seven languages the app is built around the needs expressed by 22000 global health workers surveyed by the WHO last year. Oculus technology is used at UConn Health the University of Connecticut's medical center in Farmington Connecticut to train orthopedic surgery residents. Educators have teamed with PrecisionOS a Canadian medical software company that offers VR training and educational modules in orthopedics. Donning Oculus Quest headsets the residents can visualize in 3-D performing a range of surgical procedures such as putting a pin in a broken bone. Because the procedure is performed virtually the system allows the students to make mistakes and receive feedback from faculty to incorporate on their next try. Meanwhile as the metaverse remains under construction ""we see great opportunity to continue the work Meta already does in supporting health efforts"" a Meta spokesperson said. ""As Meta's experiences apps and services evolve you can expect health strategy to play a role but it's far too soon to say how that might intersect with third-party technologies and providers.""

When Microsoft introduced its HoloLens AR smart glasses in 2016 for commercial development early adopters included Stryker  the medical technology company in Kalamazoo Michigan. In 2017 it began harnessing the AR device to improve processes for designing operating rooms for hospitals and surgery centers. Because ORs are shared by different surgical services — from general surgery to orthopedic cardiac and others — lighting equipment and surgical tools vary depending on the procedure. Recognizing the opportunity the HoloLens 2 provided in evolving OR design from 2D to 3D Stryker engineers are able to design shared ORs with the use of holograms. The MR experience visualizes all of the people equipment and setups without requiring physical objects or people to be present. Zimmer Biomet a Warsaw Indiana-based medical device company recently unveiled its OptiVu Mixed Reality Solutions platform which employs HoloLens devices and three applications — one using MR in manufacturing surgical tools another that collects and stores data to track patient progress before and after surgery and a third that allows clinicians to share a MR experience with patients ahead of a procedure. ""We are currently using the HoloLens in a pilot fashion with remote assist in the U.S. EMEA and Australia"" a Zimmer Biomet spokesperson said. The technology has been used for remote case coverage and training programs and the company is developing software applications on the HoloLens as part of data solutions focused on pre- and post-procedures the spokesperson said.

Microsoft's holographic vision of the future

In March Microsoft showcased Mesh a MR platform powered by its Azure cloud service which allows people in different physical locations to join 3-D holographic experiences on various devices including HoloLens 2 a range of VR headsets smartphones tablets and PCs. In a blog post the company imagined avatars of medical students learning about human anatomy gathered around a holographic model and peeling back muscles to see what's underneath. Microsoft sees many opportunities for its MR tech and in March secured a $20 billion contract with the U.S. military for its use with soldiers.

In real-world applications of AR medical technology Johns Hopkins neurosurgeons performed the institution's first-ever AR surgeries on living patients in June. During the initial procedure physicians placed six screws in a patient's spine during a spinal fusion. Two days later a separate team of surgeons removed a cancerous tumor from the spine of a patient. Both teams donned headsets made by Augmedics an Israeli firm equipped with a see-through eye display that projects images of a patient's internal anatomy such as bones and other tissue based on CT scans. ""It's like having a GPS navigator in front of your eyes"" said Timothy Witham M.D. director of the Johns Hopkins Neurosurgery Spinal Fusion Laboratory. At the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine instructors at the Gordon Center for Simulation and Innovation in Medical Education utilize AR VR and MR to train emergency first-responders to treat trauma patients including those who have had a stroke heart attack or gunshot wound. Students practice life-saving cardiac procedures on Harvey a life-like mannequin that realistically simulates nearly any cardiac disease. Wearing VR headsets students can ""see"" the underlying anatomy which is graphically exposed on Harvey. ""In the digital environment we're not bound by physical objects"" said Barry Issenberg MD Professor of Medicine and director of the Gordon Center. Before developing the virtual technology curriculum he said students had to physically be on the scene and train on actual trauma patients. ""Now we can guarantee that all learners have the same virtual experience regardless of their geographic location."" Since it was founded in 1999 the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) has developed VR AI and other technologies to address a variety of medical and mental health conditions. ""When I first got involved the technology was Stone Age"" said Albert ""Skip"" Rizzo a psychologist and director for medical virtual reality at ICT recalling his tinkering with an Apple IIe and a Game Boy handheld console. Today he uses VR and AR headsets from Oculus HP and Magic Leap. Rizzo has helped create a VR exposure therapy called Bravemind aimed at providing relief from PTS particularly among veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. During exposure therapy a patient guided by a trained therapist confronts his or her trauma memories through simulations of their experiences. Wearing a headset the patient can be immersed in several different virtual scenarios including a Middle-Eastern themed city and desert road environments. ""Patients use a keyboard to simulate people insurgents explosions even smells and vibrations"" Rizzo said. And rather than relying exclusively on imagining a particular scenario a patient can experience it in a safe virtual world as an alternative to traditional talk therapy. The evidence-based Bravemind therapy is now available at more than a dozen Veterans Administration hospitals where it has been shown to produce a meaningful reduction in PTS symptoms. Additional randomized controlled studies are ongoing. As Big Tech continues to build out the metaverse alongside software and hardware companies academia and other R&D partners the health-care industry remains a real-life proving ground. ""While the metaverse is still in its infancy it holds tremendous potential for the transformation and improvement of health care"" wrote Paulo Pinheiro head of software at Cambridge U.K.-based Sagentia Innovation on the advisory firm's website. ""It will be fascinating to watch the situation unfold.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
