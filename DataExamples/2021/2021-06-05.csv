Last month I imported my X and 3 into BC. In California I had 70% tint applied to the front windows both sides (that is legal there). When I had the required provincial inspection done on my cars prior to registering them I was told the tint had to be removed because in BC no tinting is allowed and the cars could not pass inspection with the tint in place. So the tint was removed.I miss the UV and IR protection that a tint provides (obviously Vancouver is not as sunny as California but there are still plenty of sunny warm days here in summertime). 3M makes a Crystalline Series CR90 tint with 90%VLT which is barely noticeable visually. See https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b00016683/ . Now that my cars are registered I’m considering having it installed and taking my chances. Anyone in BC used that tint?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vaGlwaG9wZHguY29tL25ld3MvaWQuNjI1MTEvdGl0bGUuNTAtY2VudC1zdXNwZWN0cy1hcnJlc3RlZC1pbi0zbS1idXJnbGFyedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,50 Cent Burglary Suspects Arrested,"Bergen County NJ -

Police have reportedly arrested the men they believe are responsible for stealing $3 million worth of cash and jewelry from one of 50 Cent’s businesses.

According to TMZ Bergen County New Jersey prosecutors say a resident of the apartment building where the theft occurred reported the heist in January shortly after the Cliffside Park Police Department recovered a stolen vehicle in the area.

Officers reviewed surveillance footage and were able to connect the stolen vehicle to the burglary. After a 5-month investigation they finally tracked down the three men who allegedly committed the crime — Travis Villalobos Richard Murphy and Matthew Gale — and hauled them off to jail.

Villalobos Murphy and Gale are charged with burglary conspiracy to commit burglary receiving stolen property and criminal mischief.

50 Cent’s attorney says the burglary was originally reported as a break-in at the television executive’s home but it was actually a leased corporate apartment for one of his businesses.

“At the time the suspects were in the unit police drove by but did not realize the individuals were still inside” he said. “The entire matter was caught on surveillance cameras.”

Two of the best examples of the genre were published during the Great Depression J.B. Priestley’s “English Journey” (1934) and George Orwell’s “The Road to Wigan Pier” (1937). Bill Bryson had such a hit with “Notes from a Small Island” (1995) selling more than 2m copies that he decided to repeat the exercise with “The Road to Little Dribbling” 20 years later.

With no one-size-fits-all form of respite the fund will be available for flexible support to meet the needs of individual carers through a range of person-centred and innovative options including face-to-face support and short breaks helping unpaid carers have regular periods away from their caring routines or responsibilities.

The Deputy Minister for Social Services said: “The physical and emotional impact of caring can be overwhelming.

""Unpaid carers across Wales play a vital role in our society – and their contribution to the pandemic has been immense often taking on greater responsibilities with fewer breaks.

“Respite services can be a lifeline and this new fund will make sure unpaid carers have a short break from their caring responsibilities.

""Unpaid carers are some of society’s unsung heroes and it is essential we help them look after their own health and wellbeing.”

Around 12 per cent of people in Wales have caring responsibilities – many do not receive any support.

Respondents to the Welsh Government’s Strategy for Unpaid Carers consultation said their levels of stress and anxiety had increased because they could not access respite services; go on a daytrip or even leave their home for a couple of hours during the height of the pandemic.

The £3m fund will be split into two phases – local authorities will be allocated £1.75m in the first phase to meet an anticipated surge in demand for respite services.

In the second phase £1.25m will fund a new Wales-wide short breaks fund.

Simon Hatch director of Carers Trust Wales said: “This funding is very welcome particularly given the significant impact the pandemic has had on thousands of unpaid carers.

""Carers have been highlighting for many years that the amount and flexibility of respite care support needs greatly improving.

""This is an important start in developing the respite support which carers in Wales deserve.”"

Rosales wakes at 4 a.m. and hurries to catch the bus to work before sunup sometimes doing her makeup on the bumpy half-hour ride. Her shift begins at 6 a.m. For nine hours straight she’s on her feet assembling water heaters to be shipped primarily to the U.S. permitting thousands upon thousands of American households to enjoy a hot shower.

By Friday her take home pay for the week after deductions for her home mortgage savings and taxes is the equivalent of U.S. $50.

“The pay is not very good in the factories” she said. “You learn to make do.”

Karla Rosales isn't the worker's real name. The El Paso Times is choosing to use a pseudonym since she isn't authorized by her work to speak to the press.

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is in Guatemala today her first diplomatic visit abroad since assuming her current post. Her next stop is Mexico where she’ll meet with President Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador. The record number of migrants currently arriving at the U.S./Mexico border is likely to dominate their conversation on Tuesday. But Harris’ agenda also includes discussing vulnerable populations namely women and children. Among the issues that plague the most vulnerable in Mexico are low-wages and crime. Both issues are especially prominent in Juárez and all along Mexico’s northern border.

First trip abroad:Technical issue turns Kamala Harris' plane around just after takeoff for Guatemala

For more than half a century economic development in Juárez has been dominated by the maquiladora industry — foreign-owned factories that manufacture everything from seat belts to printer cartridges to snowmobiles. Rosales is one of Juárez’s 300000 plus “maquila” workers. She said her factory can churn out up to 1700 water heaters a day. The appliances range in size and are bought and sold by U.S. companies like Whirlpool and AO Smith.

“Our water heaters end up in people’s homes in hospitals hotels” Rosales said.

Higher-level employees of Mexico’s maquiladoras might be able to afford a middle-class lifestyle and even send their kids to U.S. universities. But assembly-line workers are more likely to live in government-subsidized housing built in outlying neighborhoods where poverty and violence are high.

Violence is high in poor neighborhoods

Rosales lives in the southeastern edge of Juárez where drug-violence is a daily peril. Two women were found dead in her neighborhood just two weeks ago. Their heads were wrapped in plastic and their bodies were left covered by blankets on the street. One of the women was a sister to a friend of Rosales' daughter. A month earlier a nephew of Rosales’ husband was discovered hanging from the side of a building in central Juárez. He had been strangled to death.

“The violence is intense here in Juárez and our government offers us little support” Rosales said. “We’re always afraid that something will happen to us when we go out. We live in a state of constant alert.”

Harris tackles migration in high-profile visit to Guatemala and Mexico. Here’s what’s on the agenda.

May was the deadliest month of the year thus far in Juárez with 144 homicides. Twenty of those deaths were women. Last year 1646 people were murdered in El Paso’s sister city. The murder rate is steadily approaching the record setting years of 2008-2011 which together left a death toll of more than 10000 people.

Extreme drug violence in Juárez dates back to the early ‘90s when the infamous drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes took over the local cartel. Nicknamed “Lord of the Skies” Carrillo Fuentes flew never-before-seen amounts of narcotics to Mexico’s northern border in 747 cargo planes. He then used commuter and commercial transport to sneak his product into the U.S. the world’s largest consumer of illegal drugs.

Story continues below.

Drug cartels recruit poor young men

Young people — especially young men — make up the majority of Mexico’s drug-related victims. Poor young men are especially vulnerable to being recruited by drug cartels.

Linabel Sarlat founder of a nonprofit called Las Hormigas works in neighborhoods where crime is prevelant.

Las Hormigas works in Anapra the community farthest west in Juárez across from Sunland Park New Mexico. The organization now a decade old works primarily with youth supplementing the education they receive in school with additional lessons in literacy math and other subjects. Las Hormigas also provides psychotherapy. The group regularly sees young children suffering from severe trauma.

The majority of people who live in Anapra work in maquilas Sarlat said. To survive both parents have to work she said sometimes staying longer hours to earn overtime pay.

Criminal groups often take advantage of kids who are unsupervised or neglected and offer those kids jobs and a sense of belonging. The money organized crime offers new recruits can be multiple times what their parents bring home.

When asked about Vice President Harris’ visit to Mexico Sarlat said she’d like to see the U.S. be a more conscientious neighbor.

“I’d like to see the U.S. assume its responsibility (in Mexico’s problems) instead of acting like a judge and pointing its finger at Mexicans. I’d like to see us share in the responsibility amicably.”

Femicide in Mexico is on the rise

Women in Mexico also bear the brunt of organized crime and the violence it brings. Femicide the most extreme form of violence against women is on the rise. The crime is a murder that’s sexually motivated and often involves torture or mutilation of the victim.

Federal crime statistics show there were 948 femicides nationwide in 2020 a figure that’s more than doubled since 2015. Estado de Mexico the Mexican state just north of Mexico City has the highest number of femicides with 48 in 2020. In the past two years large scale protests have erupted nationwide calling for government action against femicide.

Juárez and Chihuahua state have a horrific history of femicide with hundreds of victims since the early ‘90s. Most of the cases remain unsolved and have direct ties to organized crime. Others are cases of extreme domestic violence. Chihuahua has recorded 15 cases of femicide statewide from January to May of this year; seven of those cases happened in Juárez.

Veronica Corchado director of the Women's Municipal Institute in Juárez said combating the most egregious forms of violence against women must begin by targeting more common everyday violence. The Juárez City Council passed an ordinance last September that makes sexual harassment in public spaces a civil offense punishable by a fine community service or up to 36 hours in jail.

Corchado wants to see the U.S. and Mexico partner more directly on cases of binational domestic violence. These are cases where an abusive partner crosses north or south of the border to evade law enforcement or legal responsibilities. Sometimes the cases involve a parent or relative taking children across the border without the other parent's consent. Corchado estimates her agency has seen 50 such cases in the last 18 months with many more likely going unreported.

Kamala Harris and Joe Biden haven’t visited the US-Mexico border. Texas officials are mixed on whether they need to

""We often can't resolve these cases because the aggressor lives in El Paso"" Corchado says. ""This is a shared responsibility between two cities where families are spread across both sides of the border.""

Lopéz Obrador's administration cut federal funding for programs aimed at preventing violence against women as part of the president's COVID-19 austerity measures. Advocates such as Corchado loudly criticized the move because it coincided with a rise in domestic violence cases at the beginning of the pandemic. She estimates their workload at the Juárez women's institute increased by 25 to 30% in the past year.

The U.S. imposed travel restrictions on Mexicans entering the U.S. via land border crossings is yet another burden on families both Corchado and Sarlat with Las Hormigas said.

“Simply put it divides families” Corchado said.

Karla Rosales the maquiladora worker calls the travel restrictions — now going on 15 months — a double standard.

“Americans they can travel to Mexico freely without a visa” she said. “They can come here very comfortably. But us? We can’t go over there. That’s not fair.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pZC1kYXkuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9jdWx0dXJlL2FydGljbGUvcHJvLXBsYW5ldC1pbml0aWF0aXZlcy1jYW4taGVscC1idWlsZC1hLWhlYWx0aHktZnV0dXJlLTIzMTc2ODA40gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlkLWRheS5jb20vYW1wL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9jdWx0dXJlL2FydGljbGUvcHJvLXBsYW5ldC1pbml0aWF0aXZlcy1jYW4taGVscC1idWlsZC1hLWhlYWx0aHktZnV0dXJlLTIzMTc2ODA4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pro-planet initiatives can help build a healthy future,"Parag Kulkarni Managing Director A.

The pandemic has given us a unique opportunity to pause reflect and rethink how to balance our relationship with nature to ensure a harmonious relationship. The learnings are many; one of the key takeaways was the way nature has responded to the lockdown through cleaner skies fresh air to breathe and the often-unexpected return of wildlife in some parts of the world. Situations like these give us a moment to recognise the impact of our actions on mother Earth.



Isn't it time we all came together as responsible citizens to rejuvenate and restore her? Aptly today World Environment Day celebrated on June 5 is focused on just that -- restoring ecosystems.



There are many ways to go about restoring our ecosystems including adopting green technologies making sustainable consumption choices incorporating conservation efforts and developing environmental awareness. Individuals communities governments and companies can contribute in their own ways to the protection of environment by taking effective measures to help reduce their carbon footprints.



Here are some possible ways in which we all can contribute:



Adopt efficient processes: Many processes businesses have in place today use more energy or power than necessary and protecting the environment can often be as simple as replacing these processes and machinery for more efficient options. Creating business models that integrate sustainable development goals into the internal processes will help conserve energy and assist in identifying where waste can be reduced.



Need for greener products: Sustainability and environmental issues are emerging as important considerations when making strategic business management manufacturing and product development decisions. There is a critical need for companies to produce more efficient products that contribute to a green economy. Companies can redesign products and adapt new technologies to aid greener consumption. In fact going ""green"" should be a first priority as new products are conceived developed and consumed.



Reducing carbon footprint: Creating and using products that are energy efficient will reduce our carbon footprint and working toward the goal of zero waste will help protect the environment and sustain our natural resources for current and future generations. Corporations can play a role in creating a culture of green consciousness by encouraging and educating employees to make positive changes or be involved in an eco-friendly behaviour and developing habits that will save or conserve energy.



Focus on re-cycling and eliminate single-use plastics: Every year thousands of seabirds turtles seals and other marine mammals are killed after ingesting plastic or getting tangled up in it. You can cut down on plastic waste by using reusable bags eliminating single-use water bottles and avoiding products made from or packaged in plastic whenever possible.



The reality is that global warming is underway and along with climate change we are experiencing changes in weather patterns and our lifestyle. Developing environmentally friendly products and practices while engaging in lifestyles that are more ecologically responsible is undoubtedly the vision by which we should live our lives and contribute in restoring our ecosystems. The power to safeguard our environment lies with us and we need to take collective action to ensure the future of our planet for generations to come.

They also made a roster move Saturday for some bullpen help. They have had success with several arms from their system this year including Keegan Thompson Justin Steele and Tommy Nance.

They’re going to try another one as they have called up righthander Cory Abbott from Triple-A Iowa:

Cubs have recalled RHP Cory Abbott (No. 15 prospect for Cubs per MLB Pipeline). LHP Brad Wieck optioned to clear a roster spot in the bullpen.



A chance to get a look at Abbott but Ross said move really about having length in bullpen right now after last two games. — Jordan Bastian (@MLBastian) June 5 2021

Abbott who was the Cubs’ second-round pick out of Loyola Marymount in 2017 has numbers at Triple-A Iowa that don’t look so great: 6.39 ERA 1.658 WHIP in five starts. He has struck out 41 in 25⅔ innings 13 of which were in his most recent outing May 30 vs. St. Paul. Thus Abbott has had four days’ rest since that 103-pitch start so he should be available tonight to back up Kohl Stewart who is starting Saturday’s game against the Giants.

Here’s some info on Abbott from Tommy Birch at the Des Moines Register from last month and here’s even more on Abbott:

Quick rundown of Cory Abbott



• Low- to mid-90s with the fastball likes to work up in the zone

• Slutter (SL/CT) is his go-to putaway pitch and can be plus-plus

• Absolute bulldog mentality on the mound almost Lester-like

• Susceptible to the long ball but racks up the Ks — Greg Huss (@OutOfTheVines) June 5 2021

Hopefully Abbott will have similar success to the previous callups. Welcome to the big leagues Cory!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleGFzbW9udGhseS5jb20vbmV3cy1wb2xpdGljcy9kb24taHVmZmluZXMtZ292ZXJub3ItdHJ1bXAtZW5kb3JzZWQtZ3JlZy1hYmJvdHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Don Huffines Plotted Governor Run as the “Trump Guy.” Then Trump Endorsed Greg Abbott.,"Don Huffines arrived at an Austin restaurant for his first meeting of the Senate Republican Caucus and he was nervously clutching one of his favorite documents—the Texas Republican party platform. This was in January of 2015 the state legislative session was underway and Huffines one of the newest senators was still riding high after his defeat of a more moderate Republican incumbent whom he depicted as a crony capitalist and RINO (Republican in Name Only).

When it was Huffines’s turn to speak at the caucus meeting he told his nineteen colleagues that the platform represented the will of the party and that they needed to focus on turning the grassroots’ hopes and dreams into reality. There were two plans in particular among the hundreds in the document that he wanted to see passed: ending the franchise tax on businesses and making it legal to carry a handgun without a license. At the very least he said Republican senators were obliged to get those issues to the floor where lawmakers could be held accountable for their votes.

His words Huffines recalls were met with silence. “Gradually one two three four or more senators got up from the table in the middle of the meal and left the room. Needless to say the rest of the night was awkward.” And so too were the next four years. In the Senate Huffines remained the truest of true believers adamant and apart from both the Democrats and most Republicans. His single term ended four years later when he lost to Democrat Nathan Johnson by eight percentage points in a district that Governor Greg Abbott won by four. Few Democrats or Republicans in the Senate lamented Huffines’s departure.

In the last few years he has frequently recounted his memory of his first caucus dinner to conservative grassroots activists who as he tells them are held in the same disdain as he. “Patriots I am going to tell you something you might not know but that you need to know” Huffines said in January at a tea party gathering in Plano. “Most but not all of your elected Republican officeholders they don’t like you. As a matter of fact it’s fair to say that a lot of them they belittle you they make fun of you they use you they are duplicitous and they are liars. And you know why? Because you might hold them accountable.”

Such heated rhetoric has made Huffines persona non grata in most GOP circles.

But Huffines who hails from a prominent and wealthy Dallas-area business family welcomes the hatred. Indeed it’s the kind of negative energy that he hopes will propel him into the Governor’s Mansion.

On May 10 Huffines announced that he would run against Governor Greg Abbott in 2022. His basic message: Abbott is no conservative. It’s been 27 years since a Democrat was last elected to statewide office but Huffines takes no satisfaction from that. He does not believe that any of the four Republican governors of Texas since Reconstruction—neither Bill Clements nor George W. Bush neither Rick Perry nor certainly Abbott—has been sufficiently conservative. Nor does he believe that the Legislature completely under Republican control since 2003 has had a single conservative session. That includes the one that just ended with Abbott signing into law a virtual ban on abortion and with legislation allowing permitless carry of firearms awaiting the governor’s signature.

“It’s not good enough” Huffines told Texas Monthly. “We’ve controlled everything in Austin for twenty years everything. And year after year we go back and beg for our priorities to become law. And maybe we get one or two issues done three maybe and they’re always watered down.”

Huffines’s candidacy is a very long shot but not one Abbott ever paranoid about threats from his right flank can ignore. When Huffines launched his campaign he made no secret of his strategy: he would run to Abbott’s right as “the only real Trump candidate in this race” and seek the endorsement of the former president. “I don’t think Trump’s gonna support Abbott I really don’t” he told me in mid-May. “I don’t know why he would. Abbott’s never supported Trump’s agenda. He’s never leading the charge for Trump. He’s never tried.”

Yet on Tuesday deploying his trademark Random Capitalization Trump bestowed upon Abbott his “Complete and Total Endorsement for re-election. He will never let you down!” A half hour later Huffines replied. “Texas Primary voters and Trump supporters will decide for themselves who will lead our state forward and who has failed Texans repeatedly on issues that matter most.” Huffines declared “I am the clear Trump candidate in the governor’s race.”

That self-proclaimed status as the truest Trumper in the race may come under challenge. On Friday Texas GOP chairman Allen West announced that he is stepping down as state party chairman and preparing to run for another office though he was coy about which race he favored. Bumptious agriculture commissioner Sid Miller is also poised to jump into the GOP race for governor.

The unusually fluid situation presents all sorts of quandaries: Can Huffines (or West or Miller) overcome Trump’s chosen candidate in Texas? With the former president’s seal of approval is Abbott freed from the need to perpetually mollify critics on the right or is he borrowing a different kind of trouble by becoming beholden to Trump?

Huffines is one of four brothers the children of J.L. and Launa Huffines best known for their family’s car dealerships. While still in his teens Don Huffines was inspired by the writing of Murray Rothbard an economist and political philosopher who was one of the fathers of paleolibertarianism which blends economic libertarianism with social and cultural conservatism. In arguing for a strategy of right-wing populism Rothbard was stirred by the example of the late red-baiting Wisconsin senator Joe McCarthy admiring “his willingness and ability to reach out to short-circuit the power elite: liberals centrists the media the intellectuals the Pentagon Rockefeller Republicans and reach out and whip up the masses directly.” Rothbard exulted that even as the “Ruling Elite from Official Right to Left” defeated white supremacist David Duke when he ran for governor of Louisiana in 1992 “he sure scared the bejesus out of them.”

Huffines went to A&M for a year before transferring to UT. After graduating with a degree in finance Huffines went into residential real estate with his twin brother Phillip. His older brother James a banker got involved in establishment Republican politics serving as a top aide to Governor Clements in the eighties an adviser to Governor Bush and chair of Rick Perry’s transition when he became governor. Huffines was drawn in a different direction into the political orbit of Ron Paul the former Republican member of Congress from Lake Jackson and three-time presidential candidate who was deeply influenced by paleolibertarianism. “History will show this man has done more to change the political discourse of the world than most any man in modern history” Huffines said in his introductory remarks when Paul making his last run for president spoke at the Republican state convention in Fort Worth in 2012.

Four years later Huffines chaired the short-lived 2016 presidential campaign in Texas of Paul’s son Rand a U.S. senator from Kentucky. But it wasn’t until President Trump that Huffines found the man that Rothbard had been looking for. With “all the odds stacked against him the entire media against him” Huffines said Trump “distinguished himself from all the other Republican candidates who have run for president in the past because there was actually a difference between him and the Democrat.”

Abbott by contrast errs on the side of caution Huffines said. In his response to the pandemic Abbott showed too much deference to experts and too little respect for individual autonomy Huffines said calling the governor’s performance the “final straw.” On March 15 2020 he tweeted a warning: a quarantine was coming and Texans’ personal and economic liberty were “under attack.” Two weeks later Abbott issued a statewide stay-at-home order while initially refusing to use those words.

On April 15 Huffines published an op-ed throwing down the gauntlet: Abbott’s “unTexan” leadership had “effectively shut down the 10th-largest economy in the world by not standing up to local leaders who are usurping his authority.” Two days later Abbott named his brother James to lead his Strike Force to Open Texas.

But as Abbott zigged and zagged in the months that followed he emboldened his enemies. In May and June he hastened the reopening of the economy after Dallas salon owner Shelley Luther emerged overnight as a Rothbardian heroine for defying the governor’s shutdown orders and serving a couple of days in jail for contempt. Then as COVID-19 numbers spiked the governor ahead of the Fourth of July buttoned the economy back up and did what he said he wouldn’t do—impose a statewide mask order.

Abbott opened the virtual state GOP convention in July with a prerecorded message defending his leadership and rebuking the naysayers. Lucky for him the Zoom convention made it impossible for anyone to boo or at least to be heard doing so. But four days later former Florida congressman West was elected chairman of the party on a message that focused on attacking Abbott’s “tyranny.” The party platform written at the convention notably condemned lockdowns and mask mandates. In October Huffines joined West and Sid Miller in a protest outside the Governor’s Mansion. The barbarians were at the gate.

The past year has undoubtedly been a difficult one for Abbott as he navigated the pandemic and presided over the spectacular failure of the state’s power grid which is overseen by his appointees during the February freeze. According to the most recent Texas Politics Project polling conducted in April Abbott had the support of 77 percent of Republicans. That’s down from 88 percent the previous spring but perhaps better than might be expected.

And Abbott’s legions of supporters James Huffines notably among them are all but saying “I told you so” to his critics from both left and right. “Everyone loves a good comeback story and Texas is writing one for the ages” James Huffines wrote in an op-ed in early May. “Thanks to the perseverance of Texans and the steady hand of Gov. Greg Abbott Texas is now poised for a major economic comeback.”

After his brother’s announcement that he would run for governor James Huffines issued a statement to Texas Monthly. “Like many families particularly in recent times ours has differences of opinions about politics” he wrote. While concluding that it would be wise not to talk about the family’s political differences he said “I have a 25-year relationship with Greg Abbott have supported him in every one of his campaigns and long before this situation arose committed to do so again. I think the Governor has done an excellent job for Texas and I am confident he will continue to do so.”

Spoken like a man who takes the long view. Don Huffines by contrast sees the current moment in apocalyptic terms. “When we lose Texas we lose the free world. That means we lost civilization as we know it” he told his audience in Plano in June. “Time is not on our side.”

In 2018 Nathan Johnson was a first-time political candidate with an eclectic background. He has a physics degree practices law and composes music scoring the Japanese anime series Dragon Ball Z. At some campaign appearances Johnson would draw the political spectrum on a whiteboard. He’d place himself left of center and former senator John Carona whom Huffines defeated in the 2014 Republican primary to the right of center. Then he’d walk past the edge of the whiteboard and say “Huffines is out here.”

Don’t expect Huffines to inch closer to the whiteboard. At the tea party event in January he shared the stage with former state representative Jonathan Stickland a founding member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus and an adviser to Huffines. Stickland talked about the necessity of expanding the Overton Window—a term describing the acceptable spectrum of political discussion—to the right. The Monday after Huffines announced Abbott ended federal pandemic-related unemployment assistance two months before it was due to expire. That Tuesday he banned governmental entities including public schools from requiring masks. The next day he signed the law banning abortion the moment a fetal heartbeat is detected—before most women know they’re pregnant. “Amazing how quick he moves when he has a primary challenger” tweeted former state representative Matt Rinaldi a Huffines ally.

Has Trump’s endorsement slammed shut the Overton Window? Or must Abbott now more closely track Trump lest he appear ungrateful or undeserving of his blessing?

Huffines is wounded but even without Trump’s support he has the resources to present Abbott with the most serious primary challenge of his career. He recently released the names of five hundred Republican grassroots leaders backing his candidacy including anti-abortion pro–gun rights and anti-vaccine activists who can and will make a lot of noise. Trump’s endorsement won’t silence them.

Nor does it seem likely to keep West (and maybe also Miller) from joining the fray. Their entrance would splinter the anti-Abbott vote possibly forcing Abbott into a runoff an eventuality that would leave the governor even more reliant on Trump’s grace.

Regardless Abbott may have to pay a price for the Trump endorsement. The governor has in recent years tread a careful path with Trump appearing always loyal but in a far lower key than Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick or Senator Ted Cruz. Now with Trump’s generous and timely endorsement Abbott has no choice but to become Trump’s main squeeze in Texas. Abbott’s polite and useful distance from Trump was crushed in Tuesday’s embrace. On Monday as if on cue the governor issued a disaster declaration for 34 counties along or near the border citing an increase in unauthorized immigrants. If Democrats mount a serious general election challenge that could be a liability for Abbott.

In the near term it also complicates the politics of Senate Bill 7 the Texas GOP’s prized “voter integrity bill” imposing new restrictions on voting especially for Texans of color and those living in cities. When at the end of the session Democrats fled the House breaking quorum and killing the bill Huffines blamed the defeat on Abbott’s “failure of leadership.” Abbott has already said he will add the legislation to the agenda in a special session. SB 7 and sister legislation being pressed and passed by Republicans in state after state are in part a consequence of Trump’s loss and his success in persuading most Republicans voters against all the evidence that the 2016 election was stolen. But the GOP lawmakers behind SB 7 have carefully avoided invoking Trump’s campaign as a reason for the bill; its author Senator Bryan Hughes cites fraud he alleges (again without evidence) took place in the 2018 midterms while other state lawmakers have stated explicitly that the 2020 elections in Texas were legitimate.

It may now be harder to keep Trump from casting a shadow on the proceedings. When the voting legislation returns to center stage it will be at a special session called by Abbott who Trump promised Texans in his endorsement is “all in on Election Integrity.” Hours before the Abbott endorsement the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman tweeted that “Trump has been telling a number of people he’s in contact with that he expects he will get reinstated by August.”

Meanwhile Huffines continues to serve up Trump-grade tartare. Trump promised to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. Huffines promises to finish the wall and have Texans pay for it. “I’m not asking permission from the federal government to secure Texas’s border” Huffines said. So far so good. No issue cuts closer to the bone for Texas Republicans than border security. But the Abbott ad writes itself. “Trump: ‘No Governor has done more to secure the Border and keep our communities safe than Greg Abbott.’”

Until Abbott touted Trump’s endorsement Tuesday the closest thing to an Abbott campaign response to the primary challenge was belittlement. The day after Huffines who cuts a slight figure announced Abbott strategist Dave Carney tweeted “Can anyone remind me what the height restrictions are for 6 Flags rides?”

Asked about the Carney tweet. Huffines was ready with a retort: “I’m tall enough” Huffines said. “Tall enough to be governor.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1sYi5jb20vbmV3cy9qYWtlLW1hcmlzbmljay1uZWFyaW5nLXJldHVybi1mcm9tLWN1YnMtaW5qdXJlZC1saXN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jake Marisnick nearing return from Cubs' injured list,With Heyward back in the fold Kris Bryant -- who has been rotating between all three outfield spots for the past six-plus weeks -- was back in center field.

ABBV,AbbVie,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jYmouY29tL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUvYWJidmllcy1pcnZpbmUtdW5pdC1hY3F1aXJlcy1zb2xpdG9uLTU1MG0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AbbVie’s Irvine Unit Acquires Soliton for $550M,"Allergan Aesthetics the Irvine-based unit of Chicago’s biopharmaceutical giant AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) appears to be back in growth mode.



The aesthetics unit of AbbVie the last remaining local division of Allergan following several sales and corporate restructurings over the past six years in May announced an acquisition of its own buying acoustic wave device maker Soliton Inc. for $550 million.



The Houston-based maker of a cellulite and tattoo removal device is being acquired for $22.60 per share.



That’s a 25% premium over Soliton’s closing price on its last full day of trading prior to the announcement.



Soliton’s device is expected to be an important contributor to Allergan Aesthetics’ collection of fat-freezing and muscle-strengthening products according to Carrie Strom president of Allergan Aesthetics and senior vice president of AbbVie.



“There is a huge unmet need to address cellulite and effective treatments have been elusive and frustrating for consumers” Strom said at the time of the announcement.



“Soliton’s technology offers a new completely noninvasive approach with clinically-proven results to reduce the appearance of cellulite with no patient downtime.”



The local aesthetic unit’s main product is wrinkle-treating drug Botox; global Botox cosmetic revenue was $477 million in the first quarter of 2021 up 45% versus year-ago levels according to AbbVie.

Flurry of Investments



The company’s buyout of Soliton comes just a few weeks after the Houston company received FDA clearance to treat cellulite with its Resonic system which uses rapid acoustic pulse technology to reduce the appearance of cellulite and tattoos. The system has also shown results for fibrotic scars in clinical trials.



It’s the second acquisition for the Allergan Aesthetics division since its parent company’s own $63 billion sale to AbbVie that closed last May—and an example of continued efforts to address unmet needs in aesthetics.



In October the company acquired Israel-based Luminera Pharma maker of a dermal filler with hyaluronic acid and calcium hydroxyapatite intended for facial soft tissue augmentation called HArmonyCa. That product previously available in just Israel and Brazil was folded into the company’s dermal filler portfolio and is expected to be rolled out globally.



In addition the company in January entered an option to acquire Chicago-based Cypris Medical a device maker for treating midface descent and neck lifts; and in September led a $7.5 million seed round of financing for hair rejuvenation firm Stemson Therapeutics of San Diego.

Brand Makeover



Allergan which long served as Orange County’s largest healthcare company and OC’s most valuable public company in 2015 was sold for $70.5 billion to Parsippany N.J.-based Actavis PLC a deal that resulted in sharp cuts to the company’s Irvine overall base of employees as well as its local executive ranks.



The company now employs close to 1300 workers locally according to Business Journal data. That’s roughly half the local employee count from 2015.



Its new ownership structure under AbbVie appears to be looking to add to the Irvine campus rather than continue the cuts as was seen during the nearly six-year ownership of Actavis which kept the Allergan name after its acquisition.

AbbVie announced a new vision for its global aesthetics brand last October.



It aims to “honor its heritage and history while looking ahead as an AbbVie company” that is “100% dedicated to aesthetics” Strom told the Business Journal.



On the consumer front “we wanted a visual identity that is bold and beautiful diverse and inclusive that includes real people and feels accessible to everyone” Strom said.



That strategy is evidenced in the company’s more recent advertisements and social media channels which have been taken over with new images and messages that demonstrate an increasingly diverse customer base—in size shape skin tone age and more.

Golden Age



Strom spent more than a decade in marketing roles working up to senior VP of medical aesthetics at Allergan before she was tapped to lead the global aesthetics unit of AbbVie.



“We’re in the golden age of aesthetics” she said.



“Aesthetics has become mainstream. It’s no longer taboo or stigmatized. It’s part of everyday beauty regimes and there are more options and categories that address needs than ever before.”



The global medical aesthetics market is expected to expand at an annual rate of 10% to $125 billion by 2028 according to Grandview Research.



In the first quarter of 2021 Allergan Aesthetics grew 35% globally to $1.1 billion led by a rebound of interest and treatments as the world begins to emerge from COVID-19 and in-person activities begin to resume.



The millennial generation in combination with more frequent use of social media have been major growth drivers for the industry added Strom.



To capitalize the company has been growing a new team—called Allergan Data Labs—made up of digital marketers consumer aesthetics marketers data scientists and engineers “with the mandate to drive penetration in a vastly under-penetrated market and inspire consumers to try our products” Strom said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved an injectable diabetes drug for long-term weight control.

“This under-the-skin injection is the first approved drug for chronic weight management in adults with general obesity or overweight since 2014” the FDA said in a statement Friday.

Studies have shown the once-a-week injection called semaglutide can help people lose up to 12% of their body weight over about a year and a half compared to people given a placebo shot and 15% of their body weight overall.

Semaglutide to be sold under the brand name Wegovy by maker Novo Nordisk affects a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 and increases the production of insulin. But it also appears to suppress appetite by acting on the brain the FDA said.

The FDA said new obesity treatments are needed.

“Approximately 70% of American adults have obesity or overweight. Having obesity or overweight is a serious health issue associated with some leading causes of death including heart disease stroke and diabetes and is linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer” the agency said in the statement.

“Losing 5% to 10% of body weight through diet and exercise has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease in adult patients with obesity or overweight.”

People without diabetes who took the drug along with a modified eating plan and extra exercise lost an average of 12.4% of their initial body weight over 16 months compared to those given a placebo along with the exercise and diet plan. Diabetes patients who tested the drug lost 6.2% more of their body weight compared to people who got dummy injections.

The trial showed people using Wegovy lost 14.9% of their body weight after about 16 months compared to those given placebo shots who lost 2.4% of their body weight.

Few drugs are approved in the United States specifically for weight loss. They include orlistat sold under the brand name Xenical which helps reduce the amount of fat the body absorbs; Qsymia a drug that combines the appetite reducer phentermine with the seizure drug topiramate; Contrave which combines the addiction drug naltrexone with the antidepressant bupropion; and liraglutide or Saxenda a diabetes drug that is similar to semaglutide.

The drug can have side effects including an inflammation of the pancreas increased heart rate nausea diarrhea and thoughts of suicide. It can also cause gallstones so patients using the injections need to keep in touch with a doctor or other healthcare provider.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkY2V4ZWMuY29tL3NvdXJjaW5nLXByb2N1cmVtZW50L2FydGljbGUvMjE0MTUzOTQvcmVzZWFyY2gtZnJvbnRpZXJzLW5hbm90ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFuZC1wb3N0Y292aWQxOS1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nanotechnology and Post-COVID-19 Manufacturing,"From raw material sourcing shortages to production issues the manufacturing industry has experienced incredible disruption as a result of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However with bits of positive news finally beginning to surface as vaccination rates increase and new cases decline the manufacturing industry has begun to take a very close look at some of the key learnings they have gathered throughout this pandemic and what the manufacturing industry may look like going forward. And one key area is innovation especially when it comes to embracing nanotechnology.

With greater scrutiny being paid in promoting cleanliness and better protection against future global health issues combined with the long-standing desire to make buildings vehicles and machinery more earth-friendly the manufacturing industry is giving nanotechnology a long hard look as a potential tool to help to tackle these challenges. This is particularly true as end-users such as renters homeowners and motorists look for glass to be a bigger part of their homes and vehicles.

With that in mind here are a few ways how nanotechnology and glass are being viewed as the next frontier for the manufacturing industry in the post-COVID-19 era.

Demand for glass

From all glass roofs in vehicles to the desire for more glass in residential high buildings the craving for glass has never been higher. Unfortunately for years builders and vehicle OEMs have looked to reduce glass use over fears of heat gain glare and durability among other things. However thanks to nanotechnology driven innovations such as suspended particle device (SPD) glass technology glass is now capable of offering much greater glare control and heat reduction. This enables auto OEMs and builders to offer a much more comfortable interior experience without sacrificing views.

Additionally as hospitals and hotels look to make their spaces easier to clean the “tintability” of nanotechnology-powered glass will allow them to get rid of unsanitary curtains and replace them with glass partitions that can be sanitized and cleaned much more easily and quickly.

The drive for sustainability

Buildings and vehicles are two primary drivers of carbon emissions today. In fact as recently as 2019 buildings were both directly and indirectly responsible for 28% of the world’s CO2 emissions while transportation was directly responsible for 24%. These are obviously massively unsettling statistics and as a result the automotive and building manufacturing sectors have been leaving no stone unturned when it comes to finding solutions. Enter nanotechnology.

For example by leveraging nanotechnology-powered glass and its heat rejecting capabilities automotive OEMs and builders have been able to drastically cut air conditioning use in their vehicles and buildings respectively. And in the case of vehicles specifically given the reduced demand for air conditioning automotive OEMs have been able to dramatically cut the size of AC compressors cutting weight and boosting fuel efficiency as a result.

Consumer goods and next-gen projection

Beyond the heavy equipment side of the manufacturing industry nanotechnology-powered glass is being embraced on the consumer goods side as well -- particularly when it comes to TVs and projection. For example some companies have begun to roll out clear TVs or TVs that resemble picture frames or the illusion of furniture and this simply wouldn’t be possible without nanotechnology-powered glass.

Moreover as we move into a world where autonomous vehicles begin to hit the roadways and automotive OEMs transform interior experiences to give passengers “something to do” since they will no longer need to drive this type of project technology will be key in transforming windows in computer and TV screens.

Each day manufacturing is getting more interesting as a result of material science and innovation. And nanotechnology -- particularly in glass -- is proving to be one of the most intriguing spaces in the material science-manufacturing revolution especially as we continue to move through the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS90ZWNoLzIwMjEvSnVuLzA2L2Nocm9tZWJvb2stcmVhZHktMjMxMTM5OS5odG1s0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3aW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2xpZmVzdHlsZS90ZWNoLzIwMjEvSnVuLzA2L2Nocm9tZWJvb2stcmVhZHktMjMxMTM5OS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chromebook ready?,"If this is how you get your work done then you are ready for a Chromebook.

Contract prices of enterprise SSDs for the July-September period are expected to go up 10-15 percent from the previous quarter according to the latest report from market researcher TrendForce which revised its previous forecast of a 5-10 percent increase.

It said the price hike will be driven by North American cloud service providers' efforts to expand their storage capacities following inventory adjustments while government agencies and other businesses are beefing up their IT infrastructure reports Yonhap news agency.

A ramp-up in production from computer processor developers like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for server CPUs are also projected to increase demand for enterprise SSDs TrendForce said.

Such a trend will likely lead to supply leader Samsung further expanding its presence in the market the market researcher added.

SSD is a storage device that contains multiple NAND flash chips. Samsung is the world's largest maker of NAND flash a type of non-volatile memory.

""Samsung has a higher flexibility in supplying SSDs compared to the other suppliers because it has a higher share of in-house components for its storage products"" it said.

""Samsung's products are expected to account for more than 50 percent of enterprise SSDs (in terms of bits) shipped to data centers in North America in 3Q21. This dominance will likely further Samsung's ability to dictate market prices going forward"" TrendForce said.

It said Intel's market share may decrease in the enterprise SSD sector since the US has been dealing with a shortage of power management integrated circuits.

""Regarding other suppliers including Kioxia and SK hynix although they have been able to raise their market shares due to the gradual adoption of their products by clients they are unlikely to catch up to Samsung for the time being"" the market researcher said.

Meanwhile for client SSD contract prices it predicted a 3-8 percent quarter-on-quarter increase in the third quarter citing strong demand for notebook computers.

ARM announced last Fall that there would be no more 32-bit support as of 2022 then this March they made a similar announcement but with a 2023 deadline. [Gary] tries to parse these statements and takes an educated guess at what the disparity means (spoiler alert — he predicts that one more 32-bit core will soon be released).

[Gary] clearly breaks down the 32-bit situation by operating systems such as Linux Windows MacOS Android and iOS and how all of these have been transitioning to 64-bits over recent years. He does a thorough job and concludes that the transition is already well underway. And while Linux and Windows have not completely dropped 32-bit support the writing is on the wall.

Take note however that this discussion regards the Cortex-A family of cores found in smart phones tablets computers and powerful embedded applications like autonomous vehicles. The popular 32-bit Cortex-M family of low-cost / low-power cores that are used in so many embedded system designs will remain 32-bits for the foreseeable future.

After watching [Gary]’s presentation if you want to learn more check out the writeup that [Maya Posch] did on the details of the latest ARMv9 ISA a few weeks ago. Also watch this 8-bit vs 32-bit presentation by our Editor-in-Chief [Mike Szczys]. Despite being from five years ago it is still quite applicable today. What about 16-bit MCUs — the old Intel/AMD embedded 80186 processor the 8051 follow-ons like the 80C196 80C251 or 8051XA the 6502 follow-ons like the 65C816 Zilog’s Z8000 the Renesas M16C etc. — is anyone using them anymore? If so or if you’re using a 4-bit MCU these days let us know in the comments below.

One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of ServiceNow is 25.8% which ranks better than 85% of the companies in Software industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 104.8% which ranks better than 98% of the companies in Software industry.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months ServiceNow's return on invested capital is 2.93 and its cost of capital is 7.78. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of ServiceNow is shown below:

His training at Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois involved repeatedly putting jet fuel and other chemicals and debris into a pit setting them on fire and then putting the flames out with firefighting foam known as AFFF. Ferrara and the other members of the fire crew became unbearably hot as they stood around the fiery pit. For relief they would cover each other with foam.

“As we’re spraying each other the substance would find its way under our collars and the cuffs of our sleeves. It would penetrate through the weak points of our suits” Ferrara remembered. The sudsy foam did cool them down. Now years later Ferrara and many other civilian and military firefighters who were exposed to firefighting foam that contained the industrial chemicals known as PFAS are developing health problems that they believe are related to those occupational exposures. And despite ample evidence connecting PFAS exposure to multiple diseases many are finding it difficult to convince others of the connection.

While almost everyone has PFAS in their blood through exposure to water dust and everyday products that contain the chemicals firefighters may have greater contact with PFAS than any other group of workers. In addition to using — and often getting doused with — AFFF it has become clear in recent years that the clothing that was supposed to protect them while fighting fires known as turnout gear is also saturated with PFAS.

Given the frequent contact with the toxic chemicals which accumulate in the body and cause kidney cancer depressed immune function and elevated cholesterol among other health problems it may not be surprising that firefighters have both relatively high levels of the chemicals in their blood and elevated rates of cancer diagnoses. Firefighters also have a death rate from cancers that is 14 percent higher than that of the general population according to a study by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.

But some firefighters who have used AFFF now find themselves struggling not just with illnesses linked to the chemical-laden foam and firefighting gear but also with getting coverage for benefits related to those illnesses. In April Volunteer Firemen’s Insurance Services a company that provides insurance and other services to firefighters and is a division of the Glatfelter Insurance Group sent its policyholders a notice that the company would be applying a “pollution exclusion” to its coverage specifying that “the application of the pollution exclusion is extended to any use of Class B firefighting foam containing PFAS.”

The Glatfelter Insurance Group declined to answer questions for this story about how many firefighters and former firefighters are subject to its new pollution rider which types of policies are affected and why the company has chosen to exclude coverage of AFFF-related claims.

Meanwhile some former military firefighters who used the firefighting foam and wore the gear are struggling to get the Department of Veterans Affairs to recognize a connection between their workplace exposure and their illnesses. Ferrara who has elevated triglyceride levels in his blood Type 2 diabetes and numbness in his feet and hands all symptoms that he believes are related to his exposure to the chemicals while in the military was unable to get the VA to pay for a blood test to measure the PFAS levels in his blood. The VA also denied his claim for disability benefits based on his exposure to the firefighting foam.

Ferrara found that he wasn’t alone in meeting resistance from the hulking bureaucracy that provides health care to U.S veterans. As he learned more about the dangers of the foam that he had been told was harmless he has become outspoken on the issue of the government’s obligation to take care of firefighters who were exposed to the chemicals in the line of duty. Through a Facebook group and email he estimates that he has connected with at least 50 veterans who have developed cancer and other serious illnesses after using AFFF in the military and have had their claims for disability related to AFFF exposure denied by the VA. The VA provides these monetary benefits to veterans only if they can prove that an illness or injury was caused or exacerbated by their service.

“The VA keeps pushing back saying that since about 96 or so percent of Americans have PFAS in their blood there’s no definitive correlation between AFFF and their medical illnesses” said Ferrara. “But if you ask any firefighter they’re going to tell you that’s BS.”

“We shouldn’t have to go run around and fight to get testing done it should just be presumptive if you did the service and were exposed. But what they do is they deny deny deny.”

Robert Gomez finds himself in that camp. Gomez used AFFF as a firefighter in the Air Force from 1990 to 2002 and continued to use it as a military contractor doing similar work until 2019. Last year at the age of 49 he was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer which was found in his liver as well as his colon and lymph nodes. Gomez who has been unable to work as he undergoes treatment for the cancer applied for disability based on the illness in December but the VA rejected his claim telling him the cancer was not “service related.”

“We shouldn’t have to go run around and fight to get testing done it should just be presumptive if you did the service and were exposed” said Gomez. “But what they do is they deny deny deny.”

VA spokesperson Gary Kunich wrote in an email that the “VA does not recommend blood tests to determine levels of PFAS in any individual. Because most individuals in the U.S. have measurable amounts of PFAS in their blood and normal ranges have not been established. Also blood tests cannot be linked to current or future health conditions or guide medical treatment decisions.” Asked which medical conditions the VA recognizes as potentially caused by AFFF exposure Kunich wrote that “AFFF contains PFAS chemicals and the potential health effects similar for any PFAS exposure depends on the concentration frequency and duration of exposure.”

Steve Kjonaas legislative director of Department of Colorado Veterans of Foreign Wars helps vets or their surviving family members who want to file claims related to their AFFF exposures in the military. According to Kjonaas the VA doesn’t keep up with all the emerging science showing the health effects of PFAS. “A lot of times the VA doesn’t recognize that AFFF causes whatever illness because it’s not yet codified and not in their rules” said Kjonaas who was himself was exposed to AFFF for years as an Air Force firefighter before developing prostate cancer at age 40.

According to Kunich the VA makes decisions about disability claims on a case-by-case basis by reviewing the types levels and duration of exposure the onset and nature of the claimed medical conditions and other factors. “If there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence VA gives the benefit of the doubt to the veteran” Kunich wrote in an email.

Dan Casson who believes that he is the first veteran to receive a 100 percent disability rating based on AFFF exposure attributed his success with the VA to persistence. “I refused to give up” said Casson a former crash rescue firefighter in the Air Force who fought with the VA about benefits for six years after being diagnosed with both melanoma and stage 3 prostate cancer in 2014. The VA rejected his first two claims for disability but approved his third application in 2020. Although the agency retroactively granted him benefits dating back to 2016 Casson is still angry. “We all asked the same question: What is this stuff?” Casson said of his fellow firefighters “And they told us it was just super soap suds.”

“They told us it was just super soap suds.”

It is not the first time the VA has delayed compensating veterans for environmental exposures. In 2019 more than 50 years after the first Air Force members were exposed to the herbicide Agent Orange legislation finally forced the VA to provide disability compensation to service members who developed cancers and other diseases. Before that many veterans who had been exposed to the chemical which the U.S. used in Vietnam in the 1960s had their claims rejected for decades.

Jeff Hermes said that he is not prepared to wait for the government to own up to its responsibility for exposed veterans — and that the U.S. military shouldn’t have allowed its firefighters to be exposed in the first place. “I’m disappointed in the government’s inability to recognize what is being talked about more and more in regard to these chemicals making firemen sick.”

Hermes is also angry that firefighters were exposed to the foam while some had evidence of their harms. “Industry knew this was happening but never never said anything to anybody” Hermes said referring to evidence that 3M and DuPont were aware of the risks of the PFAS chemicals in the foam. While the companies and the U.S. military have had evidence of the dangers of the chemicals for years Hermes said “We had no idea.”

“Industry knew this was happening but never never said anything to anybody.”

Hermes was exposed to AFFF when he was stationed at multiple Air Force bases between 1983 and 1989 including the Misawa Air Force Base in Japan. “You stayed in your gear a lot” he remembered of his time as an Air Force crash fire rescue worker. In 2016 at age 50 Hermes was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer. “It wasn’t the kind you watch and wait and follow” said Hermes who underwent surgery to remove his prostate and a subsequent surgery to address incontinence that was caused by the first surgery. Around the same time five of his colleagues were also diagnosed with various cancers. “All of us had the same work history — from the U.S. Air Force to working as an airport fireman” he said.

In 2017 Hermes who described the prostate cancer experience as physically and emotionally devastating applied for disability benefits based on the cancer. The VA denied his claim. “Their response has been: There is no proof scientifically or medically that PFAS was the cause of my cancer even though my own oncologist wrote a letter stating that it was his belief that it was more likely than not that the exposure was a primary contributing factor” said Hermes who reapplied for disability benefits last year. He is now awaiting the VA’s decision on his second application.

But even if the VA rules in his favor a decision that could give him a few thousand dollars a month Hermes says that won’t be a just outcome. “It’s not about getting the money” said Hermes. “It is about the validation that something is wrong with a system that allowed us to be poisoned by man-made chemicals which they knew about and said nothing. I just want them to admit they were wrong.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90ZW5jZW50LWhvbGRpbmdzLXN0b2NrLWFwcGVhcnMtZmFpcmx5LTIyMDAyMDgzOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tencent Holdings Stock Appears To Be Fairly Valued,"- By GF Value

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. Tencent Holdings's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 76% of the companies in Interactive Media industry. Tencent Holdings's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 27% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Interactive Media industry.

Another way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months Tencent Holdings's ROIC was 11.82 while its WACC came in at 8.25. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Tencent Holdings is shown below:

Tencent Holdings Stock Appears To Be Fairly Valued

In summary the stock of Tencent Holdings (OTCPK:TCEHY 30-year Financials) gives every indication of being fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks in the middle range of the companies in Interactive Media industry. To learn more about Tencent Holdings stock you can check out its 30-year Financials here.

And yet for Airbnb 2020 was successful. Proof of that can be found in the company’s December IPO which opened at $146 more than double the price it set the day before its market debut.

When Covid-19 hit the U.S. in March 2020 lockdowns became the norm worldwide and the travel industry—which had seen demand grow exponentially since 2014—suddenly seemed all but dead Airbnb responded directly to the abrupt changes in the way people were defining travel. Flying",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZXJpZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIxLzA2LzA2L2VyaWUtY2l0eS1jb3VuY2lsLWRlYmF0ZXMtem9uaW5nLWNoYW5nZXMtYWlyYm5iLXJlbnRhbHMvNzUzNjA1NjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Erie City Council debates proposed changes to zoning code for short-term rentals,"In November 2017 Erie's Zoning Hearing Board ruled in favor of a Glenwood neighborhood property owner who used her home as a short-term Airbnb rental.

The city's residential zoning code did not specifically prohibit such use ruled the board.

But the board reversed its ruling in August 2019 four months after a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision in the case of Slice of Life v. Hamilton Township Zoning Hearing Board out of Monroe County.

The high court ruled that such short-term rentals are prohibited unless a municipality's residential zoning code specifically permits them.

""This case flips it all around"" city solicitor Ed Betza told Erie City Council Thursday during a study session on short-term rentals. ""I've never seen anything like it with this analysis in 30 years. It now says that unless it is specifically permitted it is deemed prohibited.""

Zoning issue:Erie Airbnb zoning decision headed to court

Reversal:Erie Zoning Hearing Board reverses Airbnb decision

The state Supreme Court ruling Betza said placed the burden on property owners and municipalities. The Erie Planning Commission earlier this year approved changes to the city's zoning code that specifically addresses short-term rentals advertised on websites like Airbnb and VRBO. The issue now falls to Erie City Council which could vote on the proposed zoning amendments in late July.

""The city has to specifically identify where it wants to allow these"" Betza said Thursday

Rental licenses restrictions part of proposed changes

The proposed changes would require property owners to obtain a residential rental license from the city. No short-term rental could exceed the occupancy allowed within the applicable zoning district. Recreational vehicles campers and tents would be banned from overnight occupancy. And no occupant would be permitted to disturb the peace and quiet of the surrounding area or engage in disorderly conduct.

It would allow short-term rentals in medium- and high-density residential districts residential limited business districts; local- general- and central-commercial districts; and traditional neighborhood districts.

A short-term rental would be a conditional use in waterfront commercial and waterfront residential districts.

The proposed changes would place the most restrictions for short-term rentals in R1 and R1A residential areas where they would be considered ""special exceptions.""

R1 and R1A are zoning classifications for single-family homes the difference being that the latter is characterized by smaller lot sizes.

The restrictions for those zones address issues from parking to outdoor lighting and prohibit outdoor loudspeakers and sound systems. They also prohibit short-term rentals from being within 600 feet of one another and require owners to keep a log of guests and their dates of stay that can be inspected by the city upon request.

Owner-occupied provision

The owner of the short-term rental in these residential areas must use the home as their primary residence for a majority of the year.

""It doesn't mean the owner needs to be in the building when it is being rented however it does imply that the owner would be residing at that location for a good portion of the year and that that location be listed as the owner's primary address"" Planning Commission Secretary Jake Welsh told council members Thursday.

Councilwoman Liz Allen expressed concern about the owner-occupied provision.

""Because we haven't had regulations we know people have invested in properties"" Allen said ""and I think it would be unfair to assume that these would be (owned by) out-of-town corporations.""

She later added ""My concern is we know there have been some vocal opponents and proponents of this but I have a hunch that a lot of people in the city of Erie don't even know these regulations are being proposed. They may have bought something and don't intend to have that as their primary residence and they're going to be shortchanged by this.""

Look inside:Erie's bitty bungalow draws Airbnb customers

Welsh said he's been advising people who call him to inquire about such investments that the city has been working on regulations to address short-term rentals and that it's likely they will be permitted in zoning districts where other forms of short-term lodging are permitted or in commercial districts.

""The answers vary depending on the folks that are calling and what locations specifically they are looking at but we have to base our answers on the existing ordinance"" he said. ""I've given them some advice based on what the proposed recommendations are as far as future investment.""

Council President Ed Brzezinski noted the city does not know how many properties are being used as short-term rentals and therefore regulation will be the city's ""biggest problem.""

""How are we going to manage something that we don't know is out there?"" he asked.

""It's a code enforcement issue"" Betza said.

Tax revenue:Erie County wants bed tax on Airbnb

More:Erie County Council expands bed tax

'Imperfect system'

Planning Director Kathy Wyrosdick suggested that the city regulates such rentals the same way it has regulated long-term rentals through the city's rental registration program.

Many of them might already be registered as rentals she said.

""We just have to define the ones in the single-family districts as special exceptions that have to go through a different process"" she said.

Brzezinski then asked how the city would enforce something like the owner-occupied provision.

Wyrosdick acknowledged that the logistics of tracking these properties getting owners to register them and follow the zoning code will be ""tough"" because it is an ""imperfect system.""

""The laws on the books would give the city some enforcement measures if that situation was proven and in that case we can be reactionary when we discover the ones that are not following the letter of the law"" she said.

The Glenwood case which involves property on Upland Drive is in appeal. Betza believes Judge Stephanie Domitrovich is waiting for the city to address its zoning code in light of the state Supreme Court decision before ruling on the appeal.

City Council could take up the changes when it holds its July 21 meeting. In the meantime city officials like Wyrosdick and Welsh plan to compile more information about the number and location of existing short-term rentals.

East Lansing officials are very much opposed.

City of East Lansing 2021. East Lansing has 21 overlay districts each with different rules when it comes to rental properties.

East Lansing has 21 overlay districts each with different rules when it comes to rental properties including short-term and vacation rentals.

“Basically what these bills are attempting to do is take a one-size-fits all approach to short-term rentals in the state of Michigan” said East Lansing Mayor Aaron Stephens.

East Lansing has 21 overlay districts each with different rules when it comes to rental properties including short-term and vacation rentals.

If House bill 4722 or Senate bill 446 pass short-term rental rules would become the same in every district and East Lansing would need to allow them.

Stephens said these bills are putting every city in the same boat.

“We deal with our own unique rental challenges"" Stephens said. “East Lansing is different than Traverse City it’s different than Detroit right? So we have to treat issues differently.”

The bills define short-term rentals as housing available for no more than 30 days. Stephens said with the ease of renting these properties he's worried they'll turn into month-by-month leases effectively allowing rental properties where the city doesn't currently permit them.

Stephens said with the ease of renting these properties he's worried they'll turn into month-by-month leases.

“In a situation like this you could get on Airbnb and you could say 'All right I’m renting this home out for 30 days and you can just you know re-up your 30 days"" Stephens said. ""It’s a month-to-month lease and you don’t have to do re-inspection. You don’t have to get a license with the city.”

Stephens said allowing property owners to bypass important steps in the renting process like inspections could be dangerous.

“We have older homes in the city"" he said. ""Folks that are renting in the area we want to make sure that those homes are safe for people there so we do regular inspections. Another city might not necessarily need to do that because they don’t have the influx of rental properties.”

There were 50 active short-term rentals in East Lansing during the first quarter of 2021 according to data from the website airdna.co.

Stephens said if these bills pass everyone in the surrounding neighborhoods could be impacted.

With more Stephens worries that property values would skyrocket benefiting a few property owners but making the city less affordable for everyone else.

Property values could also skyrocket according to Stephens causing rent to become almost unaffordable.

“When you introduce a market of you can always Airbnb your property you know you’re going to see those prices increase and it’s going to be a lot more difficult for people to move in and live in the city” said Stephens.

Stephens said it could be beneficial to a few people but not to most.

The state legislators who introduced the bills did not respond to requests for comment.

Kai Lenny is a generational athlete. A specimen so rare that it is difficult for a mere mortal to take in and appreciate his vast talents in real time. We will need the history books to marvel appropriately at his feats. His big wave mastery windsurfing foil boarding even his dark passions like SUPping and befriending Mark Zuckerberg.

Well he has apparently mastered another dark passion. Road cycling.

I see the road cyclists riding on the Pacific Coast Highway often dressed in brightly colored lycra rompers often marked with IPA beer brewers taking up a full lane of traffic because it is somehow their right and I’ll be honest I fantasize about hitting them.

Like this.

Nothing overly violent just a small tap.

I would not fantasize about hitting Kai Lenny though and he has recently opened up about his new passion in a wide-ranging interview that appears on Velo News. (Velo of course Italian for IPA).

He told the author:

“What’s cool about riding here is that in surfing when you’re put into a position on big waves you’re committed to the situation you’re in there’s no time out. I think it’s good mental practice when you’re climbing up the mountain here you’re not going to stop… It’s learning to love the hurt. I think there’s a translation there — it’s key to have endurance when you’re surfing all day.”

Sadistic. Kai Lenny harbors sadistic thoughts no?

Later in the same article I read:

“I wanted to ride on every single island and foil between them. It was logistically kind of a nightmare and expensive. The reality is I’ve really only ridden on Maui. I’ve ridden a little in other places but not with an intention. I have friends on other islands who have road bikes so I thought it would be cool to link with them and connect the communities in between. It’s a long way close to five hundred miles. The total between ocean legs and miles on the bike is 460 miles total so we had nicknamed it the Hawaii 500. As soon as you landed on the beach you’d have to get on the bike. No relaxing. Either always pedaling or always pumping. Pedal to pump. Pray for the downhills or a big swell. The joke was we’d all need wheelchairs on the way home.”

I’ver seriously never even imagined anything so horrifying.

Or follow us on Google News

I just passed 15000 miles in my 2019 Tesla Model 3 SR+ and had a brief service visit. I figured this was a good time for an article on my service needs and experiences so far. This is service up to 3 months short of 2 years and as just noted right beyond 15000 miles.

Additionally during my recent service visit I got guidance on recommended or necessary service for the next few years which I think could be useful to share broadly.

Tesla Model 3 12V Battery Replacement

The service I got was a 12V battery replacement. I got a warning on the Tesla touchscreen when I went to charge one day that I needed to replace the 12V battery. Happily one of my young daughters didn’t see the warning pop up before me and purposefully or accidentally close the notification before I saw it because after dismissing the message I didn’t see it or any other notification about this again. (They are often jumping to the front to watch or play something when I go to plug in so I really could have missed the message and then had the car die on me.) It seems odd that Tesla doesn’t have this message remain somewhere (notification screen app etc.) until the issue is resolved but at least the girls didn’t get to it before me (this time).

When I was at a Tesla Service Center a few months before that I had already seen various forum discussions about Tesla vehicles getting this warning or dying without notice due to a dead 12V battery so I made sure to ask the service tech about it at that time. He said that you should get the battery replaced quickly after getting the warning. The car will still drive for a few days before the battery dies but not for very long. So I got to work and requested Tesla service to replace the 12V battery almost immediately.

I scheduled service via the app for an opening a few days later. The app indicated that it could be a mobile visit (also known as Ranger service) meaning I didn’t have to take the car to the service center — a Tesla technician just came to me.

My car is still under warranty so the battery swap was complimentary. I didn’t realize that beforehand so it was certainly a nice surprise.

Tesla Service Schedule

Back in the old days Tesla used to give Model S buyers a multi-year maintenance schedule. In fact you had to follow it or pay a fee if I recall correctly. However that wasn’t super popular new Tesla cars improved week after week even Tesla’s earliest vehicles proved the lack of need for much service and Tesla discontinued the service schedule. That said Teslas still do need some service.

Not knowing much about it and having an experienced Tesla employee right there to interrogate I asked the technician a few more questions when he was in my driveway and he offered up seemingly clear and convincing answers. He told me that the following service should be done at the designated timeframes:

Tires should be replaced as the tread gets to low. He told me mine need to be replaced in the next 2000–3000 miles or so — between about 17000 and 20000 miles. That sounds early but it’s apparently quite common with the Model 3 (ymmv). I’ll be sure to write an update in a couple of months or so.

After 2 years the car should have a brake fluid flush.

After 4 years the coolant should be replaced.

After 4–6 years the AC desiccant should be replaced.

Not too bad.

Previous Tesla Model 3 Service

Before now I had a minimal amount of service to check a few things (which didn’t really need checked) to replace the AC filter (which had gotten mildewy in the Florida heat and humidity) to rotate the tires and to glue a little trim in slightly that I thought might be sticking out too much.

A new HVAC filter cost $34 and a cleaning supply cost $16.50. Tesla Service labor would have come to $39.75 but it was done pro bono. Tesla had just recently pushed out an over-the-air firmware update to help limit how much this happened and how often the filter would need replaced and it was basically serviced without charge this time because of how soon after buying the vehicle it needed to be done (a bit more than a year into ownership).

I also asked them to check on several minor things which they did for free.

Lastly and the reason for going in I had my tires rotated which cost $35.

Almost one year prior in December 2020 I stopped into the service center to have them check a few things. Though it was all minimal and nothing needed to be done so the cost was $0.

Having owned a BMW i3 for 9 months before the Model 3 and having visited BMW service a handful of times one area where BMW did better is its service center was also much more attractive with a big TV a bunch of snacks and coffee options and a nicer and more open view. The Tesla service center a rather new one and certainly not a regional hub is much more barebones and almost warehouse-like. It’s not exactly an inspiring place. That said BMW dealers make a solid profit on service and charges well beyond their costs for many things whereas Tesla has held the view since Day 1 that service should not be a profit center and everything Tesla Service does is basically at cost.

All in all I’m very happy with Tesla Service. A few things could be a bit better but there’s very little to complain about and there’s a lot to be thankful for. It’s mostly simple quick and convenient. Also although there’s still the tendency there to worry that you’re going to spend too much on something you don’t need fixed or serviced yet the nice thing with Tesla is that you know it’s not trying to suck every dime out of you — it’s not looking to make service a profit center at all. Just don’t expect to be pampered too much and wooed for the same reason.

Or follow us on Google News

BMW Group has just made EV charging much easier for BMW and MINI electric vehicle owners in the UK. Naturally for many EV owners the vast majority of charging is done at home. However for those times when you need to charge away from home or if you don’t have home charging at all the most important thing to make EV life easier is to make public EV charging easy uniform and reliable. With that in mind it seems that BMW Group has made charging for its EV charging owners about as easy as it can get.

BMW & MINI EV Charging Made Easy

With a single charging card BMW and MINI EV drivers can charge at more than 11000 charge points in the UK. There’s also an app and website for each of them.

In addition to the 11000+ charging stations in the UK drivers have access to many more charging stations across Europe. The press release about the news mentions 173000 charge points. However the “MINI Charging” site mentions 237882 charge points and the “BMW Charging” site mentions 259345 charge points. Figure that out if you can.

Naturally these charge points are not BMW charge points. Rather the company has made partnerships with numerous charging networks and the BMW and MINI Charging cards give the drivers access to all of those networks. Currently networks these drivers have access to include: IONITY bp pulse (including ChargeYourCar) ESB Osprey Source London and Chargepoint Network UK (including INSTAVOLT) and others.

EV drivers have a choice of monthly charging packages (there are two of them) or they can choose a pay-as-you-go option. Here are many more details on the charging packages and options: “BMW or MINI Charging customers can register for a pay-as-you-go ‘Flex tariff’ which provides the driver with access to all included network operators using a single charge card without the need for a monthly membership or subscription to each individual operator. Customers choosing this tariff simply pay each month for the charging they have used.

“For drivers who use public charging more frequently BMW and MINI Charging offers two additional monthly subscription packages. The ‘bp pulse’ package (£7.85 per month) offers customers preferential pricing per/kWh when charging at over 5500 bp pulse charging points. Customers using up to 22kW AC pay just £0.12 per kWh up to 43kW AC or 50kW DC is £0.15 per kWh and up to 150kW DC at £0.27 per kWh.

“For drivers who use the IONITY charging network the ‘IONITY Plus’ package (£11.30 per month) provides access to a preferential rate of just £0.26 per kWh saving drivers £0.43 per kWh compared to the pay-as-you-go rate when using up to 350kW DC charging.

“Customers who purchase a new fully-electric or plug-in hybrid BMW or MINI via a BMW or MINI Centre – including the new MINI Electric – are offered the ‘bp pulse’ package for 12 months without subscription fee. BMW customers who purchase a new BMW iX3 or BMW iX vehicle via a BMW Centre are also eligible for the ‘IONITY Plus’ package for 12 months without subscription fee.”

BMW Electric Powertrain Production Ramping Up

This announcement comes as BMW ramps up pure electric vehicle production and sales and component sales. BMW recently announced that it has begun production of electric powertrains for the fully electric BMW iX and BMW i4 in in Dingolfing Germany which is where the electric motor for the BMW iX3 has been produced since 2020. Also production of 5th generation batteries and battery modules for the BMW iX and BMW i4 has begun in Dingolfing. And battery component production began at Plant Regensburg and Plant Leipzig in April and May 2021.

BMW actually produces what it calls e-drives. An e-drive is an electric motor power electronics and transmission integrated. BMW Group is investing more than €500 million from 2020 to 2022 into production capacity for e-drives at Dingolfing. At the end of that period it should be producing e-drives for 500000 electrified vehicles a year. (Of course some of the info here indicates that BMW is still partly focused on electrified vehicles that are not 100% fully electric.)

“We expect at least 50 percent of the vehicles we deliver to our customers worldwide to be electrified by 2030. To achieve this we are relying on our extensive in-house drive train expertise: We are increasing capacity at existing drive train production locations – like here in Dingolfing – and developing capabilities at others – like recently in Regensburg and Leipzig” explained Dr Michael Nikolaides Senior Vice President Production Engines and E-Drives BMW Group.

BMW iX and BMW i4 production is beginning soon as well. The former at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing and the latter at Plant Munich.

Don’t Miss Out — Electric Vehicle Growth Booming In UK & Europe

Of course BMW Group isn’t doing all of this out of saintly altruism. Electric vehicles are the future and increasingly the present. As Max Holland reported two days ago 14.7% of auto sales in the UK in May were plug-in vehicle sales. January through May “cumulative plugin share now stands at 13.8% up almost 2x from 7.2% by this point in 2020.”

Also although BMW was early to roll out a fully electric car built electric from the ground up (the i3) it is not exactly a leader in the market today. Actually well just look at the plug-in vehicle leaderboard for Europe as a whole and for the United Kingdom:

BMW has a long ways to go to be a serious player in the electric vehicle market. The iX and i4 are steps in the right direction and the news of increasing production capacity are good signs. Additionally the BMW & MINI Charging card rollout are yet another sign that BMW is pushing harder than before to open up the EV world to its customers.

We shall see.

ALGN,Align Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbGlnbi10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXN0b2NrLWdpdmVzLWV2ZXJ5LTIwMDAxNzk3OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Align Technology Stock Gives Every Indication Of Being Significantly Overvalued,"- By GF Value





The stock of Align Technology (NAS:ALGN 30-year Financials) appears to be significantly overvalued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $582.35 per share and the market cap of $46.1 billion Align Technology stock is believed to be significantly overvalued. GF Value for Align Technology is shown in the chart below.





Align Technology Stock Gives Every Indication Of Being Significantly Overvalued

Because Align Technology is significantly overvalued the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth which averaged 20.1% over the past three years and is estimated to grow 22.87% annually over the next three to five years.

Link: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.

Since investing in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss investors must carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Align Technology has a cash-to-debt ratio of 13.26 which ranks better than 69% of the companies in the industry of Medical Devices & Instruments. Based on this GuruFocus ranks Align Technology's financial strength as 7 out of 10 suggesting fair balance sheet. This is the debt and cash of Align Technology over the past years:

Align Technology Stock Gives Every Indication Of Being Significantly Overvalued

Companies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors who may want to purchase shares. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Align Technology has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months the company had a revenue of $2.8 billion and earnings of $5.75 a share. Its operating margin is 19.27% which ranks better than 80% of the companies in the industry of Medical Devices & Instruments. Overall the profitability of Align Technology is ranked 9 out of 10 which indicates strong profitability. This is the revenue and net income of Align Technology over the past years:

One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Align Technology is 20.1% which ranks better than 79% of the companies in the industry of Medical Devices & Instruments. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 8.3% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Medical Devices & Instruments.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Align Technology's return on invested capital is 11.92 and its cost of capital is 11.20. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Align Technology is shown below:

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzA2LzMtdGVjaC1zdG9ja3MtdGhhdC1jYW4tc29hci1kZXNwaXRlLWluZmxhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Tech Stocks That Can Soar Despite Inflation,"Prices on goods and services are up as the economy reopens but that's no reason to stop investing.

Inflation has picked up pace this year as effects from the pandemic ease and pent-up consumer demand for certain goods and services gets unleashed. For the record a little inflation is indicative of a healthy or rebounding economy so there's no need to panic just yet. But if higher inflation is a more prolonged problem having some money stashed away in some stocks that can still thrive will be a good move. Three that are worth a look right now are PayPal (PYPL -0.14%) Alphabet (GOOGL 0.51%) (GOOG 0.50%) and Micron Technology (MU 4.73%).

Digital payments could actually flourish in an inflationary environment

Nicholas Rossolillo (PayPal): I started loading up on digital payments stocks early this year in anticipation of higher consumer spending and I'm still a buyer now that money is flowing through the economy again at a fast pace and causing some spikes in prices. In fact as long as higher pricing doesn't continue to rise unabated for years a little inflation would actually be a positive for payment processors like PayPal.

The reason is the digital payments space collects a percentage fee for processing a transaction. If average transaction values increase the fees paid to companies like PayPal increase as well. Added to the strong and steady growth already expected this year this could set up PayPal shares for continued success where other stocks might stumble in such an inflationary environment.

Specifically PayPal is forecasting full-year 2021 revenue growth of about 20%. And since it's reaching a more profitable scale as it expands the reach of its payments and financial technology services network profitability will likely grow at an even faster rate. For reference PayPal's free cash flow rose 50% last year on a full-year sales increase of 23%. Talk about inflation beating business growth.

Adding to the case for PayPal the company ended March 2021 with $13.1 billion in cash and equivalents and another $5.99 billion in long-term investments offset by debt of just $8.94 billion. This is a rock solid leader in fintech and next-gen banking services growing at a rate that will far outpace (or even get a small boost from) some inflation. Shares currently value PayPal at 59 times trailing-12-month free cash flow not so unreasonable given the booming bottom line. Inflation or not I say this stock is a buy for the long haul.

The ABCs of market-leading stability

Anders Bylund (Alphabet): Raging inflation is often a precursor to a sharp correction to the stock market. For example the U.S. inflation rate stood at 5.6% in the summer of 2008 a multi-year high that was more than double the 2.4% rate seen a year earlier. The financial crisis that followed was the stuff of legend. History doesn't exactly repeat itself but you will often find that it rhymes. The 2008 crisis was primed by reckless investments in subprime mortgages and today's soaring stock market looks like an over-extended rebound from last year's COVID-19 recession. In other words the rising inflation rates we see right now could very well be an early sign of the next dramatic correction.

That's why this market tenor makes me want to buy stocks that should survive and thrive when that looming market drop shows up. And if their prices fall in the early days of the next market panic it should be an easy decision to buy more of them at lower prices.

One of the best ways to stay ahead of galloping inflation and future market crashes is to invest in Alphabet. The Google parent is built to last a lifetime weathering all sorts of market storms with a shrug and generate shareholder wealth along the way.

The key to Alphabet's long-term value is found in the company's extreme flexibility. What started as an innovative search engine has grown into a multi-industry conglomerate that dominates key sectors such as smartphones and online advertising services. The company is brewing up a plethora of business ideas like self-driving cars advanced medical research and quantum computing. Whatever marketwide sea change comes next Alphabet will be ready to adapt in a hurry.

Sure Alphabet's stock tends to get swept up in every recession-defining market crash but the share prices are always quick to recover. It's almost silly how badly Alphabet's twin stocks are beating the broader market in the long haul:

Alphabet's shares can take a licking and keep on ticking. That's a winning quality in the eternal battle between investors and inflation.

Higher chip prices equals massive cash flows for this cheap stock

Billy Duberstein (Micron Technology): Although discount rates go up with inflation it's possible for certain types of stocks to do well in inflationary times. These include commodity-related stocks in commodities experiencing the inflation or companies with enough pricing power that can raise prices.

Micron is the former as a sort of ""technology commodity"" company that makes basic DRAM and NAND flash memory components. Unlike proprietary logic chips such as those made by NVIDIA (NVDA 3.77%) the prices of memory chips fluctuate with global supply and demand not unlike oil or steel or agricultural products.

As is well-known the world is currently in a severe chip shortage. The 2018-2019 trade war and then the 2020 pandemic have caused chipmakers to cut back on supply and for chip users to draw down their inventory. But with the pandemic accelerating digital trends 5G phones coming to market and the economy roaring back huge demand is now overwhelming muted supply. Additionally chip supply can't just be ""turned on"" at the flip of a switch. Chipmakers need to build fabs and machines and produce these difficult-to-manufacture tech commodities without defects.

That has caused memory prices to rise this year. DRAM prices were up 8.7% quarter over quarter in the first quarter and are expected to rise another 18%-23% in Q2.

Thus it's no surprise that at a recent industry conference Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the company's May quarter revenue was likely to be ""at or above"" the high end of Micron's previous guidance with ""strong earnings."" Micron will report its May quarter earnings on June 30.

Yet another reason to be optimistic is that Micron has surged ahead of competitors on leading technology as the first memory company to produce both 176-layer NAND and the 1-alpha node in DRAM. The company just released a press release highlighting new products based on these advanced nodes for data center servers intelligent vehicles and 5G phones and laptops. These products are just hitting the market now and should be even more profitable for the company in the second half of this year.

While rising inflation and perhaps interest rates may hurt high-multiple stocks the cyclical Micron only trades at eight times next year's earnings estimates so it shouldn't be too affected by higher rates. Skeptical investors may be anticipating the end of the cycle that just started but Micron's improved technology position vis-a-vis competitors should make it more profitable through future cycles. If that's the case the stock is still a bargain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyb3lyZWNvcmQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMDUvNTE5LTM0LWJuLWdyb3d0aC1leHBlY3RlZC1pbi1nbG9iYWwtZGF0YS1jZW50ZXItbWFya2V0LWR1cmluZy0yMDIxLTIwMjUtdGVjaG5hdmlvL9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyb3lyZWNvcmQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMDUvNTE5LTM0LWJuLWdyb3d0aC1leHBlY3RlZC1pbi1nbG9iYWwtZGF0YS1jZW50ZXItbWFya2V0LWR1cmluZy0yMDIxLTIwMjUtdGVjaG5hdmlvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$ 519.34 Bn growth expected in Global Data Center Market during 2021-2025 | Technavio,"NEW YORK June 5 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Set to grow by USD 519.34 bn during 2021-2025 Technavio’s latest market research report estimates the data center market to register a CAGR of over 21%.

AI has ridden the tailcoats of Moore's Law which states that the speed and capability of computers can be expected to double every two years. Since 2012 the amount of compute used in the largest AI training runs has been increasing exponentially with a doubling every 3 to 4 months with the end result that the amount of computing resources allocated to AI has grown by 300000x since 2012. No other industry can compare with these growth statistics.

We will explore what fields of AI are leading this acceleration what companies are best positioned to take advantage of this growth and why it matters.

Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of AI which is essentially programming machines to learn. There are multiple types of machine learning algorithms the most popular by far is deep learning this involves feeding data into an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). An ANN is a very compute intensive network of mathematical functions joined together in a format inspired by the neural networks found in the human brain.

The more big data that is fed into an ANN the more precise the ANN becomes. For example if you are attempting to train an ANN to learn how to identify cat pictures if you feed the network 1000 cat pictures the network will have a small level of accuracy of perhaps 70% if you increase it to 10000 pictures the level of accuracy may increase to 80% if you increase it by 100000 pictures then you have just increased the accuracy of the network to 90% and onwards.

Herein lies one of the opportunities companies that dominate the field of AI chip development are naturally ripe for growth.

There are many other types of machine learning that show promise such as reinforcement learning this is training an agent through the repetition of actions and associated rewards. By using reinforcement learning an AI system can compete against itself with the intention of improving how well it performs. For example a program playing chess will play against itself repeatedly with every instance of the gameplay improving how it performs in the next game.

Currently the best types of AI use a combination of both deep learning and reinforcement learning in what is commonly referred to as deep reinforcement learning. All of the leading AI companies in the world such as Tesla use some type of deep reinforcement learning.

While there are other types of important machine learning systems that are currently being advanced such as meta-learning for the sake of simplicity deep learning and it's more advanced cousin deep reinforcement learning are what investors should be most familiar with. The companies that are at the forefront of this technological advancement will be best positioned to take advantage of the huge exponential growth we are witnessing in AI.

Data Science & Big Data

If there is one differentiator between companies that will succeed and become market leaders and companies that will fail it is big data. All types of machine learning are heavily reliant on data science this is best described as a process of understanding the world from patterns in data. In this case the AI is learning from data and the more data the more accurate the results. There are some exceptions to this rule due to what is called overfitting but this is a concern that AI developers are aware of and take precautions to compensate for.

The importance of big data is why companies such as Tesla have a clear market advantage when it comes to autonomous vehicle technology. Every single Tesla that is in motion and using auto-pilot is feeding data into the cloud. This enables Tesla to use deep reinforcement learning and other algorithm tweaks in order to improve the overall autonomous vehicle system.

This is also why companies such as Google will be so difficult for challengers to dethrone. Every day that goes by is a day that Google collects data from its myriad of products and services this includes search results Google Adsense Android mobile device the Chrome web browser and even the Nest thermostat. Google is drowning is more data than any other company in the world. This is not even counting all of the moonshots they are involved in.

By understanding why deep learning and data science matters we can then infer why the companies below are so powerful.

AI Companies to Invest In

There are three current market leaders that are going to be very difficult to challenge.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL

Alphabet Inc is the umbrella company for all Google products which includes the Google search engine. A short history lesson is necessary to explain why they are such a market leader in AI. In 2010 a British company DeepMind was launched with the goal of applying various machine learning techniques towards building general-purpose learning algorithms.

In 2013 DeepMind took the world by storm with various accomplishments including becoming world champion at seven Atari games by using deep reinforcement learning.

In 2014 Google acquired DeepMind for $500 Million shortly thereafter in 2015 DeepMind's AlphaGo became the first AI program to defeat a professional human Go player and the first program to defeat a Go world champion. For those who are unfamiliar with Go it is considered by many to be the most challenging game in existence.

DeepMind is currently considered a market leader in deep reinforcement learning and a leading contender for achievingArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) a futuristic type of AI with the goal of eventually achieving or surpassing human level intelligence.

We still need to factor in the other other types of AI that Google is currently involved in such as Waymo a market leader in automonous vehicle technology second only to Tesla and the secretive AI systems currently used in the Google search engine.

Google is currently involved in so many levels of AI that it would take an exhaustive paper to cover them all.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA

As previously stated Tesla is taking advantage of big data from its fleet of on-road vehicles to collect data from its auto-pilot. The more data that is collected the more it can improve using deep reinforcement learning this is especially important for what are deemed as edge cases this is known as scenarios that don't happen frequently in real-life.

For example it is impossible to predict and program in every type of scenario that may happen on the road such as a suitcase rolling into traffic or a plane falling from the sky. In this case there is very little specific data and the system needs to associate data from many different scenarios. This is another advantage of having a huge amount of data while it may be the first time a Tesla in Houston encounters a scenario it is possible that a Tesla in Dubai may have encountered something similar.

Tesla is also a market leader in battery technology and in electric technology for vehicles. Both of these rely on AI systems to optimize the range of a vehicle before a recharge is required. Tesla is known for its frequent on-air updates with AI optimizations that improve by a few percentage points the performance and range of its vehicle fleet.

As if this was not sufficient Tesla is also designing its own AI chips this means it is no longer reliant on third-party chips and they can optimize chips to work with their full self-driving software from the ground up.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA

NVIDIA is the company best positioned to take advantage of the current rise in demand in GPU (Graphics processing unit) chips as they are currently responsible for 80% of all GPU sales.

While GPUs were initially used for video games they were quickly adopted by the AI industry specifically for deep learning. The reason GPUs are so important is that the speed of AI computations is greatly enhanced when computations are carried out in parallel. While training a deep learning ANN inputs are required and this depends heavily on matrix multiplications where parallelism is important.

NVIDIA is constantly releasing new AI chips that are optimized for different use cases and requirements of AI researchers. It is this constant pressure to innovate that is maintaining NVIDIA as a market leader.

The first step in your journey should be to choose a stock broker. A broker that we recommend is Firstrade.

Summary

It is impossible to list all of the companies that are involved in some form of AI what is important is understanding the machine learning technologies that are responsible for most of the innovation and growth that the industry has witnessed. We have highlighted 3 market leaders many more will come along. To keep abreast of AI you should stay current with AI news avoid AI hype and understand that this field is constantly evolving.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2dsb2JhbC1lZHVjYXRpb24tYXBwcy1tYXJrZXQtLS00Ni04OC1iaWxsaW9uLWdyb3d0aC1leHBlY3RlZC1kdXJpbmctMjAyMC0yMDI0LS10ZWNobmF2aW8tMzAxMzA2MjA5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global Education Apps Market | $ 46.88 Billion growth expected during 2020-2024 | Technavio,"The report offers an up-to-date analysis regarding the current global market scenario and the overall market environment.

GOOG,Alphabet Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzA2LzMtdGVjaC1zdG9ja3MtdGhhdC1jYW4tc29hci1kZXNwaXRlLWluZmxhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Tech Stocks That Can Soar Despite Inflation,"Prices on goods and services are up as the economy reopens but that's no reason to stop investing.

Inflation has picked up pace this year as effects from the pandemic ease and pent-up consumer demand for certain goods and services gets unleashed. For the record a little inflation is indicative of a healthy or rebounding economy so there's no need to panic just yet. But if higher inflation is a more prolonged problem having some money stashed away in some stocks that can still thrive will be a good move. Three that are worth a look right now are PayPal (PYPL -0.14%) Alphabet (GOOGL 0.51%) (GOOG 0.50%) and Micron Technology (MU 4.73%).

Digital payments could actually flourish in an inflationary environment

Nicholas Rossolillo (PayPal): I started loading up on digital payments stocks early this year in anticipation of higher consumer spending and I'm still a buyer now that money is flowing through the economy again at a fast pace and causing some spikes in prices. In fact as long as higher pricing doesn't continue to rise unabated for years a little inflation would actually be a positive for payment processors like PayPal.

The reason is the digital payments space collects a percentage fee for processing a transaction. If average transaction values increase the fees paid to companies like PayPal increase as well. Added to the strong and steady growth already expected this year this could set up PayPal shares for continued success where other stocks might stumble in such an inflationary environment.

Specifically PayPal is forecasting full-year 2021 revenue growth of about 20%. And since it's reaching a more profitable scale as it expands the reach of its payments and financial technology services network profitability will likely grow at an even faster rate. For reference PayPal's free cash flow rose 50% last year on a full-year sales increase of 23%. Talk about inflation beating business growth.

Adding to the case for PayPal the company ended March 2021 with $13.1 billion in cash and equivalents and another $5.99 billion in long-term investments offset by debt of just $8.94 billion. This is a rock solid leader in fintech and next-gen banking services growing at a rate that will far outpace (or even get a small boost from) some inflation. Shares currently value PayPal at 59 times trailing-12-month free cash flow not so unreasonable given the booming bottom line. Inflation or not I say this stock is a buy for the long haul.

The ABCs of market-leading stability

Anders Bylund (Alphabet): Raging inflation is often a precursor to a sharp correction to the stock market. For example the U.S. inflation rate stood at 5.6% in the summer of 2008 a multi-year high that was more than double the 2.4% rate seen a year earlier. The financial crisis that followed was the stuff of legend. History doesn't exactly repeat itself but you will often find that it rhymes. The 2008 crisis was primed by reckless investments in subprime mortgages and today's soaring stock market looks like an over-extended rebound from last year's COVID-19 recession. In other words the rising inflation rates we see right now could very well be an early sign of the next dramatic correction.

That's why this market tenor makes me want to buy stocks that should survive and thrive when that looming market drop shows up. And if their prices fall in the early days of the next market panic it should be an easy decision to buy more of them at lower prices.

One of the best ways to stay ahead of galloping inflation and future market crashes is to invest in Alphabet. The Google parent is built to last a lifetime weathering all sorts of market storms with a shrug and generate shareholder wealth along the way.

The key to Alphabet's long-term value is found in the company's extreme flexibility. What started as an innovative search engine has grown into a multi-industry conglomerate that dominates key sectors such as smartphones and online advertising services. The company is brewing up a plethora of business ideas like self-driving cars advanced medical research and quantum computing. Whatever marketwide sea change comes next Alphabet will be ready to adapt in a hurry.

Sure Alphabet's stock tends to get swept up in every recession-defining market crash but the share prices are always quick to recover. It's almost silly how badly Alphabet's twin stocks are beating the broader market in the long haul:

Alphabet's shares can take a licking and keep on ticking. That's a winning quality in the eternal battle between investors and inflation.

Higher chip prices equals massive cash flows for this cheap stock

Billy Duberstein (Micron Technology): Although discount rates go up with inflation it's possible for certain types of stocks to do well in inflationary times. These include commodity-related stocks in commodities experiencing the inflation or companies with enough pricing power that can raise prices.

Micron is the former as a sort of ""technology commodity"" company that makes basic DRAM and NAND flash memory components. Unlike proprietary logic chips such as those made by NVIDIA (NVDA 3.77%) the prices of memory chips fluctuate with global supply and demand not unlike oil or steel or agricultural products.

As is well-known the world is currently in a severe chip shortage. The 2018-2019 trade war and then the 2020 pandemic have caused chipmakers to cut back on supply and for chip users to draw down their inventory. But with the pandemic accelerating digital trends 5G phones coming to market and the economy roaring back huge demand is now overwhelming muted supply. Additionally chip supply can't just be ""turned on"" at the flip of a switch. Chipmakers need to build fabs and machines and produce these difficult-to-manufacture tech commodities without defects.

That has caused memory prices to rise this year. DRAM prices were up 8.7% quarter over quarter in the first quarter and are expected to rise another 18%-23% in Q2.

Thus it's no surprise that at a recent industry conference Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the company's May quarter revenue was likely to be ""at or above"" the high end of Micron's previous guidance with ""strong earnings."" Micron will report its May quarter earnings on June 30.

Yet another reason to be optimistic is that Micron has surged ahead of competitors on leading technology as the first memory company to produce both 176-layer NAND and the 1-alpha node in DRAM. The company just released a press release highlighting new products based on these advanced nodes for data center servers intelligent vehicles and 5G phones and laptops. These products are just hitting the market now and should be even more profitable for the company in the second half of this year.

While rising inflation and perhaps interest rates may hurt high-multiple stocks the cyclical Micron only trades at eight times next year's earnings estimates so it shouldn't be too affected by higher rates. Skeptical investors may be anticipating the end of the cycle that just started but Micron's improved technology position vis-a-vis competitors should make it more profitable through future cycles. If that's the case the stock is still a bargain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyb3lyZWNvcmQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMDUvNTE5LTM0LWJuLWdyb3d0aC1leHBlY3RlZC1pbi1nbG9iYWwtZGF0YS1jZW50ZXItbWFya2V0LWR1cmluZy0yMDIxLTIwMjUtdGVjaG5hdmlvL9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyb3lyZWNvcmQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMDUvNTE5LTM0LWJuLWdyb3d0aC1leHBlY3RlZC1pbi1nbG9iYWwtZGF0YS1jZW50ZXItbWFya2V0LWR1cmluZy0yMDIxLTIwMjUtdGVjaG5hdmlvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$ 519.34 Bn growth expected in Global Data Center Market during 2021-2025 | Technavio,"NEW YORK June 5 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Set to grow by USD 519.34 bn during 2021-2025 Technavio’s latest market research report estimates the data center market to register a CAGR of over 21%.

AI has ridden the tailcoats of Moore's Law which states that the speed and capability of computers can be expected to double every two years. Since 2012 the amount of compute used in the largest AI training runs has been increasing exponentially with a doubling every 3 to 4 months with the end result that the amount of computing resources allocated to AI has grown by 300000x since 2012. No other industry can compare with these growth statistics.

We will explore what fields of AI are leading this acceleration what companies are best positioned to take advantage of this growth and why it matters.

Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of AI which is essentially programming machines to learn. There are multiple types of machine learning algorithms the most popular by far is deep learning this involves feeding data into an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). An ANN is a very compute intensive network of mathematical functions joined together in a format inspired by the neural networks found in the human brain.

The more big data that is fed into an ANN the more precise the ANN becomes. For example if you are attempting to train an ANN to learn how to identify cat pictures if you feed the network 1000 cat pictures the network will have a small level of accuracy of perhaps 70% if you increase it to 10000 pictures the level of accuracy may increase to 80% if you increase it by 100000 pictures then you have just increased the accuracy of the network to 90% and onwards.

Herein lies one of the opportunities companies that dominate the field of AI chip development are naturally ripe for growth.

There are many other types of machine learning that show promise such as reinforcement learning this is training an agent through the repetition of actions and associated rewards. By using reinforcement learning an AI system can compete against itself with the intention of improving how well it performs. For example a program playing chess will play against itself repeatedly with every instance of the gameplay improving how it performs in the next game.

Currently the best types of AI use a combination of both deep learning and reinforcement learning in what is commonly referred to as deep reinforcement learning. All of the leading AI companies in the world such as Tesla use some type of deep reinforcement learning.

While there are other types of important machine learning systems that are currently being advanced such as meta-learning for the sake of simplicity deep learning and it's more advanced cousin deep reinforcement learning are what investors should be most familiar with. The companies that are at the forefront of this technological advancement will be best positioned to take advantage of the huge exponential growth we are witnessing in AI.

Data Science & Big Data

If there is one differentiator between companies that will succeed and become market leaders and companies that will fail it is big data. All types of machine learning are heavily reliant on data science this is best described as a process of understanding the world from patterns in data. In this case the AI is learning from data and the more data the more accurate the results. There are some exceptions to this rule due to what is called overfitting but this is a concern that AI developers are aware of and take precautions to compensate for.

The importance of big data is why companies such as Tesla have a clear market advantage when it comes to autonomous vehicle technology. Every single Tesla that is in motion and using auto-pilot is feeding data into the cloud. This enables Tesla to use deep reinforcement learning and other algorithm tweaks in order to improve the overall autonomous vehicle system.

This is also why companies such as Google will be so difficult for challengers to dethrone. Every day that goes by is a day that Google collects data from its myriad of products and services this includes search results Google Adsense Android mobile device the Chrome web browser and even the Nest thermostat. Google is drowning is more data than any other company in the world. This is not even counting all of the moonshots they are involved in.

By understanding why deep learning and data science matters we can then infer why the companies below are so powerful.

AI Companies to Invest In

There are three current market leaders that are going to be very difficult to challenge.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL

Alphabet Inc is the umbrella company for all Google products which includes the Google search engine. A short history lesson is necessary to explain why they are such a market leader in AI. In 2010 a British company DeepMind was launched with the goal of applying various machine learning techniques towards building general-purpose learning algorithms.

In 2013 DeepMind took the world by storm with various accomplishments including becoming world champion at seven Atari games by using deep reinforcement learning.

In 2014 Google acquired DeepMind for $500 Million shortly thereafter in 2015 DeepMind's AlphaGo became the first AI program to defeat a professional human Go player and the first program to defeat a Go world champion. For those who are unfamiliar with Go it is considered by many to be the most challenging game in existence.

DeepMind is currently considered a market leader in deep reinforcement learning and a leading contender for achievingArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) a futuristic type of AI with the goal of eventually achieving or surpassing human level intelligence.

We still need to factor in the other other types of AI that Google is currently involved in such as Waymo a market leader in automonous vehicle technology second only to Tesla and the secretive AI systems currently used in the Google search engine.

Google is currently involved in so many levels of AI that it would take an exhaustive paper to cover them all.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA

As previously stated Tesla is taking advantage of big data from its fleet of on-road vehicles to collect data from its auto-pilot. The more data that is collected the more it can improve using deep reinforcement learning this is especially important for what are deemed as edge cases this is known as scenarios that don't happen frequently in real-life.

For example it is impossible to predict and program in every type of scenario that may happen on the road such as a suitcase rolling into traffic or a plane falling from the sky. In this case there is very little specific data and the system needs to associate data from many different scenarios. This is another advantage of having a huge amount of data while it may be the first time a Tesla in Houston encounters a scenario it is possible that a Tesla in Dubai may have encountered something similar.

Tesla is also a market leader in battery technology and in electric technology for vehicles. Both of these rely on AI systems to optimize the range of a vehicle before a recharge is required. Tesla is known for its frequent on-air updates with AI optimizations that improve by a few percentage points the performance and range of its vehicle fleet.

As if this was not sufficient Tesla is also designing its own AI chips this means it is no longer reliant on third-party chips and they can optimize chips to work with their full self-driving software from the ground up.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA

NVIDIA is the company best positioned to take advantage of the current rise in demand in GPU (Graphics processing unit) chips as they are currently responsible for 80% of all GPU sales.

While GPUs were initially used for video games they were quickly adopted by the AI industry specifically for deep learning. The reason GPUs are so important is that the speed of AI computations is greatly enhanced when computations are carried out in parallel. While training a deep learning ANN inputs are required and this depends heavily on matrix multiplications where parallelism is important.

NVIDIA is constantly releasing new AI chips that are optimized for different use cases and requirements of AI researchers. It is this constant pressure to innovate that is maintaining NVIDIA as a market leader.

Summary

It is impossible to list all of the companies that are involved in some form of AI what is important is understanding the machine learning technologies that are responsible for most of the innovation and growth that the industry has witnessed. We have highlighted 3 market leaders many more will come along. To keep abreast of AI you should stay current with AI news avoid AI hype and understand that this field is constantly evolving.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2dsb2JhbC1lZHVjYXRpb24tYXBwcy1tYXJrZXQtLS00Ni04OC1iaWxsaW9uLWdyb3d0aC1leHBlY3RlZC1kdXJpbmctMjAyMC0yMDI0LS10ZWNobmF2aW8tMzAxMzA2MjA5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global Education Apps Market | $ 46.88 Billion growth expected during 2020-2024 | Technavio,"The report offers an up-to-date analysis regarding the current global market scenario and the overall market environment.

Someone had been brought in to supposedly teach Mintz then a ninth-grader and his classmates about the dangers of tobacco and vaping. But the speaker had been sent by Juul Labs the company behind the discreet vaping device that Mintz and nearly all of his friends had tried.

The man gave a pretty standard spiel except Caleb noticed he kept mentioning how safe Juul was.

After the presentation Caleb and a friend asked the speaker how they might help a pal addicted to nicotine. The man — who wrongly assumed the friend was addicted to cigarettes (he actually had a vaping problem) — took out his Juul to show the boys how it worked.

“I really felt like there was an ulterior motive” Caleb told author Jamie Ducharme who reports on the company in her new book “Big Vape: The Incendiary Rise of Juul.”

Indeed there was. In 2018 Juul gave at least three private and public schools $10000 or more to participate in their Education and Youth Prevention Program whose stated purpose was “to educate youth on the dangers of nicotine addiction.” (Dwight said it received no money for participation.)

But the curriculum never mentioned the role of marketing and social media in getting people hooked the author reveals. In fact Ducharme writes that experts thought “Juul seemed to be attempting to imply that other forms of e-cigarettes were risky to use but that the Juul was not” she writes.

In her book Ducharme shows how Juul was started with the intention of creating a healthier alternative to Big Tobacco but ended up becoming part of it. And while the vaping device’s inventors were repeatedly cautioned about how their creation might appeal to teens they ignored such warnings resulting in an epic Silicon Valley downfall.

“They let history repeat itself walking the path laid by Big Tobacco as they pushed out flashy advertisements sent their representatives into schools and finally accepted billions of dollars from the largest cigarette maker in the country” Ducharme writes.

Juul started from an idealistic place. Co-founders James Monsees and Adam Bowen were friends and classmates in the prestigious graduate program in product design at Stanford University in the aughts and they were both smokers. On a cigarette break in 2004 the two men realized they didn’t want to be beholden to tobacco sticks anymore.

So they set about feverishly developing a portable product that would deliver nicotine in a safer way than cigarettes helping those who were addicted to cigs and hoping to be a boon to public health.

“If they couldn’t find a way to quit smoking they would invent one themselves” writes Ducharme.

But some of their professors worried that they were moving too quickly former classmate Colter Leys recalled.

“From an academic point of view I think it was like ‘Wow that’s cool but let’s try to investigate some of the different options that this could be’ ” Leys said. “And I think James and Adam were kind of like ‘Let’s drive ahead.’ ”

The duo did agree to do more research. An archive of internal tobacco industry documents had just been made public at a nearby university and they dove into it.

6 Both smokers Monsees and Bowen first met at Stanford University where they designed an e-cigarette for a thesis presentation. Alamy (2)

But while the files offered a cautionary tale they were also a “gold mine” for “two graduate students trying to turn a bright idea into a blockbuster product” Ducharme writes. “Without ever holding a focus group they could analyze market research about consumer preferences and tastes. They could sift through internal memos to learn how tobacco companies had sold their products to just about any and every demographic — including as they admitted teenagers.”

In 2005 the two men presented their thesis project a portable vape pen they called the Ploom that would heat little pods of flavored tobacco to create nicotine-laced clouds that could be inhaled. Their design took inspiration both from Nespresso coffee pods and the hookahs popular with college kids at the time.

“It turns out actually that burning tobacco is the real problem” Monsees said in his presentation. “Nicotine is addictive clearly but it’s not the nicotine that’s really hurting you; it’s mostly the combustion [burning of tobacco leaves and additives] that’s a problem.”

Upon graduation Monsees and Bowen launched a startup in San Francisco collecting money from various venture capitalists to turn their design into a reality. They released their first product the Ploom ModelOne in 2010 but it was plagued with problems. It relied on butane fuel and users had to carry around a little can of the stuff to refill it as needed; it also was known to shock customers.

It cracked the code of delivering ‘smoke’ without fire and it did so in a way that people found irresistible. author Jamie Ducharme on the success of Juul

Still it showed promise and in 2011 Japan Tobacco Inc. — the fourth-largest tobacco company in the world — invested $10 million in Ploom.

Fueled by that cash influx Ploom released a different vaporizer the Pax in 2012. It didn’t use butane but instead required users to fill a small compartment with loose-leaf tobacco that was then heated and vaporized by an internal battery. It was sleek and chic drawing comparisons to Apple products but it came with a steep $250 price tag. Both the ModelOne and the Pax were released into a marketplace of uncool e-cigarettes and next-to-no oversight from the FDA which wasn’t able to regulate tobacco products of any sort until 2009 — and didn’t start regulating e-cigarettes until 2016.

“All anyone needed to get into the vaping business was an idea and a credit card” Ducharme writes. “[At the time] there wasn’t even a federal law on the books that made it illegal to sell e-cigarettes to minors although many were implemented at the state level.”

The Pax was a success but Monsees and Bowen knew they needed to create a more modestly priced product to achieve broad sales. And they needed a gadget that would deliver a stronger hit of nicotine. Adam would vape “all day long and still find himself with nicotine cravings” Ducharme writes.

Most e-cigs at the time relied upon freebase nicotine which can be harsh to inhale so the founders started looking into using a nicotine salt — a mix of nicotine and acid pioneered in the 1970s. Thanks to that formulation the Juul was born packing a strong buzz in an elegant package. Thin and just under 4 inches in length it resembled a USB drive. It activated automatically when a user inhaled and featured a light that turned green when charged red when the battery was low and flashed rainbow when waved about.

6 Juul’s “Vaporized” ad campaign appealed to young adults and teens.

“Beautifully constructed eminently usable and scientifically sophisticated the Juul was perhaps the first e-cigarette that actually stood a chance of dethroning combustible cigarettes” Ducharme writes. “It cracked the code of delivering ‘smoke’ without fire and it did so in a way that people found irresistible.”

A big fashionable party at a huge industrial loft space in Chelsea kicked things off. There were buzzy DJs food from a former “Top Chef” contestant free-flowing alcohol and lots of Juuls scattered about for the taking. A sexy marketing campaign called “Vaporized” furthered Juul’s appeal — targeting “New York trendsetters” and “cool kids” to counter the douchey reputation vaping had at the time. The ads ran in youth-oriented outlets like Vice magazine and YoungHollywood.com a celebrity-focused Web site as well as on Times Square billboards and in convenience stores and retail spaces. The campaign “bore more than a passing resemblance to old advertisements for cigarette brands like Kool Lucky Strike and Parliament” Ducharme writes.

The company also sent out products to hundreds of influencers and celebs including Leonardo DiCaprio and Bella Hadid who was only 19 at the time.

“Juul’s ads may not have been made with kids in mind — indeed the company has strongly and repeatedly said they were not — but they certainly appealed to people who held a lot of sway with teenagers” Ducharme writes.

Then-supply chain head Paul Moraes actually recalls voicing concerns about the advertising.

“It didn’t take someone with a Ph.D. to say ‘Hey guys follow the logical conclusions of where this is going to go’ ” he told Ducharme.

Moraes also remembers Monsees passionately stressing around that time that Juul was for adult smokers but both he and Bowen saw the Vaporized campaign before it went up and didn’t stop it.

The gadget wasn’t an immediate hit but it eventually became one as word of mouth increased e-cigs in general became more popular and a greater number of convenience stores carried the Juul. In 2017 Juul Labs sold 16.2 million vaporizers and one out of every three vapes sold in the country was a Juul. By 2018 Juul Labs reportedly accounted for roughly 70 percent of the e-cigarette market in the US. In mid-2018 Juul was valued at $15 billion and it had sailed past the $10 billion “decacorn” benchmark faster than Twitter Facebook and Snapchat.

And it was hardly just middle-aged smokers looking to quit cigs buying them. In a study from late 2018 the journal Tobacco Control found that nearly 10 percent of teenagers between the ages of 15 and 17 had tried a Juul. That same year roughly 50 percent of Juul’s Twitter followers were under age 18. There was a system in place on the Juul Web site that didn’t allow anyone under 21 to buy the products but in a sloppy technical glitch those who failed the age verification were still targeted with marketing e-mails. And teens who wanted to get their hands on them could easily do so via third-party sellers eBay or just lax clerks at the many convenience stores selling them.

In December of 2018 Altria the parent company of Philip Morris paid $12.8 billion for a 35 percent share in Juul. That valued Juul Labs at $38 billion making it worth more than Airbnb Lyft and SpaceX at the time. Monsees and Bowen became what they had sought to disrupt — members of Big Tobacco.

6 Co-founder James Monsees testified before Congress about Juul’s role in the youth vaping epidemic. AP

Many working for the company felt sickened by what Juul had become but they also profited handsomely. Employees now numbering over 1000 reportedly received bonuses averaging around $1.3 million each from the Altria deal.

“It was the Silicon Valley dream come to life for no more so than James Adam and their executive team” Ducharme writes.

But in 2019 the dream came to an abrupt end when previously healthy teens started to become gravely ill with pneumonia-like symptoms. A 16-year-old varsity swimmer from Michigan could only be saved by having one of the first-ever double-lung transplants. By the end of August 2019 the CDC had counted nearly 200 cases of EVALI: E-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury.

In August 2019 Bowen and Monsees were called to testify before Congress about Juul’s role in the epidemic of youth vaping.

“We never wanted any non-nicotine user and certainly nobody underage to ever use Juul products” Monsees said. “Yet the data clearly shows a significant number of underage Americans are doing so. This is a serious problem. Our company has no higher priority than fighting it.”

Federal data released in 2019 found 27.5 percent of high schoolers and 10.5 percent of middle schoolers had used an e-cigarette in the past month. Juul was the mostly commonly cited brand by those surveyed.

It was eventually discovered that THC vapes not Juul were the issue causing the EVALI but many conflated Juul with vaping in general. Profits fell from $745 million in the second quarter of 2019 to $157 million in the fourth quarter of the same year amid the scandal and increased regulation.

Today Monsees no longer works for the company while Bowen does some part-time consulting. But their invention has left both men rich. And while vaping amongst teens is on the decline it remains prevalent. The research around the dangers of vaping tobacco is inconclusive with most experts believing it’s safer than smoking cigarettes but still dangerous.

After the Juul speaker came to Caleb Mintz’s school his furious mother Meredith Berkman launched an advocacy organization called Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes. In a 2020 NPR interview she reflected on Juul’s popularity.

“It’s no longer the teen favorite” she said. “Juul is almost old school.”

When kids do want a puff nowadays they’re increasingly reaching for disposable single-use e-cigarette like the Puff Bar which packs a similar punch as Juul for less money.

If Juul’s rollout had been handled differently some believe it could have actually been a good thing for society and public health especially as studies have shown that e-cigarettes can be effective at helping some people quit smoking.

As one former high-ranking Juul employee told Ducharme: “It was a colossal missed opportunity starting from the board to the management team to the early science into what’s now going to be a lesser product line for Altria.

“If you could have asked for a worse outcome aside from bankruptcy I’d love to hear it. That’s a tragedy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vb3Rha3Vtb2RlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzYwYjcyNjgyYTc3MGY1MTdiN2RhMTM1Mi9XYXRlci1Qb2xvLUFuaW1lLVJlLU1haW4tQ29uZmlybXMtQWRkaXRpb25hbC1DYXN0IdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Water Polo Anime Re-Main Confirms Additional Cast! | Anime News,"The new cast members are: Hikaru Midorikawa as Shogakukan High School water polo club coach Akimitsu Bizen Natsuki Hanae as Rikka Academy water polo club member Takeshi Toyama Mahiro Takasugi as Rikka Academy water polo club captain Akihisa Fukui and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Rikka Academy vice captain Norimichi Ishikawa.

Finance ministers in London from the G7 group of wealthy nations including representatives of the UK US and EU on Saturday agreed the landmark deal aimed at making the biggest companies such as Apple Microsoft Google and Facebook pay more tax.

The two “pillars” of the deal would make companies pay a percentage of their profits in markets where they make large sales despite minimal corporate presence as well as setting an unprecedented global minimum corporation tax.

However a communique from G7 ministers said that they envisaged pillar one would only apply on “profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises” a restriction that could rule out Amazon.

Amazon is one of the largest businesses in the world with a market value of $1.6tn (£1.1tn) and sales of $386bn in 2020. A Luxembourg subsidiary paid zero corporation tax in 2020 on sales income from across Europe of €44bn (£38bn) making Amazon a prominent target for politicians campaigning for changes to the global tax system.

However its profit margin in 2020 was only 6.3%. It runs its online retail business at very low profit margins partly because it reinvests heavily and partly to gain market share.

Richard Murphy visiting professor of accounting at the Sheffield University management school said the 10% profits threshold was “inappropriate” because of different business models for different companies. He added that current approaches to reporting profits in each country were “easily gamed”.

“This could turn out to be a false hope unless they get the detail right” he said.

The G7 deal aimed to give momentum to talks at the larger G20 group of nations followed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) a club of mainly wealthy nations that has led tax negotiations for a decade. Campaigners said they hoped the later negotiations would include an approach known as “segmentation” meaning profitable parts of businesses would pay tax in their own right.

“Based on the communique Amazon is not captured” said Paul Monaghan chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation which accredits businesses that do not avoid tax. “If there’s another layer of detail that suggest Amazon will be captured that’s great but it hasn’t emerged yet.”

Janet Yellen the US Treasury secretary on Saturday told the Reuters news agency that she expected Facebook and Amazon to be covered by the proposal.

“It will include large profitable firms and those firms I believe will qualify by almost any definition” she said.

A segmentation approach would mean a company like Amazon would pay tax in countries such as the UK on profits of subsidiaries such as Amazon Web Services its lucrative web hosting arm. AWS made a margin of 30% in 2020 according to the Fair Tax Foundation.

The US tech firm ended 2020 with more than $13.5bn in annual operating profits from annual AWS revenue of $45.4bn up nearly 30% year on year.

Sources said that while the G7 sealed an over-arching agreement details about how to carve up the revenues of big corporations into their constituent parts for tax purposes had yet to be agreed.

It is possible that some businesses will be able to rejig their operations to offset profits against loss-making units to remain under the 10% threshold unless tough rules are in place.

Alex Cobham chief executive of Tax Justice Network said: “If the OECD cannot ensure Amazon is in scope not only will it fail to meet the public demand for fairness here it will also offer a blueprint for other major multinationals to escape this element of the reform.”

Work is under way by the OECD under the banner of its inclusive framework to resolve how companies should be taxed ahead of a meeting by the G20 groups of countries in July that is expected to ratify the G7 deal.

It is expected that 135 countries that have signed up to the OECD scheme will benefit from extra tax revenues from large corporations.

George Turner director of TaxWatch UK a thinktank said it would be vital to ascertain whether tech companies would pay more UK tax overall after the UK and other nations including France conceded that they will remove unilateral digital services taxes that aimed to target big tech.

“It could be taking with one hand and giving with the other” Turner said.

Facebook the social network company on Saturday said it believed it will pay more tax. However Amazon was unable to say whether it expected to pay more tax.

An Amazon delivery driver was caught on camera punching a 67-year-old customer during a dispute over a delayed package in California KTVU Fox 2 reported.

Footage shows the driver striking the woman multiple times around her head. The incident which took place in Castro Valley was captured from several angles by a surveillance camera.

The Amazon worker Iztel Ramirez 21 was arrested on Thursday. KTVU Fox 2 reported that Doug Smith the owner of the elderly woman's apartment building said the fight began when she received a notification that a package had arrived. But when she went to the lobby to find it the package wasn't there.

The woman asked Ramirez of its whereabouts and was told she would receive it soon. After waiting for 15 more minutes the woman reportedly questioned Ramirez again kicking off a violent dispute.

Smith was quoted as saying: ""I believe the Amazon driver said something about 'your white privilege' and my tenant said 'You don't need to be a b***h about it' turned around and walked away.""

An Amazon spokesperson told Insider in a statement: ""This does not reflect the high standards we have for drivers who deliver our packages. We take these matters seriously and this individual is no longer delivering Amazon packages.""

The Alameda County Sheriff's Department said the woman had possibly suffered a broken nose and other visible injuries.

Sheriff Ray Kelly was quoted by KTVU Fox 2 as saying: ""We can't have our delivery drivers or people out there in the community attacking people punching people in the face.""

Ramirez was arrested on suspicion of battery causing serious bodily injury and elder abuse according to the outlet.

Teladoc CEO says it's ‘overrated' but he should be worried,"The Amazon Pharmacy home screen on a smartphone arranged in the Brooklyn Borough of New York U.S. on Tuesday Nov. 17 2020.

Ask a sports star before a game whether their team is going to win and they're likely to say yes with confidence. And then cue the headlines that will sensationalize the hubris. But would you expect an athlete to say — would you want them to think — they're about to lose? The heads of companies sometimes talk about the competition in a similar way and they shouldn't be in the CEO hot seat without confidence in their company's ability to win. Take Teladoc Health CEO Jason Gorevic recently asked at the CNBC Healthy Returns Summit about the threat Amazon poses in health care. ""Based on the fact that it has one enterprise client of 385 employees it is overrated"" Gorevic said answering a question about Amazon Care the retail and tech giant's app-based primary care entry in Teladoc's market which signed up its first client Peloton-owned fitness equipment company Precor in May. Should the Teladoc CEO be more worried? Even after Amazon's deal with Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan to take on the status quo with its health care joint effort Haven fell apart the merchandising giant still has a big market to exploit. Amazon Care is expected to expand to its own employees in all 50 states this summer. It has been adding workers faster than any company in history more than 500000 in 2020. It also has had a deal with employer health provider Crossover Health for in-person employee health clinics that continues to expand across states with a goal of putting these clinics within a few miles of all Amazon employees especially in light of the attention its workplace injury rates have received. J.P. Morgan is moving on and deeper into health care after Haven recently announcing it will move ahead with its own effort to invest in new health-care ideas to be offered among its 165000 employees and families.

Virtual health here to stay

As society has moved rapidly from the awareness phase of virtual care to the expectation phase those expectations have increased and Teladoc has added services like mental health treatment as part of what Gorevic tells CNBC is the future ""unified experience"" with patients. ""Virtual care is not a stay at home phenomenon"" Gorevic said. ""The utilization we are seeing across multiple conditions all indicate it is here to stay."" He cited first quarter 2021 results during which visit volume was up 69% year over year in spite of the fact that seasonal flu-related visits were down 90%.

watch now

Nevertheless Teladoc shares have cratered down from a peak earlier this year above $290 to roughly half that level ending trading last week slightly above $146. But Gorevic says investors are missing the bigger picture and overlooking improving numbers. The biggest quarterly number he cites: revenue per member per month which in Q1 2021 was $2.25 versus 87 cents a year ago. Others cite the rapid M&A taking place in Teladoc's market as reason to worry. Walmart acquired MeMD in May; two other telemedicine competitors Doctor on Demand and Grand Rounds recently merged. ""Everyone feels like they have to have a press release that says something about telehealth to be relevant"" Gorevic told CNBC Healthy Returns. ""I'm not surprised by any of these moves."" ""This pandemic has thrown the whole market into motion. As we looked at the market we said we needed to be bold and we see where it's going"" the Teladoc CEO said citing its $18 billion acquisition of chronic disease management company Livongo which is focused on diabetes and its expanding mental health services. Gorevic says health-care consumers are overwhelmed by health-care websites and apps and want a unified experience and the company is seeing that in multi-product bookings which in 2020 represented two-thirds of bookings.

Amazon and the fear of disruption

Amazon's ability to upend or at least send waves of terror through the health care industry has already been seen in the launch of its online pharmacy which led to shares of Goodrx dropping from over $52 to roughly $33 after the announcement last October. Wall Street analysts who cover Teladoc see Amazon's presence as significant yet not all agree it is an acute threat to Teladoc currently. ""Leery of Amazon's initiatives here"" wrote Sean Wieland managing director and a senior research analyst focusing on health-care information technology and health-care services at Piper Sandler in response to an email. ""Even Amazon would have to get the enterprise market on board one employer at a time as it's a highly fragmented market and that would take years. Also it's a significant lift to go from offering urgent care visits on demand to whole person health care.""

Charles Rhyee managing director and senior research analyst covering health-care technology and distribution at Cowen & Co. said Goodrx is a good example of how Amazon can disrupt health care and it would be a mistake to ignore Amazon's potential. But he thinks the threat in pharmacy is more direct than in telehealth. ""It's is a mature market. There are tons of pharmacies out there and it is not a growth sector. In the truest sense more of zero sum game"" Rhyee said and that is something Amazon can afford to win at the expense of CVS or Goodrx.

Telehealth visits still a fraction of the market

Telehealth is still a nascent field and that may play to Teladoc's favor in the years ahead. ""We are all talking about it because of Covid forcing everyone to seek virtual care but if you think about how many visits Teladoc will do this year it's 12 million to 13 million visits"" Rhyee said. That compares to a U.S. market in which there are one billion visits or more annually including mental health care. Whether a Teladoc or American Well is growing in the telemedicine market Rhyee says that amounts to about 2% to 3% of visits a small fraction of what can be virtualized and an indicator that the market is going to expand. ""I'm not concerned"" Rhyee said. ""Where Teladoc sits is not what Amazon is doing. It's not just basic video visits to speak to a doctor for a minor thing. It is increasingly in multiple specialities and second opinions and Livongo. You can argue right now very few if any have that broad capabilities and that's why Doctor on Demand is merging with Grand Rounds."" He looks at Amazon in basic care and pharmacy in a similar way to his analysis of Walmart's health care after its acquisition of MeMD. ""They want to provide some basic connectivity and prescriptions that can be dispensed at Walmart.""

Why Teladoc shares have been volatile

Stocks move up and down in discrete periods of time and that doesn't always correspond to the longer-term trend. That's part of the challenge for investors with Teladoc right now trying to figure out what its growth looks like post-Covid. Membership growth guidance for this year may not be as strong as some investors wanted coming out of Covid and app tracking firms have shown slowing momentum in daily usage. Yet people using Teladoc less now than April of last year does not mean they are using it less than they were in 2019. And last year was unusual. ""We don't know what virtual will look like in the end"" Rhyee said. The Cowen analyst has a $240 price target on the stock and says at $140 it is trading at roughly 8 times forward revenue which is up from where it traded before Covid but that was when ""people didn't believe it was a real business."" Rhyee says he will worry more about Amazon if it starts stringing together acquisitions in health care including in the chronic condition management space. ""That would tell me they are much more serious about it"" he said. As long as Amazon Care is one enterprise client and its own employees the Teladoc outlook will be based elsewhere. The idea of competition between Teladoc and Amazon may be missing the real threat Amazon poses in health care according to David Grossman research manager director at Stifel. That includes disrupting the legacy providers in insurance and pharmacy benefits managers. Teladoc is disrupting traditional providers by creating a virtual 24/7 network on demand that can offer a potentially lower-cost alternative. Those traditional providers now forced to offer telemedicine are more of a near-term threat to Teladoc in Grossman's view as they evolve from starting telehealth ""literally overnight"" to incorporating virtual care as a permanent feature of their care delivery models. ""Virtual care is now table stakes for providers while 15 months ago it was barely on the radar screen"" he said. Setting up appointments online and having telehealth as an option may be one of the features Amazon offers but that is a shortsighted way to view what Amazon is after in the health care system.

Amazon is saying we take over everything. It's not lets go after Teladoc. That's incidental. David Gross Stifel analyst

Grossman who is concerned about Teladoc's ability to grow revenue and margins says Gorevic is a smart guy building a reasonable model. Now they can pitch health plans on using a provider network they have created at lower cost for employers if employees agree to access services virtually as a first stop. That disintermediates the traditional provider network but he does not see Amazon stopping there or even thinking in those terms specifically. ""Amazon is saying we take over everything"" Grossman said looking at traditional health care market that is flawed in delivery and pricing and adds little value. ""It's not lets go after Teladoc. That's incidental."" Taking cost out of the system is what Amazon already has proven to be great at squeezing out players that don't offer value and shouldn't be there. ""I'm rooting for them in that sense"" the Stifel analyst said. But whether it is Amazon's or Walmart's efforts that are emerging in health care the models to watch do not exclude Teladoc. ""There is no indication we should write it off"" Grossman said. Teladoc shares are down for a lot of reasons starting with the market rotation out of growth names and the market acknowledging that traditional providers are ramping up their own telemedicine products. ""Everyone points to Amazon and let's be fair it was a high multiple stock and the market is getting out of the stay at home trade and pricing how high can utilization translate into pricing"" Grossman said. He added that Teladoc has struggled to convince the street of its pricing power. ""They have been opaque."" The company is growing monthly revenue per member as Gorevic noted but the Stifel analyst was quick to point out the recent Q1 growth relied on the acquisition of Livongo. Livongo is the largest provider of virtual chronic care and that is top of mind for employers but Teladoc has a lot of work left to do to prove demand for it is a secular driver of its business growth. Behavioral health meanwhile is the fastest- growing incremental service but there is only so much that can be delivered on an automated basis so it becomes a staffing platform to match supply and demand and help sole mental health practice proprietors fill their book of business like an Uber or Lyft. While the 8 times revenue the company is trading at might seem less than rich double-digit revenue multiple companies tend to be in sectors like software where scalability comes fast and at high margins. Teladoc's subscription-heavy sales model means a majority of revenue is fixed while the costs remain variable. ""Their claim all along has been as utilization goes up it's good for them but there is no pricing algorithm around that. We don't know how to calculate that"" Grossman said. Companies like Teladoc and American Well can grow members and grow utilization among members but how either of those growth measures factor into pricing power remains unpredictable. Utilization can go up but revenue not match it. And that contributes to investor concerns about its scalability. ""It is factually correct they can get more per member with more services and there are lots of opportunities but lots of competition for each module and booking"" Grossman said. The company's scale and visibility give it an advantage ""but lots remains uncertain"" he said. Gorevic told CNBC this is not a pandemic story. ""Something else is going on here. People are reaching out for other things."" Mental health dermatology and chronic conditions including diabetes and health issues linked to it such as weight loss. ""Not one and done things and that's why I am convinced"" the Teladoc CEO said. Building the virtual primary care model and convincing payers and employers that it is most cost-effective to choose this option and agree to have members enter the health system virtually as the first step is the bigger opportunity to drive higher revenue per member Grossman said and longer-term it is the more sustainable way to disrupt the traditional provider network. In that sense Teladoc is taking market share just like Amazon would and they can grow for a longer period of time. That may be a discrete disruption in health care that becomes permanent. The biggest disruption in health care though is not about telemedicine. ""All roads lead into the payers"" Grossman said. ""That's where the level of satisfaction is low and the control they have is high.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYXdzLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vc29sdXRpb25zL2Nhc2Utc3R1ZGllcy9hY3RpdmVjYW1wYWlnbi1hdXJvcmEtY2FzZS1zdHVkeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ActiveCampaign Case Study | Amazon Aurora | AWS,"Once ActiveCampaign pivoted to a cloud-based model business grew rapidly and the IT team needed to spend more time innovating new products than managing the infrastructure. So in 2016 ActiveCampaign migrated its entire operation to AWS. The company chose AWS because of the support it provides—support that now enables ActiveCampaign to focus on the care of its customers and the development of new products instead of infrastructure maintenance. “On AWS we basically have one of the best operations teams in the world available to us with an API call” says Benjamin Doherty engineering manager of ActiveCampaign’s database reliability team.

Founded in Chicago in 2003 ActiveCampaign originally sold a suite of products—including a ticketing management system a chat feature and email marketing software—that the company would help customers install on their own infrastructure. But in 2014 the company decided to shut down several products and start using a cloud-based SaaS model with a focus on customer experience software. With this strategic pivot the company aimed to help businesses interact with their customers through automated marketing and an easy-to-use customer relationship management system. “It was a big pivot for the company” says Tony Newcome chief technology officer of ActiveCampaign. “And it was definitely the right one.”

After ActiveCampaign began using Aurora with MySQL compatibility as its main transactional database its growth and revenue increased dramatically. Now the company handles 170000 schemas from customers in 61 countries and processes 120 billion queries every day using Aurora. “Our automations traffic was up 153 percent from 2019 to 2020 and our sending increased 100 percent in the same time frame” Newcome says. “We’re seeing tremendous growth in every vertical and every region where we do business.”



Aurora enables ActiveCampaign to provision clusters on demand to keep up with customers. The company added three to six database clusters every month in 2020 taking only 2 hours per month to do so. The company can also use Aurora to develop SQL queries that it could not have developed previously using MySQL and it can have more customers on a cluster and higher write throughput. Crucially ActiveCampaign can use the automatic-scaling feature of Aurora to respond quickly when it needs more capacity. “The automatic-scaling replica feature of Aurora is important to us” says Doherty. “We’re able to spin up replicas on our clusters during something intensive like while sending large campaigns and then scale down when those jobs are done. It’s painless effective and not disruptive.”



ActiveCampaign also built custom automatic-scaling handlers with an open source product called ProxySQL to support features such as query routing. Monitoring and observability service Amazon CloudWatch sends alarms that trigger AWS Lambda a serverless compute service to add new capacity and notify ProxySQL that there’s a new instance in a cluster that it can use. “We’ve benefited from the use of services like AWS Lambda as a way to customize the automatic-scaling behavior that we need” continues Doherty.



Using Aurora ActiveCampaign implements decisions quickly. “The managed service of Aurora enables us to decide on Monday mornings to add more capacity and then be done by lunch” says Doherty. Now ActiveCampaign can provide high availability to its customers. “We can depend on AWS” notes Sagar Sagiraju ActiveCampaign’s vice president of engineering cloud platforms. “For its availability support and problem solving AWS is a tremendous value.”



Aurora also reduces costs increases efficiency and improves security for ActiveCampaign. Every customer—including seasonal businesses—has its own schema. Aurora enables ActiveCampaign to archive data for customers when they go dormant and then unarchive it when they come back—a huge cost-cutting benefit because ActiveCampaign doesn’t have to pay for idle databases. Because Aurora is fully managed a team of only three engineers operates efficiently. “Not needing big data centers or dozens of engineers and being able to use AWS services instead is huge” says Newcome. The out-of-the-box security offered by Aurora is key to providing safe and secure infrastructure for ActiveCampaign and its customers. “On AWS we can monitor encryption and the access to keys” Doherty says. “Offering those kinds of complicated security maneuvers as just another service makes a huge difference.”



Although most of ActiveCampaign’s infrastructure rests on Aurora the company also uses Amazon DynamoDB—a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale—to collect and hold data from web scale functions. ActiveCampaign's customers can embed a simple script into their web interfaces and then track how many times a user visited their blogs or ecommerce sites.

Welcome to the next chapter of our Miami Airport Flight Club Tales. This time passengers did not even wait to get past security in order to start fighting.

Miami Fight Club Round 3: Fight Breaks Out At American Airlines Check-In Desk

The incident took place at the American Airlines check-in counter. It isn’t clear what started the brawl but viral video shows a pair of young men locked in mortal combat taking the fight at one point even behind the (deserted) check-in counter.

The companion of one of the men tries to break up the fight and seems to succeed though after about 25 seconds the two men just give up put up their hands and walk away. The video cuts off but could it be that we missed a beautiful gesture of peacemaking?

It’s a rough time to fly: airport concessions remain closed onboard service remains cut and planes are full once again. Prices have recently spiked and even if you are flying up front amenities remains at a minimum. And of course the mask mandate. With that subtext it is no wonder we are seeing such an increase in the number of disturbances at airports and onboard.

And this fight isn’t nearly as bad as the last one I covered at MIA.

CONCLUSION

In all seriousness this is a difficult time to fly. Stay safe out there and the best way to make peace is to put your pride aside and run the opposite direction if you encounter an angry or aggressive passenger. I know easier said than done. But who wins in a fight like this? No one…

Editor’s note: This story was originally published by Aspen Daily News and was shared via AP StoryShare.

Highlighted by more daily flights scheduled between Aspen and Texas than any summer previously the Aspen-Pitkin County Airport’s mid-year flight season got underway Thursday.

American Airlines is flying to Aspen from Dallas/Fort Worth four times a day and United’s daily schedule includes two flights daily from Houston. In addition American will provide a Saturday flight from Austin Texas a route that represents a new addition to the ASE lineup.

“We now have twice as many flights from Texas as ever before in the summer” local air travel consultant Bill Tomcich said Thursday. In the summer of 2019 American flew twice daily from D/FW and United flew once per day from Houston.

Local officials have said that Texas’ connections with Aspen grew stronger during the pandemic as tourist stays both short- and long-term picked up last summer and winter. Through most of 2020 and early this year the Lone Star State shied away from strict COVID-19 limitations on mask wearing and social distancing that were being observed in most other areas of the country.

Many Texans also have relocated to the Roaring Fork Valley over the last year.

“We saw a lot of Texans coming to Aspen during the summer and the winter” said Tomcich consultant to the group Fly Aspen Snowmass a partnership among the Aspen-Pitkin County Airport the Aspen Chamber Resort Association Snowmass Tourism and Aspen Skiing Co. “That momentum [from the winter] is carrying over into this summer. Both American and United have seen strong demand from Texas and they are responding to that demand by adding additional flights.”

Through Aug. 16 ASE will see a total of 23 daily flights Sunday through Friday and 24 on Saturdays with the addition of American’s Austin route. American will fly four times daily from D/FW two times daily each from Chicago and Los Angeles and once daily from Phoenix.

Meanwhile United has eight flights scheduled daily from its Denver hub along with two flights per day from Houston and Los Angeles as well as one flight a day from both Chicago and San Francisco.

The summer flight schedule follows the completion of a project that required a closure at the local airport May 18-23. The $1.7 million project was a partnership between Pitkin County the Federal Aviation Administration and the Colorado Department of Transportation.

Generally the project involved patching sealing and restriping of the asphalt-based taxiway and apron. It also included some repainting on the concrete runway.

“We wanted to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their patience and understanding of the recent ASE airport closure for runway rehabilitation which was completed on time allowing the airport to reopen [May 24] as scheduled” a Thursday news release from Fly Aspen Snowmass says.

All of the nonstop flights are scheduled to continue through Labor Day weekend albeit on slightly reduced schedules after Aug. 16. American’s new summer service from Austin and United’s service from San Francisco are set to end after Labor Day weekend. All other nonstop flights are now scheduled to continue through at least Oct. 4 the release states.

All commercial flights into ASE the three-­letter identifier for the Aspen-Pitkin County Airport are operated by SkyWest Airlines using CRJ-700 aircraft configured with 65-70 seats.

The 23 daily flights to Aspen scheduled by the two airlines represent a record for the summer tourism season.

June 5 2021

Story By Mike Garrett

When one thinks of inline six engines particularly inline six engines from American automakers you'll probably find yourself imagining the I6s that powered countless entry level American cars and trucks up through the 1970s.

But during the 2000s there was another American-made inline six on the scene and it's often considered one of the greatest and most under-appreciated engines in recent memory—the General Motors Atlas.

The Atlas Inline Engine Family

The Atlas family also included inline-four and and inline-five engines but it was the six-cylinder version that was the true sweetheart of the bunch widely praised when new but also nearly forgotten today. Development of the engines began in the mid 1990s as GM looked for newer engines that delivered increased power and lower emissions suitable for its upcoming midsize trucks and SUVs.

The four and five-cylinder versions would be used in the Chevy Colorado pickup (along) with its corporate cousins. The six-cylinder version though was designed for the new GMT360 platform SUVs; Chevy Trailblazer GMC Envoy Oldsmobile Bravada etc.

Vortec 4200

Dubbed the LL8 or Vortec 4200 the naturally aspirated engine displaced 4.2 liters used a double overhead cams with four-valves per cylinder and had variable valve timing on the exhaust side. It made its production debut for the 2002 model year.

The engine made 270hp and 275 pound feet of torque with later engine updates bumping these numbers to 275hp and 277 pound feet of torque.

But more than just the specs the engines made their power in the smooth and linear way that modern inline sixes are known for and the engine earned a ton of praise. All in all it was both more refined and more powerful than the V6s of the time and made the power of a small V8.

Interestingly though for such an ambitious and well-received engine program the Atlas era was short-lived. GMT360 production ended in 2009 and GM never really replaced the platform nor found another home for the Atlas I6. There's no doubt the fuel price spike economic downturn and corporate restructuring were reasons for this.

Atlas I6 in Racing

It would have been awesome to see the engine kept around and to see its potential as a performance engine realized. And you don't have to look far to see that potential. because as part of the promotion for the engine GM built a few race trucks powered by the Atlas inline six.

These special engines were punched up to five liters in displacement and made 600hp naturally aspirated in Baja racers that competed against V8s of similar displacement.

A similar engine was also used in a 4WD GMC Envoy-bodied race machine that won its class at the 2000 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. This is no doubt one of most interesting race vehicles GM has ever built.

Had GM decided to continue the Atlas program or to drop the engine into a proper performance car there's no telling what could have been but it doesn't take much imagination to think this could have been the American answer to Toyota's legendary 2JZ inline six.

There have been a few enterprising hot-rodders who have used the 4.2 as a swap choice both naturally aspirated and with aftermarket forced induction but that's always been and will likely remain a niche movement.

Just one more chapter showing the abandoned projects and ""what could have beens"" of the American auto industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMS8wNi8wNS9hd2Vzb21lbHktd2VpcmQtYWxpYmFiYS1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlLW9mLXRoZS13ZWVrLWNoYW5nbGktZWxlY3RyaWMtcGlja3VwLXRydWNrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week: $2000 electric pickup truck,"Ever since I discovered this awesome electric pickup truck I’ve been going nuts over the thing. And no I’m not talking about the hot new electric Ford F-150 launch. I’m talking about my most recent find for the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week series a somewhat fully featured electric pickup truck!

Admittedly it doesn’t have a cool name like the Cybertruck or the electric Ford F-150 “Lightning.” Instead this Chinese electric truck goes by the model name CLZKC-009.

That’s cool enough for me and frankly I’ll let Ford and Tesla fight it out over the top-selling electric truck that you can’t even have yet.

I’m not sitting on $40000 that I can plop down to wait in line for a full-size electric pickup.

But I do have $2000 for this little guy which can likely arrive much sooner thanks to the factory’s 15-day lead time.

And yes it might not stack up equally with the bigger electric trucks. It only measures 3.5 meters long (11’6″) and has a payload capacity of 400 kg (880 lb) but it’s got heart where it counts!





The little two-seater truck is produced by Jiangsu Ruipaiying Import And Export Co. Ltd. owner of the Changzhou Xili Vehicle Co. Ltd factory also known as the Changli Vehicle Factory (Yes Jason Torchinsky’s Changli).

I legitimately 100% want this fun-size electric truck for no other reason than it looks like a hoot to play around with. To get there I’ve been communicating with the company’s rep Jessica. She’s kindly hooked me up with all of the specs and even the company’s full product catalog.

As it turns out my little Changli CLZKC-009 truck here is something of a hot rod. It can be maxed out with a 3000W motor (a whole four horsepower!) that provides rear wheel drive reaching a top speed of 45 km/h (28 mph).

It sports either an SLA or Li-ion battery in a 60V 80Ah configuration for 4.8 kWh of capacity. That results in a range of between 70-130 km (43-80 miles).











The little 12″ wheels include hydraulic disc brakes not that you’ll need to stop from a terribly high speed.

You even get a pile of fancy features that come standard including electric windows front wiper electric heater a backup camera a roof/cargo rack in the bed and roof-mounted off-road lights.

There are also options for upgrades such as air conditioning and even a gas-powered range extender to turn it into a hybrid truck.





The frunk can include a range-extending gasoline generator though that option doesn’t interest me as much

There are a number of colors to choose from or you could go with their in-house graphics package.

They’ve got a Jeep-badged model that also comes complete with “Explorer” blasted across the grille (click play to see it in action below).

I admire the hustle of going after both Ford and Jeep at the same time but c’mon guys. Let’s just choose a copyright infringement lawsuit and stick with it.

And as much as I love the off-road lights and the cargo rack package to be honest they kind of make it look like it’s one turret short of a Taliban truck. Our graphic designer (of “Mad Micah” and “Tolltanic” fame) wanted to go with “Tolliban” but fortunately I nipped that idea in the bud.

For the most part I’m gushing over the cool accessories but I’m not going to claim that everything about the truck is perfect.

For example the climate control system connected to the pop-up sunroof appears to consist of two computer fans mounted to the side of a laundry basket.

But I think you’re focusing on the wrong part of that sentence – this truck has a pop-up sunroof!

And I’ve saved the best feature for last.

Not only is this a $2000 electric pickup truck with more range than a used Nissan Leaf. Not only does it offer the latest in cheap backup camera technology. Not only does it already exist and can ship to your driveway (or more likely closest port) today. But it even has a working hydraulic dump truck feature (that costs an extra $228). Not even the F-150 Lightning or Tesla Cybertruck can claim that!

Don’t believe me? Jump to 0:29 in the video below to see this marvel of engineering in action!

Alright so by now I’m sure I’ve sold you on this awesome electric truck.

You probably want one as bad as I do. Or at least you think you do.

We’re about to see how bad you really want one. Because even though the purchase price is a hair under $2000 that’s only the beginning.

Technically you’ve also got to pay for a battery upgrade if you want lithium-ion batteries which of course you should want. Plus the fancier options like air conditioning or that range-extending gas engine cost extra.

From there you’ve got to pay for shipping. Jessica quoted me a sea shipping price of $2210 for a single unit shipped as LCL cargo (less than container load cargo) to my local port of Miami where I’d have to pick it up. On top of that I’ll have customs broker fees likely in the several hundred-dollar range and then there could very well be 25% Trump tariffs on top. (This is where those tariffs are supposed to encourage me to buy an American-made mini EV but something tells me I’ll grow old before I can find a US company producing mini EVs.)

All told I could be looking at closer to $5K to get this truck into my garage in the US. From there I’m not entirely sure it would even be street legal in its present form. In Florida I think I could register it as a low-speed vehicle as long as it comes with a manufacturer’s certificate of origin meaning the 25 mph vehicle could travel on any road posted up to 35 mph or cross faster roads (Frogger anyone?). But NEV and LSV laws and regulations vary from state to state so you’d want to check your local legislation. Theoretically it should have everything it needs to meet federal NEV regulations but some states have stricter laws.

There could be another option though. These electric mini EVs are all over the place in China but so far haven’t caught on quickly in the US… but they may be starting to. There are now two different importers of mini EVs and mini electric trucks Pickman in California and Electric Import Motors in Utah. The latter apparently imports this very truck as well as the Changli car version which they’ve spec’d for US customers. That would be a much easier way to get your own mini EV stateside – even if you have to pay the markup.

I’ve still got some numbers to crunch (and a wife to convince) before I can make one of these little electric trucks mine. If it works out in the end though you better believe you’ll be hearing about it.

This promotion is showing card accounts with Membership Rewards earning/redemption capability and the official expiration date is June 30 2021.

Transferring Membership Rewards points from Amex to HawaiianMiles is usually 1:1 in increments of 1000 and during the promotional period members will benefit from the 1:1.25 ratio (25% bonus).

ADVERTISEMENT

You can find the transfer option in your online Amex card account under Membership Rewards – Airline Transfers :

There are several opportunities to use HawaiianMiles and considering that Hawaii has now reopened to visitors from the continental U.S. definitely a good point to make a redemption in order to go to the islands.

In fact American Express in the U.S. has quite a few attractive points transfer bonuses going on right now including the following for hotel partners:

Hilton Honors 40% Transfer Bonus

Marriott Bonvoy 40% Transfer Bonus

Those of us with U.S. based accounts are quite spoiled in that regard as there are almost always ample opportunities to offload membership Rewards Points at a good ratio which is good because many Amex products don’t have a great earning capability for points including the Platinum Card which I really like but whose earning ratio on anything but airfare is horrible (the worst of all charge cards).

Conclusion

If you’re planning a trip to Hawaii or can make the Hawaiian Airlines award chart work for you in any way it’ a good time to transfer Amex Membership Rewards with 25% bonus until the end of June.

I recommend to first check availability and not just transfer points without having a specific plan for how to use them.

Here's what it's like onboard,"I'm currently onboard Celebrity Millennium. That might not mean anything to someone who's unfamiliar with cruising but this sailing is significant because it's the first large mainstream ship to allow American passengers back onboard since the COVID-19 pandemic forced an industry shutdown more than 15 months ago.

Why it matters

This first voyage of Celebrity Millennium kicks off the rebirth of an industry that has had to fight its way back from ""floating petri dish"" stereotypes and financial burdens that have caused cruise lines to take on billions of dollars in debt and scrap old hardware.

But in this case it's old hardware that's leading the charge. In early 2019 Celebrity Millennium underwent a refurbishment to the tune of $90 million -- a sizeable investment for a ship that's more than 20 years old. It has left the ship feeling shiny and new again.

I booked the trip because for me it's the rebirth of a decade-long travel writing career that has focused almost exclusively on the cruise sector. (The fact that Celebrity matched my loyalty status with Royal Caribbean and offered me double points on the booking was just a nice bonus.) But for as much as I love cruising I was terrified of being back on board.

Why would someone who has spent hundreds of days at sea and who knows that ships have been clean and safe since before coronavirus became a household word be nervous?

It wasn't the threat of illness that scared me. Having spent months familiarizing myself with the details of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s initial No-Sail Order and subsequent Framework for Conditional Sailing Order I was anxious that the level of required protocol for North American voyages -- even ones like this where foreign port departures mean the CDC has no jurisdiction -- would detract from the onboard experience I know and love.

In the following sections I'll highlight the changes I've seen in everything from pre-cruise prep and terminal operations to boarding and the onboard vibe.

Changes in pre-cruise prep

In order to even reach the ship I had to meet the requirements for entry to St. Maarten which include proof of both full vaccination and a negative COVID-19 PCR test (no older than 120 hours prior to arrival). I also had to obtain approval to enter via the country's Electronic Health Authorization System (EHAS).

Tip: When traveling having paper copies of any verification needed (test results application approvals travel insurance etc.) can save a ton of time. We saw lots of people holding up lines while fumbling with their phones. Keep in mind that if you're flying your airline can deny you boarding if you don't have all of the documents required by your destination country.

Changes at the terminal

After my flight I took a cab to the cruise terminal and checked my bag -- a process that remains unchanged from the pre-COVID days.

I was directed to sanitize my hands and make my way to the health screening area which consisted of numbered sections of chairs where passengers could sit for agents to take their information. My agent asked to see my proof of vaccination and negative PCR test results. She then took photos of them with an iPad before fitting me with a wristband.

Changes at the gangway

I checked in the day prior to embarkation via the Celebrity smartphone app so after my health check I was able to breeze through the terminal straight to the gangway using my digital Express Pass. At the gangway ramp my temperature was taken and I was ushered onto the ship where my pass was scanned along with my carry-on luggage. Again this process was the same as always with the exception of the temperature check.

From there two lines of crew and officers -- some tearful -- flanked the usual walk from the metal detector to the elevators. As I passed by there were claps cheers and smiles all around and calls of ""Welcome back!"" have been a common refrain for the past two days.

Changes onboard

OK time for answers to the biggest questions you have: How have cruise lines adjusted to make sailings safer for passengers and how do the new rules affect the vacation experience?

I'm thrilled to report that I actually think the vibe has been enhanced by the yearlong hiatus. In a ""you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone"" sort of way everyone is legitimately happy to be here -- crew and passengers alike. People are smiling more. They seem more thankful more courteous and more willing to roll with the punches.

Celebrity passengers must now complete e-muster drills instead of in-person ones. (Photo by Ashley Kosciolek/The Points Guy)

Here's where things stand on the major bones of contention:

Vaccination is required for all passengers 16 and older. (For sailings departing on or after August 1 that changes to all passengers 12 and older.) Original vaccine cards are required as proof.

All passengers regardless of vaccination status must show proof of a negative PCR test result that's no more than 72 hours old. (Note that this is different from the St. Maarten-specific requirement of 120 hours.)

Masks are required for crew while onboard but they are not required for passengers who are vaccinated. Anybody younger than 16 who is unvaccinated still has to wear one when in public areas. (This one has been an adjustment for me and many other passengers. Overall though it's freeing.)

The cruise line does not require ship-sponsored excursions unless the ports it's visiting do. On this sailing we're permitted to go ashore on our own in Aruba and Curacao but not in Barbados.

Celebrity provides branded masks and hand sanitizer in each cabin which is thoughtful. There are also tons of additional hand sanitizing stations throughout the vessel.

Additionally Celebrity has added handwashing stations to buffets on all ships that didn't previously have them. They're convenient and attendants are on hand to make sure you scrub your digits before you eat.

Speaking of the buffet it's open but food is no longer self-serve. (Oddly you can still grab drinks yourself.)

Capacity onboard is reduced to less than half so the ship feels uncrowded.

Reminders about social distancing and handwashing/sanitizing abound throughout hallways and elevators in the theater and at customer service desks.

Celebrity puts complimentary masks and hand sanitizer in each passenger cabin. (Photo by Ashley Kosciolek/The Points Guy)

Passengers now have to complete their muster drills virtually within a certain window of time either on their cabin TVs or via the Celebrity phone app. After completing the steps cruisers must then physically report to their muster stations for verification. (A crew member will take your cabin number and place a sticker on your keycard.) Overall the process took me less than 10 minutes including my walk to my assembly station.

There are no specific social distancing requirements in the theater or restaurants but cruisers with set dining times are no longer seated with passengers from different travel groups unless it's specifically requested.

Crew are constantly cleaning. At every turn they're wiping down handrails elevator buttons and other high-touch areas.

Stronger HVAC filters have been put in place to help with particulates.

Bottom line

Sailaway reminded me just how lucky we are to be able to travel again. (Photo by Ashley Kosciolek/The Points Guy)

Ultimately I'm impressed with how seamlessly Celebrity has implemented its new requirements and how safe and frankly normal this cruise feels. Socializing without masks and being able to hug old friends is wonderfully liberating after a year of restrictions in most places.

The biggest headaches in my opinion came pre-cruise when I struggled to schedule my PCR test and ensure my paperwork was all in order. So far everything else has been easy and enjoyable.

Last night I excused myself from dinner and went to one of the ship's top decks to find a quiet secluded spot to watch sailaway. As we slowly pulled away from the dock in St. Maarten I cried. Hard. Throughout the pandemic nightmare my general mantra has been ""Someday things will be back to normal."" As Celebrity now says ""Someday is here.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L2hlcmUtaXMtdGhlLXByaXplLW1vbmV5LXBheW91dC1mb3ItZWFjaC1nb2xmZXItYXQtdGhlLTIwMjEtbWVtb3JpYWwtdG91cm5hbWVudNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L2hlcmUtaXMtdGhlLXByaXplLW1vbmV5LXBheW91dC1mb3ItZWFjaC1nb2xmZXItYXQtdGhlLTIwMjEtbWVtb3JpYWwtdG91cm5hbWVudC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's the prize money payout for each golfer at the 2021 Memorial,No matter how things turned out on Sunday at Muirfield Village the 2021 Memorial will always be remembered as the tournament Jon Rahm should have won.

Details on lounge facilities and access eligibility have yet to be announced but the “Sapphire” part of the brand name suggests that they will be aimed at the group’s Sapphire credit card holders.

In a press release JPMorgan Chase said:

“For more than a decade Chase Sapphire has activated lounges across the country at marquee events serving as hubs for unique access at culinary entertainment and cultural experiences. That same inspiration will come to life in airports providing access to exceptional authentic and regionally inspired food drink art entertainment and wellness.”

Over time the lounges are likely to go head to head with American Express’ network of Centurion lounges developed for the firm’s premium card holders. Credit card specialist Capital One also recently announced plans to launch its own airport lounges starting with locations at Dallas Fort Worth and Washington Dulles.

Collinson-owned Airport Dimensions operates a network of airport lounges worldwide under The Club and Club Aspire brands with forthcoming locations including Cleveland Hopkins International Charlotte Douglas International and San Francisco International.

Commenting on the new venture Mignon Buckingham CEO of Airport Dimensions said:

Here’s how the hate group’s legacy is still being felt in 2021.,"Nora Flaherty saw the cross burning in front of St. Dominic Catholic Church in north Denver and ran to her home a block away to get her husband.

He grabbed an ax and helped put the fire out but the Ku Klux Klan members who constructed the symbol of hate already had fled as Dennis Gallagher tells the story that’s been passed down by his family. Like other longtime Denver families dealing with the Ku Klux Klan’s one-time dominance of the city has been a generational problem for Gallagher and his kin.

His father was bullied by self-identified Klansmen about being an Irish Catholic when he joined the Denver Fire Department in 1938. In 1970 Gallagher was knocking on doors as a candidate for the Colorado House of Representatives and met a man who said he was a member of the Klan and thus would never vote for an Irish Catholic.

“There’s never been an apology for what the Klan did” said Gallagher professor emeritus at Regis University former city auditor city councilman state senator and state representative. “I think that has affected the city for generations.”

Ripple effects of the Klan’s takeover of Denver’s power structures over the course of just a few years in the mid-1920s are still felt especially after the release by History Colorado this spring of digital copies of the Klan’s membership ledgers from that time period. The more than 30000 names in the documents include those of the men the Klan’s political machine installed as Colorado’s governor Denver’s mayor and police chief judges state senators and representatives.

But the ledgers also show how pervasive the Klan was in day-to-day life where the people they persecuted and intimidated would encounter them. The membership rolls show Klansmen worked at banks pie companies railroads grocery stores pharmacies the zoo the parks the post office cab companies cafes the stockyard the city jail the courthouse laundry businesses cab companies and this newspaper. They also worked at Denver landmarks like Elitch Gardens the Brown Palace Hotel Union Station and Lakeside Amusement Park.

Those targeted and demonized by the Klan — Blacks Latinos Catholics Jews immigrants of any kind — lived in fear said Robert Goldberg a history professor at the University of Utah and author of “Hooded Empire: The Ku Klux Klan in Colorado.” They knew the Klan was pervasive and that many parts of the government charged with protecting them were actively involved in the white supremacist organization.

“They were made to be second-class citizens in their home” Goldberg said. “Their neighbors were either active antagonists or passive bystanders to their pain.”

The stories of that pain and resistance to the Klan have passed down through the generations of families who have lived in Denver over the past 100 years. The work too of pushing back against the Klan’s legacy continues as new groups form to espouse the KKK’s brand of white supremacy and public spaces still bear KKK members’ names.

Many iterations of the Klan and similar groups have appeared in Colorado and the U.S. since the Reconstruction era Jared Orsi a professor of history at Colorado State University said during a recent History Colorado event. Although they do not always have the same stated goals or organization there is a common thread through them all.

“It’s an episodic phenomenon” Orsi said. “It’s a periodic welling up of deep and dark waters in the American soul. In that darkness lurks a very narrow and excluding definition of who is an American and a suspicion and fear — even a hatred — of anyone who seems to lie outside of that definition.”

The KKK metastasizes

Denver was supposed to be a better safer city in the 1920s. Leaders from the prior decade promised to clean up crime end corruption and eliminate drinking. Nationally World War I was supposed to be the war to end all wars.

“And it all flopped” Denver historian Phil Goodstein said. “There is this extreme anxiety especially in Denver that something just isn’t right.”

It was also a time when Black people in Denver were moving into white neighborhoods and the city’s immigrant population was growing including Jewish and Catholic communities. These changes made the white Anglo-Saxon Protestants who had long held power in the city nervous Goodstein said.

Enter the KKK.

The Klan of the 1920s was distinct in some ways from the organization that terrorized the South in the 1860s after the Civil War and was responsible for lynching hundreds and suppressing the Black vote. This Klan largely disappeared from the public view by the 1870s.

The second wave of the Klan which began in 1915 under new leaders was inspired in part by the movie “The Birth of a Nation” which glorified the Reconstruction-era Klan’s actions and falsely recast the terrorist organization as a patriotic defender of law and order. While still fervent believers in white supremacy the second iteration of the KKK expanded its targets to include Catholics Jews and immigrants of any kind. The new Klan also was far more organized.

“The Klan had a cafeteria of appeals” Goldberg said. “They would go into a community and find out what the problem was and how they could sell themselves to that community.”

In Denver the white Protestant majority saw public safety bootlegging and immigration as the problem. People joined the Klan for a range of reasons Goodstein said. Political opportunists from both parties wanted to use membership to their political advantage. Others wanted to be a part of a quasi-secret society and relished the ritualism and feeling of participating in something with a “patriotic aura” he said.

“They realized that those with great power and fortunes received an inordinate share of society’s honors while most politicians were bought puppets of the ruling elite” Goodstein wrote in his book “In the Shadow of the Klan.” “But they never questioned the essential setup. On the contrary they turned their wrath on those who sought equality with them. An intense patriotism and religiosity filled voids in their social and psychic makeups.”

Denver’s Klan began secretly in well-connected circles but soon went public and spread to thousands of middle-class households Goldberg said. Working-class neighborhoods tended to have higher membership rates because those people were more likely to live near or work with immigrants Jews Catholics and Blacks said Tom Noel director of Public History Preservation & Colorado Studies at the University of Colorado Denver during a discussion hosted by History Colorado.

Although the Klan sometimes painted itself as a volunteer and social organization its exclusionary and white supremacist ideals were plainly iterated in its writings. The “Creed of the Ku Klux Klan” as printed on Jan. 31 1925 in the Boulder KKK publication The Rocky Mountain American states that one of the organization’s core principles was “white supremacy” and “limitation of foreign immigration.”

At its peak at least 30000 men were part of the KKK in Denver — nearly a third of the 107000 white U.S.-born men recorded living in the city at the time of the 1920 census. Chapters opened in other Colorado cities with Denver’s Klan acting as the central hub.

And though their names aren’t in the ledgers at least 11000 women joined Klan groups in Colorado with the largest chapter in Denver said Betty Jo Brenner who is working on a book on the women of the Klan.

Under the leadership of John Galen Locke Grand Dragon in Colorado the Klan quickly grew in power and took top positions in the city state and federal governments as well as rank-and-file jobs in those systems. The ledgers show that at least 186 Klansmen worked for the city of Denver not including the 53 police officers and 37 firefighters a Denver Post review found.

Influence extended beyond the government. More than 40 Klan members listed hospitals as their workplace as well as more than a dozen Klansmen who said they worked for public middle and high schools or the school board. At least 45 Klansmen listed a local newspaper as their employer — including 19 who said they worked for The Denver Post. It wasn’t clear what roles they played.

The Klan met regularly in the foothills outside Denver where they burned crosses to be seen for miles. They hosted picnics and car races and frequently marched. Few acts of physical violence have been directly tied to the Denver KKK during this time but the organization waged a campaign of intimidation through letter writing and cross burnings. It also pressured members to not shop at stores not owned by Klansmen and to fire employees who wouldn’t or couldn’t join the KKK.

But the Klan fizzled in the summer of 1925 after Locke was jailed in connection to tax evasion — a contradiction to the man of law and order he pretended to be. His downfall and the failure of the Klansmen in the legislature to pass bills related to the KKK’s goals like repealing the state civil rights act contributed to the KKK’s diminishment in Denver.

“The Klan was not defeated in Denver” Goldberg said noting there was never any broad uprising against the group. “The Klan died of self-inflicted wounds in Denver.

“It’s an open wound.”

An oral tradition

Descendants of Black Jewish and Catholic families who lived during that time still tell stories their predecessors passed down about the Klan’s reign — and how people stood up to the KKK.

Denver’s small Black community countered the Klan through the local branch of the NAACP and its newspapers the Denver Star and the Denver Statesman where writers repeatedly condemned the group. At the time of the 1920 census 6075 Black people lived in Denver which had a total population of 256491.

One Black physician with light skin Dr. Joseph Westbrook joined the Klan and was able to keep tabs on the group’s plans and share them with the Black community said Terri Gentry a docent at Denver’s Black American West Museum.

Gentry’s family has been telling Westbrook’s story for four generations. Westbrook was her great-grandfather’s best friend and godfather to her grandmother.

“There were threats to the Black community and the Black community still looked after itself and made sure it increased and strengthened” Gentry said.

The Klan sent the NAACP president a letter ordering him to leave town which he refused and burned a cross in front of his home according to History Colorado. The KKK also boycotted companies that hired Black employees.

Gentry’s grandmother lived in the Five Points area like most Black Denverites at the time. Gentry’s grandmother loved her neighborhood and neighbors but leaving the confines of the area could be a threat.

“You have this double-edged sword: Your community’s a safe haven but your radar’s up all the time” she said. “Because if you step outside of your house you have to pay attention. And that hasn’t changed. My radar is still up high.”

Even though Bobbi Furer wasn’t born until a few years after the KKK’s fall she still felt the fear the group instilled in her parents. They didn’t tell her many stories about living as a Jewish family in Denver in the 1920s but a sense of fear remained even after the Klan fell out of power.

“They said to me ‘Don’t talk about it and don’t tell anyone you’re Jewish’” Furer said.

Her family had to walk a difficult line. They needed customers at their downtown gift and frame store and feared that the Klan would boycott them if the group found out they were Jewish — or worse. For years her great uncle bought a Christmas tree for his house so that he would blend in with the Christian majority Furer said.

It wasn’t until she was a teen in the 1940s that she felt comfortable sharing her faith with people who were not Jewish.

The Catholic press issued condemnations of the Klan which spread conspiracies that all Catholics were allegiant to the pope and not the U.S. said Kevin Jones a Denver-based staff writer at Catholic News Agency.

Jones’ great aunt was a ticket taker at a Denver theater who once had to hide in a closet because the theater was hosting a Klan event he said. His grandma once saw KKK members trying to set up a cross to burn in front of a Catholic church.

“We can say there was a lot of anxiety and fear” he said. “The Klan was a secret society. There was a concern about who was in the Klan — if your employer was in the Klan you had to watch your step.”

A reckoning

For several nights last month George Sparks struggled to sleep.

The digitization and release of History Colorado’s membership ledgers revealed one of Sparks’ predecessors the first director of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science as a Klansman.

Someone noticed Jesse Figgins’ name in the ledgers and flagged the museum’s leadership who on May 4 issued an acknowledgment of the “abhorrent history” that influenced the operations of the museum’s first years.

“For the people in this building learning about Jesse Figgins was a shock to the system” said Sparks the museum’s president and CEO.

Since then the museum’s archivist has been sifting through Figgins’ correspondence and papers to figure out what Figgins believed and how those beliefs affected the operations of the museum. Figgins ran the museum from 1910 to 1935 and he would’ve personally been involved in curating and creating exhibits Sparks said.

The museum took Figgins’ name off a collections room took down a plaque that bore his name and hosted a town hall for staff to talk about the news. Personally the revelation has left Sparks with a sadness he said.

“You don’t get to pick your predecessors but you want to admire them” he said. “And I don’t admire Jesse Figgins.”

A similar review of History Colorado is underway after the state’s pre-eminent history organization found a former curator Albert Sanford and members of the board in the KKK membership rolls. The museum is reviewing Sanford’s work and also looking to see if donors or volunteers were Klansmen.

Overall History Colorado has received only positive feedback about the release of the ledgers Chief Operating Officer Dawn DiPrince said. The ledgers are the only document of their kind and size in the U.S. known to the museum. People are eager to learn more about issues of systemic racism she said.

“This is the form white supremacy took in the 1920s in Colorado but it’s such a powerful force it’s got this shape-shifting to it” DiPrince said. “It just finds new ways to continue thriving in our society.”

Mementos of the old ways of white supremacism remain in Denver too.

Although a neighborhood named for Klansman mayor Ben Stapleton has a new name — Central Park — after decades of effort the group that led the most recent campaign is still working to get his name removed from a street in the area. A portrait of Gov. Clarence Morley a member of the KKK still hangs in the state Capitol.

Understanding how the KKK rose to power in Denver and the group’s legacy is crucial to making sense of inequalities that continue today said Nicki Gonzales an associate professor of history and vice provost for diversity and inclusion at Regis University.

“Your sense of normalcy is so much shaped by the attitudes that are around you the institutions that are supported by those attitudes” she said.

The historians who spoke to The Post for this story said there are corollary groups today that espouse white supremacy and prey on peoples’ insecurities.

“What was said at the KKK rallies in the 1920s is almost word for word what is being said today by the alt-right” William Wei a University of Colorado Boulder history professor said during a History Colorado event.

The 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville Virginia is an example of the continuation of the KKK’s white supremacist anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant beliefs said Sue Parker Gerson senior associate director with the Anti-Defamation League’s Mountain States office and a community adviser to History Colorado’s ledger project. People at the rally chanted “Jews will not replace us” and Nazi nationalist slogans.

“We need to pay attention especially when we have this treasure trove of data to look at it and see if it speaks to things that we’re seeing now” Gersen said. “Does it speak primarily to a blip in history or are we seeing similar patterns now that we can correct?

“The KKK is on the decline now but there are other groups that are here to fill the void.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzc29jY2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMTkvMDcvdXNtbnQtdnMtbWV4aWNvLW1hdGNoLWhpc3RvcnktcHJldmlldy1maXZlLXRoaW5ncy10by1rbm930gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USA vs. Mexico - Match History & Preview - Five Things to Know,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ussoccer.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The USMNT reached a No. 4 FIFA ranking in April 2006 though that fell slightly to No. 5 by the time the World Cup rolled around in Germany.

To this day the No. 4 ranking remains the highest the USMNT has ever reached. After the 2006 World Cup which included two defeats and a draw the U.S. plummeted to No. 31 and has been stuck around No. 20 (plus or minus 10) in the decade-and-a-half since.

On Sunday night in Denver the 20th-ranked USMNT will take on No. 11 Mexico in the first Concacaf Nations League final. While not as important as a Gold Cup final or World Cup qualifier it will mark another memorable chapter in the USA-Mexico soccer rivalry.

The question remains: Is this USMNT better than the one ranked No. 4 just 15 years ago?

There is nothing like being a USMNT fan. On the one hand you’ve got a nation with tons of potential plenty of resources and dedicated support. On the other you’ve got a team that constantly disappoints on the biggest stages whether it’s failing to advance out of the 2006 World Cup group stage losing to Ghana in the 2010 Round of 16 or failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup altogether. It doesn’t help that the USWNT is the greatest soccer team of all time having never fallen below No. 2 in FIFA’s women’s rankings.

In 2006 it looked like the U.S. might be on the verge of becoming a legitimate player in world football. After coming within a Torsten Frings hand ball of potentially reaching the 2002 World Cup semifinals the No. 5 ranking and an exciting roster meant the U.S. was the reason Group E was the Group of Death alongside eventual champion Italy the second-ranked Czech Republic and Africa’s best team Ghana.

Leading that 2006 team coached by Bruce Arena was captain Claudio Reyna one of the best midfielders the USMNT has ever developed. Stalwarts like Eddie Pope Carlos Bocanegra Pablo Mastroeni Steve Cherundolo Gregg Berhalter Brian McBride and Kasey Keller gave the team a real veteran presence. Youngsters like Landon Donovan DaMarcus Beasley and Clint Dempsey were just entering their prime.

The 2006 World Cup roster included players from Manchester United Manchester City Fulham Leeds United Reading Hannover 96 Standard Liège and Borussia Mönchengladbach. There was a real feeling that this team could compete with anyone.

But it didn’t quite work out that way in Germany that summer.

The U.S. was blitzed by the Czech Republic 3-0 in the opener. A feisty 1-1 draw against Italy gave the USMNT a chance in the finale against Ghana but an awful penalty kick call doomed the Americans to a 2-1 defeat and last-place finish in the group.

Now 15 years on it’s worth wondering: Is this current USMNT better?

The Americans’ No. 20 ranking doesn’t mean too much right now because the U.S. has played just a handful of meaningful matches since 2017. What matters is how the players have been performing in Europe lately — and whether or not they can replicate that with the national team.

Just looking at the current USMNT roster it’s easy to suggest it’s a stronger group than from 15 years ago. While the 2006 World Cup squad had a handful of European-based players the 2021 team has young stars at some of Europe’s best clubs including Barcelona Juventus RB Leipzig Manchester City Borussia Dortmund and European champion Chelsea.

Americans abroad won more trophies than we can count in the 2020-21 season. Zack Steffen won the Premier League with City Tim Weah helped Lille claim the Ligue 1 title Ethan Horvath won the Belgian league and Brenden Aaronson helped American coach Jesse Marsch to the Austrian Bundesliga crown. Weston McKennie Sergiño Dest and Gio Reyna all won domestic cups for their respective clubs in Italy Spain and Germany.

But the question remains: Can these players live up to their potential with the national team?

Recent performances suggest yes probably. Since Covid-19 shut down international soccer the Americans have scored four or more goals four times in eight games. Against the types of teams the U.S. will face in World Cup qualifying the U.S. beat Panama 6-2 El Salvador 6-0 Trinidad and Tobago 7-0 and Jamaica 4-1.

But those were all friendlies. Now playing Mexico for a trophy it means something.

If the U.S. wants to prove it’s better than that 2006 team that was ranked No. 4 in the world it has to come together in the games that matter starting on Sunday against El Tri and continuing throughout the year with the 2021 Gold Cup and the start of 2022 World Cup qualifying.

Until we can see what Pulisic Reyna Dest McKennie Tyler Adams Aaronson Yunus Musah Weah Daryl Dike Steffen and the rest of the rising USMNT stars can do in meaningful competition the 2006 squad has the edge because at least they reached the World Cup.

It’s been 15 years since the USMNT has been hyped this much. The 2006 squad crumbled under the pressure. Sunday’s game against Mexico will go a long way to defining this current crop of players and whether they can once again rise to the top of FIFA’s mostly arbitrary ratings.",,,

Driving into Southern California’s Palo Verde Valley from the Arizona border fields of vibrant green appear out of the desert like a mirage. Near the town of Blythe water from the Colorado River turns the dry earth into verdant farmland much of it to grow a single crop — alfalfa a type of plant used mainly to feed dairy cows.

For decades a significant portion of alfalfa grown here and elsewhere in the western United States — as much as 17 percent in 2017 — has been loaded onto trucks driven hundreds of miles to ports on the west coast and shipped around the world mainly to China Japan and Saudi Arabia. A little over five years ago one company decided it made more sense to own the land and the water that came with it outright.

The company a Saudi Arabian dairy firm called Almarai purchased 1790 acres in the Palo Verde Valley to secure a supply of alfalfa for its dairy cows. Soon after Saudi Arabia began phasing out domestic alfalfa production to preserve its water supplies which were dwindling after years of overuse for agriculture. The purchase made headlines as critics including local politicians and environmentalists questioned whether it was fair for a foreign entity to use up valuable groundwater resources for products that wouldn’t ultimately benefit Americans.

But the company is far from alone. Foreign corporations are increasingly purchasing land in the U.S.; in the Southwest thanks to longstanding laws on water rights these purchases often come with unlimited access to the valuable water underneath the soil. Combined with nearly year-round sunshine this has made the area a magnet for companies looking to grow water-intensive crops and raise livestock. Over the last 20 years foreign companies have purchased more than 250000 acres of land in six Southwestern states to raise cattle and pigs as well as to grow everything from almonds to alfalfa according to an analysis of purchase data that Undark obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

On its face foreign ownership of farmland hasn’t proved significantly different from American ownership for large-scale production of crops like alfalfa. Domestic farmers have long shipped food overseas and companies like Almarai as well as independent researchers have suggested the outsized focus on foreign companies may be xenophobic. American farmers and companies also control millions of acres overseas mainly in Africa Asia and South America. But with their implications for food and water security — that ultimately the U.S. is not in control of its own farmland — the purchases are drawing attention to the larger trend of industrial agriculture in the U.S. and the problems that come with it.

Corporate farms researchers and policymakers warn drain aquifers and threaten access to water for drinking and future crop production. The export of crops and the water used to grow them known as virtual water has been accelerating for decades despite concerns that in drought-stricken areas such as the Southwest this system is unsustainable in the long term. Although virtual water itself is not inherently problematic — and can even reduce water usage in some cases — its extraction from water-stressed communities is sounding the alarm as water crises become more urgent. Even as the Colorado River Basin enters its 21st year of sustained drought and climate change threatens to further exacerbate water scarcity virtual water trading is expected to triple globally by 2100 with a large share moving from the U.S. to other countries.

“It’s basically exporting water in the form of alfalfa to countries that are water scarce” said Alida Cantor an assistant professor at Portland State University in Oregon who researches water management and sustainability. “But it’s exporting it from a region that is also water scarce.”

While concerns over how to balance agriculture and water availability in the Southwest are nothing new virtual water is a relatively recent concept. First introduced by British geographer John Anthony Allan in 1993 the term signifies the water that is embedded in the production of commodities from food to fibers to energy. Allan who won the Stockholm Water Prize in 2008 for his work framed it as a solution to global conflicts over natural resources and a helpful tool for water-scarce countries to feed growing populations. He suggested that countries lacking domestic water resources could simply import food and other commodities containing embedded water and thus avoid having to deal with water crises directly.

Allan also argued that importing water-intensive goods instead of producing them can prevent environmental degradation in water-scarce countries that may otherwise have to damage fragile ecosystems to access water. And in theory the virtual water trade could actually conserve water in the long run by allowing regional climate and soil conditions to dictate where certain crops are grown. Cooler temperatures lead to less evaporation from plant leaves for example and so countries that export virtual water end up using about 22 percent less water overall to produce a good than the importing country would need to produce it at home.

But water-intensive crops aren’t always grown in areas with an abundance of water. India one of the world’s biggest virtual water exporters is also one of the world’s most water-stressed countries with severely overdrawn groundwater resources and a rapidly growing population.

The type of water that’s used matters too. While the majority of virtual water embedded in internationally-traded food comes from rainfall — called green water and generally considered renewable — about 20 percent is stored on the land surface in rivers and reservoirs or underground in aquifers — called blue water — and is used to irrigate crops. Blue water is much more susceptible to overuse; in particular groundwater according to one study is effectively nonrenewable because it can take centuries for aquifers to replenish once they are depleted particularly in arid areas without significant rainfall.

“It’s basically exporting water in the form of alfalfa to countries that are water scarce” said Cantor. “But it’s exporting it from a region that is also water scarce.”

Researchers like Paolo D’Odorico a professor of ecohydrology at the University of California Berkeley say blue water is already being overused. D’Odorico argued in a 2019 blog post that the globalization of food systems has disconnected consumers from the places their food is grown leading to the “over-exploitation” of rivers “partly by distant actors who do not directly suffer the environmental consequences of their decisions.” As a result this “unsustainable virtual water trade” now makes up 15 percent of the water used in irrigation around the world a share that increased by 18 percent from 2000 to 2015.

In the U.S. the effects of this unsustainable trade are felt unevenly. Although America also receives goods containing virtual water from other countries it is currently one of the largest net exporters of virtual water in the world. And while the majority of the country’s exported virtual water is green water that falls as rain on the Missouri River Basin nonrenewable groundwater exports are concentrated in the southwestern U.S. where the Central Valley aquifer system in California underlies one of the country’s biggest agricultural regions. American crops ranging from alfalfa to almonds — of which up to 70 percent are exported — are major moneymakers for states like California but also require intensive watering.

With scant rainfall the southwestern aquifers as well as the Colorado River provide the main sources of irrigation water in the region and both are threatened by drought and overdrafting. Other factors such as climate change contribute to water stress said Brad Udall a senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University as do municipal water users — large cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas. Agriculture though uses about 80 percent of the water in the Colorado River basin and Udall said agricultural water usage will have to play a large role in keeping reservoirs along the river including Lake Powell and Lake Mead full.

“If you continue to have this massive imbalance where use is greater than inflows these reservoirs that over the last 20 years have buffered the difference will go empty” Udall said. “And that’s what everybody every smart person wants to avoid because if they go empty you then end up with a ‘Day Zero’ South Africa issue where nobody really knows what the rules of the road are. Nobody’s certain of their supply.”

Western water policy advocates have long criticized the practice of growing water-intensive crops for export in water-scarce areas focusing mainly on American companies and farmers. Now though foreign companies buying land to export those same crops are starting to receive more attention. According to the USDA as of 2019 35 million acres of land are held directly by foreign investors a number that doubled between 2004 and 2014.

Not all of this land ends up being used for farming and in fact some of the biggest purchasers over the last couple decades have been timber companies and European energy firms seeking large swathes of empty acreage for wind farms. But for some companies relatively lax water laws in the Southwest make farmland a good investment with a nearly unlimited supply of low-cost water. Others like Almarai have begun purchasing farmland in the U.S. as a direct result of dwindling water supplies at home a process that is exacerbated by hotter and drier conditions in parts of the world fueled by climate change.

Data obtained by Undark from the USDA — while self-reported and likely undercounted according to the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting — show that in California Arizona New Mexico Utah Wyoming and Colorado 152 foreign companies have purchased more than 250000 acres since 2000 to use for agriculture from ranching to almond farming to vineyards. More than half of the acreage was dedicated to cattle and pork production and companies from Mexico China and Canada were the top purchasers of agricultural land during this time period.

Some of these purchases have come under scrutiny before. In 2013 a Chinese company called Shuanghui International — later renamed WH Group — bought America’s largest pork producer Smithfield Foods. The deal came with 146000 acres of land in nine states. More than 33000 acres are in Utah which is currently attempting to increase its access to Colorado River water in anticipation of drier conditions. Two years earlier two Chinese entrepreneurs purchased a 22000-acre ranch in Utah for about $10 million which they used to grow alfalfa for export to China.

“If you continue to have this massive imbalance where use is greater than inflows these reservoirs that over the last 20 years have buffered the difference will go empty” Udall said.

Almarai which has purchased more than 15000 acres in Arizona and California since 2014 has received a large amount of attention and pushback from local lawmakers and sustainability advocates. The company which also owns land in Argentina and Romania announced in 2014 that it would eventually import all of the alfalfa needed to feed its cows in order to “protect the natural resources in the Kingdom.” A 2015 directive from the Saudi government banned the local production of green forage for animals for which precious groundwater would be used on farms over 120 acres.

A major draw for Almarai and many other corporations may be the easy access to water for landowners in states like Arizona and California. Water laws dating back to the 1850s when White Americans first began pouring into the region established a doctrine of what is called prior appropriation which gave first-come-first-serve water rights for unlimited use to anyone who staked a claim according to Cantor the Portland State University professor.

In California farmers access irrigation water from the Colorado River at a much lower cost than municipal users in cities like Los Angeles. In Arizona rural areas outside of big cities like Phoenix and Tucson are not subject to groundwater pumping restrictions and are not required to report how much water they use.

Companies notice these lax rules. “There’s concern that a lot of these large corporate farms are taking advantage of the fact that we have unregulated pumping allowed in rural Arizona” said Kim Mitchell a senior water policy adviser at the nonprofit Western Resource Advocates. The worry she added is that the companies “may not have the same level of concern for safeguarding long-term water supplies” compared to “the historic farming operations that have been here a while.”

The direct effects of other countries buying the virtual water on American farmland are difficult to quantify. About 29 percent of unsustainable virtual water in the U.S. was exported as crops in 2015 mainly to China Mexico and Canada according to a 2019 study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. While American-owned farms likely contribute the majority of these flows the virtual water shipped by foreign-owned farms is unknown.

But in areas where water-intensive crops such as alfalfa grow residents have felt the effects of declining water supplies. Since 2010 the groundwater table has fallen by more than 50 feet in some parts of La Paz County a rural area about 130 miles west of Phoenix where Almarai operates one of its alfalfa farms according to a 2016 report from CNBC. Meanwhile reservoirs along the Colorado river have reached historically low levels prompting cutbacks to water access for Arizona and Nevada.

These issues are not unique to foreign-held companies but part of the larger problem of corporatization of agriculture as a whole Mitchell said. Large corporate farms often have the capital to dig deeper wells and access more groundwater according to a 2019 investigation by The Arizona Republic. Although Almarai says it makes an effort to irrigate sustainably residents who rely on groundwater pumping for personal use in areas where Almarai operates farms have seen their wells dry up and have had to drill deeper and deeper to access water. (Almarai did not respond to requests for comment from Undark.)

“It’s another case of you suck out all the resources then ship off the wealth and the value someplace else and the local people get some kind of pittance” said Jody Emel a research scientist at Clark University and former water resource planner in Arizona. She said she believes that prior appropriation water laws granting nearly unlimited access for “beneficial use” which includes agriculture will have to be revisited. “I think if we don’t deal with science” she added “we’re doomed.”

Buying farmland directly also allows these companies to guarantee long-term access to the crops — and water — they desire said George Frisvold a professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of Arizona.

“What’s the economic rationale of actually buying up land as opposed to just going ‘I need alfalfa?’” Frisvold said. “You’re locking in that supply over a longer period of time than if you were just buying something on the spot market.”

In recent years lawmakers have attempted to impose greater regulations on groundwater use in states like Arizona but have met resistance out of fears that local farmers would lose access and local economies which are often dependent on agriculture would suffer.

“It’s like ‘I don’t want to be regulated but I want my neighbors to be regulated’” Frisvold said. “So you see tensions in areas where you’ve had water tables drop but at the same time there’s a fairly strong resistance in a lot of quarters [to] having government control.”

But while foreign companies seeking to access water have raised particular concern the larger issue remains the globalized agricultural system that is a cornerstone of the rural economy in the Southwest Frisvold said. Foreign demand for alfalfa supplied by American farmers far outstrips the amount grown by foreign companies that own land in the U.S. indicating that the problem will be harder to solve than just restricting foreign land purchases.

Moreover growing demand for water-intensive products like meat and dairy as well as water scarcity driven by climate change are expected to spur even more virtual water exports. In a 2020 study in the journal Nature Communications researchers estimated that virtual water exports around the world could triple by the end of the century from 961 billion cubic meters in 2010 to 3370 billion in 2100. And the trade in nonrenewable groundwater is expected to form a significant share of that increase growing fivefold by 2050 and doubling its 2010 value by 2100. The U.S. is expected to be the biggest exporter of nonrenewable groundwater according to the study with exports going to the Middle East South Asia and Africa.

For Cantor the predictions emphasize the need for the U.S. to reevaluate its support for corporate agriculture on drought-stricken land in the Southwest as a whole.

“There’s enough water to meet our basic needs absolutely but we need to think about the ways” it’s actually being used Cantor said. “Where’s it actually going?’” she added. “What are some of the ways in which the way we use water just doesn’t make sense?”

""Systems officials should be commended for the continuous improvements made to the plants"" the Mississippi State Department of Health's report said.

MSDH makes its annual inspection each year in May.

The third consecutive perfect score of five out of five comes after a less than perfect score — four out of five — in both 2017 and 2018.

A point was deducted in 2017 due to high levels of iron in the water supply. MSDH determined that the secondary iron levels were .44 milligrams per liter — higher than the minimum allowed value of .3 milligrams per liter.

""While it was safe to drink there was work to do to upgrade Water Plant No. 1"" Hattiesburg Mayor Toby Barker said Friday. ""From where we've come from four years ago to now is a testament to the leadership of (Water and Sewer Director) Alan Howe but also the dedication and commitment and hard work of our employees.""

The deduction in 2018 was due to a lack of financial audits.

Water sewer replacement in wards 2 4:City of Hattiesburg announces $2.7 million project

Barker was joined Friday by Howe water operators and water division staff at Water Plant No. 2 on James Street for the announcement.

The report examines operations across three categories: technical managerial and financial. This is the third perfect score the city received since 2018. In June 2020 there was no inspection due to the pandemic so MSDH issued the score from the year prior.

“There are 15 subsets within the three categories and we received a perfect score across all of them” Howe said. “We have an incredible managerial and operator team who work around the clock managing daily samples readings and paperwork to make sure the city of Hattiesburg’s water supply is of the highest quality that our citizens deserve.”

In March the city announced a $2.7 million water and sewer replacement project spanning parts of Ward 2 and Ward 4 with the bulk being in Ward 2 in the neighborhood north of the Longleaf Trace.

The church has always been most dynamic and effective when she has stood in stark contrast to the dominant culture of the day—zigging when the world is zagging. This sort of creative resistance and prophetic posture is what we need most in the digital age. And the most creative prophetic way to stand in opposition to the digital age is to lean into analog opportunities.

To gather when the world scatters.

To slow down when the world speeds up.

To commune when the world critiques.

Slow Church in a Speedy Age

As we serve and lead in the local church we must remember that the goal isn’t selling a product or service but discipling our people. And discipleship requires patience depth and community—the very things that stand in contradiction to the values of the digital age. Dallas Willard reminds us that “character is formed through action and it is transformed through action including carefully planned and grace-sustained disciplines.” Carefully planned and grace-sustained disciplines. This is intentional methodical slow and steady work. It’s why Jesus used metaphors like vines and branches to describe the life of discipleship:

I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up thrown into the re and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you. This is to my Father’s glory that you bear much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples. (John 15:5–8)

No matter the fruit it takes a while for branches to produce it. It requires constant care regularly scheduled watering and pruning and daily upkeep. The invitation to remain in Jesus is an invitation into this sort of work distancing ourselves from the frenetic shallowness of our digital distractions in order to learn and practice the way of Jesus in the big little and everything-in-between aspects of life.

Tangible Experience Over Digital Convenience

I believe there is tremendous opportunity for this especially with younger generations. Despite the grim news of declining church attendance and engagement among young people we are also beginning to see these same young people intuitively recognizing and responding to the digital tensions of our day.

The most creative prophetic way to stand in opposition to the digital age is to lean into analog opportunities.

David Sax’s fascinating book The Revenge of Analog presents a variety of ways younger generations are growing more interested in non-digital stuff. Things like Polaroid cameras and moleskin journals are experiencing a renaissance. One of the clearest examples of the analog comeback may be the resurrection of vinyl records. Vinyl record sales have grown from less than one million in 2007 to more than twelve million in 2015 with an annual growth rate of more than 20 percent. In the book Sax quotes Jay Millar the former director of marketing at United Record Pressing as saying “Digitization is the peak of convenience but vinyl is the peak of experience.”

According to many tech-industry experts the meteoric rise of Amazon signaled the end of bookstores. But this has not been the case. Amazon recently announced plans to open three thousand brick-and-mortar bookstores. Why? Because as Millar suggests while buying a book online is convenient it cannot offer the experience. Younger generations having grown up in an over-digitized world feel this on an intrinsic level and are seeking out experiences they can see hear feel and touch. They realize that ordering a book online and walking through a bookstore are two palpably different things. They’re longing for analog. And this offers the church a never-before-seen missional opportunity to provide these sorts of transcendent spaces that are so few and far between in the digital age.

Unplugged and Alive

Several years ago Jenny and I took an anniversary trip to a sleepy little town up the coast of California called Mendocino. We booked ourselves a room at a bed and breakfast that overlooked the Pacific Ocean. When we arrived at the front desk to check in I asked the customary question “What’s the WiFi password?” The lady gave me a knowing oh-you’re-one-of-those smirks. I was confused. She replied “There’s no internet here. Honestly you’re probably not going to have very good cell service either.” At first I thought she was kidding. Then she pointed to the table in the corner of the room and said “We do have some great board games right under that table. Feel free to take a few.”

Younger generations having grown up in an over-digitized world feel this on an intrinsic level and are seeking out experiences they can see hear feel and touch.

I felt the withdrawal symptoms immediately. We were going to be in Mendocino for several days. How would I possibly make it that long without checking email? How would I survive without knowing what was trending on Twitter? How would anyone know what a great time we were having if I didn’t post dramatically filtered photos on Instagram?

Jenny and I got to our room set down our bags opened a bottle of wine and stepped out onto the small balcony. The view was breathtaking. Nothing but the big blue ocean for as far as our eyes could see. We sat in stunned silence for a while then began to talk. No phones no laptops no WiFi no social media. Just us and the endless sea seen clearly with our very own unfiltered eyes. Slowly but surely the anxiety of digital disconnection began to fade and I started to feel an aliveness I hadn’t felt in a long while.

This is the opportunity and the challenge before us today as we serve and lead our church communities—to help people lift their collective gaze away from the abyss of their digital devices and spaces to see Jesus out on the water inviting them to step out in faith one small step at a time to go about the patient and deep work of following him together.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vc3ludGhhbmF0b215LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2L25yc3ludGgtYmlnLWFuY2VzdG9yLWFuYWxvZy1zeW50aGVzaXplci13aXRoLWFuLWFycC1vci1tb29nLWNvcmUtc3ludGhmZXN0LWZyYW5jZS0yMDIxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NRSynth Big Ancestor Analog Synthesizer With An ARP Or Moog Core (SynthFest France 2021),"SYNTH ANATOMY uses affiliation & partner programs (big red buttons) to finance a part of the activity.

At SynthFest France 2021 the French Boutique developer unveiled the Big Ancestor a new 3-oscillator analog Synthesizer available either with an ARP or Moog core.

Synthesizer fairs currently virtual ones are nice cozy events for fans by fans where even small Boutique manufacturers get the opportunity to present their instruments. These are often overshadowed by the big players as they have other financial resources to promote their latest product releases on social media. Without money you won’t get very far on Facebook and co these days. Also as a media website.

Back to the positive. The Synthesizer trade fairs season 2021 starts today with the SynthFest France 2021. Once again in virtual form with many video releases. Here the French boutique manufacturer NRSynth presets the Big Ancestor.

NRSynth Ancestor

The Big Ancestor is a classic analog mono Synthesizer packed with tons of features. But before we deal with the new release for SynthFest 2021 we have to briefly highlight the Ancestor where many of the features of the Big Ancestor come from.

Ancestor is a fully analog 3 VCO mono Synthesizer that is based on circuits from synthesizers from the 1970s. There are two different versions. One with recreated/cloned Minimoog circuits that use 3 (921) VCOs CP3 mixer a ladder filter VCA and the ADS envelope. Another one features revived ARP 2600 circuits with 3 (4027-1) VCOs VCF (4012 4023 or 4072 possible) (4019) VCA and two ultra-fast ADSR envelopes.

In addition to the envelopes that come from the cloned circuits both synths also have other modulators. These are the same in both versions. You get a single LFO with 8 waveforms and a sample & hold generator both synchronizable. The built-in switch-based modulation matrix with sources & destinations takes care of the routings. The modulation can be created in a flash even without a patch cable.

Ancestor supports MIDI with control of the wheel and velocity. Plus you get numerous I/Os that allow you to connect it to other devices. The modulation can be created in a flash even without a patch cable.

NRSynth Big Ancestor

The Big Ancestor takes everything from the Ancestor but in a much-expanded form. It is also available in a Moog and ARP version. It starts with a new 2dB multimode filter (LPF HPF BP notch) which can run in series or parallel to the actual Moog or ARP filter. A sine-based wavefolder brings new harmonics and timbres to the entire synth. Perfect for building sounds that are more than just classic analog.

The XXL version also includes a second fully analog non-synchronizable LFO with multiple waves and two different frequency ranges. Then you get a dedicated envelope that only detunes the attack of the sounds. Thus you can re-create wind instruments or make add a different flavor to sequences. Further it comes with a clock divider expression pedal input with support for the Moog EP-3 and more I/O.

The latter looks modular but they aren’t. These give you direct access to the VCOs filters modulation outputs clock dividers… good for integrating the synth into other setups. The Big Ancestor is not semi-modular and therefore not a patch matrix either.

Big Ancestor Demo

The video demonstration from SynthFest France 2021 will premier at 9:30 CEST (06/06/2021)

Ancestor and Big Ancestor are two very massive synthesizers. Not only is the look great but also the sound. I find the approach chosen by the developer for cloning the Moog Minimoog and ARP 2600 interesting. Not a 1 to 1 clone but Stephen the developer put the circuits in a new Synthesizer that is nothing to do with the original. Similar to what Studio Electronics does with its synths.

NRSynth Big Ancestor is available now on-demand for 2850€ the Ancestor for 2200€.

When you think of an Arduino the first board in your head has to be the classic Arduino Uno with its Atmel microcontroller. You wouldn’t think of an Arduino powered by ‘Pi Silicon’ but the last of the initial wave of RP2040 partner boards is the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect and this is the board we have been waiting for. You see the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect is the only partner board to come with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Neatly integrated into the familiar Nano layout is a Nina W102 uBlox Wi-Fi module which provides 2.4 GHz WI-Fi Bluetooth Low Energy an IMU capable of detecting movement and gestures and a microphone which can be used to measure audio levels and more importantly used in machine learning projects.

Should the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect be the heart of your next project? Well that depends on your needs and budget. If you are happy to blink LEDs and make things move then a $4 Raspberry Pi Pico is more for you. But if you want to build Internet of Things (IoT) devices with a web interface then Arduino’s latest board may just be what you are looking for. But we don’t truly understand how a board works and more importantly how it is supported until we use it and use it we shall!

Design and Use of the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The design of the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect is quite clearly based on Arduino’s Nano range of boards such as the Nano 33 IoT and Nano Every. The Nano range of boards share the same pin out enabling the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect to be a drop-in replacement for other Nano boards. The bare board has the castellated edges that have become the norm for an RP2040 board and the underside of the board is unpopulated enabling it to be surface soldered into a project. Of the 22 GPIO pins we have 20 pins which can be used for PWM and of those we have 8 analog inputs the most of any RP2040 board as the Pico comes with three and most third-party RP2040 boards have four. If you are looking for the I2C pins they are hidden away on pins A4 and A5 and the onboard IMU is accessible on the I2C bus.

The eagle eyed amongst you will have spotted a micro USB connector something common on many newer Arduino boards. We would’ve liked to have seen a USB-C connector because it offers a foolproof connection and the mechanical connector is stronger than micro USB. As this is the most expensive RP2040 board we think that Arduino could’ve included this without impacting the overall cost.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The big feature of the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect is Wi-Fi and the Nina W102 chip provides us with 802.11 b/g/n 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2. The antenna is located opposite the micro USB port. The Nina W102 chip is itself a powerful microcontroller with 520KB SRAM and a 240MHz 32bit Dual Core Xtensa LX6 CPU but in this board it is relegated to handling communications.

As this is an Arduino our natural inclination is to use the Arduino IDE and with a recent update bringing official support for the RP2040 to the IDE we can easily create projects. We tested the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect with the Arduino 1.8.15 and 2.0 beta 7 IDE and after installing the board via the board manager we were able to flash the example blink sketch to prove that we had connectivity. To access Wi-Fi we needed to install the WiFiNINA library and then create a secrets file to contain our Wi-Fi login details. We ran the Simple Web Server WiFi example and it flashed with no issue but we later learned that we needed to change the default GPIO pin used in the example from 9 to “LED_BUILTIN” in order to control via a web interface.

The connection details should appear in the serial monitor but no matter what we did we could not connect to the serial monitor and all we saw was an error informing us that the port was busy. This is not unique to the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect; we have seen this behavior with other RP2040 boards and the Arduino IDE. Our only solution was to close the Arduino IDE and use another application to open a serial terminal. The same issue affected our test of the IMU so we opened the serial terminal reset the board and saw raw accelerometer data scroll across the screen. We later discovered that the issue lay with our operating system Ubuntu 18.04 we had to uninstall modemmanager in order to see the serial data on the port. This issue has not impacted any of our other official and clone boards.

We also tested the onboard microphone the same model as used in the Nano 33 IoT. We followed the official documentation to flash the test sketch to the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect then opened the Serial Plotter hoping to see a visualization of sound. Alas all we saw was a constant flatline value of -128. We were unable to locate any guidance on how to fix this issue.

We had other issues when using the Arduino’s IoT Cloud a service that we have used before with MKR WIFI 1010 and Nano 33 IoT boards. our Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect was detected but could not be configured. We followed the official documentation  which at the time of writing looks to be incomplete and still drew a blank. This is a real shame as the IoT Cloud is Arduino’s new service to enable IoT “Things” (projects) to be created and monitored via a web interface. It is most likely teething troubles for now and something that will be fixed in the future. For now the smart maker will stick with the desktop IDEs.

You are probably thinking that this is an RP2040 so I can run other programming languages? Correct! We can use CircuitPython and MicroPython with the Arduino Nano RP2040 the caveat is that you will need to source your own libraries for the onboard microphone IMU and WiFi. A quirk exists between the pin numbering and the actual GPIO number. The Arduino pin number used in the Arduino IDE for a pin is say D2 but the RP2040 pin is GPIO25. Another example is the built in LED is D13 but in our MicroPython tests it was GPIO 6.

We tested the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect with CircuitPython and it was a much more pleasant experience and thanks to the plethora of libraries especially the ESP32SPI library we quickly had the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect online and receiving data from a remote API. We also tested with MicroPython and it behaved in much the same manner as a Raspberry Pi Pico but we had no drivers to use the onboard Wi-Fi.

This is where we noticed a quirk that prevented us from setting the board ready to accept new firmware. Typically we would reset the board and press BOOTSEL. For the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect we would double press the reset button but this did not work. After reaching out for help on Twitter we were told that we could connect the REC and GND pins together to force the board into the mode.

Use Cases for the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect

The most obvious use case is an IoT appliance and this is made quite straightforward via the Arduino IoT Cloud. With the IoT Cloud we can quickly create GUI applications to read data from a remote device. For example we can create a weather station using the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect and have live data streamed to the cloud which can be accessed from any web connected device.

The same Arduino IoT Cloud user interface can be used to remotely control the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect for example a web controlled robot wouldn’t be much more difficult to build than a non web enabled robot.

If you are not an Arduino IoT Cloud user you can still make the most of this board using the traditional IDE. There are libraries available for HTTP MQTT and Bluetooth which have existed for some time and can be ported to run on the RP2040. With these libraries we can build web controlled robots wireless weather stations etc.

Bottom Line

It comes down to the price. If you need Wi-Fi and the RP2040 then the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect is a solid piece of hardware but it is more expensive than any other RP2040 solution we’ve tested including buying a Raspberry Pi Pico and a Pimoroni Pico Wireless. The extra cost gives us access to GPIO pins which are sadly blocked with the Pico Wireless. If you need the smallest package possible for an embedded IoT project then this could be the board but right now the documentation is not up to Arduino’s usual standards despite this being the last board in the first wave of RP2040 powered devices.

The additional analog inputs mean that the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect has the most of any RP2040 device useful for connecting many different components. The smart money for those wanting to connect their RP2040 project to the world is with this board but for how long? Seeed’s own RP2040 board comes with Wi-Fi and it is expected to retail for half the price of the Arduino.",,,,,,

Job security has become more important than salary following pandemic-related changes to the working environment while additional research highlights the role of employee benefits in retention and recruitment.

Over half of employees (51 per cent) in a YouGov survey conducted on behalf of law firm Winckworth Sherwood said job security was the most important factor not pay when deciding to stay with their current employer in comparison to 32 per cent who said pay and remuneration was the most persuasive factor. The findings indicated a ‘mindset shift’ in employees and their attitudes to work according to the subsequent report Ethical Leadership in a time of crisis.

The survey conducted between January and February 2021 of over 1000 employees also found that while nearly three-quarters of respondents felt their employer had handled the pandemic ‘well’ 25 per cent said workplace communication could have been better over the last twelve months. However 38 per cent expressed satisfaction over workplace communication levels and engagement initiatives.

In addition:

18 per cent did not feel their employer had been compassionate enough during the crisis and 15 per cent did not feel there were adequate health and wellbeing initiatives in place.

22 per cent were satisfied with how their employer had realigned executive pay with wider staff remuneration and job cuts in comparison to 46 per cent who were unhappy with the lack of transparency over executive pay.

13 per cent felt their employer should have aligned executive pay with salary sacrifices faced by the wider workforce in relation to downturn in business over the past twelve months.

The research highlights the importance of communicating existing workplace benefits with staff to improve retention levels rather than focusing solely on pay.

GRiD research earlier in the year revealed that employee benefits are still an ‘after thought’ during recruitment despite 29 per cent of employers and 32 per cent of employees saying employee benefits are ‘as important’ as salary.

Pay does a certain amount for job satisfaction and employee engagement levels when someone first takes a job. But pay becomes an issue if an employee doesn’t move up the pay scale maybe because the business isn’t growing fast enough or because staff are having to take pay cuts.

To a certain extent employee benefits can become a key differentiator from a recruitment and retention perspective.

The cost per person of some shared benefits can be quite low but highly perceived. They can add some real value hence the importance of communicating with staff about the benefits available to them.

Aon Benefits & Trends 2021 survey revealed a near consensus among UK employers (98 per cent) who want to improve workforce engagement with employee benefits. Part of improving benefit engagements is reminding staff of the benefits available to them at the right time so they recognise the value. If you have a workplace ISA scheme you might want to remind staff who need help getting on the property ladder or reminding staff about tax-free childcare for those with children. It’s about communicating benefits which help employees in their day-to-day life. That’s where the value is.

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Archer-Daniels Midland Co is 2.4% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Consumer Packaged Goods. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 4.3% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Consumer Packaged Goods.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Archer-Daniels Midland Co's return on invested capital is 4.97 and its cost of capital is 6.29. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Archer-Daniels Midland Co is shown below:

Prévention routière à l'Erea Guy-Villeroux,Durant une journée les élèves de l’établissement régional d’enseignement (EREA) Guy-Villeroux ont abordé le thème de la sécurité routière au travers d’exercices pratiques. Maître d’œuvre de la journée Sandrine Puyo professeur de lettres histoire a pu compte sur le soutien de l’Association pilotes police gendarmerie de la préfecture d’Ariège assurant la prise en charge financière de l’opération et le Comité d’éducation à la santé et la citoyenneté de l’établissement. Au programme : un circuit vélo pour les plus jeunes et voiture tonneau à partir des élèves de troisième et des lycéens. L’après-midi rendez-vous sur le terrain de sport avec Cédric Delage policier et pilote de rallye de haut niveau. Le formateur a rappelé aux élèves que les trois causes principales d’accident sont les facteurs humains : alcoolémie vitesse et distraction au volant (comme le téléphone portable). Pour approcher du réel les participants ont assisté à la reconstitution d’un accident d’une voiture heurtant à 50 km/h un scooter. Le pilote du deux-roues représenté par un mannequin est tué sur le coup. Les jeunes se sont approchés de l’accident tous très impressionnés par sa brutalité et ont pu constater que le conducteur du scooter n’avait aucune chance de s’en sortir après avoir omis d’attacher son casque./Photo DDM,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9wZTEuZnIvc29jaWV0ZS9tb3J0LWRlLWNsZW1lbnQtbWVyaWMtZGV1eC1leC1za2luaGVhZHMtY29uZGFtbmVzLWEtOC1ldC01LWFucy1kZS1wcmlzb24tZW4tYXBwZWwtNDA0OTg2ONIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9wZTEuZnIvc29jaWV0ZS9tb3J0LWRlLWNsZW1lbnQtbWVyaWMtZGV1eC1leC1za2luaGVhZHMtY29uZGFtbmVzLWEtOC1ldC01LWFucy1kZS1wcmlzb24tZW4tYXBwZWwtNDA0OTg2OC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mort de Clément Méric : deux ex-skinheads condamnés à 8 et 5 ans de prison en appel,"La cour d'assises de l'Essonne a condamné vendredi en appel deux anciens skinheads à huit et cinq ans d'emprisonnement pour la mort de Clément Méric tué lors d'une rixe à Paris en 2013 des peines moins lourdes qu'en première instance.

Après cinq heures de délibération les deux accusés Esteban Morillo et Samuel Dufour ont été reconnus coupables de violences volontaires ayant entraîné la mort du jeune militant antifasciste Clément Méric sans intention de la donner. Des violences volontaires aggravées par deux circonstances : l'usage d'une arme et la réunion.

""Victime d'une idéologie violente""

""La vérité a été redite ce soir"" a déclaré à l'AFP Me Cosima Ouhioun représentant la famille Méric depuis le procès en première instance. ""Clément Méric a été victime d'une agression par des bras armés par des poings américains mais aussi par une idéologie violente qui a été un poison tant pour les accusés que pour les victimes"" a-t-elle poursuivi.

Le 5 juin 2013 une brève rixe éclate entre militants d'extrême gauche et d'extrême droite en marge d'une vente privée de vêtements de la marque Fred Perry. Sept secondes fatales à Clément Méric 18 ans qui s'écroule sur le bitume après avoir été frappé au visage.

Esteban Morillo invoquait la légitime défense

Vendredi les deux accusés tous deux vêtus d'une chemise ont accueilli leur condamnation dans le calme. Les deux anciens skinheads qui comparaissaient libres depuis deux semaines se sont rendus dans le box des accusés où leurs proches sont venus les embrasser. ""Vous allez être reconduits à la maison d'arrêt"" leur a indiqué le président de la cour Thierry Fusina.

Esteban Morillo 28 ans avait reconnu avoir porté les coups mortels. En première instance il avait été condamné à onze ans d'emprisonnement. En appel il avait plaidé la légitime défense se disant ""désolé"" de la mort ""horrible"" de Clément Méric mais assurant s'être défendu d'un ""guet-apens"" orchestré par les militants antifascistes.

Les assises de l'Essonne ont rejeté à la majorité absolue cette question de la légitime défense et l'ont condamné à huit ans d'emprisonnement.

""Une décision très amère pour la défense""

Une ""C'est une peine moins lourde (…) mais c'est une décision très amère pour la défense"" car ""difficile à comprendre sur le plan de la vérité"" a réagi son avocat Me Jérôme Triomphe. ""Les passions politiques d'en face la pression médiatique et surtout la pression idéologique de ceux qui s’étaient déjà attaqués à eux ont été trop fortes' a-t-il estimé auprès de l'AFP.

Samuel Dufour 27 ans avait lui été condamné à sept ans en première instance. Même s'il n'avait pas frappé Clément Méric la cour d'assises de Paris avait jugé que sa participation à la bagarre avait empêché les camarades de Clément Méric de venir en aide à la victime. En appel il avait également assuré s'être défendu ce que la cour de l'Essonne a rejeté en le condamnant à cinq ans d'emprisonnement.

""C'est une affaire dans laquelle nos clients se sont défendus d’une agression extérieure mais il était sans doute trop difficile pour la cour et les jurés de dire la vérité dans ce procès tellement symbolique"" a commenté son avocat Me Grégoire Etrillard.

Des peines moins lourdes que les réquisitions du parquet

Ces peines sont moins lourdes que les réquisitions du parquet qui avait demandé des peines équivalentes à la première instance fustigeant l'""idéologie mortifère"" de ces anciens skinheads qui a abouti à la mort ""absurde"" de Clément Méric.

Lors de leur examen de personnalité les deux condamnés avaient assuré ne plus être en phase avec l'idéologie skinhead Esteban Morillo assurant même ne ""jamais avoir été vraiment impliqué"" à l'extrême droite.

Les motivations de la cour n'ont pas été dévoilées vendredi soir. ""Compte tenu de la complexité de votre affaire je n'ai pas voulu allonger autrement le prononcé de la décision"" a indiqué aux condamnés le président Thierry Fusina précisant que la feuille de motivation leur sera communiquée lundi.

Coupables de ""port d'arme prohibé""

Au cours des deux semaines d'audience témoins et expertises se sont souvent contredits et n'ont pas permis de lever toutes les zones d'ombre entourant le bref et violent échange de coups. La question de l'usage d'un poing américain a été longuement débattue Samuel Dufour et Esteban Morillo niant formellement tout au long du procès y avoir eu recours. La cour les a reconnus coupables vendredi soir de ""port d'arme prohibé"".

Restored and rereleased Big Banana Feet is the 1976 documentary about Billy Connolly’s live shows in Dublin and Belfast the year before just after his appearance on the BBC’s Parkinson show made him a star virtually overnight and allowed his legions of new fans to hear him live and unexpurgated.

Billy and his hangdog entourage – all looking like a very downbeat version of the Bay City Rollers – travel to Dublin then to Belfast by private plane but aside from that everything looks very non-luxury. The backstage areas have the air of a scout hut and there don’t seem to be any riders with Jack Daniel’s cocaine only-green-coloured M&Ms and the like – Connolly gets a pot of tea backstage so stewed it has to be poured like treacle.

The press gets an enormous amount of almost unmediated access to him including a meet and greet before the show – despite his plaintive requests that this shouldn’t happen – and afterwards too. And the morning after his first big night at Dublin he is prevailed upon to get up early for a radio show; he does it all with absolute politeness. The nearest Connolly gets to being annoyed in the entire film is when he realises his support act is playing a banjo thus rather upstaging the bluegrass part of his own set.

Frankly a lot of Connolly’s naughty material hasn’t aged very well and he got away with quite a lot of dross perhaps because adult comedy was not a saturated mainstream market in those days. People were more used to the daring satire of Dave Allen and in comparison Connolly was an innovator. Connolly certainly was proto-alternative and proto-punk and these were febrile times. At the Dublin show a heckler shouts “IRA!” and Connolly replies acidly: “I’d love to hear you say that at Ibrox [Rangers’ stadium in Glasgow] …!” It’s amazing from this modern perspective to experience again how sectarianism was a violent and normalised fact of life in the 70s.

In Belfast Connolly prudently drops any material about the Troubles perhaps because he simply and understandably doesn’t want to take the risk. When he arrives at Belfast airport Connolly chats amiably to soldiers from 15th Battalion of the Parachute Regiment which he was once with as a Terrritorial Army reserve and we hear his melancholy song about this on stage Weekend Soldier‚ easily the best part of his show.

It is what Connolly says offstage that is now amusing rather than his actual act. When he and his crew are at the airport a voice over the tannoy requests a “Mr Jamaica”; Connolly ponders that it feels like a Mr Universe candidate is being paged. “And then a white skinny guy gets up!” He also explains how someone made his famous banana boots and this man said to him: “They’re not identical … but then bananas never are.” For a second Connolly’s material sounds like Alan Bennett’s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9saWZlL2hlYWx0aC13ZWxsbmVzcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA3L3BhbWVsYS1hbmRlcnNvbi1tYWtldXAtbWV0LWdhbGEtYmVhdXR5LXN0YW5kYXJkcy83MzU5NjM3ODAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pamela Anderson makeup look at Met Gala was natural stunning,"Pamela Anderson made headlines when she was photographed at Paris Fashion Week last year without makeup and she has continued to make public appearances with a fresh face ever since. At Monday's Met Gala Anderson opted to step out with makeup done by celebrity makeup artist Pat McGrath though her look was decidedly more natural than many stars who walked the carpet.

Anderson in October made the choice to ditch makeup for herself noting it wasn't to make a ""political"" statement.

""I would come back from the shows wearing all these clothes and a big funny hat and everything and there were all these paparazzi and then I went in one door and changed into my jeans and T-shirt and no makeup and walked out the door right through the same crowd that had been chasing me and no one noticed"" she told Allure.

She later added to Vogue France she hopes that she can help model the multitude of ways women can express themselves. ""I'm not trying to be the prettiest girl in the room"" she said. ""I feel like it's just freedom. It's a relief.""

Experts note that when big name celebs like Anderson show off their natural looks it can inspire women to embrace their beauty as they age.

Met Gala 2024 highlights:Demi Moore Sydney Sweeney more wow in 'timeless' floral theme

'Men seem to thrive more when they age' and 'it should be the same for women'

Anderson's not the only public figure who's embraced a natural look recently. In August 2020 Kelly Ripa poked fun at her gray roots and in March 2021 Katie Couric went makeup-free for a People magazine spread saying the experience made her feel ""liberated and vulnerable.""

CHICAGO (AP) — Police cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at the University of Chicago on Tuesday as tension ratcheted up in standoffs with demonstrators at other college campuses around the U.S. — and increasingly in Europe.

Nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University the Rhode Island School of Design held talks with protesters occupying a building and MIT dealt with a new encampment on a site that was cleared but immediately retaken by demonstrators.

The confrontations come as campuses try a range of strategies from appeasement to threats of disciplinary action to resolve the protests against the Israel-Hamas war and clear the way for commencements.

At the University of Chicago protesters numbering in the several hundreds had gathered in an area known as the Quad for at least eight days. Campus administrators warned them Friday to leave the area or face removal.

Police in riot gear blocked access to the Quad early Tuesday as law enforcement dismantled the encampment. Officers picked up a barricade and moved it toward protesters some of whom chanted “Up up with liberation Down down with occupation!” Police and protesters pushed back and forth along the barricade as the officers moved to reestablish control.

At MIT protesters were given a Monday afternoon deadline to voluntarily leave or face suspension. Many left according to an MIT spokesperson who said protesters breached fencing after the arrival of demonstrators from outside the university. On Monday night dozens of protesters remained at the encampment in a calmer atmosphere listening to speakers and chanting before taking a pizza break.

Sam Ihns a graduate student at MIT studying mechanical engineering and a member of MIT Jews for a Ceasefire said that the group has been at the encampment for two weeks and that they were calling for an end to the killing in Gaza.

“Specifically our encampment is protesting MIT’s direct research ties to the Israeli Ministry of Defense” he said.

No arrests had been made as of Monday night according to the MIT spokesperson.

At the Rhode Island School of Design where students started occupying a building Monday a spokesperson said that the school affirms students’ rights to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly and that it supports all members of its community. The RISD president and provost were on site meeting with the demonstrators the spokesperson said.

The student protests have spread to Europe where they are gaining momentum. Police arrested about 125 activists Tuesday as they broke up a camp at the University of Amsterdam and German police dismantled an occupation at Berlin’s Free University. Students also have held protests or set up encampments in Finland Denmark Italy Spain France and Britain.

Many protesters want their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort. Others simply want to call attention to the deaths in Gaza and for the war to end.

Demonstrations at New York City's Columbia University where the protest movement began about three weeks ago have roiled its campus. Officials on Monday canceled its large main ceremony but said students will be able to celebrate at a series of smaller school-based ceremonies this week and next.

Columbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia’s green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks.

Similar encampments sprouted up elsewhere leading universities to struggle with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.

The University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony. Students abandoned their camp at USC on Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest. Other universities have held graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday.

A group of faculty and staff members at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill asked the administration for amnesty for student protesters who were recently arrested and suspended.

Harvard University’s interim president Alan Garber warned students that those in an encampment in Harvard Yard could face “involuntary leave"" meaning they would not be allowed on campus could lose their student housing and might not be able to take exams.

At the University of California San Diego police cleared an encampment and arrested more than 64 people including 40 students. The University of California Los Angeles moved classes online for the week due to disruptions following the dismantling of an encampment last week that resulted in 44 reported arrests.

Vowing to destroy Hamas Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34500 Palestinians about two-thirds of them women and children according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.

Hamas on Monday announced its acceptance of an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal but Israel said the deal did not meet its “core demands” and that it was pushing ahead with an assault on the southern Gaza town of Rafah.

“Cease-fires are temporary” said Selina Al-Shihabi a Georgetown University sophomore who was taking part in a protest at George Washington. “There can be a cease-fire but the U.S. government will continue to arm the Israeli military. We plan to be here until the university divests or until they drag us out of here.”

Check out those titillating invoices at the Trump hush money trial.,"Jurors did see Trump’s Sharpie-crafted signature on several $35000 checks that were drawn from Trump’s personal bank account and sent to Michael Cohen in 2017. Prosecutors hope jurors will conclude that Trump was personally involved in Cohen’s arrangement of hush money to keep porn star Stormy Daniels quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump.

But the salacious details were entirely absent Monday as attorneys grilled a former Trump Organization financial controller and a current bookkeeper about “accounts payable” and the nuts and bolts of how money moved through the massive company. In many of the instances at issue in the case these witnesses said the money ultimately moved at the direction of Trump himself.

The sense of abrupt deceleration stemmed in part from sky-high expectations for an explosive confrontation between Trump and Cohen or live testimony from one or both of Trump’s alleged paramours who figure in the case: Daniels and Karen McDougal a former Playboy Playmate who got a payout from Trump allies at the National Enquirer.

For court watchers hoping for that level of drama they’ll need to wait at least another day — or possibly much longer. Prosecutors revealed on Monday afternoon that they still have about two weeks’ worth of witnesses to go.

Defense attorneys meanwhile appeared to revel in the prosecution’s responsibility for the tedium and mercifully offered up only cursory cross-examination of both witnesses: former controller Jeffrey McConney and accounts payable clerk Deborah Tarasoff. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche’s questioning of Tarasoff took only five minutes.

“The checks that we just went through for the past hour and a half…” Blanche said as he opened one of his few questions to Tarasoff who’s worked for Trump for 24 years and gave Trump’s son Eric Trump a smile and a pat on the leg as she returned to the courtroom after a break.

As prosecutors plodded through the documents Monday they did draw out some subtext and nuances suggesting to jurors that there was an unusual air of secrecy and irregularity around the payments to Cohen. The documents associated with those payments — including the checks that prosecutors laboriously displayed — are the very business records that Trump is accused of falsifying in violation of a New York law on corporate fraud.

McConney testified that he was instructed to make the payments to Cohen at a brief meeting in 2016 with Trump’s then-CFO Allen Weisselberg. The controller said that while the payments were recorded as legal expenses pursuant to a “retainer agreement” they did not go through the Trump Organization’s legal department as such payments typically did.

Emails suggested Cohen was slow to understand that Trump’s accountants wanted invoices to support the monthly $35000 payments Cohen received.

“A lot of people ask for money. I need an invoice” McConney explained matter of factly.

When McConney reiterated that requirement to Cohen Cohen offered a somewhat puzzling reply: “Jeff Please remind me of the monthly amount.”

Cohen also at first simply typed in a few lines under the word “Invoice” in an email. He later sent monthly invoices to Weisselberg — but often curiously continued to omit the amount.

In later testimony Tarasoff said she checked with McConney and Weisselberg on those invoices and confirmed that Cohen was due $35000 each month.

Prosecutors’ suggestion of subterfuge and irregularity around the payments could be harnessed later to suggest Donald Trump’s consciousness of guilt on a key element in elevating the business-records charges from misdemeanors to felonies: that he knew the hush money payment to Daniels was legally required to be reported as a campaign contribution and that he conspired with others to hide it.

Trump’s attorneys disputed that there was any unusual secrecy around the payments and have suggested that any discretion around the matter was to protect Trump’s wife Melania and other members of his family not to influence the 2016 presidential election or to circumvent the more esoteric and debatable aspects of campaign finance law.

While prosecutors have seized on the categorization of the payments as “legal expenses” in Trump Organization bookkeeping records as a flagrant falsehood McConney said under cross-examination that label was simply one of a limited number of choices in “a drop-down menu” in the dated computer system used by Trump’s finance personnel.

“These categories: There was a level of rigidity to them right? … If you’re talking about payment to an attorney legal expenses was the account that was used” Trump lawyer Emil Bove asked McConney who readily agreed.

And while the prosecution made much of McConney keeping his notes about the structure of the payments to Cohen in a locked drawer the controller said that was standard practice for most of what he had in his office since it contained information on employee payroll and bonuses.

“I had a lot of sensitive information” McConney said.

While few reporters were seen gripping the courtroom’s wooden armrests Monday the hush money trial has featured an unusual dose of suspense for journalists — and for Trump’s defense attorneys. That’s because prosecutors have been unusually guarded about their schedule for the witnesses they plan to call each day.

The judge Juan Merchan has refused to order that sort of routine disclosure citing Trump’s public comments about witnesses and his repeated violations of the judge’s gag order.

Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said Monday that the prosecution has been voluntarily telling Trump’s attorneys “the day before” about whom the government plans to call the following day. “We did not want to have the next witnesses’ names out there” Steinglass said.

The most attention-grabbing developments of the day — the judge’s renewed threat to throw Trump in jail if he again violates the gag order and Trump’s defiant statement at day’s end that he’d proudly become a political prisoner if necessary — both took place out of earshot of the jury.

Most members of the jury remained attentive through the long slog Monday but one seemed visibly bored by the repetitive testimony. During the morning session he stared out into the gallery largely filled with reporters. By the afternoon he was resting his head in his hands as the documents popped up on small video monitors in front of the jurors and oversize ones mounted on the walls of the courtroom.

In this article we will walk through the creation of a workspace layout step by step using generative design in Revit.

Overview

At Autodesk we spend a lot of time thinking about the future in terms of the things we make how we make them and how we work. Events of 2020 including COVID-19 and social upheaval are both disrupting and accelerating many of the trends we’ve been tracking uncovering gaps in the way the world works: what we make where we make it how we make it and our understanding of who benefits.

The post-COVID-19 world will look different—politically economically and in terms of the built environment—than the pre-COVID world. We need to work together to forge not a new normal but a new better...to create spaces and processes that are better for all of us as we re-enter the world. This is an opportunity to rethink the AEC ecosystem.

From education to remote work to socializing with our friends and family in a way that keeps everyone safe we’re all acting as innovators now—and in ways we never imagined. We will need to rethink the people and processes that define our industry.

Over the past few months we’ve been talking to customers and health experts about current challenges and the constantly changing landscape. Four main themes have continued to come up; specifically the need to:

1. Accelerate remote and hybrid work

2. Plan to retrofit indoor and outdoor spaces

3. Solve for congestion points where people move through space such as at building entrances or through transit hubs

4. Improve indoor air quality

Space Planning

We’ve all seen the headlines. It’s the end of the open office floor plan. It’s the end of the gummy bear jar. The need to maintain a safe distance of six feet between employees means that commercial offices will need to be retrofitted at least temporarily. From the safe arrangement of desks and the width and spacing of aisles to the density of seating better data informs better decision making. AEC firms are actively thinking about what this looks like.

Dynamo and generative design in Revit can automate the iteration of workspace layouts to help determine what will work best in your client’s space.

With generative design in Revit you can build safe distancing standards into your workplace design studies. Use it to better visualize design data understand trade-offs and weigh different room layout options without the manual work of rearranging and reorienting desks and interior elements.

You can use Revit generative design to:

Optimize room capacity according to safe distancing guidelines

Generate explore and refine multiple layout options in a short amount of time—visualizing and supporting design decisions with data

Create custom logic with Dynamo to address specific design requirements or needs

Populate preferred design concepts directly into the Revit model

The tool can be applied to other project types as well such as redesigning the layout of a restaurant a grocery store or a hospital.

Think of this article as your training guide. Here you will learn how to use generative design in Revit to perform workspace layout. Through hands-on exercises with step-by-step instruction you will generate alternatives for the placement of desks in office environments. These exercises will increase in complexity as we go along starting with out-of-the-box Revit samples and working towards built-from-scratch studies in Dynamo for Revit.

Exercise 1: Desk Layout Using the Workspace Layout Sample Study

In this exercise you want to determine the best arrangement of desks in a large room using generative design in Revit. You plan to use the Workspace Layout study which generates layout alternatives in rows—suitable for an office space or classroom. Your goals are to maximize the number of desks maximize views to the outside and minimize the distance from each desk to the nearest exit.

1. Open the Datasets/Workspace Layout.rvt file.

2. On the Manage tab click Create Study.

The Create Study function lists available study types. These are the examples provided by Autodesk. Using Dynamo more study types can be added to help solve your organization’s unique design problems.

3. Select the Workspace Layout sample study.

4. Enter a unique name in the Study Name field.

5. The Method you select determines the logic that is used to generate design alternatives or outcomes. In this example you have specific goals so you will use Optimize. The settings change based on the Method you choose.

When creating a study using the Optimize method you can choose from the following goals:

Maximize the number of desks in the room (i.e. desk count)

Maximize the average score for the quality of views to outside from each desk (i.e. views to outside)

Minimize the average distance to exits

6. Select a room for the study. Go to the 03 – Floor view. Select the room 321 Open Office. (Note: In Revit rooms can be selected only in a plan view.)

7. Select an instance of the desk family to be used in the layout. For this exercise you will select the Desk family (a standard family available out of the box) sitting in the adjacent room 320 Media Review.

8. For Choose Variables you will choose the items whose values can change when generating outcomes. For this exercise ensure both are selected.

9. For Set Goals you will select the goals that are important for this study as follows:

10. In addition to defining variables and goals you can set constraints on the outcomes. In this case you will leave the default values unchanged.

11. For Generation Settings use the settings pictured below. These settings affect how the Optimize algorithm works. Check the Issues section and be sure to resolve any issues before starting the study.

12. Click Generate. The Explore Outcomes dialog box will appear and your study will begin generating.

13. When the study is done a green checkmark displays next to the study name. Outcomes display in the center pane showing the design alternatives resulting from the study.

14. Click the icon to collapse the studies list.

15. Each thumbnail is a live 3D view so a limited number of outcomes are displayed at one time. Use the controls to view the outcomes as a list sort them or display additional pages of outcomes.

16. Select an outcome and make sure the Details and Charts options are turned on from the top right corner. The outcome details appear in the pane on the right. The image is a 3D view that you can manipulate. The outputs indicate resulting values for this outcome and the inputs show the values used to generate it. Click the arrows at the bottom right to view other outcomes in detail.

17. You can also use the chart to filter outcomes. Click and drag over one or more columns to see outcomes that meet the criteria.

18. Click Clear filters to display all outcomes again.

19. To review and analyze outcomes in another way change the chart view to a scatterplot. Use the options here to change the criteria used for the X and Y axes and to format the display of outcome values.

20. Click a plot on the chart to select that outcome and view its details.

21. Once you have decided on a particular outcome that you want to integrate into the model select that outcome and click Create Revit Elements to add these elements to Revit.

22. The resulting desk layout in the 03 - Floor plan view appears as expected.

Open the 3D view Office Building. Here you notice that the desks are oriented backwards (i.e. back to front) from the desired result.

23. Fortunately this rotation issue is easily solved; simply select all desks and press the Space bar twice.

SYDNEY/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Australian-listed software maker Altium rejected a $3.9 billion takeover bid from U.S. peer Autodesk Inc on Monday as too low but kept the door open for a higher offer as its shares leapt to near six-month highs.

Autodesk which makes architecture designing software AutoCAD offered Altium A$38.50 for each share a 41% premium to its last closing price valuing the company at A$5.05 billion ($3.91 billion).

Altium rejected the approach ""at the current price"" which analysts said valued it at 17 times forecast 2022 sales or 44 times forecast earnings. It added that it would engage with interested parties for an appropriate valuation and pursue a ""review of all potential strategic alternatives"".

The phrasing ""at the current price"" potentially alludes to the willingness to complete a deal at a higher price analysts at brokerage RBC Capital said in a note.

""Autodesk may incrementally increase its offer to gain further engagement from Altium's board"" the analysts added.

A spokesperson for Autodesk said it was willing to engage further with Altium which services high-profile customers such as Apple Facebook Tesla BMW Intel and Samsung. The company wants to integrate Altium's electronics design software with its engineering and manufacturing software platforms to provide its users with a host of applications under one cloud network.

Jefferies analysts said they did not rule out a higher bid price from Autodesk but added that there could be other potential bidders such as France's Dassault Systemes and NASDAQ-listed PCT Inc.

Dassault and PCT did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

It was the second tech-sector takeover bid of the Australian day with customer relations and billing software provider Hansen Technologies receiving a A$1.3 billion approach from private equity firm BGH Capital on Monday that sent its shares to a record high.

Altium shares which had been hovering near its post-pandemic low of $23.11 in May soared as much as 40.6% on Monday to mark their biggest intraday gain in more than a decade following the takeover offer closing at A$37.83.

""Many tech stocks have been hammered -50% from their(overbought at the time) peaks back in early February"" Bell Potter sell-side strategist Richard Coppleson said in a note to clients.

""If corporates are seeing value – then maybe the sector's period of underperformance is now officially over.""

AI is the ability of a machine to perceive its environment and perform tasks that normally require human intelligence and it’s a whole field of different technologies techniques and applications.

Big data is a set of tools and capabilities for working with for processing extremely large sets of data.

How does AI and Big Data work together?

Big data is just one of the enablers of AI though as we see increasing volumes of data it’s one of the most important

How can this be applied to a manufacturing setting?

Broadly speaking there are many benefits of AI and the use of data which include reducing costs minimising human error and increasing productivity and efficiency. The important thing to consider is any setting - for the use of any technology - is what is the problem you are trying to solve? Be it merely automating repetitive tasks or to reinventing the nature of work in factories by having humans and machines collaborate in order to make better and faster decisions.

Why should manufacturers use AI and Big Data when adopting smart manufacturing capabilities what is the value for manufacturers?

One view is again the economic benefits of AI which come in manufacturing as a result of:

Productivity gains from automating processes and augmenting the work of existing labour forces with various applications of AI technologies. Increased consumer demand due to the increased ability to personalise and tailor manufactured products along with higher-quality digital and AI-enhanced products and services.

Manufacturing (and construction industries) are by nature capital intensive and in our 2018 report “The potential impact of AI in the Middle East” we estimated that the adoption of AI applications could increase the sectors’ contribution to GDP gains by more than 12.4% by 2030.

How can AI and Big Data help manufacturers to evolve in the Industry 4.0 revolution? What about those already looking at Industry 5.0?

It’s really about the investment you make now in order to futureproof your business.

We typically see two broad strategies or approaches to the adoption of AI. There are things that we can do immediately without any recourse to Big Data - which is to adopt technologies we describe as Sensing those involving computer vision for example. There are plenty of use cases where these can be used immediately in manufacturing such as for automatic fault detection. However there is a longer term play which requires investing in data - getting the right collection mechanisms in place storage data governance Big Data capabilities etc - in order to develop increasingly valuable machine learning driven AI use cases. This is absolutely necessary for long term adoption success.

What is the best strategy for organisations looking to realise the value of AI and Big Data in manufacturing?

AI and Big Data are only one part of a successful smart factory. The organisations that lead on AI adoption are those who have already made the most progress in digitising core business processes. In order get ahead in using AI solutions at scale there are a number of technology investments and organisational decisions to be made including:

Digitising processes ultimately leads to improved ability to generate data and in the manufacturing setting - with many 100s of sensors generating 1000s of measurements in real time the result is Big Data. Data is key to building AI so reliable and accurate data acquisition management and governance are key. The production line and factories play a critical and direct role in the data-acquisition process. AI strategy both long and short term begins with the use cases the business applications. Manufacturers need to ask where they want to use AI and gather these use cases together and prioritising projects based on a balance of expected impact and complexity of implementation.

Of course in addition to technology and business processes people are at the heart of any successful technology adoption.

Like many things the coronavirus pandemic took a mostly negative toll on this year’s Fortune 500. As the world locked down hitting pause on the global economy the overall profits of Fortune 500 companies dropped from $1.24 trillion to $859 billion. More than 70 percent of Fortune 500 sectors saw a decline in profits. A few sectors saw increases the list notes including technology and household products the latter of which reported a 106 percent increase in profits.

Women hit some big milestones on this year’s list. The number of women running businesses on the Fortune 500 hit an all-time record of 41; and for the first time ever two Black women are running Fortune 500 businesses (Roz Brewer of No. 16 Walgreens Boots Alliance and Thasunda Brown Duckett of No. 79 TIAA).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbXNkeW5hbWljc3dvcmxkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS93aHktYXp1cmUtc3luYXBzZS1saW5rLWRhdGF2ZXJzZS1pbXByb3ZlZC1keW5hbWljcy0zNjUtZGF0YS1hbmFseXNpcy1zdG9yedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse improved the Dynamics 365 data analysis story,"As expected many exciting announcements came out during Microsoft Build 2021.

In conversations with others in the Dynamics 365 CRM/CE community some have mentioned that this functionality feels like a rebrand of the ‘Export to Data Lake’ functionality that has been available for quite a while now and I partially agree.

The capabilities announced at this year’s Build add another extremely beneficial layer on top of the previous functionality: the automatic linking of the configured storage account with Azure Synapse Analytics and the creation of T-SQL views in the Serverless endpoint that queries from the data lake.

Work is underway on a $30 million 103000-square-foot county office building at 12611 Ravenwood Drive in Claridon Township. That new office building would house some Geauga County agencies including the Department on Aging Job and Family Services adult services Health Department and veterans services.

Chardon Geauga’s county seat filed a lawsuit against the county in October. In its June 3 summary judgment motion Chardon is seeking a declaration that the “usual office” of the county commissioners be maintained in the county seat.

The city defines the usual office of the county commissioners as:

the main offices of the three county commissioners

the main offices of the county administrator and all staff who directly or indirectly report to him/her including but not limited to the clerk to the commissioners the human resource specialist the benefit specialist the budget director the fiscal specialist the A/P assistant the archivist-records manager the micrographic specialist and the archives and record clerk

The main offices of the Maintenance Department the Water Resources Department the Department of Aging the Department of Job and Family Services the dog warden the Department of Emergency Services the Archives Department the Transit Department the Building Department the Community and Economic Development Department the Automatic Data Processing Board and the Planning Commission.

In a news release announcing the summary judgment motion Chardon stated that it has “sought many avenues to work together with the commissioners to try and accommodate their needs for expanded space.”

The city stated that in addition to frequent meetings with the commissioners Chardon also paid for a study “that determined it was feasible for the County to continue to use and expand the Courthouse and construct a new administrative building on the Square offering financial assistance to acquire the property.”

The city alleges that “as in the past the commissioners rejected these and all other options to keep county offices in Chardon.”

“The city stands to lose more than $120000 in annual taxes from the offices that are already scheduled to move to the new administration building” Chardon City Manager Randy Sharpe said in a statement. “If the commissioners ultimately succeed in moving the county seat out of Chardon and with it all remaining county offices including the courts businesses that support those county employees will also likely move out further hurting the city financially and potentially putting a chilling effect on economic development on Chardon Square.”

Geauga County Prosecutor James Flaiz who is representing the county in the case declined to comment on the city’s summary judgment motion because it is pending litigation.

Shortly after the city filed its motion the county filed a summary judgment motion of its own arguing “there are no genuine issues of material fact” in the case. In its motion the county argued that the Geauga County Commissioners’ office is currently located in Chardon and there are no plans to move that office.

“Therefore there exists no case in controversy as it relates to that matter” the county states in the motion.

The county also argues that the Ohio Revised Code does not prohibit counties from maintaining more than one office for its commissioners “and therefore the maintenance of a second office outside the county seat in addition to the office located within the county seat is appropriate.”

The county also argues that the offices of the county administrator the county departments the county archives and the other customary offices referenced in Chardon’s complaint are separate from the commissioners’ office.

“As a result there exists no requirement that those offices be located in the county seat” the county argues in the motion.

The case is assigned to Geauga County Common Pleas Court Judge David M. Ondrey."

Hundreds in fact if not thousands. But the legendary quarterback said the AutoZone Liberty Bowl’s Distinguished Citizen Award – which was presented to him Sunday at the Hilton Memphis – might rank ahead of them all on the cool scale.

“My father (Archie Manning has) won this award before. One of my old coaches Tony Dungy has won this award” Manning sporting an orange blazer and royal blue necktie told reporters before the program. “I think my dad used this line a couple of years ago but anytime you win an award that Elvis Presley won (in 1977) I think that’s pretty cool.”

Manning a two-time Super Bowl winner five-time NFL MVP and 14-time Pro Bowler also said receiving the award in Memphis – where his wife Ashley is from – made it even more special. On top of his family ties to the Mid-South Manning is also a minority owner of the Grizzlies. He said watched closely the team’s play-in games and playoff series against the Jazz and is encouraged about the franchise’s future.

“I think good things are ahead for the Grizzlies” Manning said. “The youth. The energy. We were here two years ago at a game and the kids got to meet Ja (Morant) down in the locker room. That was a big deal.”

Manning added his son Marshall 10 has a Morant jersey on the wall of his room at their home alongside Josh Allen Patrick Mahomes Tyreek Hill and Jerry Rice.

“He’s got Giannis (Antetokounmpo) too. Him and Morant are the only two hoops players up there” Manning said. “So that’s some pretty good company Morant’s keeping up there.”

Another team near and dear to Manning’s heart is Tennessee football. The former Vols legend net with athletic director Danny White as well as football coach Josh Heupel and his staff last month in Knoxville. White and Heupel were both hired in January.

The Vols have finished under .500 three of the past four seasons. Manning admitted he doesn’t expect things to turn around immediately but he expects UT to get there eventually.

“I sat down with (White and Heupel) for several hours just sort of talking football” Manning said. “I’m excited about (Heupel). Obviously he has work to do. It’s going to be a challenge. But I think he’s excited about the challenge. The fact that he and Danny have worked together (at UCF) sure helps.

“I’m on board. All our other sports programs are doing really well. We want football to kind of get back going. I still think it’s a great place to play. Certainly the conference is extremely competitive as we all know. But I think we can get back on track.”

As part of Sunday’s event a live auction and silent auction were held with 100 percent of proceeds going to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital was established in 2003 in Indianapolis making the cause a special one.

“I have great respect for what St. Jude does” Manning said. “Being involved with one in Indianapolis for years now it might be one of the best teams I’ve ever been a part of. I appreciate what St. Jude does because I’ve seen it firsthand in Indianapolis.”

The BMW X6 has never been regarded as a particularly good-looking vehicle and this particular X6 is uglier than most. In fact it could very well be the most horrific X6 on earth.



This X6 was recently snapped somewhere in the UK and a photo of it was shared on Reddit. As you can imagine Redditors haven’t held back in their criticism of the SUV with one suggesting that the owner probably got drunk and tried to make a time machine.

All kinds of miscellaneous items adorn the exterior of the BMW. On the roof for example you may notice a pair of CCTV cameras while the rear decklid has a handful of bizarre chrome parts. There are also some weird badges and stickers across the rear including hazard tape. Elsewhere there is a cylindrical object finished in chrome that’s attached to the bumper. In addition the X6 has been equipped with huge chrome tailpipes that protrude at least three inches out from the bumper.

Watch Also: Can The BMW X6 M Keep Pace With A Lamborghini Urus?

The weirdness continues along the sides of the X6 where you will notice black wheels with red accents. Black plastic covers have also been placed over the standard door handles and various silver and gold accents have been affixed to the doors. There’s even an additional mirror attached to the driver’s side wing mirror.

It’s impossible to know for certain what kind of look the owner of the X6 was trying to achieve but whatever it was we don’t think it has been particularly successful.",,,,,,,,,

JOHN DICKERSON: We turn now to the state of our economy with Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. Good morning.

CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF BANK OF AMERICA BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Good morning JOHN. How are you?

JOHN DICKERSON: I want to start- very well thank you. I want to start with the question of cyber-attacks. There have been a whole recent number of them and we've seen the way in which these ransomware attacks can affect the economy. How much time are you spending on this and has your approach to it become- have the stakes increased based on these new recent attacks?

MOYNIHAN: Well the financial services industry this has been an issue for many years and so I- I spent time on it. But frankly the good news is we have a great team and our spending a year has gone from maybe four or five hundred million dollars a year when I first became CEO a little over a decade ago to a billion dollars a year 2000 plus people work on it. We work in deep cooperation with the rest of the institutions in our industry. But there's more that can be done and there are suggestions and proposals that are coming out to do more sharing of information cooperation speed and- and things like that which I think need to be looked at by the administration and Congress and pushed through in order to protect more people.

JOHN DICKERSON: Tell me a little bit about that. Speed in particular seems to me to be crucial in one of these instances. What more needs to be done?

MOYNIHAN: We were able to create a group called the ARC. Now it was called FSARC before but that's a group of many companies that- that are inside the- the tent so to speak sharing information with people with the right clearances. And that allows us to move quickly when one person is seeing something and share it with others. And I think that kind of cooperation is in the most critical industries but needs to continue to be moved to more and more industries over time.

JOHN DICKERSON: Let's switch now to the health of the economy. The jobs report for May was good but not great. What do you see? You have a special window in on- on people spending and their consumer habits and economic activity. What are you seeing from your vantage point?

MOYNIHAN: Well a couple of key points about the economy. One is it's predicted to grow the US economy is predicted to grow at 7% this year and 5.5% next year by our team. If you think about that the economy is now as big as it was pre-pandemic roughly predicted to grow at two to three times the rate over the next couple of years. Our consumers have lots of money in their checking accounts. We think they spent about 65 or they have not spent about 65-70% of the last couple of rounds of stimulus. Loans are starting to pick up and there's plenty of borrowing capacity. Companies have unused lines. And the spending by our consumer which is a trillion and four so far this year is up 20% over '19 and obviously a lot over '20. And what that really tells you is that you're seeing a 10% growth rate which is a faster growth rate on a bigger amount. So the US economy is really set to go with a couple of key risks. One is supply chain dynamics that you I'm sure you've talked about in your show. And the other is people getting workers. And that bodes well for the unemployment figure which is starting to drop. And we predict to get in the low to mid 4s by year end which is a pretty strong recovery engineered by the work of the fiscal side the monetary side and frankly private industry.

JOHN DICKERSON: When you- focusing on that 20% over '19 as you mentioned '19 was not a pandemic year. So the spending appears to be- one of the things that we saw during the pandemic is people were paying down their credit card saving money. So do you attribute that 20% to essentially what some people call revenge spending or the sort of pent up consumer demand that was out there?

MOYNIHAN: I think a lot of it has to do with- and what you're seeing happen is really reopening across the board and- and so while certain places because the infection rates were different and reopened faster you've got a pretty universal application now. So even here in Massachusetts where I live you're seeing people be able to move about. So you're seeing the spending move to domestic travel spending is up dramatically. Car rentals hotels for leisure travel not business travel yet that will probably be late this fall is strong. Theme park bookings and things like that. Those are all very good signs. And by the way it's shifting from buying food in the store to more people going to sit-down restaurants even over quick-service restaurants. So you're seeing that natural behavior which is I can go out I can do things and I can sit down and eat dinner. Because frankly way back when I was first talking to MARGARET on this question it's a war against a virus and America is starting to win through all the great vaccination work that's going on. We're starting to win the war and it's not over yet. We've got to be careful to get it done. But we're starting to win the war and that's allowing the economy to reopen and that's allowing the spending to take place.

JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about small business. Bank of America is the largest lender to small business. More than 400000 closed during the pandemic. What are you seeing on the small business front and what kinds of businesses are borrowing and starting to take risks again?

MOYNIHAN: Well the- the good news is you're starting to see our in- our smallest businesses which is companies up to five million in revenue we're seeing the originations actually exceed what they were in 2019 for the month of May. They're a little bit up in April. They're basically flattish in March. So you're seeing it come on. And that's really the reopening in those economies. The businesses that are doing the best are the service side businesses like doctors lawyers and things like that really recover quickly. But now we've seen the supply chain the people supply in the industry et cetera growing faster. One of the things we got to work on is continue the supply chain. And I think that's- when we asked our small business what's on your mind in the fall it was all about the pandemic. In the spring survey we do which is millions of businesses we asked the question to it's all about getting workers and getting their supplies so they have things to sell and manufacture to sell to their customers. And that's something that's straightening out but will take a little time.

JOHN DICKERSON: And do you worry about the backlog of people paying their mortgages? Those who couldn't during the pandemic what happens when they lose government assistance? Will they be able to pay those mortgages?

MOYNIHAN: Well the good news at Bank of America it's really a thing of the past. At the high point we had given customers two million customers the right not to pay. We're down to a fraction of that now and it's going through the system. So I think at the- even in all mortgages you come down. So I think there's a little bit of the world has largely recovered but there's- there's a pockets of things that just have to be dealt with. And I'm sure the companies will deal with them fairly.

JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We've run out of time. Thank you so much Brian Moynihan for being with us. And we'll be right back.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXkueWFob28uY29tL21vcmdhbi1zdGFubGV5LWhpcmVzLWV4LWJvZmEtMDg0NzU0NzQ3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morgan Stanley hires ex BofA banker Rizzo to drive European client push - sources,"FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed on the Morgan Stanley building in New York

By Pamela Barbaglia

Morgan Stanley was not immediately available for comment.

A seasoned dealmaker who started his career at Goldman Sachs in 1993 Rizzo rose through the ranks becoming a partner in 2008 and working closely with some of Europe's most prominent dealmakers including Diego De Giorgi now co-CEO at Pegasus Europe.

In 2013 he joined Bank of America to take on top jobs in both M&A and investment banking for the EMEA region and moved to Paris after the Brexit referendum to oversee the bank's rollout across the EU.

In his new role he will advise clients including consumer and retail companies financial institutions and TMT (telecoms media and technology) conglomerates in their efforts to pursue strategic combinations that could speed up their post-COVID recovery.

The redeveloped complex at the corner of Front and Summer streets called The Uptown after a movie theater that was once there will be reserved for residents who are 55 and older. In total it will add 50 rental units to 10 that were in the structure before it was redeveloped.

Forty-two of them will be for low-income renters according to the project’s developer The Szanton Company.

The housing shortage that’s affecting all Maine communities is particularly serious in the midcoast making it harder for workers in the region to find places to live. Among other communities trying to build more housing is St. George where voters will decide next week whether to give away town-owned land to build new homes.

The new development in Bath which will have a grand opening on Wednesday joins another project that Bath Housing has been working to develop at 520 Centre St. in recent years.

The first phase of the Bath Housing project will bring 18 rental units for low-income residents and the second phase is expected to include an additional 24 units of single-bedroom rentals for a range of incomes according to Executive Director Debora Keller.

Any additional housing will go a long way to easing the crisis Keller said.

She noted that The Uptown will help preserve the historic Moses and Columbia Block buildings which were constructed in 1893 and redeveloped for the project after Bath Housing acquired the properties in 2019 and sold them in 2022 to The Szanton Company.

The buildings have also hosted shops the movie theater and a YMCA over the years and they will continue to maintain six retail spaces now that they’ve been redeveloped. Keller says the new housing option will make it easier for residents to live within walking distance of a number of downtown amenities.

“I just think this is one of the neatest housing projects I’ve seen in years” Keller said.

Rental prices on the apartments will range from $794 to $1495 per month depending on residents’ income according to The Szanton Company. Most of the units are one-bedroom apartments while six of them are two-bedrooms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNi9vcmlvbGVzLWRhdmlkLXJ1YmVuc3RlaW4tZ3Vlc3Qtc3BsYXNoZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Rubenstein to soak Bird Bath as Orioles' 'guest splasher',🚌 When is the last day of school?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9hcnRhbmRkZXNpZ24vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8wNC9oZW5yeS1tb29yZS1taW5pYXR1cmUtbXItZG9vZGxlLWJhdGgtaG9sYnVybmUtbXVzZXVt0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2FydGFuZGRlc2lnbi9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA0L2hlbnJ5LW1vb3JlLW1pbmlhdHVyZS1tci1kb29kbGUtYmF0aC1ob2xidXJuZS1tdXNldW0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Henry Moore’s miniature sculptures celebrated in Bath show,"Henry Moore is celebrated for his monumental sculptures that turn city squares and parks into outdoor art galleries. But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9jeGU4M2owNWtseG_SATJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvY3hlODNqMDVrbHhvLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Historic Royal Navy dolphin bell goes on display in Bath,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9maWxtcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA0L2thdGUtd2luc2xldC1zdGFycy13YXItcGhvdG9ncmFwaGVyLXdhc2hlZC1oaXRsZXJzLWJhdGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kate Winslet stars as war photographer who washed in Hitler's bath,"Looking every inch the battle-hardened foreign correspondent this is Kate Winslet as World War Two photographer Lee Miller.

For some the perfect destination might be a short drive away; for others the process might involve flying to another country — or another continent. Depending on the resources you have available to you that might be a challenge — or it might allow you to rack up more frequent flyer miles than you know what to do with.



The latest country to emerge as a prime destination for surfers is El Salvador. Writing at the Los Angeles Times Kevin Baxter explored the nation’s ascendancy in the surfing world. That El Salvador is presently hosting the last round of Olympic qualifiers is but one sign of its growing popularity among the sport’s faithful.



Baxter points to one particular stretch of beach as having an especially notable draw. This is the region known as Surf City. Baxter writes that “[a]t the center of those 13 miles are La Bocana and El Sunzal two top surfing spots known collectively as El Tunco after the distinctive volcanic rocks just a few feet off the beach.”



A distinctive landscape and excellent waves? It’s hard to argue with that. The nation’s government has also been involved in raising the profile of Surf City a process that’s included 5 years of work. It’s an understandable way bring international attention to the country — and hopefully benefit local businesses as well. For now El Salvador has its moment in the spotlight — and plenty of dedicated surfers eager to see where the waves take them.

Here’s an excerpt from the interview:

Spier: In the case of Berkshire Hathaway you’ve got to assume that the day you buy it Warren Buffett is no longer around. But the businesses that are in there even if they don’t own Amazon and they don’t own Salesforce.com and various other cloud and other businesses that are thriving in this time they have plenty of great businesses that will do absolutely fine.

You can be very… we can be very confident that the people at the top allocating capital even after Warren Buffett is gone are going to do a decent job of it and so what’s the likelihood that it turns out a return that is somewhat better than the S&P? It’s a very very good chance and you have to put the money somewhere.

I would say that more and more… I realize that like I don’t lose sleep over my Berkshire Hathaway position and I in a certain way actually I’m coming to the… I mean Warren Buffett said that he can’t guarantee that he’ll exceed the S&P over the next 10 years if I’m not mistaken from the annual meeting this time around.

But would you rather be in the S&P and have maybe some more volatility or have more worries or would you rather be in Berkshire Hathaway and sleep better at night and have less worries or know that it’s counter-cyclical but when the right moment comes they’ll be able to deploy a lot of capital.

Malone told the investor that he wouldn't buy the software stock due to competitive threats.

The media mogul later said he'd be ""bigger than Warren Buffett"" if he spun off fewer companies.

Warren Buffett may have declined to invest in Microsoft's IPO because of a media mogul's bad advice.

John Malone the billionaire chairman of Liberty Media cautioned the investor against buying a piece of the software company during a CEO retreat in the mid-1980s he told The Telegraph in 2018. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates had just finished pitching his fledgling business to a crowd of executives.

""Warren and I are sitting there and we hear Bill's presentation. Warren says 'John you know something about these technology companies would you invest in that?'"" Malone recalled.

""And I said 'S--- I don't think so Warren. It would be too easy for other people to compete with it. I don't see the barriers to entry'"" he added.

Read more: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has $140 billion in cash yet it pulled billions out of Apple Costco and Chevron. Veteran investor Chris Bloomstran explains why the cash pile isn't excessive and the sales made sense.

Malone was dead wrong in hindsight. If Buffett had put $1 million into Microsoft's IPO and never reinvested a single dividend his stake would be worth $2.5 billion today — a 250000% gain in 35 years.

Of course Buffett might have ignored Malone even if he'd recommended buying Microsoft stock. The Berkshire Hathaway CEO famously operates within his ""circle of competence"" only investing in things he understands. He also hunts for bargains and avoids expensive technology stocks — with the notable exception of Apple in recent years.

Even if Buffett had invested in Microsoft's IPO he probably would have sold his stock a few years later once he became good friends with Gates. The pair play online bridge together Buffett donates billions of dollars in Berkshire stock to the Gates Foundation annually and Gates was a Berkshire board member for several years.

Buffett officially ruled out buying Microsoft stock a few years ago citing the potential for accusations that Gates was feeding him inside information and vice versa.

It's worth noting that Buffett didn't miss the Microsoft boat entirely. He bought 100 shares of Gates' company shortly after meeting him ""just to keep track of what this young kid was doing"" the investor said in a 2016 interview.

Bigger than Buffett

Malone has taken a different approach to Buffett throughout his career spinning out scores of businesses instead of building a single conglomerate. He would be richer and more influential than Buffett if he'd kept his empire intact he said at an investor event in 2017 according to Deadline.

""I'd be bigger than Warren Buffett today if I hadn't spun shit off"" Malone said. The executive's famous quip is ""the store is always open"" meaning he's never opposed to selling his assets at the right price.

Liberty Media has carved out DirecTV Starz and many other subsidiaries over the years. Its key holdings today are SiriusXM Formula One and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.

In contrast Buffett has been collecting businesses under the Berkshire umbrella for more than 50 years. The conglomerate counts Geico See's Candies Fruit of the Loom Precision Castparts Dairy Queen and the BNSF Railway among its subsidiaries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFtZXNjb25jYS8yMDIxLzA2LzA1L3d5b21pbmctdG8tbGVhZC10aGUtY29hbC10by1udWNsZWFyLXRyYW5zaXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wyoming To Lead The Coal-To-Nuclear Transition With New Reactor Planned By Bill Gates-Backed TerraPower,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2021/06/05/wyoming-to-lead-the-coal-to-nuclear-transition/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFtZXNjb25jYS8yMDIxLzA2LzA1L3d5b21pbmctdG8tbGVhZC10aGUtY29hbC10by1udWNsZWFyLXRyYW5zaXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9oZXJlcy10ZWFjaC1jaGlsZC1uZXh0LXdhcnJlbi0xNzAwMDAyODAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's how to teach your child to be the next Warren Buffett,"Here's how to teach your child to be the next Warren Buffett

The billionaire CEO of Berkshire Hathaway started small before rising to the ranks of one of the wealthiest men on the planet — and he has plenty of advice for the next generation of young intrepid investors.

Warren Buffett believes in picking up smart financial habits early on and who are we to argue? Show your children how to spend and save wisely to prepare them as adults whether that’s through educational games or kid-friendly tools.

Over the years the Oracle of Omaha has offered a few nuggets of wisdom for parents on how to teach their own children about money — and even helped create an animated series for kids called Secret Millionaires Club.

Here are six tips you can use to turn your toddler into the next Warren Buffett.

1. It’s seriously never too early to learn

xiaoyuguai / Shutterstock

When Buffett says to start teaching financial skills early he means early.

“Sometimes parents wait until their kids are in their teens before they start talking about managing money — when they could be starting when their kids are in preschool” he told CNBC.

So how do you teach financial literacy to a three-year-old? Forget the stock market and start with the classics: Money doesn’t grow on trees.

You can play fun educational board games with them like Monopoly and Life and explain that spending isn’t as easy as tapping that card everywhere you go. It takes hard work to earn money so you shouldn’t spend frivolously.

2. Teach the value of saving — even $1

Youtube / Warren Buffett's Secret Millionaires Club

As soon as they’re old enough to understand start teaching your kids how to prioritize saving over spending.

Buffett wastes no time teaching the children in his animated series Secret Millionaires Club about interest.

“Saving even a little bit of money on a regular basis pays off” he says. “Instead of spending money on a soda which you don’t really need put it in savings and it will make even more money for you by earning interest.”

But lessons from cartoons only go so far — your kids could use some hands-on experience to be better savers. You can get them their very own savings account and debit card.

You can use an app to assign chores set up automatic deposits for their allowance and even deposit parent-provided interest. They’ll be able to see how much money they’re making and saving — but don’t worry Greenlight gives you ultimate control over how much they can spend with the card and where.

3. Be a heroic role model

LightField Studios/Shutterstock

Your kids are going to pick up some of your habits — the good and the bad. Buffett credits his own father for showing him how to build the right habits.

“My dad was my greatest inspiration” Buffett said in a 2013 interview with CNBC. “He was my hero when I was six and he is still my hero now. He is an inspiration to me in every way. What I learned at an early age from him was to have the right habits early.”

Story continues

Want to be a hero parent? Inspire your kids by making smart financial decisions. That doesn’t mean you need to be an expert investor but at least show your kids you know how to keep your house in order.

That means first of all eliminating any troublesome debt you’ve accumulated. If you’re struggling with high interest rates – the kind on credit cards for example — consider a lower interest debt consolidation loan to roll all those payments into one.

4. Separate needs from wants

A tough early lesson for kids: You can’t have everything you want.

Before they can manage their money responsibly you’ll need to teach them that there’s a significant difference between wants and needs.

In an interview with CNBC Buffett suggests having your kids make a list of five or 10 things they’d like to purchase. Then go through each item with them and mark whether it’s a need or a want and explain why.

When you do shop for the needs — or occasionally the wants — show your kids they can make meaningful decisions at that stage too. For example not every store has the same prices. With a free browser extension you can instantly scan for better prices at other sellers while you shop on Amazon Target and more.

5. Get them started in the stock market

Greenlight

Buffett bought his very first stock at the age of 11 with three shares of oil company Cities Service at around $38 per share. He later sold it for a small profit of $2 a share although he would’ve earned more if he waited out a bit longer — the stock shot up afterward to $200.

While most of us probably don’t start investing until later on in life you can give your kids a head start by breaking down some stock market basics like risks and rewards and profits and losses. Talk about trending market topics like Gamestop or their favorite brands and companies and show them how the market works so it’s more accessible to them.

You can even help them buy fractional shares of big-name companies they admire like Nike and Apple as little as $1.

6. Fuel their entrepreneurial spirit

It didn’t take long for Buffett to start sharpening his business skills.

Long before Berkshire Hathaway a six-year-old Buffett earned his first few cents selling sticks of gum in the neighborhood. Seeing an opportunity for even better margins he moved on to purchasing six-packs of Coke for a quarter and selling the individual cans for a nickel each.

Encouraging your kids to find money-making opportunities will help them down the road. Even a lemonade stand will help teach lessons like problem solving goal setting and salesmanship.

You might also consider building up some seed money for your child’s future ventures using an app that automatically invests ""spare change"" from everyday purchases.

Then when your child becomes an adult they'll be able to take over the account and use the lessons you've taught them to grow it even more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy92aWxsYWdlLXN1cGVyLW1hcmtldC1zdG9jay1zaG93cy0wMDAwMTAyMDQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Village Super Market Stock Shows Every Sign Of Being Modestly Undervalued,"- By GF Value

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Village Super Market is 3.8% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Retail - Defensive. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -1.2% which ranks worse than 76% of the companies in the industry of Retail - Defensive.

Another way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months Village Super Market's ROIC was 4.52 while its WACC came in at 1.59. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Village Super Market is shown below:

However there’s no single definition of what “refurbished” means in the tech world.(“To brighten or freshen up”. That’s how the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “refurbishing”.)

You can generally break down what it means in the context of gadgets into five streams. It may be a customer return perhaps sent back just days after the original purchase. It may be a new product with packaging damaged in storage and “refurbished” is the label the retailer decided to use. Or part of a discontinued line but still a “new” device”.

Refurbished tech can be flat-out second hand just given a once over and wipe before selling on. Or it could be a repaired device something you tend to only see in specific refurb tech categories as not many gadgets warrant a repair these days.

So phone laptops or audio gear should you buy a refurb? Let’s look at the reasons why you should why you shouldn’t and where you can actually get a tech refurb deal.

The rules of refurb

You need to look for at least one of three things when buying refurbished tech. But preferably all three. These are a darn good price a good returns policy and a warranty similar to what you’d get buying new. The benefit of the first is obvious: why buy refurbished if you only save a per cent or two?

Free returns are a huge benefit if you will buy from a company that sells “used” refurb tech which is likely to have some signs of use. These companies often rely on a grading system — often denoting condition with A/B/C labels. Free returns mean not just that you can send the gadget back if you’re not happy but that the company has clearly built this into its grading system and if anything the product is likely to be in better condition than described. A warranty is always important for the same reason you want a warranty when you buy anything new. You want to know you’re covered if something goes wrong.

Second-hand goods bought from online retailers are covered by the Consumer Rights Act 2015 which allows for 14-day returns and repair or replacement if the gadget can be proved to be not “fit for purpose” within six months. This actually extends to six years but after that the onus in on the buyer to prove any faults were there at the time of purchase. Good luck doing that. You are not covered for wear and tear of course.

Now a few areas of tech to be wary of. Older refurb phones may have been used a lot and their battery capacity may not be what it once was. To test you could find a review of the phone that uses some form of battery benchmark perhaps video playback and see how the refurb compares. Battery life too short? Return the thing within the 14-day window.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9yYXplci1ibGFja3dpZG93LXYzLW1pbmktaHlwZXJzcGVlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed Review: Premium-Priced Space-Saver,"The Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed hits the sweet spot between functionality and size clearing up desk space while offering a premium design and functionality. But it’s pricey compared to some fantastic 65% keyboards and its keycaps can get uncomfortable during heated gaming.

For some a clear space makes for a clear mind. And if you’re gaming more space also means extra room for your mouse and focusing solely on the inputs needed to level up. The best wireless keyboards already decrease clutter by cutting the cord but a wireless gaming keyboard in a smaller form factor can be a true game-changer for players seeking an efficient yet productive form factor.

The Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed fits the bill well. It’s Razer’s first 65% keyboard which is a good sweet spot for those who want a small keyboard but can’t let go of navigation keys. With arrow keys the BlackWidow V3 Mini is a more likely mate for both productivity and work than 60% keyboards. a more likely match for those who want a keyboard for both gaming and work. And Razer makes connectivity even across several PCs simple by offering the option to use a dongle Bluetooth with up to 3 devices or a USB-C to USB-A cable. A $180 MSRP means you’re paying a Razer tax though and the keyboard especially its keycaps aren’t perfect compared to the best gaming keyboards it’s up against.

If you haven’t tried a 65% layout before it’s worth a shot because you may just find your sweet spot. 65% keyboards chop off a lot of keys but keep the precious arrow keys and even some that typically live above them. Razer told me it wants the BlackWidow V3 Mini to be a “more inclusive option” than the 60% Razer Huntsman Mini  one that saves space but still is efficient in applications like Excel and PowerPoint. No more keyboard switching is the idea but if you do heavy number input into Excel you’ll probably still miss the numpad.

The BlackWidow V3 Mini has Delete Page Up Page Down and Insert keys which all also double as macro keys when you’re holding Fn. That’s a little more than some other 65% keyboards such as the wired Ducky Mecha SF Radiant  which leaves out Insert in favor of a Ducky logo and doesn’t double up those keys as macros. Already we see the more gaming-friendly side of Razer’s 65% option.

However I rarely use those four keys and would personally prefer a Print Screen option if anything. Of course I could reprogram this via software and even switch out a keycap if I was that serious. But since I don’t care for that quartet of additional buttons over a 60% keyboard something like the Cooler Master SK622  which doesn’t have dedicated keys for any of those functions except for Delete would be even more efficient for me. That keyboard also saves a little bit of space measuring 11.5 x 4.1 x 1.6 inches while weighing only 1 pound. The Razer (12.6 x 5.1 x 1.6 inches 1.8 pounds) is still on par with Ducky’s Mecha SF Radiant (12.8 x 4.1 x 1.6 inches 1.9 pounds) though.

The V3 Mini doesn’t have a function row but gets a lot done with its Fn key. Just as with the Huntsman Mini out of the box pressing Fn will disable any lighting you have on and provide white lighting to the keys with a secondary function. In addition to the number row handling F1-F12 there are also side-printed functions for macro recording adjusting RGB brightness media controls and the missing navigation keys.

Still some tasks were more tedious on the 65% board. For example to take a screenshot of a specific window instead of pressing Windows + Alt + Print Screen I had to hit Windows + Alt + Fn + Print Screen while locating the key that has Print Screen as a secondary function (see how to take screenshots in Windows 10 or 11). The side-printing is easy to read from typical seated positions. But unlike the main legends on the keys these aren’t doubleshot so could fade with time.

The BlackWidow V3 Mini has flip-out feet for 6 or 9-degree elevation but I preferred keeping it flat as my wrists already sloped down due to the lack of included palm rest. If I were to use this as my forever keyboard I’d need to find some sort of compact wrist rest  which is a mild annoyance considering the keyboard’s price.

Besides that the BlackWidow V3 Mini takes many characteristics from the BlackWidow line  which includes the full-sized BlackWidow V3  wireless BlackWidow V3 Pro and BlackWidow V3 Tenkeyless .That includes a plastic base that’s shiny around the lip allowing the snake trio that is the Razer logo to peek through with customizable RGB.

The plastic base is subtly textured and surprisingly durable in that it doesn’t seem like it’ll scratch or nick easily. “For Gamers by Gamers” written in a designer bag like pattern on the underside makes you feel special. An aluminum top plate sits atop that for more heft and more fingerprints. But because there’s such little wasted space on the BlackWidow V3 Mini that issue is mostly limited to the keyboard’s bottom slope.

Razer went with doubleshot ABS plastic keycaps that are a good and cheaper substitute for doubleshot PBT. The ABS plastic here is still visibly textured especially in bright lighting is good at fighting smudges and allows RGB to shine through perfectly. Although they’re still slippier than doubleshot PBT it could fool the less-aware gamer.

The BlackWidow V3 Mini uses the same font as other BlackWidow keyboards with a lower-case font that can feel slightly kiddish especially if you opt for rainbow RGB and in the truncated right Shift key. Speaking of the right Shift’s size will be a problem for some but I’m a righty and touch typist who never uses the right shift key so besides it looking a little funky I’m okay with the sacrifice.

Typing Experience on Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Razer offers the BlackWidow V3 Mini with either clicky Razer Green switches (which we tested in our BlackWidow V3 Pro review ) or linear Razer Yellow switches with added sound dampeners which we’re testing here. Razer specs its Yellow switches with 3.5mm total travel actuating at 1.2mm with 45g of force versus Cherry MX Red’s 4mm/2mm/45g.

I don’t have another keyboard with Razer Yellows on hand to directly compare the dampeners' effectiveness but compared to the sound displayed in our Razer Yellow hands-on a few years ago my test keyboard sounded quieter and less high-pitched and annoying. For the most part I enjoyed the soft clacking of the BlackWidow V3 Mini during testing. Most of the keys’ noises are an inoffensive volume and even if your mic picks it up your teammates won’t be nearly as distracted then if you were using a clicky mechanical switch.

But while the spacebar still manages to sound soft despite an extra plastic-y note the Backspace Enter and right Shift which also show some wobble make too much of a plastic racket that stands out compared to the other keys. I also noticed a small amount of unwanted pinging but this was only occasional.

I don’t typically like using linear switches for typing but getting work done on the BlackWidow V3 Mini was easier than expected. I still missed my tactile bumps and clicks but the keyboard’s layout is logical and the keys properly spaced so there were no other distractions. The keycaps are also more comfortable than many other ABS ones and the keys never felt mushy.

On the 10FastFingers.com typing test I averaged 122.7 words per minute (wpm) and 95.2% accuracy. That’s faster than my typical 118 average but my accuracy dropped 2.8 percentage points. The speed may be due to the faster travel and lack of a tactile bump to get through but I believe that bump would’ve helped my accuracy.

Wireless Experience on Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Razer recommends using the BlackWidow V3 Mini’s 2.4 GHz USB-A dongle for gaming and even remembered to provide a spot for dongle storage on the keyboard’s underside; (although the plastic covering could be more durable). Even better I never lost my connection during testing even when gaming with my best wireless mouse and a pair of Bluetooth headphones. The only time I noticed obvious lag was when the battery was under 2%. At this point RGB started changing effects unprovoked and the keyboard would occasionally repeat inputs for some reason so I wouldn’t use it much at that battery level anyway.

If you prefer to save a USB port you can connect via Bluetooth by sliding the toggle on the front edge over to the “BT” side. The keyboard can connect to up to three devices via Bluetooth and toggle through them by hitting Fn + 1-3.

Gaming Experience on Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Many prefer the smooth travel of linear switches like Razer Yellows. Packed inside of the BlackWidow V3 Mini these switches felt fast and responsive not only keeping up with my inputs but feeling potentially faster than gaming with heavier switches like Razer Greens (4mm total travel 1.9mm actuation 50g of force).

Movements felt easy. With just a light touch I could walk my character long distances without growing weary or feeling like the key was too unstable if I didn’t bottom out. I often find keyboards with Cherry MX Reds exhausting in that regard because I can feel like I'm floating when depressing halfway for an extended period. That wasn’t the case with this keyboard making my adjustment to linear switches over my preferred tactile and clicky switches easier than expected. Well-spaced keys also made strategic inputs easy so I didn’t end up murked because I was hitting the wrong button.

But after even just 15 minutes of gaming the keyboard would get noticeably clammy. Now this was before things even got heated on the battlefield. When I grazed my finger down the W key for example while exploring my virtual world I’d encounter an unpleasant feeling. You may mistake the BlackWidow V3 Mini’s doubleshot ABS keycaps as PBT at quick examination but once you get gaming the truth will be apparent. After serious gaming for an hour the clacker got seriously clammy and dare I say sticky-like.

But there are some gaming advantages here. The obvious one is the keyboard’s small form factor which afforded me more space to not only move my mouse but to get comfortable by positioning my keyboard in different angles.

If you’re concerned about sound Razer used sound dampeners with this keyboard to make its linear switches even quieter. I don’t have other Razer Yellows on hand but I do enjoy the sound.

Battery Life of Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

When I used Razer’s keyboard with its dongle connection and rainbow Wave RGB effect at max brightness for about 26 hours and 17 minutes and Synapse’s battery meter read 3%. This was with the keyboard set to dim lighting after 1 minute of activity and to turn off after 15 minutes of activity (the shortest amount of times available). Once the battery level dropped to about under 2% the lighting would automatically turn off unless I was actively typing and would change effects without me asking. There was also input delay and repeated inputs key bindings stopped working and Synapse wouldn’t recognize the keyboard so I wouldn’t want to use the keyboard at under 3% battery.

Razer claims the BlackWidow V3 Mini can last for up to 200 hours without any RGB whether using the dongle or Bluetooth connection. With the keyboard’s Spectrum Cycling RGB effect at max brightness Razer’s battery life estimate drops to 17 hours. If you keep brightness at 30% max the expectation is 48 hours.

Razer told me the keyboard can charge to 100% after 4 hours and 50% after 30 minutes. However your experience may vary as I let my test unit’s battery run out charged it for 30 minutes with the included cable and a 5V/2A power brick and only had 11% battery after. After 4 hours of charging though the battery meter on the mouse’s software read 100%.

Features and Software of Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed

Synapse continues to be the tool of choice for Razer’s RGB and feature-clad lineup offering control over everything from per-key and logo RGB to almost every key’s function. My favorite part however is the battery life reading stated in a clear specific percentage.

The Customize section lets you set almost every key’s (not Windows or Fn) function including different keyboard and mouse actions RGB control and the ability to switch another Razer product’s profile. With Razer’s HyperShift feature Fn doesn’t only activate certain key’s side-printed secondary functions it can also activate secondary functions assigned via Synapse among most other keys. Indeed one of Razer’s advantages is the volume of customization options -- so long as you don’t mind running Synapse in the background.

If you do the BlackWidow V3 Mini makes a decent effort of offering some features app-free. For one you can toggle through some RGB presets by pressing Fn + Ctrl + 1-7. And in addition to being able to store an infinite number of profiles in the software (thanks to the cloud) there are 4 onboard memory profiles. But how to toggle through those profiles isn’t obvious. In my few weeks with the keyboard I couldn't figure it out on my own. I had to ask Razer which taught me to fold Fn + C. And indeed when you hold down Fn the C key lights up to let you know it has a secondary function. But there's no side-printing on the C key to remind you that it can perform profile toggling. Additionally RGB settings don't carry over. And some advanced functions like inter-device control and launching apps or websites still require Synapse to be open.

You can also do macro recording on the fly but it requires Synapse to be running in the background. But remember four keys are ready to serve as macro keys alongside Fn so it’s worth considering. If you plan on using dedicated macros often though a full-size keyboard may be a better fit especially something with macro keys like the Corsair K95 RGB Platinum XT .

Synapse’s Lighting section offers access to RGB controls like brightness from 0-100% and the ability to toggle 11 preset effects including your typical rainbow wave and Fire which plays around with the red and orange color scheme flickering across keys. For customized effects you’ll need the Chroma plug-in which offers expansive layers of customization options including over the snake logo.

Power is a simple but important menu. There’s a battery meter here plus the option to make RGB dim automatically or have the keyboard turn off after a certain amount of inactivity (to conserve battery).

Bottom Line

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed is Razer’s first 65% keyboard but adopts the brand’s tradition of high-priced high-functionality peripherals gamers would be proud to carry. This keyboard is an exciting addition particularly because of its efficient layout. If you don’t need a numpad this is about as good as it gets without making basic navigation burdensome.

You can go slightly trimmer though. The Cooler Master SK622 offers an interesting counter offer in what is essentially a 60% keyboard with arrows. Wireless connectivity is Bluetooth only though and many will prefer the reliability of the BlackWidow V3 Mini’s dongle and the option to toggle through up to 3 more PC connections via Bluetooth.

We rank the 75% Keychron K2 as the best wireless keyboard for productivity and the 65% version the Keychron K6 is much cheaper than the BlackWidow V3 Mini at under $105 with RGB or without .

And if you can stomach a cable the Ducky Mecha SF Radiant offers a striking design a broad range of Cherry switches and doubleshot PBT keycaps an upgrade over what the BlackWidow V3 Mini offers for $159 .

But with this level of customization from key bindings to RGB to multi-PC connectivity there’s very few if any in the 65% category that can compete with the BlackWidow V3 Mini’s gaming-ready featureset.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9nb29nbGUtcGl4ZWwtYnVkcy1hLXNlcmllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Pixel Buds A-Series review,"Why you can trust Laptop Mag Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.

It’s like deja vu but with a much more affordable price tag. The Google Pixel Buds A-Series take everything I liked about the 2020 Pixel Buds and dropped the price to a budget-friendly $99. And while you’d think Google would cut corners somewhere to get to the lower cost these buds are just as good as their predecessor. However the A-Series still retain most of the faults of Google’s previous buds including a lack of active noise cancellation and lower maximum volume. But for the price and the seamless integration of Google Assistant I doubt many Android diehards will mind. Either way the A-Series have earned their place on our best wireless earbuds page.

Google Pixel Buds A-Series pricing and availability

I never thought I’d see the day when a pair of flagship wireless earbuds were priced at under $100 but here we are. The Google Pixel Buds Series-A are available for only $99.99. Compare that to other flagships on the market including the $197 Apple AirPods Pro $178 Sony WF-1000xM3 and $279 Bose QuietComfort Earbuds and you see why these are such a compelling option. Even the 2020 Google Pixel Buds are pricey at $179.

Google Pixel Buds A-Series design

The fresh maker! Sorry The Pixel Buds continue to remind me of a pair of Mentos. Thankfully these earbuds have an IPX4 rating much like their competitors so you can at least splash them with Diet Coke. Although I can’t promise you’ll get that Coca-Cola volcano you’re looking for.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The A-Series are currently available in two colors: Clearly White and Dark Olive. They’re not the most compelling colors but I’m hoping Google will release more eye-catching hues down the line. My review units are colored Dark Olive which in person looks more gray than green. Quibbles about tint aside the earbuds retain much of the 2020 Pixel Buds’ design elements starting with the matte finish with an uppercase G stamped in the middle of the cap. While the earwing is also made of a matte material the back of the earbuds gleam with a glossy gray casing. You’ll see two holes along the back for the microphone and bass port with either an R or L stamped in black to let you know which bud goes in which ear.

And while the A-Series might look like Mentos the white matte charging case looks like a mega Tic Tac or a misshapen macaron. A thick gray seam along the front shows where to flip it open. When you do open the case the interior matches the back of the earbuds in that shiny gray plastic. You’ll also see a bright white light right below the seam. Flip the case over to see the pair button at the bottom. And at the very bottom of the case is the USB-C charging port.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

At 0.18 ounces the A-Series weigh the same as their predecessor. But measuring 0.8 x 1.2 x 0.7 inches the new buds are larger than the 2020 Pixel Buds (0.8 x 0.8 x 0.7 inches). Still the A-Series are smaller than the AirPods Pro (0.19 ounces 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches) and the QC Earbuds (3 ounces 1.5 x 1 x 1.1 inches).

As for the charging case it weighs 1.5 ounces without the earbuds (1.9 ounces with the buds) and measures 2.5 x 1.9 x 1 inches. It’s absolutely dainty compared to the AirPods Pro (2.7 ounces 3.5 x 2 x 1.3 inches). Surprisingly the Bose’s case is a scooch lighter (1.6 ounces 2.4 x 1.7 x 0.9 inches).

Google Pixel Buds A-Series comfort

The A-Series are really comfortable to the point where I happily wore them for 2.5 hours. They fit snugly along my ears’ scapha hiding just under the helix. I definitely felt the default medium eartips expand against the entrance to my ear canal but it was never uncomfortable. In fact it felt more like a tiny ear hug. Google has embedded a spatial vent to alleviate in-ear pressure and enhance spatial awareness. However if the default tips aren’t just right you can swap them out for either the large or small tips.

Google Pixel Buds A-Series setup

Google is borrowing a few of Apple’s tricks with its proprietary Fast Pair technology. As soon as I flipped open the charging case a big prompt informed me that the A-Series were ready to pair appeared on both my Google Pixel 5 and my Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra . Clicking the Setup button took me to a quick firmware update. From there the A-Series were ready to rock and roll.

As demonstrated by my Note 20 Ultra the A-Series will pair with any device including iOS gadgets as long as it has Bluetooth 4.0 capability. Want to use Google Assistant? Your phone or tablet needs at least Android 6.0.

Google Pixel Buds A-Series controls

Tap controls can be hit or miss with wireless earbuds. Too sensitive and the slightest brush can trigger an unwanted action. Not sensitive enough forces harder taps which is an uncomfortable experience both physically and aurally. Google threaded the needle on this one activating commands with a light but firm tap.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

When listening to music a single tap will play/pause a track while a double tap will skip the track forward and a triple tap skips backward. When a call comes in a single tap answers while a double tap ignores or ends the conversation. But unlike the 2020 Pixel Buds to raise or lower the volume you have to use Google Assistant or (shudder) touch your phone.

Speaking of Google Assistant a long press on either bud summons the digital assistant to read any recent notifications. For any further Assistant action you’ll utter the magic words “Hey Google.”

Google Pixel Buds A-Series features

Features on a pair of sub-$100 earbuds are typically a non-existent occurrence. Not so with the A-Series. All those snazzy features from the 2020 Pixel Buds are also standard on the A-Series. For instance the A-Series allow you to use Google Translate which lets you carry on a conversation in over 40 languages. To test it out I said “Hey Google help me speak Spanish” and long-pressing a bud. Google Translate launched on my Pixel 5 and I started speaking in English. From there Translate actually read out my sentences into Spanish.

In order to simulate a conversation I turned to Telemundo and watched Hoy Día and tapped the right microphone in the Google Translate app. The software began translating into English in real time and did a better job than I could do with my rudimentary grasp of the language.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Another nifty Google Assistant-powered feature is Notifications which as the name suggests lets the digital assistant read out your recent activities including email messages flight changes and traffic updates to name a few. Once again I long-pressed an earbud to initiate the feature and heard a chime then the assistant began reading the latest text messages starting with an email. After announcing who the email was from and the subject line I pressed an earbud until I heard a chime to hear the full email. To stop hearing notifications I quickly double-tapped the earbud and went back to listening to music.

Using voice command I launched my favorite Spotify playlist. I also used the buds for walking directions to my doctor’s appointment. I appreciate how seamlessly Google integrated voice command into the A-Series. This is the most I’ve used a digital assistant in a long time.

The buds also have a Find My Earbuds feature that will show the lost buds location or you can ping the bud causing it to ring increasingly louder as long as you have the corresponding app installed. The app successfully showed the approximate whereabouts of the buds on Google Maps. And when I rang the buds they eventually got to a volume where I could hear them in my bedroom while I was in the living room.

Google Pixel Buds A-Series app

I don’t know about you but I like my wireless earbuds to have a companion app. It’s here that you can really unlock the buds’ potential as well as make a few personal tweaks. The A-Series employs the same app as the 2020 Pixel Buds. That means the app still lacks an adjustable equalizer. However it does feature a Bass Boost as a small consolation prize.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Equalizer aside the app does have plenty of other settings to play with. You can set what notifications Google Assistant will read as well as check battery life. The app also allows you to enable/disable Adaptive Sounds in-ear detection and Google Assistant. You can also check battery life status change the earbuds’ name and activate Find My Earbuds.

Google Pixel Buds A-Series adaptive audio

I yearn for the day that Google makes the leap into the active noise cancelling arena. But alas today is not that day. Instead Google relies on its Adaptive Sound technology and the tight yet comfortable seal created by the A-Series’ eartips. In practice Adaptive Sound constantly listens to your environment and adjusts the volume on your audio accordingly.

So when I was in the solitude of my house working on a review I had the volume set to about 40% volume. When I took a break to fix lunch the banging of pots and pans caused the volume to increase in an attempt to block out the outside world. And when I was finished making my slightly noisy task the volume returned to my original setting.

And while it’s a cool feature in theory it doesn’t have as much oomph as I’d like. The volume increase is very slight. So when I left my house to walk to the subway it did very little to shut out the ambient noise of the outside world forcing me to raise the volume manually by asking Google Assistant.

Google Pixel Buds A-Series audio

Just like the 2020 Pixel Buds the A-Series utilize a pair of custom 12-millimeter dynamic drivers that deliver great sound. They sound better than a pair of sub-$100 have any right to. The highs and mids are nice and full while the lows are deep and weighty.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Listening to Stormzy’s “One Second” the upper register of the piano was clean and bright with crisp percussion. Stormzy’s raspy delivery was front and center as was singer H.E.R.’s alto. The organ portion of the track had a bit too much reverb which muddied the track but not enough to take away from my overall enjoyment. The AirPods Pro dealt with the organ parts of the track better and I had a better time hearing the twangs of H.E.R’s guitar as she closed out the song. Plus the AirPods Pro are louder than the A-Series with the former’s 50% equating to the latter’s 75%.

The A-Series had a bit more clarity during “True Kind Of Love” from the Steven Universe soundtrack. The synthy keyboard was a lot easier for the earbuds to handle which let me enjoy the gentle crescendos amidst the snare drum and the cymbals. The low end was cleaner than what I heard on my first test track. However when I turned on Bass Boost the lows overwhelmed the rest of the track almost encroaching on Estelle’s vocals. The keyboard sounded light and airy on the AirPods Pro giving buoyancy to Estelle’s deep alto without losing the drum machine.

For my last song I went with Ayron Jones “Killing Season.” And despite having the volume at about 80% what should have been an aggressive opening guitar riff sounded distant and somewhat toothless. Still I had no problems hearing the grit in Jones’ vocal delivery. The same opener on the AirPods Pro had the punch I was looking for. Plus there was a fairly spacious soundstage so I could focus on individual parts of the song.

Google Pixel Buds A-Series battery life and Bluetooth

It would have been nice if Google could have boosted the A-Series battery life but we don’t deal in coulda-woulda-shouldas. So the A-Series is still rated for an estimated 5 hours of listening time and 2.5 hours of talk time. The earbuds made it through a little more than half my work day at 4 hours and 15 minutes which was spent between video conferencing listening to music and taking a few phone calls. Similar to its predecessor the right bud tends to drain faster than the left.

When the buds need a recharge 15 minutes in the charging case will get you 3 hours of listening time which translates to 1.5 hours of talk time. With additional charges the A-Series battery life is estimated at 24 hours putting it on a par with the AirPods Pro and outlasting Bose's 18 hours.

Thanks to the A-Series Bluetooth 5.0 chip I had no problem leaving my Pixel 5 in the house while I went out back to tend to my grill. The connection also held up whether I was upstairs with my phone or downstairs to record a podcast. The connection didn’t start to drop until I left my apartment to take out the garbage.

Google Pixel Buds A-Series call quality

Whether I was running meetings with my staff or just chatting with friends the A-Series’ pair of beamforming microphones were up to the task. My staff couldn’t tell I was even using earbuds until I mentioned it. And when my friend called when I was running errands they couldn’t hear any wind resistance but they definitely heard the train running overhead in the background. I didn’t have any complaints from my side of the calls as everyone who I spoke to came through loud and clear.

Bottom line

Who says you need to spend over $100 for a pair of quality flagship-grade wireless earbuds? Clearly not Google. Similar to what the company did for the Pixel 5 it has done for the A-Series wireless earbuds. For $99 you get a pair of truly wireless earbuds that are packed with features and super comfortable with just a splash of water resistance.

If you’re looking for a bit more oomph on the volume and some active noise cancelling action you’ll want to look at the $197 Apple AirPods Pro $178 Sony WF-1000xM3 or $279 Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. But if you’re a diehard Android fan with an eye on your budget who is looking for a pair of earbuds with solid audio quality the Google Pixel Buds A-Series are the way to go.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9taW5uZWFwb2xpcy1zdGFydHVwLWhlbHBpbmctcmV0YWlsZXJzLXVwLXRoZWlyLXByZXNlbmNlLW9uLXNpdGVzLWxpa2UtYW1hem9uLWV0c3kvNjAwMDY0NzQxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minneapolis startup helping retailers up their presence on sites like Amazon Etsy,"For many consumers Amazon is a one-stop shop to easily buy nearly any mass-produced item. But the digital platform is not so easy to navigate for the retailers that try to use it to sell their wares.

""[Amazon's] business is figuring out different ways the consumer can shop on their platform and buy as many products as possible so when you talk about the seller the seller has a tougher job on their hands than the consumer"" said Darrin Levine founder of retail management software company Asdal.

Levine 26 first started working on software and e-commerce programs during a college project. He launched Asdal in 2017 and it was a finalist in 2019 for Meda's Million Dollar Challenge. It has grown to have more than 20 employees who work mostly remotely and helps retailers achieve an average of $67000 in monthly gross revenue in less than 16 months.

The company headquartered in north Minneapolis has a goal to help direct-to-consumer retailers better manage their digital stores on a range of online marketplaces including Amazon Etsy Shopify and Instagram.

Especially after the acceleration of e-commerce adoption by consumers during the pandemic Levine said his company's mission has become more urgent as it focuses on helping retailers use online platforms more efficiently and make sense of data.

""The digital market is here now"" Levine said as he walked Nicollet Mall with a couple of his business partners. ""COVID sped that adaption up. Grandmas are buying stuff online now grandpas are buying stuff online and when baby boomers are starting to buy stuff online go!""

Specialty retailers unlike the big-box stores that many have flocked to during the pandemic will increasingly become what consumers turn to online as their shopping patterns change Levine said.

""No one is is really here fighting for these retailers these up-and-coming retailers. … These specialty retailers what they have that the Amazons and the Targets will never have they have these humanistic bonds [to their customers]"" Levine said.

Asdal has developed four versions of a suite of programs called Grit that offers retailers a platform to address account management sales tracking marketing data and analytics customer service logistics and more depending on how much assistance the client needs.

In the last few weeks Asdal has released its most comprehensive service Grit Automation. With the service the company's staff works with partners including e-commerce company Ecom Capital to help clients develop a product create brand identity and marketing build the supply chain and sell the product online.

""It's basically doing everything A to Z for a client somebody who has wanted to get into the space almost like a different aspect of investing if you want to say"" said Levi Strowder another partner at Asdal who works to get new clients.

Besides working with clients from big to small Asdal also intentionally tries to support minority-run companies said Levine who is Black. It is still hard for minority-owned startups to obtain venture capital in the Twin Cities he said.

""It's still political for no reason and so underrepresented for Blacks"" Levine said.

The economic issues caused by the pandemic did affect Asdal. The company charged less for some of its services because so many retail clients were hurting including some clients that they consulted. Soon Asdal plans to expand internationally to integrate into online marketplaces in other countries.

""There's almost an Amazon in every corner of the world now"" Levine said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9yZXZpZXdlZC8yMDIxLzA2LzA1L3NoYXBld2Vhci1nZXQtc2xpbW1pbmctYmFjay13b3JrLXVuZGVyZ2FybWVudHMtNy83NTQ5NTIyMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shapewear: Get slimming undergarments from $9 at Macy's,"Christine Persaud

Most activists — think Paul Singer and Carl Icahn — are in it for the money. Engine No. 1 wants to make money with a progressive twist: The fund’s founders argue that there’s gold in green.

These savvy veteran investors say making the world a better and greener place will translate into big earnings for companies and bigger returns for shareholders. Windmills apparently can produce efficient ­energy at a profit. Electric cars will soon be replacing gas guzzlers.

Whether this sentiment expands beyond the woke is a matter of debate. I know plenty of investors who aren’t convinced that green investing is anything more than a politically ­induced fad that will never make money and wouldn’t get financing if it weren’t for government grants. As proof they point to the world’s greenest company — electric-car maker Tesla — which feasts on government subsidies and barely turns a profit despite its much-hyped stock price.

Of course that hasn’t stopped the progressive celebrations over the news that Exxon will now have to place three reps from Engine No. 1 on its board to force change.

Engine No. 1 wants the company to figure out ways to reduce its carbon footprint which again sounds good until you realize it’s also a fancy way of saying it wants Exxon to do less of what it’s good at. And by the way what does Engine No. 1 know about running an oil company?

Giving credibility to this apparent lunacy has been one of the biggest and most profitable institutional ­investors out there: BlackRock. The $9 trillion investing monster run by Larry Fink may be the most powerful financial firm in the world because it holds shares in large doses of so many big companies and thus can ­direct corporate policy.

And guess what? BlackRock backed this no-name cadre of woke activists even as Exxon persuasively argued that Engine No. 1 wasn’t qualified to help run an oil company. With BlackRock on the fund’s side ExxonMobil eventually folded like a cheap tent.

While Elon Musk keeps flaunting Tesla’s stock prices he can’t neglect how much funding he relies on from Uncle Sam just to remain profitable. AP Photo/Britta Pedersen Pool File

A spokesman for Engine No. 1 and BlackRock had no comment. But a BlackRock company official said the company’s vote was a result of its concern that Exxon doesn’t have clear climate-change strategy and its long-term performance will suffer in a “low-carbon economy.”

Fink has been a huge cheerleader for so-called ESG (environmental social and corporate governance) investing. ESG is all about ensuring that companies BlackRock holds in its multitudes of funds adhere to certain progressive edicts (like executives not paying themselves too much money).

Sounds good on paper — until you drill down. For starters such investing methods are highly political and veer far to the left. Companies often get good grades for supporting lefty causes such as Black Lives Matter. Oil companies like Exxon will get higher marks for building wind farms that produce energy inefficiently.

Something else for investors to consider: These funds lately haven’t beat ­indices that are simply created to make you money and only do so when they pack themselves with high-flying tech names.

But here’s where Fink and BlackRock still come out ahead: They have sensed that with all the media hype of ESG investing as the next frontier they can also make a lot of money creating a new type of fund dedicated specifically to ESG — and then charge more for it.

My sources inside BlackRock say that over the past year Fink has transformed the place into an ESG cultural center. Fink talks ESG nonstop at company town halls. Seminars on ESG investing seem to take place every week. An executive named Brian Deese was promoted to push money managers to consider ESG in all their investment decisions.

Deese is now one of several BlackRock officials who hold key positions in the Biden administration as director of the president’s National Economic Council.

This revolving door between Washington and Wall Street gives Fink a huge voice in US economic policy. It’s no surprise that the Biden White House is issuing new environmental rules left and right to satisfy its woke base and by extension those who want woke investments which Fink is happy to provide.

By the end of the year BlackRock could have as many as 150 so-called exchange-traded funds that adhere to ESG standards. ETFs are supposed to carry lower fees than normal funds because they mirror a typical basket of stocks like the S&P 500.

But with ESG screening methods BlackRock has found a way to inflate management fees of this seemingly prosaic investment. In fact studies show that management fees on ESG funds are more than 40 percent higher than other ETFs.

BlackRock currently manages about $200 billion in ESG client money which means that number is likely to grow and add to BlackRock’s profits.

Now with Engine No. 1 likely to occupy three seats on Exxon’s board it isn’t too much of a stretch to see the company passing Fink’s ESG screens for his ETFs with flying colors.

In short Fink will look like a darl­ing to Democratic politicians he’ll get a lot of left-leaning rich people to put cash in what they feel are “moral” stocks — and he’ll laugh all the way to the bank.

Will the rest of the investors make money?

For investors seeking to diversify their portfolios primary investments serve as the foundational gateway into the asset class. Diverse exposure on a look-through basis typically reduces volatility and provides access to the full spectrum of opportunities. There has been a growing interest for partnership as clients look beyond established blue chip funds and seek help accessing specialized strategies like emerging managers and targeting specific sectors regions or market capitalizations.

Adding secondaries or co-investments to portfolios of primaries can help mitigate risk get exposure to specific investment themes or older vintages and accelerate deployment of capital to reduce the J curve. In terms of portfolio allocation we generally consider 50% for primaries and 50% for co-investments and secondaries as a mature balanced approach. As clients increase their exposure to infrastructure and portfolios become more complex advanced analytics will be critical to ensuring portfolio risks are fully understood and exposure commitments and NAV development are optimized across all three investment types.

When co-investments are added to a portfolio investors have the flexibility to target specific market dynamics and sectors. Co-investments have the potential to achieve above-average returns and can help investors optimize exposure to high conviction trends such as digital infrastructure or the energy transition.

Finally secondary exposures afford investors the benefit of purchasing a portfolio of existing assets that are otherwise not available in the market. They also allow for a faster buildup of exposure early distributions and typically are lower risk thanks to mature substantially invested portfolios.

Think of telecommunications supermarkets department stores packaging airlines hardware service stations cinema chains and commercial television.

In industries like these there’s a temptation to share the spoils — not to compete too hard on price or service.

How much stronger would that temptation be if both dominant firms in each industry were owned by the same shareholder or set of shareholders?

Neither firm might want to put the other out of business.

There’s evidence to suggest this has indeed been the case in the United States where increases in common ownership have been linked to higher airline fares more expensive pharmaceuticals and higher bank fees.

It’s enough to make you wonder whether there’s common ownership in Australia.

Competitors share owners

To find out Andrew Leigh and I collected data from IBISWorld on the firms that compete with each other across Australia’s 443 industries.

We then matched that data to shareholding disclosures for each of the firms listed on the share market and analysed the extent to which competitors were owned by the same investors.

Our findings just published in Economic Record are troubling.

They identify common ownership in 49 of Australia’s 443 industries.

Read more: Should monopoly businesses have an obligation to create competition?

They are significant industries. The 49 together account for more than one third of Australia’s total industry revenue.

They include commercial banking explosives manufacturing fuel retailing general insurance and iron ore mining.

In firms in those industries in which we can identify at least one owner 31% share a substantial owner with a rival.

Concentration is bigger than it looks

Market concentration is traditionally measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) on a scale in which an HHI of less than 1500 is considered to be competitive an HHI of 1500 to 2500 is considered to be a moderately concentrated and an HHI of 2500 or more to be a highly concentrated.

When we modified the HHI to take account of common ownership the scores of some industries jumped.

The index for banking jumped from 1534 to 5850; the index for funds management services jumped from 1254 to 3014. The index for department stores jumped from 3061 to 4888.

All up effective market concentration was 20% higher than had been thought.

This is a problem because concentrated markets have been linked to a decline in the labour share of income low productivity growth and low investment as well as high prices markups and rising inequality — all challenges Australia is facing.

Who are these common owners? They are overwhelmingly institutional investors predominantly BlackRock and Vanguard.

This is unsurprising given one of either BlackRock Vanguard or State Street is the largest shareholder in 88% of S&P500 companies in the United States.

BlackRock Vanguard and State Street

But do they influence corporate decisions? The literature suggests they do.

Documenting the channels through which common owners affect competition Nathan Shekita identifies 30 cases of common owner intervention across industries including pharmaceuticals oil and gas banking and ride-sharing.

In 2019 BlackRock engaged 2050 times with 1458 companies in 42 markets.

Martin Schmalz provides a case study of how this can occur.

An activist hedge fund campaigned in 2015 to have DuPont take a more aggressive approach to winning market share from its competitor Monsanto.

The campaign was opposed by institutional investors including BlackRock and Vanguard. Upon the news that the activist campaign against DuPont had been defeated Monsanto’s shares rose 3.5%.

Schmalz believes it’s possible that these institutional investors voted to maximise the value of their entire portfolio which included significant stakes in DuPont’s competitor.

Our own study has plenty of limitations. We can only see Australian firms that are listed on the securities exchange we can only observe shareholdings that exceed 5% we can only see the largest competitors.

Read more: Is Australia’s media market one of the world's most concentrated?

These data limitations mean we might have understated common ownership.

Our findings ought to be enough to get policymakers and regulators looking more deeply into common ownership and monitoring its changes.

Sky News has learnt that Mr Jenkins who was sacked as the British bank's boss in 2015 is close to selling a stake in 10x Future Technologies his fintech venture to BlackRock.

City sources said that 10x could announce the deal which will value the company at well over £500m within weeks.

BlackRock's investment will form part of a £130m funding round according to an investor briefed on the deal.

The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board one of the country's biggest retirement schemes is also injecting capital as part of the 10x fundraising they added.

Mr Jenkins is expected to hold a stake of approximately 40% in the company worth more than £200m after the fundraising.

The former Barclays chief was ousted six years ago amid concerns among some of the bank's directors that it was not being overhauled quickly enough.

He had been handed the job in the autumn of 2012 as Barclays fought to repair a corporate reputation which had been left in tatters by the Libor rate-rigging scandal.

Mr Jenkins established 10x a year after his departure offering to build a cloud-based technology platform for lenders around the world.

His argument that banks' transition to digitally led services was delivering inadequate results has since been vindicated as increasing numbers of lenders have turned to banking-as-a-service providers such as 10x and Mambu.

Mr Jenkins also sits on the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Committee and the board of the US mortgage provider Fannie Mae.

He chairs Currencies Direct and is a director of Blockchain which is a fintech unicorn - meaning it is worth at least $1bn.

His latest fundraising at 10x - the company's first since 2019 - will turn him into one of Britain's wealthiest fintech entrepreneurs.

The deal will come amid a boom in the financing of UK-based start-ups and scale-ups with record levels of funding being attracted to the potential returns available in private technology deals.

10x's existing investors include JP Morgan which is working with Mr Jenkins' company on plans to launch a UK-based digital consumer bank under the Chase brand.

Nationwide and Ping An the giant Chinese insurer are also shareholders in 10x.

The fintech's other customers include the Australian bank Westpac which ironically is now led by John McFarlane the chairman who sacked Mr Jenkins at Barclays.

In recent months 10x has announced a series of senior appointments to strengthen its management team under Mr Jenkins its executive chairman.

""While the full impact and effect of the pandemic is uncertain we believe based on our pipeline of activity that the financial services industry and retail banks in particular are continuing to pursue new digital cloud-native technology solutions to help them address their ongoing legacy cost and customer delivery challenges"" Mr Jenkins said in December.

The Ariana Airlines Boeing B737 which was impounded by Russian three months ago was released on saturday.

Ariana sources say its in their favour and two Russian courts ordered the release of the aircraft. Earlier the plane had been impounded at Sheremetyevo international airport after leaving the airport without the permission of the Russian Customs Agency Russian authorities said.

Ariana officials said that all allegations against the airline were baseless and they plan to file a lawsuit against the Government of the Russian Federation to seek compensation for the losses incurred during the past 3 months.

“The plane was grounded there for three months and 11 days. During this period we have recorded the number of losses that we incurred” said Mohammad Salim Rahimi Deputy of commercial affairs at Ariana Afghan Airlines aviation company.

The Afghanistan Aviation Support Association (AASA) says that Ariana Afghan Airlines lost more than 30% of its revenue in the past three months due to the impoundment of one of its aircrafts in Russia.

Though Ariana airlines did not make the details of estimated loss public the Afghanistan Aviation Support Association say that Ariana Afghan Airlines has endured significant losses as one of its three planes was seized by Russia for three months.

""Ariana Afghan airlines has only three aircrafts. When one of these aircrafts stops operating it means that over 30% of the company's revenue has been cut in the past few months"" said Mahmoud Shah Habibi director of the Afghanistan Aviation Support Association.

The report points to Boeing's South Carolina operations where earlier this year the 787 Dreamliner program was consolidated as a place where Boeing sees a unique opportunity to develop more diverse talent.

With the release of the inaugural set of diversity data CEO Dave Calhoun put out a statement describing the initiative as a ""business imperative"" for Boeing. The data were being shared ""because transparency will help drive shared accountability"" Calhoun said in the statement. Those metrics shared were the rates of representation by gender race and ethnicity and veteran status.

The data in the report were described as ""incomplete"" in that some aspects of diversity were not measured. There wasn't a metric for example of how many employees identify as LGBTQ+.

Calhoun wrote that the newly-released demographic data show Boeing is ""on par with the aerospace industry"" a sector that's long been largely White and male and the company is not where it wants to be.

Tommy Preston National Strategy and Engagement Director for Boeing told The Post and Courier in an interview that the data in the report didn't surprise him but what was surprising to him was ""how aggressive the company was willing to go to address"" diversity and inclusion-related issues.

""We've been talking a lot internally about not just settling for status quo not just saying that we are on par with others in the industry"" said Preston who's a South Carolina native and serves on Boeing's Racial Equity Task Force. ""We know we need to do better.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2Vjb25vbXljbGFzc2FuZGJleW9uZC5ib2FyZGluZ2FyZWEuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMDYvYWlycGxhbmUtYXJ0LWx1ZnRoYW5zYS1ib2VpbmctNzQ3LThpLXJldHJvLWNvbG91cnMtYXQtZnJhbmtmdXJ0LWFpcnBvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airplane Art - Lufthansa Boeing 747-8I (Retro Colours) at Frankfurt Airport - Economy Class & Beyond,"It’s Sunday again so it must be time for some more airplane art.

Maiden – a current reservist who served with the Australian Army for 28 years before joining Boeing Defence Australia (BDA) in 2016 as a CH-47F Chinook aircrew technician and instructor – achieved the milestone on 15th March. He’s proudly worked on the CH-47 capability at 5th Aviation Regiment RAAF Base Townsville for more than 25 years including his Army background as an avionics technician. He now joins a unique worldwide club of CH-47 Chinook aircrew who’ve also achieved the record flight hours.

As a specialised technician Maiden is a qualified tradesperson who can both operate and maintain the CH-47F. He’s part of the BDA team that delivers the CH-47F Chinook Integrated Support Services (CISS) contract to the 10 aircraft operated out of the Australian Army’s C Squadron at 5th Aviation Regiment. Maiden’s record 5000 CH-47 flight hours was honoured by the Army with a traditional water arch – a form of salute which typically involves two firefighting rigs spraying arcs of water over an arriving or departing flight as a sign of respect and honour.

“There are very few who have achieved this milestone” Maiden said. “The 5000 flying hours have been accrued over my flying career which started in 1999 on the CH-47D.”

During his time with the ADF Maiden completed six tours with Rotary Wing Group (RWG) as part of Operation SLIPPER in Afghanistan. “I joined the Army at 19 and it was the best decision I’ve ever made” he said. “I love flying and fixing the aircraft. My father instilled in me a love of all things aviation – and I particularly love flying in the Chinook as it is super reliable. “I’m humbled and honoured to have achieved this momentous milestone.”

Commander 16th Aviation Brigade Brigadier David Hafner CSC commented: “Every day our people across the Army aviation capability pull on their uniforms live our values and do exceptional work on behalf of our nation. Maiden’s contribution to Army and as a Defence contractor is meaningful and truly appreciated.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1taWFtaS10ZWwtYXZpdi0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Inaugurates Its Second Route To Israel,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1taWFtaS10ZWwtYXZpdi0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Brown won the hearts of millions during her season on ""The Bachelorette"" which aired in the summer of 2019.

She's now taken her skills to the publishing world with the release of her first novel ""Mistakes We Never Made"" which goes on sale on Tuesday May 7.

CALLING ALL BOOK LOVERS: HERE ARE THE TOP 10 CITIES FOR THOSE WHO LOVE TO READ

Fox News Digital spoke by Zoom with the 29-year-old originally from Tuscaloosa Alabama ahead of her book's release to talk about all things Emma and Finn her main characters.

""I’m so excited about this book because it’s truly like a dream come true"" she said.

A proud graduate of the University of Alabama Brown received a bachelor’s degree in communication studies and worked as an interior designer before going on ""The Bachelor"" as a contestant in 2019.

VACATION DESTINATIONS ARE OFTEN CHOSEN FROM POPULAR BOOKS ON THE SHELF STUDY SAYS: SEE IF YOU'VE READ THESE

The TV personality shifted gears after her lead season of ""The Bachelorette"" later in 2019 — even writing a memoir and becoming a New York Times bestselling author in 2021.

She said she’s always loved to read and write but this process was very different from writing her memoir ""God Bless This Mess.""

""It was very different. I would say ‘God Bless This Mess’ was hard because it was a very cathartic experience — it’s hard sharing your story and [wondering] how people will perceive you"" she said.

""When it came to ‘Mistakes We Never Made’ it was a lot more challenging [than knowing] the plot points in my own life [as] I experience them. But how do you create a totally fictitious world [with] characters? That takes a lot of organizing and plotting.""

""I have a pretty good gut instinct for what’s working and what’s not.""

The romance novel's two main characters go from ""frenemies to lovers"" during a ""wild-goose chase"" to find a missing bride ahead of her wedding.

TORONTO WOMAN TAKES NOVEL APPROACH TO DATING BY STAMPING HANDS AT BARS: ‘YOU’RE CUTE YOU SHOULD HIT ME UP'

Brown won FOX's ""Special Forces: World's Toughest Test"" in 2023.

She took some of her favorite things she said and put them in the novel — describing her book as ""The Hangover"" meets ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" meets ""When Harry Met Sally.""

""I definitely drew inspiration from things I love about different things I’ve read or watched or seen in some way and was really inspired by those aspects of what I enjoy"" she said.

Brown said the two-year writing process was a ""brand-new thing"" for her.

""That’s what makes it a lot harder because I’m still trying to figure it out as I go but I feel very confident in this first book because I had a lot of pros helping me along the way"" she said.

‘BACHELOR’ COUPLE SHARES THE UNEXPECTED MOMENT AT THEIR EUROPEAN WEDDING THAT LEFT THE BRIDE ‘BAWLING’

The Nashville resident got engaged to her fiancé Adam Woolard in August 2023 after over two years of dating.

Brown said through the writing process of ""Mistakes We Never Made"" she learned that she has ""pretty good gut instincts.""

""Like anybody starting something new you can get imposter syndrome as in ‘Why am I doing this?’ and ‘Why do I think I can do this?’ What I have learned about myself is I do have a pretty good gut instinct for what’s working and what’s not.""

""People ask me [if] Finn’s based on any guy in my life and I’m like ‘Finn is definitely part of the people in my life' — but also Finn’s part of me.""

She added ""When it comes to the big picture and seeing a full world and really understanding these characters thoughts feelings and emotions how they could respond react … I have a pretty good instinct for that.""

Brown said that while the book is a work of fiction she sees herself in different parts of the main character Emma.

""For me personally I don’t think I can write anything that’s not based on some type of truth. I can’t write a character that I’ve never experienced"" she said.

She added ""People ask me [if] Finn’s based on any guy in my life and I’m like ‘Finn is definitely part of the people in my life' — but also Finn’s part of me.""

Director of scouting Eliot Wolf has served as the de facto General Manager since Bill Belichick’s departure earlier this offseason and is expected to be a candidate for the role.

The Patriots though have to comply with the Rooney Rule by interviewing two external minority candidates.

Bengals senior personnel executive Trey Brown has declined an interview request from the Patriots Tom Pelissero of NFL Media reports. The reason is unknown though with Wolf seen as the leading contender for the job it might not be the last time the Patriots’ interview request is rejected.

Brown has interviewed for G.M. jobs three times — with the Bills in May 2017 with the Raiders in December 2018 and with the Raiders in January 2022.

He was the Eagles’ director of college scouting and worked for both the AAF and XFL before joining the Bengals in 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWhpZ2hlcmVkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dvdmVybmFuY2UvZXhlY3V0aXZlLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAvMjAyNC8wNS8wNy91bml2ZXJzaXRpZXMtd2VpZ2gtcHJvdGVzdGVycy1kaXZlc3RtZW50LWRlbWFuZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Universities weigh protesters' divestment demands,"Students at Brown University dismantled their encampment after reaching an agreement with officials to present a divestment plan to Brown’s governing board.

As pro-Palestinian protests have spread across college campuses nationwide two key demands have emerged: that colleges disclose how endowment funds are invested and that they divest from weapons manufacturers and other businesses profiting off of the war in Gaza.

Student stipulations vary by campus often going beyond disclosure and divestment but those two themes are universal. And while national news coverage focuses on the use of force to clear encampments violent clashes with police and protester arrests it belies the fact that some colleges are making negotiations on these demands.

The concessions so far are limited. Administrators have promised little if anything at all. But engaging with student protesters has offered leadership a salve to campus chaos through agreements with demonstrators to remove encampments in exchange for action. In some cases a mere promise to consider protesters’ concerns has been enough to unwind the camps.

Colleges Making Concessions

Brown University has arguably taken the biggest step in striking a deal with protesters who folded up their tents in exchange for face time with board members to make a pitch for divesting from companies profiting off the war. A divestment vote is scheduled for October.

“I hope the meeting between the students and Corporation members will allow for a full and frank exchange of views” Brown President Christina Paxson wrote in an April 30 message to campus. “As I shared with the protesting students in my letter yesterday the devastation and loss of life in the Middle East has prompted many to call for meaningful change while also raising real issues about how best to accomplish this. Brown has always prided itself on resolving differences through dialog debate and listening to each other.”

Student protesters celebrated the moment noting the vote marks a historic first at Brown.

“VICTORY!! BROWN COMMITS TO DIVESTMENT VOTE!” the Brown Divest Coalition wrote as part of a social media post that credited the role protesters played in forcing the deal.

Elsewhere Northwestern University has agreed to reestablish an Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility which will include student faculty and staff representatives and provide funding for both Palestinian students and visiting faculty members among other moves.

The decision to consider protesters’ demands provoked quick reprimand from Congressional Republicans. On Monday Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina the chairwoman of the House Education and Workforce Committee announced that the presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers University (which also agreed to listen to protesters’ demands) will now be part of a hearing on campus antisemitism alongside University of California Los Angeles Chancellor Gene Block. Originally the presidents of the University of Michigan and Yale University had been on the hook.

“Over the last several days the presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers have made shocking concessions to the unlawful antisemitic encampments on their campuses” Foxx said in a statement. “They have surrendered to antisemitic radicals in despicable displays of cowardice. As a result of these gravely concerning actions the Committee believes it’s necessary to reevaluate the scope of the May 23 hearing and bring in the presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers—along with UCLA—to testify before the Committee” she said noting Yale and Michigan will provide testimony at a later date.

At least two other public institutions have joined Rutgers in considering divestment demands.

Evergreen State College and the University of Minnesota have also struck agreements with pro-Palestinian protesters. None of the agreements promise concrete action but rather offer consideration of divestment proposals in exchange for removing the encampments. Students at Minnesota will also discuss divestment with the Board of Regents on Friday.

The University of Vermont has disclosed its investments as part of an agreement with students but has not agreed to weigh divestment.

Defending Decisions

Engaging in dialogue with protesters stands in stark contrast to the responses at Emory University and the University of Texas at Austin where demonstrators were met with tear gas and pepper spray. Neither institution responded to requests for information about possible negotiations with students.

But no matter which approach they’ve taken presidents have sought to justify their actions.

Leaders meeting with student activists have largely cast the decision as a reasonable response to constituent demands while also noting that the encampments violated university policies allowing them to emphasize order while striking a compromise with demonstrators. Some have used the moment to denounce any antisemitism they see connected to the protests.

“I recognize that some slogans and expressions are open to interpretation. But when I see a Star of David with an X on it when I see a picture of me with horns or when I hear that one of our students has been called a dirty Jew there is no ambiguity. This needs to be condemned by all of us and that starts with me” Northwestern President Michael Schill said last week in a video statement in which he announced the agreement and condemned hateful rhetoric.

Other presidents however have defended decisions which have led to violent arrests.

“We have watched with concern as disruptive and illegal encampments have sprung up on other university campuses and we took seriously the pre-protest threats—voiced by organizers and others with no affiliation with UT—to ‘occupy’ our own” UT-Austin President Jay Hartzell wrote in an opinion piece for the Houston Chronicle. “As university leaders we recognized that at other schools encampments have preceded further and more serious disruptions safety risks injuries and ultimately more severe and dangerous police intervention. Also if we allowed encampments in this instance it would be nearly impossible to stop encampments from other groups in the future without facing challenges of chilling speech or viewpoint discrimination.”

University of Florida president Ben Sasse a former Republican Senator from Nebraska defended UF’s decision to arrest pro-Palestinian demonstrators in an interview with CNN on Sunday while also chiding other college leaders for their decision to engage with students.

“What you see happening on so many campuses across the country is instead of drawing the line at speech and action a lot of universities bizarrely give the most attention and most voice to the smallest angriest group. And it’s just not what we’re going to do here” Sasse told CNN.

Weighing Demands

To engage or arrest protesters is a choice many college leaders have faced in recent weeks as dozens of pro-Palestinian encampments have cropped up coast-to-coast leading to a spiraling clash between students and officials.

In more than two weeks of protests at least 2000 demonstrators have reportedly been arrested.

Mary Papazian executive vice president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges identifies the two responses—meeting directly with protesters or arresting them—as two points at opposite ends of a response spectrum. But she believes presidents can operate in the middle engaging protesters indirectly and keeping order without mass arrests depending on the situation.

She notes however that the safety of the campus community should be paramount and that presidents frequently operate off facts that may not be available to the public or the press.

“A president has to be concerned about the safety of all stakeholders all representatives of the institution of all students. Violence and destruction of property really changes the conversation” Papazian said.

She also cautioned administrators against overreacting lest they “unnecessarily create more violence” such as in the anti-Vietnam War protests of the 1960s and early 1970s that included student fatalities most famously in the Kent State University shootings in which the Ohio National Guard gunned down unarmed students.

Roderick A. Ferguson who teaches women’s gender and sexuality studies and American studies at Yale University and has written a book on student activism told Inside Higher Ed by email that the current campus protests call for engaged leadership by college presidents.

“The role of a president in moments like this should be to engage with students and to uphold the ideals of academic freedom and inquiry. The president after all represents the various constituencies on a campus and the long-held principles that found universities and colleges” he wrote. Presidents “should be able to tie those academic principles to constitutional rights—particularly rights of assembly free speech the press petitioning the government for redress” he added.

Ferguson disputed the notion that presidents shouldn’t engage with protesters.

“There is no good argument and no standard of real leadership that eschews engagement with our students. Particularly in the context of student protests not engaging them typically means engaging the police. Engaging the police is where the conditions of life-threatening violence typically take place” Ferguson wrote.

But what happens before a campus protest reaches the point of crisis is key.

Specifically Papazian believes that universities need to have established trust and lines of communication between the administration and campus community members. She argues that colleges also need policies in place that guide how to respond to dynamic situations rather than hammering out new campus protocols amid an unexpected issue.

And regardless of what decision a president makes on encampment protests they should be able to explain what led to their decision and discuss their positions clearly and transparently Papazian argues.

“There has to be clarity about whatever action it is that the president takes. There may be good reasons for it but it has to be articulated and explained clearly and consistently” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NsaXZlLmNvbS9wYXRyaW90cy8yMDI0LzA1L3VuYy1oZWFkLWNvYWNoLW1hY2stYnJvd24tb24tZHJha2UtbWF5ZS1oZXMtb2JzZXNzZWQtd2l0aC1nZXR0aW5nLWEtcmluZy5odG1s0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NsaXZlLmNvbS9wYXRyaW90cy8yMDI0LzA1L3VuYy1oZWFkLWNvYWNoLW1hY2stYnJvd24tb24tZHJha2UtbWF5ZS1oZXMtb2JzZXNzZWQtd2l0aC1nZXR0aW5nLWEtcmluZy5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UNC head coach Mack Brown on Drake Maye: ‘He’s obsessed with getting a ring’,"University of North Carolina head football coach Mack Brown is an unabashed fan of Drake Maye. That should come as no surprise.

During a Zoom call with reporters Monday it was still interesting to hear Brown provide some insights about the Patriots first-round pick and what fans in New England should expect from the rookie quarterback.

""There are way too many differences right now so it's somewhat confusing for the novice fan.""The NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel adopted three significant rule changes for 2024 that have been in place in the NFL for many years.Beginning this fall teams will be able to use coach-to-player communications via radio transmitters in helmets to an offensive and defensive player on the field. Those players will be identified by having a green dot on the back midline of their helmet.Brown said they have been experimenting with the new communications system for a while now in practice in anticipation of the rule change.""(During the spring game) we were really vanilla with it"" he said. ""We used it in the bowl game and we've used it the last two springs so it's not necessarily new to us but we're using a different company now. I think it's going to help the game. It's going to help defenses as well. People are kind of underestimating that but it's really going to help the defenses.""West Virginia's middle linebackers have been using the helmet communications system but Brown indicated that it's still to be determined who will use it in the games this fall. Overall he believes helmet communications will alleviate some of the sloppiness that can take place on the sidelines.""If you feel like a team really has your signals it gives you some options on how you want to communicate"" he noted.NFL teams have been communicating with quarterbacks via helmets since 1994 and NFL defenders have been doing so since 2008.Tablets will also be permitted this year on the sidelines to view in-game video only. The video can include the game broadcast feed and camera angles from the sideline and the end zone.Up to 18 active tablets for use in the coaching booth sideline and locker room will be permitted. They cannot be connected to projection devices and cannot include analytics data or data accessing capabilities.Another rule synonymous with the NFL is the two-minute warning its origins dating back to the early days of the league when game time was kept by a member of the officiating crew on the field. Its function was to serve as a checkpoint to make sure both teams were aware of the time remaining in the game.When television became prominent in the late 1960s and early 1970s the two-minute warning took on more significance as a means of building drama for the conclusion of the game.College football is adopted a two-minute warning as a method of synchronizing end-of-game timing rules according to secretary-rules editor Steve Shaw. It will also help avoid consecutive media time outs at the conclusions of each half.""I think it's great for the officials and clock operators because the rules change under two minutes so it's a good reminder for them"" Brown said.

The Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine in support of the Indiana equine industry is pleased to announce its partnership with Caesars Entertainment and the renaming of the college’s equine hospital in Shelbyville Indiana as the Caesars Entertainment Equine Specialty Hospital.

“We are delighted that Caesars Entertainment will be part of the mission of our hospital” said Dr. Ellen Lowery director of the Purdue University Veterinary Hospital. “Everything we do there is state of the art and involves the most current diagnostics and therapeutics so I’m excited to see the continued innovation we are able to provide for our patients and clientele.”

Located near Indiana Grand Racing and Casino the Caesars Entertainment Equine Specialty Hospital was opened in 2017 by Purdue as a satellite facility to provide medical support for Indiana’s growing equine industry. Since 2019 Caesars Entertainment has contributed close to $1.5 million to the hospital.

“We are honored Caesars Entertainment’s name will be on one of the most technologically advanced equine hospital and surgical centers in the country right here in Shelbyville” said Steve Jarmuz senior vice president and general manager of Indiana Grand Racing and Casino.

Trent McIntosh senior vice president and general manager of Harrah’s Hoosier Park Racing and Casino said “Caesars Entertainment remains committed to supporting the communities in which we operate including this premier hospital and the students of Purdue’s College of Veterinary Medicine. We are thrilled to share in all the benefits this facility brings to the growing horse racing community in Indiana.”

The Caesars Entertainment Equine Specialty Hospital provides an expert level of medical services to performance horses. Dr. Timm Gudehus the hospital’s senior equine surgeon said the facility offers specialized services such as advanced equine surgery including long-bone fracture repair; orthopedic examinations involving advanced diagnostic imaging including nuclear scintigraphy (bone scan); other diagnostic services such as digital radiography ultrasound and dynamic endoscopy; and treatments that incorporate a range of biologics and stem cell therapy.

Adding to its already innovative services the hospital will soon install a specialized large gantry helical CT scanning machine which Gudehus said will be the first installation of its kind in the United States.

“The Caesars Entertainment Equine Specialty Hospital is an integral piece of Indiana’s racing community and continues to prove itself as a vital resource for horse owners trainers and breeders” said Joseph Morris Caesars Entertainment vice president of racing. “Providing foundational and experiential learning for Purdue students this pioneering facility is blazing trails in the advancement of care for the horse.”

Analysts say don't bet on it,"California voters will wait 16 months before weighing in on a tribal-backed ballot referendum that asks them to legalize sports betting.

Whatever occurs it won’t change the opinion of gaming observers.

Though there is apprehension from a few Nevada sportsbook operators about potential competition from the largest feeder market to casinos in Las Vegas and Reno analysts and sports betting experts don’t believe sportsbooks in California — the nation’s leading Indian gaming state — will slice into Nevada’s multi-billion-dollar business.

Nevada’s sports betting industry is on pace to surpass its 2019 record-setting totals.

“Las Vegas has something that will never go away. It’s a business model that is impossible to compete with” said Maryland-based sports betting consultant Sara Slane.

Eilers & Krejcik Gaming analyst Chris Grove said the state’s tourist-driven economy has withstood decades of gaming expansion efforts across the U.S.

“There's no reason why California has to represent a threat to Nevada's sports betting market” Grove said. “California drive-in traffic to Vegas remains robust despite the widespread availability of various types of gambling within the state's borders.”

ESPN’s Doug Kezirian host of Daily Wager which is filmed inside the network’s Las Vegas studios overlooking the Strip at the Linq believes “more legalization is better for Vegas.” Other than major events such as the Super Bowl and March Madness “people don’t come to Vegas just to bet on sports. They come for all the bells and whistles.”

Even if California voters approve amending the state’s Constitution the first wagers couldn’t be placed until 2023 at the earliest. Golden State lawmakers and gaming authorities also would need to sign off on regulations and procedures.

California’s secretary of state qualified the statewide ballot initiative petition last month after the tribes turned in more than 1 million valid signatures. The effort began in late 2019 and the 18-member tribal coalition sponsoring the referendum planned to put the measure on the November 2020 ballot. However the pandemic delayed the process.

In addition to large and small tribal casinos throughout the state sportsbooks would be allowed at four privately owned racetracks: Golden Gate Fields in the Bay Area and Santa Anita plus Los Alamitos and Del Mar in Southern California. Cut out of the deal are California’s cardroom casinos which offer table games but not slot machines.

The referendum calls for a 10 percent tax on sports betting revenues for funding public safety mental health programs education and regulatory costs.

Two items in the referendum are reasons analysts believe Nevada would be immune from California competition: The initiative doesn’t allow mobile sports wagering and bans betting on games involving teams at California colleges and universities.

Kezirian worried that the California college ban “sends the wrong message: that college sports are corruptible. It’s bad optics.”

Tribal leaders said the prohibition would stop wagering by underage gamblers. The absence of mobile also would increase casino visitation an important concern among the coalition’s smaller tribal casinos.

“This is an important step toward giving Californians the opportunity to participate in sports wagering while also establishing safeguards and protections against underage gambling” Mark Macarro chairman of Southern California’s Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians said in a statement.

Nevada is still No. 1

In the three years since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed states to legalize sports betting the activity is live in 21 states and Washington D.C. Nine other states and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico have legalized sports betting but have yet to launch. Another four states - Ohio Massachusetts Vermont and Maine - are considering legalization.

The speed of progress in more than half the U.S. has astonished sports betting observers.

“Who knows what will happen between now and when the referendum finally reaches the ballot in California?” Slane said.

Nevada has maintained its presence at the top of the rankings. Since 2018 10 states have taken in more than $1 billion in sports wagers through April. Nevada leads with more than $15.1 billion in bets followed by populous New Jersey at $14.9 million.

In 2019 Nevada sportsbooks took in $5.319 billion in wagers an all-time record for the 10th consecutive year. Revenues from those wagers totaled $329.1 million which was also a single-year record.

The pandemic caused the first annual decline in sports in more than a decade.

However according to the Gaming Control Board the state is back on pace to set another record. Through April sports books have taken in nearly $2.3 billion in wagers which is up 22.4 percent compared with 2019. Revenues of $150.8 million during those four months is a 44 percent increase over 2019.

Silence from Nevada

Nevada sports betting operators declined comment on the California initiative. But at least three Las Vegas and Reno casino operators could have a stake in the expansion.

Caesars operates Harrah’s Southern California near San Diego for the Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians as well as Harrah’s Northern California near Sacramento for the Buena Vista Rancheria Band of Me-Wuk Indians.

The company also spent nearly $4 billion this year to acquire United Kingdom betting giant William Hill which included the company's U.S. operations in 18 states. Caesars also recently became one of three official sports betting partners for the National Football League.

Boyd Gaming Corp. and Red Rock Resorts are in the process of developing tribal-owned casinos.

Boyd broke ground in March with the Wilton Rancheria Tribe on a $500 million casino resort in Elk Grove — 15 miles from downtown Sacramento. The property is expected to open in 2022. Boyd’s sports betting outside Nevada is operated through its 5 percent ownership in FanDuel and includes operations in Pennsylvania Illinois Indiana Iowa and Mississippi (all fall among the top three revenue-generating operators in each state).

Red Rock is moving forward with a $350 million to $400 million casino resort project near Fresno for the North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians. The company hopes to break ground on the casino sometime this summer.

Global Market Advisors Partner Brendan Bussmann said there is a healthy potential for collaborations and cross-marketing opportunities in California.

“Every Las Vegas and national operator will have its eye on a partnership if not multiple partnerships in this land-based sports betting approach” he said.

Will California be golden?

California is viewed by analysts as a potential sports betting juggernaut.

It is the nation’s most populous state and is home to more than a dozen teams in the four major professional sports leagues. Nearly 70 Indian casinos produced an estimated $8 billion in annual gaming revenues prior to 2020 roughly one-quarter of all U.S. Indian gaming revenues.

Analysts believe adding California to the roster of legal sports betting states will put a dent in the illegal offshore sports betting industry which is easily accessed online.

Bussmann said “all roads” to legal sports betting expansion in California have to run through the tribes.

“Sports betting in California has the potential to capture a significant untapped market that is ruled today by illegal books and retain those dollars through a tribal approach” Bussmann said. “Californians will finally get a say on the expansion of gaming in the state.”

‘An opportunity not a threat’

Nevada gaming regulators have reported a steady year-over-year increase in sports wagers placed through mobile devices. Grove and other analysts said the absence of mobile sports betting in California helps Nevada sports books. He suggested however that Nevada could further improve its standing by adding a remote registration component to mobile sports betting regulations.

“Assuming Nevada adjusts its approach to mobile sports betting to allow for a smoother customer experience and that Vegas casinos continue to invest in creating world-class sportsbooks the expansion of legal sports betting in California and across the U.S. should represent an opportunity not a threat for Las Vegas casinos” Grove said.

Nevada will get its first real test of competition from a neighboring state this fall when Arizona launches sports betting at tribal casinos and at sports stadiums.

Caesars Entertainment has a deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks to place a sportsbook at Chase Field in downtown Phoenix. DraftKings and the PGA Tour will create a sportsbook at the TPC Scottsdale golf course.

“I don’t believe sports betting in Arizona will have any effect in Nevada” Slane said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL2luc2lkZS1nYW1pbmcvbmV3LW93bmVyLW9mLXRyb3BpY2FuYS10dW5lZC1pbi10by1zcG9ydHMtaW5jbHVkaW5nLWJhc2ViYWxsLTIzNzE3NDEv0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2J1c2luZXNzLWNvbHVtbnMvaW5zaWRlLWdhbWluZy9uZXctb3duZXItb2YtdHJvcGljYW5hLXR1bmVkLWluLXRvLXNwb3J0cy1pbmNsdWRpbmctYmFzZWJhbGwtMjM3MTc0MS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New owner of Tropicana tuned in to sports including baseball,"Rhode Island-based Bally’s Corp. is one of the nation’s fastest growing casino companies and it’s making its mark with sports wagering and a television network.

New gaming industry competitors are making their way to Las Vegas and one of them — Bally’s Corp. — has been somewhat overshadowed by the unusual presence of two tribal entities entering the market.

Providence Rhode Island-based Bally’s may be the fastest-growing commercial gaming company in the United States and its acquisition of the Tropicana in April from Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. a real estate investment trust for $150 million has growth potential that company executives are still exploring.

The combination of casino assets a strong online sports wagering presence and a broadcast partner that is visible nationwide has given the company a foundation for growth.

“From our perspective is this the perfect time for us to focus on Vegas given how much we have going on” said Soo Kim a hedge fund investor who is chairman of Bally’s board of directors.

Kim has served as an independent director for the company since 2016 when it was known as Twin Rivers Worldwide Holdings.

“We’ve been watching the Strip to see what was there and when this came up for sale I really felt like it came at a (perfect) time” Kim said in an exclusive interview with the Review-Journal. “It was mostly that potential Strip access was spoken for and so I’m not sure what else is going to be for sale. You can’t be a national gaming company without a Las Vegas presence.”

The Tropicana transaction is expected to close early next year. But once the deal closes what will its name be? That’s one of the many unanswered questions still out there.

“Caesars (Entertainment Inc.) owns the Bally’s (casino property) in Las Vegas” Kim said. “As part of a purchase of the brand from them we can ask them to remove the brand for a price but ultimately in the end we’d control the Bally’s brand in Las Vegas. In the immediate time we’re OK with not having the Bally’s (name).”

Some of the speculation around such a deal is that Caesars would rename the Bally’s property to one of its other brands. Among the brands it owns are the Horseshoe a name that used to exist in downtown Las Vegas but is no longer in the local landscape. Caesars isn’t commenting on the speculation of a name change.

As for Bally’s it wants to capitalize on the growing national presence of its brand and mark. Kim said the company’s goal is to have the Bally’s name attached to all of its 12-and-counting casinos in the United States with the exception of its Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Biloxi Mississippi.

Bally’s $155 million package deal for the MontBleu resort at Lake Tahoe closed in April. Kim said it would take on the Bally’s name.

The company name already has a historic reputation in the slot machine video game and pinball machine sectors since 1932.

Bally’s also partners with Sinclair Broadcasting Co. which has rebranded its Fox Sports West network to Bally Sports. Fans who watch local broadcasts of Arizona Diamondbacks Los Angeles Angels and San Diego Padres see the Bally’s logo on their screens.

That all presents an intriguing question: Would Bally’s parlay its interest in sports — it just closed on its deal to acquire Bet.Works for $125 million and introduced Bally Bet in Colorado — to something bigger involving the Oakland A’s’ prospective move to Las Vegas?

Think about that opportunity — a location the Tropicana with enough real estate to build an indoor baseball stadium that could attract guests who could walk to hockey games at T-Mobile Arena football games at Allegiant Stadium or onsite baseball games. There’s some precedence: Petco Park in San Diego is attached to the Omni San Diego Hotel.

Kim said he would definitely take the call if the A’s phoned him.

“To be completely frank it’s an idea that I haven’t heard at this point” he said. “We are very creative and there are 35 acres (at the Tropicana). I actually don’t know how many acres it takes to host a baseball stadium so it’s hard for me to comment on this. But Vegas is an important market on a number of fronts. It’s also fast-growing and dynamic which is what sports teams like.”

John DeCree a gaming industry analyst with Las Vegas-based Union Gaming said that Bally’s latest moves in sports shows the company is ready to “hit the accelerator” on its sports betting strategy and that the company plans to launch its mobile app in three more states before the end of the year.

In a note to investors DeCree reiterated a $95 price target — a heavy lift considering shares closed Friday at $55.84.

“Given how little value the market ascribes to Bally’s Interactive today we believe (the company) offers one of the best risk-reward plays in the U.S. digital gaming industry” DeCree said.

Kim said the true value in the company is in its ability to blend its online and terrestrial products.

“The holy grail is when your customers can also go online have a good experience and then also cash their rewards points at the physical-experience amenities. I think when both work together that’s a truly winning combination” he said.

The industry and customers will be watching as Bally’s becomes part of the Strip landscape.

In announcing the seven-casino fireworks show on its Instagram page the Clark County government declared “Vegas is back!” Las Vegas is in Clark County. The largest resorts on the Strip are outside city limits under the county’s jurisdiction.

The casinos participating in the July 4 show at 11 pm are The Strat Resorts World Las Vegas Treasure Island Caesars Palace Aria The Venetian and Planet Hollywood. The Strat is the only one of these located inside Las Vegas city limits.

Resorts World which was built on the site of the now-demolished Stardust Casino is set to open June 24.

Kate Wik of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said the public’s pent-up demand to visit Las Vegas “is real” according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

“We have been waiting for this moment to announce that once again your ‘Only Vegas’ experience is waiting” said Wik the agency’s chief marketing officer.

Las Vegas Recovery

For months after the March 2020 onset of the coronavirus pandemic Las Vegas’ tourism-dependent casino economy was in steep decline. Beginning in March casinos were closed for 11 weeks.

Even after casinos were allowed to reopen in June the economy sputtered. McCarran International Airport saw a decline of millions of passengers during the pandemic. At one point last year Las Vegas had an employment rate of at 34.2 percent the highest in the nation for any metropolitan area with a population over 1 million according to the Wall Street Journal. As recently as April Las Vegas had the second-highest jobless rate trailing only Los Angeles.

However with the recent national rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and stimulus checks the Southern Nevada economy has begun to rebound. For two straight months this spring the Las Vegas Valley saw more than 2 million visitors. The airport also experienced increases in passenger totals.

Tourism officials are hopeful the World of Concrete convention starting on Monday will further jump-start the economy. Conventions are considered vital to filling up the massive hotel towers in Las Vegas especially during the slower middle of the week.

In attempting to lure conventions back to the city the LVCVA has touted its nearly $1 billion West Hall expansion at the Convention Center and the underground Tesla people-mover by Elon Musk’s The Boring Co.

Other Fireworks Shows

The fireworks shows on the Strip are part of an Independence Day celebration beginning in early July at other hotel-casinos in the Las Vegas Valley.

Station Casinos is launching fireworks from July 1-4 at some of its properties through the area beginning July 1 at 9 pm from the off-Strip Palace Station. The company is celebrating its 45th anniversary.

M. Smucker Company (SJM) and more.

Is America ready to get back to work?

As of end of May weekly initial jobless claims dropped to 385K falling below the 400K mark for the first time since March 2020 when the pandemic hit the U.S. economy. Reported claims were better than initial expectations of 390K. On the other hand the total number of Americans who continued to receive unemployment benefits did not subside (3.77 million). Many states decided recently to withdraw from federal unemployment benefit programs following reports that it has been more difficult for companies to hire workers with unemployment benefits paying more than minimum wage. Millions of people in 24 states are set to lose unemployment benefits as early as June 12.

Foodservice labor shortage

The food industry particularly restaurants is struggling to find enough workers. There were a record-high 8.1 million unfilled jobs at the end of March including 993K at restaurants and hotels and 878K at stores. Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer says it could take months to fill restaurant job openings. Charleston restauranteur Patrick Whalen is less optimistic. He thinks that the inherent issues of low pay lack of benefits and ‘toxic’ workplaces are some of the reasons that workers won’t return. COVID-19 was simply the straw that broke the camel’s back.

Food manufacturing recovery

Food manufacturing plants also felt labor market strains albeit to a lesser degree than foodservice. Pre-pandemic food manufacturing businesses employed 1.66 million workers. As of April the industry re-hired 77% of the 1.1 million jobs lost during the pandemic shutdowns (see chart).

Food retail expansion

At the same time food delivery businesses have less trouble finding workers as e-commerce continued to grow at a record pace across America. Pre-pandemic food retail employed 3.07 million workers and as of April the total workforce expanded to 3.11 million (see chart). Amazon recently announced that it will hire another 75K in its fulfillment and logistics network. The positions pay an average of $17 an hour and include signing bonuses of up to $1000 plus an additional $100 for new hires who can show proof they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

Looking ahead

ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson expects continued job recovery particularly among the consumer-facing industry. Private businesses in the U.S. hired 978K workers in May the most in 11 months led by leisure & hospitality (440K); education & health (139K); and trade transportation & utilities (118K). Most economists expect the overall unemployment rate to fall below 6% by the end of June and 5.5% in 12-month time.

Others are more wary of social and health factors that have resulted in less than robust job recovery. A recent survey showed three main reasons of the current labor shortage:

Continuing child-care demands keeping parents at home

Extended enhanced unemployment benefits

Lingering health concerns

The labor shortage is prompting businesses to re-think compensation benefits as well as work conditions amidst re-opening efforts.

As the world locked down hitting pause on the global economy the overall profits of Fortune 500 companies dropped from $1.24 trillion to $859 billion. More than 70 percent of Fortune 500 sectors saw a decline in profits. A few sectors saw increases the list notes including technology and household products the latter of which reported a 106 percent increase in profits.

Women hit some big milestones on this year’s list. The number of women running businesses on the Fortune 500 hit an all-time record of 41; and for the first time ever two Black women are running Fortune 500 businesses (Roz Brewer of No. 16 Walgreens Boots Alliance and Thasunda Brown Duckett of No. 79 TIAA).",,,

About Billie Eilish

As Billie Eilish prepares for the July 30th 2021 release of her highly anticipated sophomore album ‘Happier Than Ever’ the 19-year-old Los Angeles native remains one of the biggest stars to emerge in the 21st century. Since the release of her debut single “ocean eyes” in 2015 Eilish continues to shatter the ceiling of music with her genre-defying sound. Fast forward from her humble breakout her album WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP WHERE DO WE GO? debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S as well as 17 additional countries around the world upon release in 2019 and was the most streamed album of that year. WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP WHERE DO WE GO? was written produced and recorded entirely by Billie Eilish and brother FINNEAS in their childhood home of Los Angeles. Billie Eilish went on to make history as the youngest artist to receive nominations and win in all the major categories at the 62nd GRAMMY® Awards receiving an award for Best New Artist Album of the Year Record of the Year Song of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. Billie Eilish is also the youngest artist to write and record an official James Bond theme song ‘No Time To Die.’ Most recently Billie Eilish was nominated for four additional awards at the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards in 2021 and took home both Record of the Year for 'everything i wanted' and Best Song Written For Visual Media for 'No Time To Die.’ Billie Eilish’s forthcoming album ‘Happier Than Ever’ was written by Billie and her brother FINNEAS who also produced the album.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vcGVubmNhcGl0YWwtc3Rhci5jb20vYnJpZWZzL2FsbC15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93LWFib3V0LWxvdS1iYXJsZXR0YXMtMjAyMi1wbGF0Zm9ybS1pbi1vbmUtY2FydG9vbi1lZGl0b3JpYWwtY2FydG9vbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All you need to know about Lou Barletta's 2022 platform.

Here's our ultimate checklist of 21 things to do on your trip,"White sand beaches all-inclusive resorts vibrant nightclubs and sparkling blue water — those are probably the first things that come to mind when you think of Cancun. Located in the Yucatan Peninsula on the eastern coast of Mexico Cancun is known as the party capital of the country. Travelers flock to the city to experience its nightclubs and luxurious all-inclusive resorts. But there's more to this city than just days spent lying in a hammock and nights partying at Coco Bongo (though you should definitely put both on your to-do list while you're there).

Whether you stay at an all-inclusive or a standard resort there are likely plenty of things to do without leaving the property. But there's also lots to explore in Cancun and the surrounding areas from museums to nature reserves to nearby small towns and more.

Cancun is one of the easiest places for U.S. residents to visit right now since Mexico doesn't currently require you to have a negative COVID-19 test or make you quarantine upon arrival. While that comes with its own set of concerns it does mean it's a popular summer 2021 destination for vaccinated travelers. If you plan on visiting Cancun this year make sure you check out everything the city has to offer — both at your resort and off-property.

Visit gorgeous beaches

If you are staying at a resort that doesn't have beachfront access or you just want to explore beaches away from your hotel there are plenty of options where you can enjoy the water in the Cancun area.

Playa Tortugas

This beach is located in the northern area of the hotel zone but it's still a popular spot for locals. The area is clean the water is calm (perfect for kids who want to swim) and the atmosphere is relaxed. Plenty of tourists even prefer it to the strips of beaches in front of their resorts.

You can also grab a ferry to the nearby Isla Mujeres from here bungee jump from the pier or check out one of the open-air restaurants scattered along the beach.

Playa Delfines

If you want to escape the resort towers you should try the soft white sand of Playa Delfines about seven miles south of the hotel zone. Onsite parking is free and you can rent chairs and beach umbrellas when you're there. The water can get rough once you wade out into deeper water at this beach but you can still swim closer to shore. It's a great spot for surfing though you'll have to make sure to rent a board in town before heading to the beach.

There aren't any restaurants or resorts located on the beach but local vendors do sell foods if you get hungry. If you have kids with you the beach has a playground and palapas available for shade when it's naptime. There is also a popular photo spot near the beach with colorful letters that spell out ""Cancun"" though there is typically a line of people waiting with their cameras.

Playa Marlin

Playa Marlin is a great beach for water sports such as surfing parasailing and snorkeling but the waves and currents can be dangerous for leisure swimmers.

It's located in the hotel zone about a five-minute walk from the Kukulcan Plaza shopping mall. Lifeguards are on duty and you can rent beach supplies for the day.

Playa Chac Mool

For a family-friendly beach in close proximity to shopping and restaurants check out Playa Chac Mool. It gets fewer visitors than some of the other beaches in Cancun since it doesn't offer parking so you may find it easier to spread out here.

There is an area where you can rent umbrellas and loungers and a lifeguard is on duty. The beach is a certified Blue Flag beach which means it has to meet and maintain a series of environmental educational safety and accessibility standards. The waves can get rough here so it may not be the best place for small children to swim. But from May to October you might see sea turtles come ashore to nest.

Learn about Mexican culture

One of my favorite things about traveling is learning about the local culture of the places I visit. While Cancun is very tourist-centric there are still plenty of opportunities to explore Mayan ruins and learn more about Mexican culture during your trip.

Chichen Itza

One of the more famous archaeological sites in the Cancun area is Chichen Itza which was an important city-state in pre-Hispanic America. This UNESCO World Heritage site is two and a half hours from Cancun located deeper in the Yucatan peninsula. If you have a rental car you can drive yourself there. But there are also plenty of tour options you can book from Cancun to visit the site.

The main attraction of the ruins is the large pyramid called El Castillo but there are 26 total Mayan ruins you can see while there. Entrance tickets cost $533 MXN for visiting adults (around $27) and $80 MXN for children ages three to 12 (around $4). But you can also book specialty tours.

Right now Chichen Itza capacity is limited to just 3000 visitors per day and the entry is closed at 4 p.m. (though you can explore until 5 p.m.) so you'll want to plan to get there earlier in the day.

Xoximilco

Another UNESCO World Heritage Site is Xochimilco and you can take tour to pay homage to the original city on a Mexican floating fiesta. You board a gondola-like boat called a trajinera to experience a floating party. Yes there are games and dancing but you'll also get a taste of Mexican culture — literally. The music and food come from different areas in Mexico to display the different cultures throughout the country.

Tickets start at $90 for adults; make sure to bring long pants and biodegradable bug spray if you plan to participate. You'll be floating through the jungle and that means mosquitos will want to join the fiesta.

Temazcal ritual

Temazcal (sweat lodge) ceremonies originated in Mexico and have been practiced for thousands of years. Each ceremony is unique but they all serve as a cleansing ritual rumored to have healing powers. A shaman or temazcalero will lead the ceremony performed in dome-like structures made of cement mud or volcanic stone that act as a steam room. While there are health benefits to a temazcal ritual for many these ceremonies hold deep spiritual significance.

During the Spanish conquest many temazcal structures were destroyed but some were hidden and the ritual was preserved. Now these ceremonies are continually growing in popularity. Make sure any temazcal ritual you take part in is performed by an experienced shaman or temazcalero to ensure they are qualified to safely carry out the ceremony.

Lucha Libre

Make sure to check out a Lucha Libre show while you're in Cancun Mexico's version of pro-wrestling. These unique Mexican performances mix wrestling acrobatics and theatrical moves to show a fight between good and bad. And of course each fighter will wear one of the infamous masks and costumes.

These events tend to be lively and end with someone getting thrown out of the ring. Tickets are pretty inexpensive (less than $15 per person) and fights are held in downtown Cancun and sometimes the nearby island of Isla Mujeres.

Museo Maya and San Miguelito

The Museo Maya and the adjoining Sam Miguelito ruins is a great place to learn about Mayan history. The museum is filled with some of the most important Maya artifacts from sculptures to ceramics to jewelry recovered from assorted sites across the Yucatán peninsula. The San Miguelito archeological site was once part of the El Rey ruins (which is temporarily closed to visitors). The ruins feature several small pyramids and other structures you can explore and you'll also likely spot an iguana or two (or a dozen) while you explore.

Your ticket to the museum (less than $5) includes access to the ruins so make sure you check out both while you are there.

Go on fun excursions

If you're in an adventurous mood there are plenty of excursions you can book while in Cancun that take you in the water or through the jungle (or both).

Snorkeling

Snorkeling just might be the most widely available water excursion in Cancun. Plenty of beaches have places where you can rent equipment so you can snorkel right off the beach but you can also book special excursions to snorkel with sea turtles whale sharks or check out the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef.

Sea turtles are common in the Mexican Caribbean waters — I saw a couple while snorkeling the reef — but to see whale shark you'll need to book a specialty tours that run during whale shark season. Peak season for spotting whale sharks is typically July and August though you can sometimes spot them as early as May when weather starts to warm. Whale sharks are the largest shark in the sea but they are harmless gentle giants.

If you do take a tour I would highly suggest wearing a rash guard or other long-sleeved swimwear to ward off sunburn. Many snorkel tours won't let you bring extra sunscreen on the boat and any sunscreen you put on while at the docks will wear off before your tour ends. Any sunscreen you do wear make sure is reef-safe. Many sunscreens can cause damage to coral and other reef wildlife.

Finally keep in mind that many snorkel excursions may not be the best activity for young kids. Currents can get strong and kids who aren't experienced at navigating through the water around the reefs can accidentally damage the coral.

Underwater museum

Cancun is home to an underwater museum called the Museo Subacuático de Arte (MUSA). This marine park was founded as a way to divert some diving attention away from the coral reefs to help with preservation efforts. Now nearly 500 statues created by a group of sculptors and artists sit in an assortment of exhibits off the coast of Cancun and the nearby Isla Mujeres — and more galleries

The museum isn't only for divers. There are plenty of tours you can book through the MUSA website from snorkeling excursions to diving (both for beginners and certified divers) to glass boat trips to jungle tours. The tour we booked included a guided tour of the gallery of Punta Nizuc and time to snorkel some of the reef — and drinks throughout the day were included complimentary in our package.

Cenote tour on Ruta De Cenotes

If you are in the mood for some adventuring in the jungle check out the cenotes found along a strip in Puerto Morelos. The area is nicknamed the Ruta De Cenotes and it's a quick 30-minute drive from Cancun (about halfway between the city and Playa del Carmen). Many resorts in both Cancun and Playa del Carmen offer tours of this area too.

Cenotes are naturally occurring sinkholes that form when limestone collapses to expose groundwater. Cenotes are found throughout the Yucatán Peninsula and often have beautifully clear water. I've taken a cenote tour in Mexico before (though not in Cancun) and it was easily one of the highlights of that trip. There are many different kinds of cenotes — some are pits that open up to the sky and others are more cave-like in nature. Just make sure to pack your mosquito repellent for your trek through the jungle and plenty of water.

Keep in mind that cenotes are generally off the beaten path and getting into the cenotes themselves almost always requires using shaky ladders or stairs. Therefore most of them aren't easily accessible for those with mobility limitations or small kids.

Try scuba diving or surfing

(Photo by EXTREME PHOTOGRAPHER/Getty Images)

Cancun is a great place to try out scuba diving or surfing for the first time.

For those who want to learn how to surf Cancun is one of the top beginner surf spots in the world thanks to the warm Caribbean water sand beaches that make for easy-going waves and consistent two-to-three foot waves year-round. There are plenty of surf schools that offer lessons in the Cancun area for all ages. As someone who took my very first surf lesson last year (though in Hawaii and not Mexico) there is nothing like the sense of accomplishment you feel when you fly through the water on your feet the first time.

If you'd rather dive beneath the water than surf on top of the waves Cancun is also a great place for both beginner and experienced divers thanks to shallow water areas its proximity to the second largest barrier reef in the world and the many clear-water cenotes in the area. MUSA (above) offers beginner diving excursions as well as experiences for certified scuba divers and there are also other schools where you can start your journey to becoming PADI Certified.

Shop local

There will likely be shopping at the resort you are at but consider venturing into the city for your souvenir purchases. There are some luxury shopping areas you can check out for high-end boutiques.

Mercado 28

Be sure to check out the vendors on Mercado 28 and don't be afraid to negotiate the price you get. (Photo by Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group/Getty Images)

This vibrant and colorful market is a great place to shop for souvenirs and local goods. It's set up like a huge flea market with vendors lining the walkways and you can easily spend hours walking around. From the hotel zone take the R-2 bus to Mercado 28; once you get off you'll need to walk about six blocks up to an archway that says Mercado 28.

While shopping you'll want to negotiate prices down from the first (likely overpriced) offer and don't be afraid to turn down a price and continue shopping elsewhere. You can find some great deals on beautiful pottery clothes and other handcrafted goods.

Tacos on Avenida Tulum

If there is one meal you have that's not at your all-inclusive resort while in Cancun it should be tacos from one of the vendors on Avenida Tulum. Taco stands and stalls are dotted along the road and you can find pretty much every type of taco imaginable. It's a great way to support local business owners while grabbing some delicious authentic eats. I personally recommend mixing and matching tacos from different stands with friends or family members walking down to Parque Las Palapas and spreading everything out on one of the tables at the park to sample all the different tacos everyone got.

La Isla shopping village

La Isla shopping village is where you'll find the aquarium movie theatre and upscale boutiques. It's an open-air mall with walkways that line the canals that go through the shopping center and fountains throughout. It's located in the hotel zone and there are plenty of well-known American chain stores and restaurants here but you'll also find some local gems throughout the shopping center.

If you go in the evening you can even catch a great view of the sunset over the lagoon.

Tequila tasting

Mexico is known for its tequila made 100% from blue agave plants in the Jaliscan Highlands in western Mexico. By law tequila in Mexico can only be produced in handful of municipalities in the state of Jalisco. So while you won't find Cancun-produced tequila you'll find a wide variety of tequilas that were made in the Jaliscan Highlands to taste (and maybe even take home with you).

In Cancun and along the Riviera Maya there are tequila tours and tastings you can book to try out a variety of tequila types and learn more about how the liquor is made.

Take a day trip

There is so much to do in and around Cancun but the city is also perfectly situated for plenty of fun day trips to nearby destinations to get away from the tourists or experience a different vibe. These are all places within a few hours of Cancun that you can get to with a rental car or ferry.

Isla Mujeres

A quick ferry ride away from Cancun's hotel zone is Isla Mujeres or ""the island of women."" This small island town has a much more relaxed atmosphere compared to Cancun. There are places to stay on the island but it's also a quick day trip for those staying in the city.

The island has a little bit of everything — pristine beaches ruins to explore restaurants water activities shopping and more. Divers and snorkelers can check out the MUSA gallery installations off the coast of Isla Mujeres and those who enjoy an adrenaline rush can take a zipline tour over the Caribbean waters. You can also visit Punta Sur on the southern tip of the island. It's the first place in Mexico the sun touches in the morning and the cliffs along the shore are the highest elevation points in the Yucatan. It's also where the temple of the goddess Ixchel used to be — which used to be used as a lighthouse for ships.

Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve

The Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve is a protected area of the Yucatan just south of Playa del Carmen. This UNESCO World Heritage Site covers about 75 miles of coastline and about 988000 acres. It's home to hundreds of different wildlife species from the West Indian Manatee to jaguars and pumas to flamingos to sea turtles to endemic bird species. There are also more than 1000 different types of flora found throughout the reserve.

You can book ecologically friendly nature tours into the lagoons and wetlands where you can see the (mostly) undisturbed nature and learn more about why the conservation of this biosphere reserve and others like it are so important.

Rio Lagartos and Las Coloradas

If you want to escape the non-stop tourist party in Cancun drive to Rio Lagartos a small fishing village and natural reserve on the northern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula. Hundreds of flamingos can be found in the bay if you take a tour through the mangroves and you can walk alongside the pink water salt ponds (which make for an excellent photo op) in Las Coloradas just a few miles away.

It's a birdwatchers paradise but there is a lot to love about this quaint town even if you aren't a self-professed ornithologist. You can walk through the town check out a tour of the reserve to see the flamingos and mangroves and then see the salt ponds that are open to the public (the larger commercial ones are not).

Tulum is another popular destination in Mexico and it's only a couple of hours from Cancun by car. While Tulum is popular it's not as touristy as Cancun in nature so you'll get a more authentic experience walking through the Pre-Columbian Mayan ruins and cliffs checking out the local restaurants and shopping and visiting Playa Paraiso (""Paradise Beach"") to relax under the palm trees that line the sand.

There are also outdoor bars and restaurants that host DJs on the weekends for a great nightlife scene that is fun without being quite as crazy as Cancun's abundance of nightclubs. Spending an evening with friends a margarita good music and a hammock? You can't tell me that isn't the best way to end a day in paradise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzA1L2JlYXQtY2FwaXRhbC1nYWlucy10YXhlcy13aXRoLXRoZS1yb3RoLWlyYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beat Capital Gains Taxes With the Roth IRA,"You can kiss your capital gains worries goodbye with this retirement savings opportunity.

If capital gains taxes are causing you anxiety there's a way to shake off your worries. It's called the Roth IRA and it's the ultimate tax-saving vehicle for eligible investors.

Unlike a traditional IRA the Roth IRA allows you to pay your tax bill up front in exchange for tax-free income later. On top of that buying and selling stocks in your account before you retire won't trigger any capital gains taxes. That's a pretty big deal especially if you believe you might be subject to higher taxes later.

Since the Roth IRA is a time-sensitive offer that's based on your income status here's a quick rundown of what you should know to be eligible to kick capital gains taxes to the curb.

How capital gains taxes work

The goal of every investor is to make money. But if you sold stocks for more than you paid for them in a traditional brokerage account you're on the hook for capital gains taxes.

Let's say you purchased $10000 worth of shares of your favorite company's stock. And now your shares are worth $13000. If you sell all your shares you would have a $3000 capital gain that is subject to short-term or long-term capital gains rates.

Anytime you hold an investment for one year or less you'll pay short-term capital gains tax rates that can be as high as 37%. Essentially you will pay the same rate as you do on your income from a job. If you want to lower your tax bill you could hold your stocks for over a year and unlock the 0% 15% or 20% long-term capital gains rates.

Although lower tax rates are very appealing there's another offer that can be even more rewarding: no capital gains taxes. This perk is one of the main reasons investors fall in love with the Roth IRA.

Eliminate future tax concerns

When you contribute money to a Roth IRA you are funding your account with money you have already paid taxes on. That means you won't have to worry about taxes later if you follow all the rules. Let's say you contribute $100000 over 20 years and your account grows to $700000. Once you reach 59 1/2 and have met the five-year rule you can withdraw all the money in your account 100% tax-free.

This tax-free safety net also works when you are buying and selling stocks in your Roth IRA. If you buy your favorite company's stock and sell it six months later you won't have to pay capital gains taxes. In other words you can sell stocks in your Roth IRA anytime you desire and you won't have to report your gains on your tax return. Make sure you don't withdraw your earnings before you're eligible or you'll be subject to taxes and penalties.

Determine your eligibility

Before you dump all your money into a Roth IRA and live happily ever after you should be aware of the rules.

First you must have earned income to contribute to a Roth IRA. But if your income exceeds the thresholds you won't be eligible to make a direct contribution to a Roth IRA.

You can only contribute a maximum of $6000 to a Roth IRA if you're under 50 and $7000 if you're 50 or over in 2021. Also you cannot contribute more than your earned income for the year. If you don't want to contribute anything during the year you are not required to fund the account.

The Roth IRA income limits and contribution amounts may change every year. If you're interested in the Roth it's a good idea to do your research now and contribute the maximum amount so that you can take full advantage of the capital gains tax exemption.

Enjoy tax-free rewards later

Although most savers can only contribute up to $6000 every year into a Roth IRA that money adds up when you don't have to think about future capital gains taxes. You can allow the power of compounding to take control without any disruptions.

Let's say you're 23 and you contribute $6000 every year to a Roth IRA. By the time you reach 60 you could achieve millionaire status if your investments are earning a 7% return. At this point you can sell investments in your Roth IRA and take the earnings without splitting any profits with the IRS. Even if your annual income is $3 million for the year you still won't have to pay any capital gains taxes when you sell your stocks in your Roth IRA.

Stashing money away in a Roth IRA is something to consider if you expect to climb the income ladder. The more money you can save now the better chance you'll have of building a massive portfolio of investments that is exempt from capital gains taxes."

The Archdiocese of Capiz has again cancelled the much-awaited event as recommended by local health authorities amid the prevailing health crisis.

The move was also made “to ensure the health and safety of everyone” it said.

The ceremony was due to take place at the Immaculate Conception Metropolitan Cathedral in Roxas City on June 8.

The city however is currently under the stricter modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) status until June 15.

This is the second time that the ceremony has been cancelled.

It was originally scheduled for May 28 but was postponed due to the availability of the papal nuncio Archbishop John Brown who will lead the event.

There is no word yet as to when will the ceremony push through.

Advincula was among the 13 new additions to the College of Cardinals during a consistory at the Vatican in November 2020. But he was not able to physically attend the event due to travel restrictions in the country.

The red hat ceremony is Advincula’s last big event in the Capiz archdiocese before he assumes his new post as Manila archbishop on June 24.

Fairfield Police say 52-year-old William Penn of Staten Island and 46-year-old George Smith of East Meadow made plans to steal the trailer from Funtime Services in Fairfield New Jersey earlier this year.

Penn and a juvenile allegedly traveled to the business on April 12 and stole an enclosed trailer. Inside the trailer were a number of inflatable amusements and a water pistol carnival game.

Police say the trailer and its contents are worth about $192000.

Penn then allegedly towed the trailer to New York City.

The trailer was found in a parking lot in Oceanside on April 30 and eventually returned to its owner.

Police say Penn and Smith turned themselves in to police on June 2.

Board chair Kristen Pence vice chair Antoinette Funk and board members Andrea Lo Thomas McFadden Jr. and Melanie Salins during their regular meeting on Wednesday May 1 voted 5-0 to have Jennifer Cameron appointed as the LFK principal effective July 1.

“Ms. Cameron is an experienced educator and leader in Warren County” said WCPS Superintendent Christopher Ballenger in recommending her appointment to the School Board.

Previously Cameron has taught as a fourth- and fifth-grade teacher and has experience as a literacy coach who supported grade-level teachers in her school building Ballenger said adding that as an administrator Cameron has served as the dean of students and as an assistant principal.

“During her years of service Ms. Cameron was selected as the Rotary Teacher of the Year in 2008 and was the [WCPS] Elementary Teacher of the Year in 2015-2016” he added.

As a leader Ballenger also said that Cameron has been integral in transforming E. Wilson Morrison Elementary School and has served as the chair for the division’s Attendance Committee for the past two years.

“Ms. Cameron is a great fit for LFK and I know that her skill set will continue to move LFK forward” said the superintendent.

Following the board’s vote Cameron told board members she was honored to accept the LFK principal position and said she’s excited to rejoin the Lil’ Cat family.

“Thank you for entrusting me with this opportunity to nurture young minds and to foster the continued excellence of LFK” she said. “I look forward to working with you to continue the path to excellence at Warren County Public Schools. I’m truly humbled at this huge responsibility that you have entrusted to me and I look forward to the coming school year and this new adventure that awaits me.”

In other action items the School Board unanimously accepted four scholarships with gratitude from the Front Royal Cardinals and approved the donation of auditorium seating from E. Wilson Morrison (EWM) Elementary School.

Donna Settle president of Front Royal Cardinals Baseball a nonprofit organization that is part of the Valley Baseball League said that as part of the group’s fundraising activities the board will sponsor Little League for both girls and boys and will give back to the WCPS baseball and softball programs.

“This year our board has voted to bring scholarships back to Warren County” Settle told the board. “I know we’re a little late in the season but we have enough money set aside for the scholarships for the 2024 student-athletes.”

There are four new $500 scholarship opportunities beginning with the Class of 2024 that are available for a Skyline baseball and softball senior who plans to continue their education and for a Warren County baseball and softball senior who plans to continue their education.

The School Board also voted 5-0 to permit two auditorium seats to be donated to Robert MacDougall founding principal of Transform Development a commercial landlord and developer based in the Shenandoah Valley.

Seating in the EWM auditorium which is being renovated to provide an indoor facility for students and staff has been removed and is set to go to auction. MacDougall offered a facility to store the auditorium seating until they could be auctioned.

With the School Board’s blessing WCPS will now donate two seats to MacDougall who will display them in the theater once its renovation is completed.

Regarding a request to have the Warren County Board of Supervisors (BOS) appropriate the fiscal year 2022 School Operating Fund Surplus the School Board voted unanimously to table the item to a work session and FY2025 budget resolution.

Ballenger explained that the total fiscal year 2021-2022 school operating surplus is $973098 and said it was being requested that the Warren County Board of Supervisors (BOS) appropriate $300000 of the surplus to the School Transportation Fund that is held by the County and the remaining $673098 to the School Capital Improvement Fund that is also held by the County.

The $300000 designated for the Transportation Fund was originally included in the FY2025 Proposed School Operating Budget to purchase replacement buses and vehicle(s) but has since been removed contingent upon the funding appropriated to the Transportation Fund he said.

Of the $673098 requested for the County’s School Capital Improvement Fund $40000 was originally included in the FY2025 Proposed School Operating Budget to cover the repair/replacement of the chiller at Hilda J Barbour Elementary School and to upgrade the HVAC management systems at several schools. The remaining balance ($633098) being requested for the Capital Improvement Fund would be requested at a future date for other capital priorities such as the replacement of the tennis courts at the high schools.

As the budget process continues unfolding for both WCPS and the BOS the School Board members agreed to work more on the item before taking action.

During the School Board’s community participation portion of its meeting Leslie Mathews (above) a parent with two children attending Skyline Middle School said that some of the School Board members are using the concerns expressed through emails by parents as “a crutch” for their own political motives. She called it a disgrace.

“I and we parents are only given three minutes a month [during School Board meetings] to get up here and express our concerns to you or we’re told we can email you” said Mathews. “But I no longer trust that method of emailing.”

Mathews who last fall unsuccessfully challenged School Board incumbent Pence for the South River School Board seat said “it’s such a disgrace for you as a public servant to go and encourage others to FOIA the concerns of parents who are not like-minded as yourself.

“So therefore our concerns are going public” said Mathews who didn’t name names. “If we want more positive in Warren County Public Schools then we need to start at our leadership.”

Yet they would serve in other conflicts.

Here's What You Need To Know: The arrival of these large carriers came at a time when the United States was becoming a global superpower and these ships played a key role.

Conceived as a beefier ""battle carrier"" the Midway­-class aircraft carrier featured an armored flight deck was more resilient and better able to recover from dive-bombing and kamikaze attacks – and to ensure that it could still carry enough planes to do the job the ship was longer than three football fields.

Six of the nearly 1000 foot long behemoths were planned and three were built. And from her launching on March 20 1945 USS Midway (CV-41) which was named after the decisive World War II carrier battle fought just three years earlier was the largest warship on the planet.

The USS Midway arrived too late for World War II and was commissioned on September 10 1945 – but she would play a major role during the changing geopolitical climate of the Cold War. For 47 years as the longest-serving aircraft carrier in the 20th century she was a pioneer as well; the first American carrier to operate in sub-Arctic midwinder which required the development of new flight deck procedures and became the only ship to launch a captured German V-2 rocket and then sent a patrol plane aloft to demonstrate that atomic bombs could be delivered from a carrier.

Midway's sister ship USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42) the first carrier to be named for a former U.S. President became the first carrier to have a planned jet-powered landing on her deck. She also demonstrated carrier long-range attack capabilities when a P2V-3C Neptune took off and flew over Charleston South Carolina to the Bahamas to the Panama Canal and then finally to San Francisco – a total of 5060 miles and the longest flight ever made from a carrier deck.

Along with the third sister ship USS Coral Sea (CV-43) USS Midway and USS Roosevelt were modernized for jet aircraft in time for the Vietnam War. USS Midway pilots shot down the first and last MiG fighters of the Vietnam War and the ship led the evacuation of Saigon in 1975 rescuing more than 3000 refugees in two days.

""They were the perfect ships for what the U.S. Navy needed"" said Mike Fabey America's Naval reporter for Jane's. ""We needed a much larger carrier to maintain our global navy.""

The arrival of these large carriers came at a time when the United States was becoming a global superpower and these ships played a key role.

""You could say America was getting the keys to controlling world events"" Fabey told The National Interest. ""Ships like Midway were what were needed to keep the peace and maintain order especially in the Western Pacific. You needed a different kind of ship.""

Today the supercarrier isn't really such a novel concept but in the early Cold War this wasn't so readily apparent.

""The Midway shows something about the concept of the carrier at large"" explained Fabey. ""It is a floating city/airfield/naval base. The ships were designed for a particular war but were able to morph to stay on patrol longer.""

Then there is the fact that this class of warships was able to hold such a significant number of aircraft – upwards of 130 in the immediate post-World War II era and still nearly 70 more modern aircraft.

""This is very important because it is very much the aircraft and the carrier"" added Fabey. ""Without the aircraft you really just have a super ugly cruise ship.""

On April 11 1992 after 47 years the first of the class and the last to remain in service was finally decommissioned. Midway didn't arrive in time for World War II but along with her two sister ships played a crucial role in the Cold War – remaining in service through the 1991 Gulf War. Today she is preserved as a museum ship in San Diego.

Turkey's procurement of the Russian S-400 missile defense systems prompted the U.S. administration to suspend Ankara's participation in the F-35 joint program in July 2019. This left Turkey without a clear path towards providing a fixed-wing combat capability for this ship. Turkey will thus be alone in having a large amphibious assault ship with no fixed wing aircraft.

In a statement made by Turkish drone maker Baykar chief technology officer (CTO) Selçuk Bayraktar 05 April 2021 We are developing an aircraft that lands / takes off on the aircraft carrier called Bayraktar TB3 and is unique in that class. Its wings fold it lands on the aircraft carrier it can carry heavier ammunition around 1200 kilograms. Regarding the issue Prof. Dr. Ismail DEMIR said ""We have various fixed wing UAV projects that will transform TCG ANATOLIA into an armed unmanned aerial vehicle ship."" SavunmaSanayiST.com shared the information that the SIHA in question was Bayraktar TB3.

For Bayraktar TB3 which is expected to be located between Bayraktar TB2 and ANKA TCG will make some modifications in ANATOLIA. As a result of these modifications TCG ANADOLU will be made ready for flight operations for Baykar Defense production Bayraktar TB3. It is predicted that Bayraktar TB3 will be capable of using the L-UMTAS Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) system developed by Roketsan. SIHA will use a national engine produced by TEI. With the project Bayraktar TB3 SIHA will have foldable wings will be able to land and take off using the deck of TCG Anadolu.

Turkey announced plans to equip its future aircraft carrier TCG Anadolu with 50 battle drones the Bayraktar TB 3 after Turkey was barred from participating in the F-35 US fifth-generation fighter program as it was with these fighters that Turkey initially had planned to equip its base ship which is due to be completed in 2021. In March 2021 Ismail Demir the Turkish governments president of defence industries said companies have been working on the Baykar-made Bayraktar TB3 derived from the combat-proven TB2 to turn Anadolu into a drone carrier.

Turkish unmanned aerial vehicle manufacturer Baykar unveiled a new launch system to equip TCG Anadolu displaying unmanned aerial vehicles Bayraktar TB-2/3 on board during the presentation [with a strangely unrealistic depiction of the TCG Anadolu itself]. There is an interesting pulley-winch system in the bow of the ship. It's like a tow accelerator-aimed system instead of a catepult. In the section where the Phalanx CWIS is surprisingly two more RAMs are packed. A piece equipment that cannot be identified is drawn in the place reserved for the 12.7 / 25mm RCWS under the ramp.

The Bayraktar TB-2/3 is a medium-altitude long-range unmanned aerial vehicle capable of performing autonomous or remote combat tasks. Turkish Baykar Defence Companys CEO Haluk Bayraktar released an image of Turkeys future landing helicopter dock TCG Anadolus with TB-3 Bayraktar unmanned combat aerial vehicles during an online event on 07 May 2021. He said that the image shows the taking off and landing concept of TB-3 Bayraktar from TCG Anadolu. He also stressed that they have still been working on the drone that will weigh around 1200 kilograms.

An unmanned aircraft carrier would be a new concept for the operation of aircraft carriers. The UK Defense Journal reports that the main focus of the aircraft at the moment would be on intelligence and surveillance operations as well as small-scale impact operations in the coastal region.

F-35B TCVL

Turkey had planned to buy 100 F-35A jets for its air force and 16 F-35B for the navy to deploy on its carriers. Turkey can only deploy S-400B Seahawk DSH (Submarine Defense War) helicopters on board. The Land Forces Command's S-70 Blackhawk helicopters are not suited for long-term marine use due to corrosion as is the case with the T-129 ATAK helicopters. The Land Forces Command inventory includes 9 AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopters which are also used by the US Marine Corps. Spain plans to retire the AV-8B Harrier II VSTOL planes and supply the F-35B instead on the Spanish Juan Carlos LHD. Possibly Turkey might acquire these used Harriers.

The Anatolia is fitted with a runway sloped to 12 degrees for fighter planes. Milliyet reported that the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter and the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military aircraft were among the aircraft designed for launch from the runway on missions by the Turkish armed forces around the world. The F-35B class 5th generation fighter and eight helicopters can be carried to theaters in the Aegean Black Sea and Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean if needed.

In March 2012 the head of the naval forces of Turkey Admiral Murat Bilgel in an interview in the US Naval Institute Proceedings Magazine supported the strengthening of the Turkish fleet with an aircraft carrier. In particular the Turkish Admiral said the ""the strategic priorities of our fleet for the next 5 10 to 20 years is the creation of naval forces of well-trained and well equipped which would be promoted in a brief period and to operate in areas of strategic interest. The design of the Turkish naval forces for the next decade includes the acquisition of an aircraft carrier which would focus to meet the working needs beyond war enterprises. We intend to increase the carrying capacity of our air transport and to gain support of multiple role naval ships frigates unmanned helicopters and submarines which would operate the under water for a long time.""

Admiral Bilgel stated that the Turkish air forces do not have aircraft that could be adapted to an aircraft carrier but acquiring the STOVL F-35B aircraft would provide the possibility of shipboard operations. Turkey is to buy 100 F-35 (by 2015 would receive the first two aircraft) and according to Adm. Bilgel a part of these would the F-35B STOVL type or Turkey would provide additional aircraft of this type. TEI of Turkey (the engine division of TAI) is among the producers of the RR-GE engine of the F-35B (the STOVL version) so it won't be a surprise if Turkey would also get around 20 to 24 F-35Bs (JSF) to operate on this ship.

But after Turkey took its first delivery of the Russian S-400 missile system in July 2019 Donald Trump admitted it would be extremely hard for the United States to sell F-35 fighters jets to its NATO ally. The US president described the situation as 'unfair"" suggesting it may not be his decision to halt the deal. He certainly appeared reluctant to impose sanctions on Ankara. There were indications from Trump has been talking to lawmakers as well as State Department and Pentagon officials to find a solution to what had become a legal issue for his government. Other countries had seen the F-35B as a path towards a medium aircraft carrier but without the F-35B Turkey would not have such an option.

The European Union has decided to ban Belarusian airlines from entering its airspace effective from 5 June. The decision was taken after Belarus hijacked a Ryanair plane in May citing a bomb threat to arrest an opponent.

Friday's decision by the EU comes two weeks after the Belarusian authorities decided to divert a plane carrying dissident journalist Roman Protasevich.

The ban primarily concerns the national airline Belavia.

""Other sanctions targeting entities and individuals will follow quickly"" warned European Council President Charles Michel renewing a call to ""release all political prisoners in Belarus"".

We keep our word.



As of midnight any aircraft operated by Belarusian air carriers is prohibited to land in take off from or overfly #EU territory.

On Wednesday European airlines had already been instructed not to fly over the ex-Soviet country for ""security"" reasons.

This retaliatory measure was denounced by the international association defending the interests of airlines the IATA which sees it as a ""retrograde and disappointing development"" that amounts to ""politicising air safety"".

""Two wrongs do not make a right. Politics should never interfere with the safe operation of aircraft and politicians should never use aviation safety as a cover to pursue political or diplomatic agendas"" IATA chief Willie Walsh said in a statement.

EU condemns Belarus interview under pressure

Meanwhile several politicians on Friday condemned an interview shown on Belarusian state television with the journalist Roman Protasevich saying he was only speaking ""under duress"".

Germany said the interview broadcast on Thursday was a ""disgrace"" while British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it was ""disturbing"".

Looking uncomfortable in the video Protasevich said he had called for protests last year and praised Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko.

Speaking during a visit to Warsaw Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said: ""All such videos are shot under pressure.""

""We should not believe any of the words of these people including Roman Protasevich"" said Tikhanovskaya who ran against Belarusian strongman Lukashenko in an election last year.

""They are done after torture"" she said.

Protasevich was arrested on May 23 along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega when their Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius was diverted intercepted by a Belarusian fighter jet and made to land.

Belarusian authorities accuse Protasevich of organising mass riots a charge that could land him in prison for 15 years.

In its caterpillar life stage the insect is a voracious leaf eater. Large numbers of gypsy moth caterpillars caused widespread defoliation in the state from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. A large population in 2020 has led to more caterpillars hatching this spring in localized areas across Lower Michigan — including in Lapeer County and neighboring counties.

Phil Kaatz an educator with the Michigan State University Extension Service-Lapeer County said it’s already beyond time to offer much control for area residents to provide substantial relief to the destruction the gypsy moth can cause. Late April and May provides a slight window when the eggs are hatching from masses on the sides of trees. “Now they’re up high in the canopy of trees chewing away at leaves. Trees can be defoliated by these insects but a healthy tree can usually withstand one year of infestation” said Kaatz. Additional stresses on trees that could negatively impact their ability to survive defoliation would include if Lapeer County has extended hot dry conditions this summer.

From September to May a single egg mass contains 100-1000 eggs insulated in a matting of hair from the female’s body. Masses are tan-colored oblong and range from 1 to 3 inches. Hatching coincides with the opening of tree buds. According to the MSU Extension and DNR they climb trees or other objects and drop on silken threads to be dispersed by the wind in a behavior called ballooning. Once they land on a host tree the larva begin to feed.

“We’re going to have gypsy moths in Michigan for a long long time” said Kaatz and suggested the severity of the problem should be a conversation by residents as well as township and county officials to explore the possibility of developing spray and treatment initiatives. “We should be planning now for next year” said Kaatz.

Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) forest health experts say heavy defoliation likely will become visible within the next month in localized outbreak areas and persist through mid-July.

“Gypsy moth caterpillars rarely kill trees in Michigan” said James Wieferich DNR forest health specialist. “Only stressed trees suffering from problems like drought old age or root damage are at high risk. In most cases gypsy moth caterpillars are more of a nuisance in residential areas on houses and in yards than in the woods.”

The leaf-eating caterpillars are hairy up to 2 inches long and have a pattern of blue and dark-red spots. Male moths are dark buff in color and fly; females are white with black wavy markings and do not fly.

The best thing people can do to reduce the effects of pests like gypsy moth on their trees is to promote tree health.

“Water trees regularly and avoid damaging the roots and bark” Wieferich said. “That goes a long way in helping trees fend off the effects of defoliation.”

Defoliated trees will begin to develop new leaves in July to replace those that were eaten. Even heavily defoliated trees will recover without serious long-term effects. However consecutive years of mass defoliation will start to take a toll even on the healthiest of mature trees.

Gypsy moths were first discovered in Michigan in 1954. By the 1980s and 1990s large gypsy moth populations cycled through Michigan defoliating up to a million acres in some years said Scott Lint DNR forest health specialist. At that time the moths were new to the state and the population grew rapidly without natural control from parasites predators and pathogens.

In 1991 a fungal pathogen found to be killing gypsy moth caterpillars in the northeastern states was deployed in Michigan. This fungus Entomophaga maimaiga proved an effective biological control remaining in the soil from year to year and infecting gypsy moth caterpillars that come in contact with the soil or with other infected caterpillars. Moist soils help to activate the fungus and spread it among gypsy moth populations.

Nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV) is a naturally occurring virus that kills caterpillars. NPV can spread quickly during major gypsy moth outbreaks causing a population crash. This virus also was artificially distributed in Michigan in the 1990s with positive effects.

To determine whether NPV is at work in a certain location look for dead caterpillars attached to tree trunks in an upside-down “V” position. Caterpillars affected by the E. maimaiga fungus also remain attached to trunks but hang straight down.

For residential areas several Michigan counties local governments and/ or property owner associations conduct surveillance in the fall to determine if populations are reaching an outbreak level. If treatments are needed an aerial pesticide application will target highly infested areas.

Michigan communities considering a gypsy moth spray program should seek licensed pesticide applicator businesses familiar with the complex pesticide laws including notification and permitting requirements.

To address a gypsy moth infestation in a handful of individual trees homeowners can purchase a spray containing Bacillus thuringiensis var.

Caterpillars move up and down trees often massing on tree trunks. During this time spraying caterpillars with a mixture of dish soap and water or scraping caterpillars into a bucket of soap and water also can be effective.

Kaatz said it’s important for area residents during a period of active gypsy moth presence to refrain from moving firewood. “Buy only local firewood. Don’t pack firewood to take on vacation because it’s possible there could be egg masses on the wood and people could spread gypsy moths more if they do that” he commented.

The gypsy moth is often confused with the Eastern tent caterpillar a benign native species. While some find their tents unsightly Eastern tent caterpillars are a natural part of the Michigan ecosystem.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA2LTA2L2tvbWluZXJzLXMtY29udW5kcnVtcy1sb3N0LWx5cmljcy10by1raWNrLW9mZi10aGUtc3VtbWVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kominers's Conundrums: Lost Lyrics to Kick Off the Summer,"With Memorial Day last weekend and temperatures in New York expected to hit 90 degrees this week it’s officially summer in the northern hemisphere.

Columns share an author's personal perspective and are often based on facts in the newspaper's reporting.

I got a text from my mom last week that made my heart sink: “Eric Carle died.”

All over Twitter I saw that other people heard the news the same way— their parent or called their grown children texted.

The iconic children’s book author and illustrator who has a studio and children’s museum in Massachusetts died last week at age 91. The lifetime bond his works created between kids and parents speaks volumes about his genius and legacy.

His family announced that the artist illustrator and writer “passed away peacefully and surrounded by family members on May 23 2021 at his summer studio in Northampton Massachusetts.”

As soon as I heard I thought of the Christmas we got “The Very Quiet Cricket.” Like all Carle’s books it was vibrantly colorful in his signature tissue paper collage illustrations. I was floored that it chirped at the end. I read that book over and over just for the joy of the last page.

We became like many families as I witnessed on Twitter last week an Eric Carle family: “The Very Busy Spider” “Little Cloud” “A House for Hermit Crab” “The Grouchy Lady Bug” and his illustrative debut with Bill Martin Jr. “Brown Bear Brown Bear What do you See?”

The second thing that struck me after replaying those childhood moments with his books in my head was that I had interviewed Carle in 2009 when “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” turned 40.

Rereading it I was stuck by so many lines.

This was back before social media before we shared articles online so I want to share highlights of that interview here.

The award-winning book creator was 80 at the time. He told me about writing art and growing up in Nazi Germany — and that his favorite book he ever wrote was “Do You Want to be My Friend?” because “it’s about friendship.”

Here are highlights:

Daley: You were born in Syracuse N.Y. in 1929. Your family moved to Germany when you were 6 years old.

Carle: I have painful memories of growing up in Germany during the Second World War and in a way I feel the colorful illustrations of my books are a kind of antidote to the grays and browns of my childhood.

Daley: What were your favorite books to read as a kid? Did you have many books?

Carle: I didn’t have many books. But I have very fond memories of sitting on my father’s lap while he read the Sunday funny pages to me.

It’s important that we read to our children but equally important is the act of taking your child onto your lap holding them close while you read to them letting them know by this simple act that you care for them have time for them and love them. Then the book becomes more than pages with words and pictures.

Daley: Do you consider yourself more of an artist who writes or a writer who creates art?

Carle: I am first a visual person. I was tentative at first in my ability as a writer but over the years I’ve become more confident. My pictures are a very important part of my books. I think of them as little posters.

Daley: How did you come up with your unique collage technique?

EC: I first learned about collage in art school in Germany and later used the technique as a graphic designer and art director for an advertising agency. But I didn’t invent collage. Many children have done collages at home or in their classrooms. In fact some children have said to me “Oh I can do that.” I consider that the highest compliment.

Daley: What’s your process?

Carle: I take hand-painted tissue papers that I paint with acrylics. Then I cut and tear these painted papers and glue them onto illustration board. My painted papers are like my palette.

Daley: How’d you like working in advertising?

Carle My work and my training were very important in my development and I did enjoy it. But when I was asked to illustrate Bill Martin Jr.’s “Brown Bear” I was set on fire. I was so inspired to be able to make a difference in the lives of young readers. I had found my true course in life… He opened the world of picture books for me.

Daley: What gave you the idea for “The Very Hungry Caterpillar”?

Carle The idea (came) when I was absentmindedly punching holes into a stack of paper. I always try to squeeze as much as possible out of the paper. If possible I don’t want just a plain sheet of paper. I want to change that flat sheet in some way.

Daley: You said “Caterpillar” is about hope; “Spider” is about work; “Cricket” is about love and “Firefly” is about belonging. Why did you pick those four themes?

Carle: I didn’t set out to write about those themes. They sort of evolved as the idea for each book took shape.

Daley: I have a copy of “The Very Quiet Cricket” from 1990 that still chirps. Was it your idea to create a multi-sensory book?

Carle: I’ve always been interested in making books more tactile something for a child to hold (like) a toy. I often think of my books as being toys you can read.

Daley: You wrote on your Web site: “The passage from home to school is the second biggest trauma of childhood; the first is of course being born.” Is that one of the reasons you wanted to write for children?

Carle: I’ve always hoped my books would help bridge the worlds of home and school —that was a very difficult transition for me. My books are attempts to bridge those worlds.

Thank you Eric for all the bridges.

We don’t blame you if you’re not a fan of them all—but quite a few are actually beautiful if you look closely enough. (It’s not all murder hornets and cicadas out there!)

From blush-pink mantises to golden beetles hummingbird-like moths to painterly stink bugs the world is full of insects that wouldn’t look out of place in an art museum. Here’s everything you need to know about why bugs have evolved this way plus a look at a few of the most beautiful insects ever discovered.

Why do insects have different colors and patterns?

Bugs have evolved with unique appearances for a few key reasons: camouflage mating and protection explains Akito Y. Kawahara Ph.D. associate professor and curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida.

By blending into their surroundings insects like the orchid mantis give predators the slip or become invisible to their prey. Displaying vibrant colors helps bugs like the coastal peacock spider attract mates. And flashier insects like the green milkweed locust meanwhile display their colors to warn that they are poisonous or taste bad.

Consider a hairy caterpillar: Those hairs serve a specific purpose keeping wasps from landing on the caterpillar and appearing unappetizing to birds Kawahara says. But human beings see them as cute or at least less freaky than other bugs. “It’s our interpretation the way human beings perceive what is beautiful and what is gross” he continues. Other species do the same calculus in a different kind of way.

Another great example of the genius of beautiful insects is the monarch butterfly Kawahara notes which feeds on poisonous milkweed as a caterpillar. When it emerges as a full-grown butterfly its recognizable wings advertise that it tastes nasty—and that it might even kill any predator unlucky enough to eat it. On top of that other species with similar defenses including viceroy and queen butterflies have evolved to look like monarchs providing extra protection for all three types.

What are the most beautiful insects in the world?

No matter what remember that all bugs (yes even that spider hiding in your closet right now!) are worthy of your respect. “We shouldn’t bias ourselves by looking at just the things that are pretty” Kawahara says. “It’s unfortunate that people don’t think of insects as being awesome which they really are.”

With so many species to choose from it’s tough to narrow down the most stunning bugs of the bunch—but here are the ones that really caught our eye:"

The uncertainty over the lease especially as the court recently merged with the Federal Court kept the yield comparatively high at 6.5 per cent. Sources say it can be difficult to get bank financing at that kind of yield so the buyer is likely to have deep pockets. The 2729 sq m office at 53-55 Robinson Street has been a family law court since the mid-1980s.

The Commonwealth government’s lease runs out in July 2023 and there are no further options. Annual rent is $782413 a year. The deal was done by Gross Waddell ICR’s Alex Ham and Michael Gross with CBRE’s Scott Orchard Scott Hawthorne and Jimmy Tat. Mr Orchard said the uncertainty stopped the transaction achieving the sharp yields usually obtained by government-leased buildings. A Family Court representative told Capital Gain there were no plans to move. City fringe

A family-run boutique student accommodation building on the city fringe has been listed for sale as the flow of international students dries up. 57-65 Drummond Street Carlton Credit: It is understood the 43-room property known as Albert House has just four students living in its dorms. The 1600 sq m three-storey building at 57-64 Drummond Street was configured into accommodation in the 1990s but it started out as offices for the Australian Workers Union. Records show the AWU sold up in 1997 for $1.05 million. It’s expected to fetch more than $10 million.

Expressions of interest closing on July 1 are being handled by Gross Waddell ICR agents Raff De Luise Julian Materia and Danny Clark. The property is on a 604 sq m site near the corner of Queensberry Street and has room for 10 car parks. Meanwhile bigger players like Scape are planning towers for the Carlton precinct to house the students expected to return in the future. Wizel buys Former CBRE agent Mark Wizel who struck out on his own last year establishing the Wizel Property Group is ramping up his activities.

Two shops opposite Fairfield railway station owned by Mr Wizel have been leased to Burgertory and the Bean Smuggler. CBRE agent Jason Orenbuch said the 92 sq m and 98 sq m shops at 7-9 Railway Place the foot of a new apartment building were leased on 10-year terms. Mr Wizel has been a keen investor in new strata title retail and confirmed he also owns around 150 sq m of space in Caulfield. In Prahran Wizel Property Group’s Lewis Tong made the winning bid of $5.2 million for a two-storey shop at 257 Chapel Street on the corner of Greville Street - a sharp yield of 3.35 per cent yield. Mr Wizel did not return calls so it’s not clear if the group was acting as buyer or buyer’s representative.

Gross Waddell ICR agents Michael Gross and Andrew Waddell handled Thursday’s auction on the eve of lockdown. The sale was struck at a building rate of $8228 a sq m and a land rate of $10505 a sq m. There are offices on the first floor and the long-running discount store Supa Bargains on the ground. It returns $230000 a year from leases expiring in 2026. Two bidders competed in front of a crowd of around 40 for the property. By Friday auctions were back online and the Oreana Group paid $13.15 million for a row of faux Tudor shops at 169-175 Toorak Road. It adjoins South Yarra Square which it purchased for $35 million last month. Faux Tudor

Speaking of faux Tudor shops and Prahran a row opposite Prahran Market at 182-194 Commercial Road is expected to sell for $8 million.

U.S. cellphone carriers are offering their most generous discounts in years handing some customers brand-new devices for no money down or small monthly payments stretched over many months. The discounts from AT&T Inc. Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. require customers to make long-term commitments that give carriers the stability they need to reassure investors as they increase spending on 5G network upgrades.

AT&T kicked off the trend in October by offering high-end smartphones such as the iPhone 12 free with an eligible trade-in device. Its discount later dropped to $700 which covers the entire price of an iPhone 12 Mini and most of a standard iPhone 12 among other gadgets.

Verizon followed suit on Tuesday dangling trade-in credits of $700 toward new iPhones and $800 toward high-end Android phones. Both companies' most generous offers require that customers stick with an unlimited data plan for a set time.

""It's essentially a contract"" said Jeff Moore the head of telecom research firm Wave7 Research. ""We're seeing carriers locking in the customer base that they have as opposed to encouraging switchers.""

The free-phone strategy is a throwback to the wireless market a decade ago when U.S. carriers subsidized the price of most new smartphones in exchange for subscribers' guaranteed monthly payments.

The status quo shifted around 2013 and carriers began hawking no-contract wireless plans to customers who bought their own devices.

Subscribers could also pay off the cost of a new smartphone through monthly installments added to their bills.

AT&T and Verizon are now footing most or all of those purchases in exchange for reliable revenue. Verizon's free-phone offer requires a two-year commitment. AT&T on Friday stretched its 30-month payoff plan to cover three years. Both companies are offering the deals to existing customers not just new ones or those adding a new phone line.

T-Mobile is offering trade-in credits worth up to $1000 toward new smartphones paid off over two years. Its offer covers a wider range of mobile data plans but only applies to customers activating a new phone line.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % T AT&T INC. 16.99 +0.14 +0.83% VZ VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. 39.33 +0.44 +1.13% TMUS T-MOBILE US INC. 162.37 -2.23 -1.35% AAPL APPLE INC. 181.71 -1.67 -0.91%

Each carrier covers the cost of the smartphone through monthly bill credits equal to what their regular equipment installment payments would be. More expensive devices such as the iPhone 12 Pro Max -- sticker price $1100 -- yield low monthly installment payments. Verizon's $700 to $800 offer also throws in a $300 gift card for new customers. The discounts require continuous wireless service for at least two years; otherwise customers must pay off the balance of the smartphone purchase.

Wall Street analysts say the offers to existing AT&T and Verizon customers affect a much wider range of eligible users than previous promotions did. Paying to equip new and existing customers with new smartphones has already cost AT&T as much as $2 billion per quarter according to estimates from industry researcher MoffettNathanson LLC.

PCS ARE BACK AS DELL HP DELIVER STRONG SALES FOR DESKTOPS AND NOTEBOOKS

The handouts have yielded AT&T the sharp subscriber growth that investors tend to reward. The Dallas company added nearly 1.4 million postpaid phone connections to its base over the six months that ended in March.

David Christopher executive vice president of AT&T's wireless division said the device credits are more like interest-free financing than a long-term contract for wireless service. He said the carrier started offering subsidized financing because the sticker price on top smartphones has risen from $600 a few years ago to $1000 or more today and buyers wanted more ways to cover the purchase.

""Our customer base is very valuable and low churn is represented by customers voting to stay with AT&T"" he said. ""It resonated in the marketplace. We like the formula.""

Industry executives also say the generous phone deals reveal fiercer competition in the wireless market which has shrunk to three national carriers since T-Mobile's takeover of rival Sprint Corp. in 2020. Satellite operator Dish Network Inc. gained the ingredients for a fourth national system through a Justice Department-brokered settlement but its first cell towers won't go live until later this year.

GE VERIZON TEAM UP ON 5G

The consolidation hasn't yet led to sharply higher service charges though monthly rates haven't fallen either. MoffettNathanson estimates the average revenue per user on a postpaid plan which carriers value for its reliable monthly payments has hovered around roughly $47 over the past three years.

Cable-internet providers Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. are adding to the fray with their own low-price wireless plans. Those deals are only available in the cable providers' footprints where they have arrangements to provide cellular service with help from Verizon's network.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % CMCSA COMCAST CORP. 38.49 -0.20 -0.52% CHTR CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS INC. 271.47 +5.54 +2.08%

""We see a competitive healthy market out there"" T-Mobile Chief Executive Mike Sievert said last month. ""When more people start to enter the switching pool you have more people that are jump balls. And when more people are jump balls T-Mobile tends to do well.""

Verizon meanwhile is counting on customers with cheaper wireless service to upgrade to its most expensive unlimited-data plans which include high-speed 5G access and subscriptions to media services such as Disney+. The carrier said about a fifth of its postpaid wireless accounts subscribed to these premium unlimited plans at the end of 2020 a share executives hope to boost to about 50% by the end of 2023.

AT&T's offers apply to several wireless plans but its executives have touted their ability to upsell customers to premium-tier service bundled with other perks such as HBO Max. The telecom giant recently unveiled plans to spin off HBO owner WarnerMedia into a new company combined with rival Discovery Inc. The carrier hasn't detailed its plans for HBO Max after the deal closes but has said the Hollywood business will remain part of AT&T through mid-2022.

All three national carriers are working to shore up their customer bases as they increase spending on 5G infrastructure. U.S. companies bid about $81 billion earlier this year to secure new federal spectrum licenses that support the high-speed connections adding to the sector's overall debt. Executives have said those down payments will yield benefits once their customers start to notice 5G's faster internet speeds in the coming years.

Until then AT&T and Verizon could keep battling it out in the market with discounts to avoid bleeding subscribers.

""It's a stalemate"" said Craig Moffett a MoffettNathanson analyst. ""History says it's a lot easier to start these kinds of price wars than it is to end them.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

In April UiPath (PATH 1.90%) went public at $56 per share jumping 23% on the first day. Given the company's background it's not surprising that investors raced to buy this tech stock. UiPath's business is built around two trendy technologies: robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI) both of which have the potential to reshape the world.

However sometimes hype drives a stock price more than the underlying fundamentals. So before you invest your hard-earned dollars let's look more closely at UiPath and its long-term prospects. Specifically where will this company be in five years?

Market opportunity

UiPath has a lofty mission: to enable the fully automated enterprise. To that end its platform identifies tasks that can be automated then helps clients build manage and measure software robots that automate those tasks. This is known as RPA.

UiPath's platform blends RPA and AI which includes natural-language processing computer vision and machine learning. To understand why that's important let's dive deeper into those terms.

RPA involves automating manual tasks like filling out forms and pulling data from documents. But natural-language processing and computer vision allow robots to understand those forms and documents. And machine learning takes that one step further by teaching robots to learn meaning they become more intelligent over time.

UiPath's combination of RPA and AI allows clients to build software robots that learn from human behavior which makes it possible to automate even highly complex tasks.

In other words UiPath can transform enterprises by replacing humans with robots. This boosts efficiency by freeing people from tedious or repetitive tasks allowing them to spend their time on more valuable activities.

Given the potential here UiPath estimates its current market opportunity at $60 billion but management expects this figure to grow over time.

Competitive position

Traditionally automation tools have been built for software developers and engineers making it difficult for the average employee to engage with or benefit from the technology. UiPath solves this problem. Its end-to-end platform democratizes automation creating benefit for all employees regardless of their title or technical background.

That's a significant advantage and it means UiPath can create more value for clients than traditional RPA solutions. For instance the company estimates simple automations could save the average employee 20 minutes per day. If an enterprise provisioned 10000 employees with software robots those simple automations could save the enterprise $30 million each year. That number gets much smaller if only a handful of employees can use the technology.

Research firm Gartner has recognized UiPath as the leader in the RPA market citing its ability to handle complex processes as a key differentiator. More recently research firm Forrester also noted UiPath's leadership citing a stronger current offering and a stronger growth strategy than any rival.

Financial performance

UiPath's best-in-class solution has helped the company win thousands of customers across a variety of industries. These include tech giants like Adobe Systems cybersecurity firms like CrowdStrike auto manufacturers like Toyota mobility companies like Uber and restaurants like Chipotle.

In fact the company had 7968 customers as of Jan. 31 2021 up from 2671 just two years earlier. Put another way UiPath's customer base has grown by 198% during that short time period. That has powered stellar top-line growth.

Metric 2019 2021 CAGR Revenue $148.5 million $607.6 million 102%

While UiPath is not currently profitable it did generate positive free cash flow of $26 million during fiscal 2021. That's a good sign suggesting that its business is self-sustaining. In other words the company won't need to issue debt or dilute shareholders to fund growth.

UiPath's net retention rate was 145% during 2021 indicating a 45% uptick in average customer spend. That speaks to its platform's stickiness; it's hard for clients to stop using it once they've started. In the coming years that should help UiPath continue to grow quickly.

The verdict

For investors it's important to understand how a company fits into an industry's competitive landscape. And while rivals like Microsoft are much larger than UiPath this tech company has still achieved a greater market presence. That's impressive.

However UiPath is a newly public company and the public spotlight can negatively impact a business from its culture to its financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to how UIPath handles this transition.

Given its sizable market opportunity solid competitive position and strong top-line growth UiPath looks like a long-term winner. Of course it's impossible to know exactly where a company will be in five years but I wouldn't be surprised if this growth stock doubled or tripled during that time period.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

Menerapkan gaya hidup berkelanjutan atau sustainable living bisa dilakukan di mana saja. Anda bahkan bisa memulainya dari dapur.

Salah satu cara membuat lingkungan lebih baik bisa dimulai dari sudut rumah satu ini. Dapur biasanya menyumbang banyak limbah makanan rumah tangga. Baik itu kemasannya atau makanan sisa yang tak muat lagi di perut Anda hingga akhirnya terbuang.

Bertepatan dengan Hari Lingkungan Hidup Sedunia sebaiknya Anda juga ikut berkontribusi menciptakan bumi yang lebih sehat. Berikut beberapa langkahnya.

- Efisiensi kulkas

Menurut Science Daily kulkas melepaskan clorofluorocarbon(CFC) zat yang bisa merusak lapisan ozon dan membuat bumi makin panas. Satu kulkas yang rusak bisa melepaskan lebih dari 100 gram CFC ke lingkungan.

Efisiensi kulkas termasuk tidak sering buka-tutup kulkas untuk hal yang tidak diperlukan. Membuka kulkas terlalu sering juga berisiko membuat kulkas semakin cepat rusak karena ada perbedaan udara di dalam dan luar kulkas.

- Menghabiskan bahan di kulkas

Belanja bulanan terkadang membuat siapa pun kalap. Membeli banyak bahan makanan untuk persediaan memang baik tapi jika tidak digunakan maka bahan makanan tersebut hanya akan jadi limbah di tempat sampah.

Ketahui apa yang ada di lemari es Anda dan gunakan sebelum tanggal kadaluarsa. Langkah ini juga bisa menghemat pengeluaran bulanan.

- Menghemat energi memasak

Memasak dalam jumlah banyak menggunakan microwave oven dan kompor listrik bisa sangat menguras energi.

Salah satu kunci hidup ramah lingkungan adalah dengan mengurangi penggunaan energi termasuk energi listrik. Dapur Anda mungkin berkontribusi besar pada tagihan listrik di rumah.

Coba untuk bijak mengelola penggunaan listrik di dapur.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL21ha2Fzc2FyLnRyaWJ1bm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMDYva2lzYWgtcnVtYWgtdGFuZ2dhLWNoaWthLXdhb2RlLXBlbWVyYW4tbWlybmEtaWthdGFuLWNpbnRhLWRpLWR1bmlhLW55YXRhLXRlcm55YXRhLXBlbnVoLWxpa2EtbGlrddIBkAFodHRwczovL21ha2Fzc2FyLnRyaWJ1bm5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzA2LzA2L2tpc2FoLXJ1bWFoLXRhbmdnYS1jaGlrYS13YW9kZS1wZW1lcmFuLW1pcm5hLWlrYXRhbi1jaW50YS1kaS1kdW5pYS1ueWF0YS10ZXJueWF0YS1wZW51aC1saWthLWxpa3U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kisah Rumah Tangga Chika Waode Pemeran Mirna Ikatan Cinta di Dunia Nyata Ternyata Penuh Lika Liku,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://makassar.tribunnews.com/2021/06/06/kisah-rumah-tangga-chika-waode-pemeran-mirna-ikatan-cinta-di-dunia-nyata-ternyata-penuh-lika-liku on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL21ha2Fzc2FyLnRyaWJ1bm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMDYva2lzYWgtcnVtYWgtdGFuZ2dhLWNoaWthLXdhb2RlLXBlbWVyYW4tbWlybmEtaWthdGFuLWNpbnRhLWRpLWR1bmlhLW55YXRhLXRlcm55YXRhLXBlbnVoLWxpa2EtbGlrddIBkAFodHRwczovL21ha2Fzc2FyLnRyaWJ1bm5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzA2LzA2L2tpc2FoLXJ1bWFoLXRhbmdnYS1jaGlrYS13YW9kZS1wZW1lcmFuLW1pcm5hLWlrYXRhbi1jaW50YS1kaS1kdW5pYS1ueWF0YS10ZXJueWF0YS1wZW51aC1saWthLWxpa3U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8va3VtcGFyYW4uY29tL2NpbnRhLXJhaGFzaWEva2lzYWgtY2ludGEtc2lyLWxhbmNlbG90LWRhbi1yYXR1LWd1aW5ldmVyZS15YW5nLW1hbGFuZy1uYW4tbWVueWVkaWhrYW4tMXZ0NzNWVEpwc3DSAXxodHRwczovL20ua3VtcGFyYW4uY29tL2FtcC9jaW50YS1yYWhhc2lhL2tpc2FoLWNpbnRhLXNpci1sYW5jZWxvdC1kYW4tcmF0dS1ndWluZXZlcmUteWFuZy1tYWxhbmctbmFuLW1lbnllZGloa2FuLTF2dDczVlRKcHNw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kisah Cinta Sir Lancelot dan Ratu Guinevere yang Malang nan Menyedihkan - kumparan.com,Di masa lalu khususnya ketika era kerajaan berlangsung banyak sekali kisah percintaan yang inspiratif maupun menyedihkan.

hipotesa.id – Secara fisiologis air mata berfungsi membersihkan dan menyehatkan mata. Secara psikologis kebanyakan orang memandang bahwa mengucurkan air mata adalah pertanda kelemahan. Tapi sebenarnya ada tangisan dan cucuran air mata yang justru menjadi tanda kekuatan jiwa seseorang yaitu tangisannya karena cinta kepada Allah.



Air mata cinta kepada Allah ini dicurahkan ketika seseorang berdoa atau bermunajat dengan-Nya baik di dalam maupun di luar salat yakni ketika dia memohon agar kebutuhannya dipenuhi Allah.



Shadr al-Din al-Qabanci di dalam kitabnya Fi Rihab Du’a Abi Hamzah al-Tsumali (h. 61) mengatakan bahwa ada tiga jenis pendoa. Pertama pendoa penyegera. Kedua pendoa penyangka. Ketiga pendoa pencinta.



Pendoa jenis yang pertama adalah orang yang Allah telah menakdirkan baginya apa yang ia mohon tapi karena ia tidak tahu maka ia memohonnya.



Pendoa jenis yang kedua adalah orang Allah telah menakdirkan baginya apa yang ia mohon tapi Allah mensyaratkan hal itu akan dia peroleh kalau dia memohonnya dan dia pun mengira seperti itu maka dia memohonnya.



Baik dalam kondisi pertama atau kedua karena manusia tidak mengetahui takdir Allah maka dia harus berdoa untuk kebutuhannya. Begitu juga pendoa jenis yang ketiga. Akan tetapi pendoa jenis ketiga akan mendapatkan ganjaran yang luar biasa dari Allah.



Pendoa jenis ketiga yaitu pendoa pencinta adalah orang yang memohon kepada Allah semata-mata untuk mematuhi perintah-Nya. Allah Yang Mahakaya yang gudang kekayaan-Nya tiada batasnya Dia suka melihat hamba-Nya memohon dan menghinakan diri di hadapan-Nya.



Doa akan menjadi media untuk mencurahkan cinta kepada Allah ketika seseorang sadar bahwa Allah tidak membutuhkan doa dan penghambaan dirinya. Dia juga sadar bahwa dirinya tidak memiliki daya dan kuasa apa-apa. Bahkan keberadaan dirinya pun bukan miliknya.



Syariat membolehkan manusia untuk memohon apa saja kepada Allah. Dia boleh memohon kebutuhan dirinya sendiri atau orang lain kebutuhan yang sepele atau yang penting kebutuhan fisik atau spiritual kebutuhan duniawi atau ukhrawi. Namun bagi pendoa pencinta terikat dengan Allah adalah satu-satunya kebutuhannya.



Hal ini dapat kita teladani dari kisah Nabi Syu’aib yang senantiasa menangis saat membaca doa:



الهي أحب لقائك ورؤيتك ولا أريد شيئا ولقاؤك قرة عيني



Ilaahii uhibbu liqoo’aka wa ru’yata wa laa uriidu syay’aa wa liqoo’aka qurratu ‘aynii.



Artinya “Tuhanku aku mencintai perjumpaan dengan-Mu dan melihat-Mu dan aku tidak menginginkan apa pun. Perjumpaan dengan-Mu adalah pelipur mataku.”



Balasan atas cinta Nabi Syu’aib as tersebut adalah Allah SWT menjadikan salah seorang nabi-Nya yang mulia yaitu Nabi Musa as untuk menjadi pembantunya.



Di dalam kitab ‘Ilal al-Syara’i’ diceritakan bahwa Nabi Syu’aib as menangis karena cinta kepada Allah hingga beliau buta. Allah mengembalikan penglihatannya. Lalu Nabi Syu’aib as menangis lagi hingga matanya buta. Allah mengembalikan penglihatannya. Lalu Nabi Syu’aib as menangis lagi hingga matanya buta. Allah mengembalikan penglihatannya lagi.



Ketika untuk yang keempat kalinya Allah mewahyukan “Wahai Syu’aib sampai kapan engkau selalu begini? Jika ini karena engkau takut akan neraka maka Aku menjamin dirimu selamat darinya. Jika karena engkau rindu kepada surga Aku menjamin engkau akan memasukinya.”



Nabi Syu’aib as berkata “Tuhanku Tuanku Engkau tahu bahwa aku tidak menangis karena takut akan neraka-Mu atau rindu kepada surga-Mu tapi karena cinta kepada-Mu telah tersimpul di hatiku sehingga aku tidak sabar untuk melihat-Mu.”



Maka Allah SWT mewahyukan kepadanya “Jika demikian maka sebagai balasannya Aku akan menjadikan Musa bin Imran Kalim-Ku sebagai pembantumu.”



Kisah Nabi Musa as menjadi pembantu Nabi Syu’aib as dapat kita baca di dalam Al-Qur’an Surah al-Qashash: 21-29.



Berdasarkan teladan dari Nabi Syu’aib as ini maka tercurahnya air mata dari manusia yang serba butuh di hadapan Zat yang kasih sayang-Nya menjadi basis keberadaannya adalah bukti kematangan dan kekuatan jiwa.

We have started to see longer-running blade/ chassis servers get refreshed as the industry prepares for the next generation of components. Cisco like others is refreshing its chassis to offer more cloud management and higher-speed networking with higher-power components.

Cisco UCS X-Series Modular Server

The Cisco UCS X-Series is the company’s blade server that is 7U in height with eight slots. Since this is a blade chassis the concept is that one can upgrade nodes over time while retaining the ecological benefits of re-using power supplies fans and the chassis.

Something that is more modern with the UCS X-Series is that the enclosure uses a backplane-less design to connect the compute nodes to the network fabric. Here is a quick look at how that works.

Not having a backplane is important for a few reasons. First failed backplanes were immensely difficult to service since to get to them requires offlining multiple nodes then getting into a large chassis. Second older-generation blade solutions with backplanes were often limited by the PCB material and pins so that one could not upgrade to faster networking without replacing the backplane. At STH we were the first to go in-depth in our Dell EMC PowerEdge MX review. There we can see that Dell is doing the same thing. The reason for this trend is that while we have 100GbE as common today the future of 400GbE to the node is coming and removing the backplane for higher reliability and future upgradeability makes a lot of sense.

The first nodes are the dual 3rd gen Intel Xeon Scalable “Ice Lake” processor nodes. Each has two CPUs up to 6x 2.5″ HDD/ SSDs (including NVMe) and spaces for two VICs. Cisco also has a full set of DDR4 channels and Optane PMem 200 support on the nodes.

Cisco has its new VICs and includes an internal bridge between them which is something a bit more unique.

As one would imagine Cisco has a cloud management solution for the new blade servers.

Final Words

This is not going to be an inexpensive solution and that is perhaps Cisco’s biggest challenge. The UCS line has great engineering but the market has been moving towards lower-cost scale-out nodes. Cisco UCS is far from being known as a low-cost leader so it is really targeting higher-end enterprise and government deployments sitting alongside traditional Cisco networking infrastructure. While this is a solution targeted at Cisco’s current installed base it is still fun to see a new solution like this.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmFuZG9td2lyZS5jb20vdGhlLWZsYXNoLWNpc2Nvcy1leGl0LXdhcy1zdXBwb3NlZC10by1iZS1pbi1zZWFzb24tNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Flash: Cisco's Exit Was Supposed To Be In Season 4,"Featured Video

CW show “The Flash” is scheduled to bid farewell to one of its most fan-favourite characters Cisco Ramon. He was a significant member of Team Flash providing advanced tech support and inventions. Whenever things got more intense Cisco also accompanied Flash to the field as the Vibe. Throughout seven seasons he has won many hearts with his exuberance and light-hearted comedy. Therefore it’s not surprising that his exit comes as heartbreak to many of us. Recently actor Carlos Valdes who plays Cisco revealed that he had been planning to leave the show since Season 4.

During one of his latest interviews Carlos said “It’s been a long time actually. Doing this kind of show with the sort of commitment that comes with it happened very fast and I think that at the time I was in a place where I was still figuring out my life. And right around Season 4 I started debating what the end for this character might look like”. He added “So that seed was always there but it didn’t start becoming a reality until much later on — like the end of Season 5 Season 6 where I started to become more comfortable with the idea of ‘Oh I think there’s a good way to put an end to this chapter.”

Not just Carlos even Tom Cavanagh a recurring actor known for playing Harrison Wells from the multiverse is also scheduled to leave. Carols’ departure was recently announced in May. Now that we think about what Carlos had said a lot of episodes from past seasons pop up as his potential exit routes. Cisco deciding to give up his powers in Season 5 was a groundbreaking and life-altering moment for the character. Some of us did fear at the moment that it could be a cue for his departure. However the impending adieu is finally happening in “Good-Bye Vibrations” Episode 12 Season 7 on 8th June’2021.

Interestingly Ciscos’ debut in the Arrowverse was not on “The Flash” but “Arrow” Season 2 Episode 19 “The Man Under The Hood”. Cisco Ramon is an irreplaceable asset for Team Flash. But since life has to go on his role will be filled by Brandon McKnight’s Chester Runk. Actor Carlos has also added that his farewell will be less dramatic and emotional. He described his final moments on the series as a “very silly very goofy low-stakes departure.”

Snap said it would make this work public in hopes of encouraging collaboration across the industry.

Auditing its suppliers and using findings to create commitments to increase spend with diverse suppliers in Q4 2020. 2021 progress: Snap has made progress on its goals in the following ways: The company said it's on track to meet its representation goal of doubling the number of employees from underrepresented U.S. racial groups by 2025 and doubling the number of women in tech roles by 2023. The company set additional goals of increasing the number of employees from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups to 20% by 2025 women in tech roles to 25% by 2025 and increasing the number of people in leadership who identify as women or members of racial and ethnic minority groups by 30% by 2025.

A spokesperson confirmed its financial commitments to nonprofits had all been fulfilled. Other notable updates: TikTok said in its transparency report covering the last half of 2020 that after it changed its ""hate speech"" policy to cover ""hateful behavior"" the category accounts for 2% of videos it removed compared with 0.8% in the first half of the year.

Twitter

2020 commitment: Twitter said it would donate a Promoted Trend Spotlight to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture for a day about $1 million in pro bono premium ads to promote the museum's ""Talking About Race"" series. Twitter also created a $1 million fund to match employee donations to racial justice groups. The company said it would give $250000 in grants split between the Equal Justice Initiative and National Association of Black Journalists. It also said it would give $270000 in ad grants to 13 organizations to amplify Black voices on the platform. Twitter had stopped political campaign donations in 2018 but said it would donate a remaining $100000 to nonpartisan groups working on voter turnout and civic engagement in underrepresented communities. In fall 2020 Twitter launched the Finance Justice Fund with the Opportunity Finance Network with the goal of bringing $1 billion in capital from corporate and philanthropic partners to underserved U.S. communities. Twitter committed $100 million to the fund for the long-term below market rate loans a $1 million grant and ongoing support. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey also the chief executive of Square committed to donating $3 million to the Know Your Rights Camp. 2021 progress: Twitter said it allocated the $1 million pro bono ads promised to the National Museum of African American History and Culture's ""Talking About Race"" series. Its employees donated $800000 to 99 organizations between June and December that it matched for a total of $1.6 million. The $200000 left over in Twitter's $1 million match fund goes back to the match budget to use on other campaigns and causes throughout the year a spokesperson confirmed. The company said it's made its grant donation to the Equal Justice Initiative and National Association of Black Journalists. It also said it ultimately allocated $500000 in ad grants to nonprofit groups dedicated to fighting for racial justice nearly double the amount it initially pledged. Twitter said the Finance Justice Fund it launched with the Opportunity Finance Network has committed $15.5 million in financing and issued $625000 in grants. The company also confirmed it had donated the $100000 commitment to nonpartisan groups working to expand civic engagement. Of its $100 million Finance Justice Fund a Twitter spokesperson confirmed the company had so far made announced loans for five community development financial institutions. Other notable updates: Twitter created a new compensation program for leaders of internal Business Resource Groups. It also said that beginning this year it will determine executive team compensation in part by participation in diversity and inclusion efforts and work toward meeting workforce representation targets.

Uber

2020 commitment: Uber said it would donate $1 million total to the Center for Policing Equity and the Equal Justice Initiative. The company said it would use its Uber Eats platform to highlight Black-owned businesses and eliminate delivery fees from those restaurants for the remainder of 2020. It also said it would offer discounted rides to Black-owned businesses impacted by Covid-19. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reaffirmed Uber's commitment to being transparent about internal diversity and said it would expand opportunities for its gig workers through education opportunities and skills training. In July Uber outlined several commitments to becoming an anti-racist company: Continuing to enforce its community guidelines prohibiting racist behavior.

Creating anti-racism and unconscious bias training for drivers and riders in consultation with experts.

Training customer support agents in bias and discrimination and making it easier to report these issues through the apps.

Creating a new role to lead inclusivity and accessibility product design.

Investing $10 million to support Black-owned businesses over two years through promotions and other features.

Continuing to highlight Black-owned restaurants beyond the 2020 $0 delivery promotion.

Doubling its spend with Black-owned suppliers. 2021 progress: In May Khosrowshahi provided an update on the commitments in a blog post: Uber said it's developing new anti-racism training for drivers and riders with the help of experts and said it launched its first pilot in Brazil.

The company added a standalone option in the app to report racism and discrimination and improved processes to handle such incidents.

Uber hired its first Inclusive Design Lead Erica Ellis. It said it would create more roles to support the work.

It launched a Fairness Research Team to measure the impact of pricing matching and safety products on underserved communities. It also expanded its Fairness Working Group to include lawyers data scientists product managers policy experts and members of Uber's employee resource groups.

Uber expanded its Career Prep fellowship program to accept applicants at universities in Brazil and Canada. Fellows gain an individual mentor from Uber's engineering team throughout 2021 with a guaranteed opportunity to interview for a full-time or internship role.

Uber said that in 2020 women at the company earned $1 for every $1 earned by men in similar job functions. Employees from underrepresented racial backgrounds also earned $1 for every $1 earned by non-underrepresented peers at the same job level.

Uber implemented dedicated time for executive talent acquisition teams to build a diverse pipeline of talent for leadership roles. It also added the Mansfield Rule committing to interview a pool of candidates matching or exceeding market supply for diversity. It created the Uber Executive Networking program to build relationships between Uber's leaders and female Black and Latino executives outside of the company.

Uber said it will begin to offer inclusive management and cross-cultural competency training to the first 2000 people managers in June 2021.

Uber said it achieved 50% diverse representation in its mid-level career development program that gives workers skills to grow into senior leadership roles.

The company invested $50 million in support of minority and underserved communities through a $25 million commitment to the MDI Keeper's Fund and $25 million of unrestricted cash via deposits to qualifying MDIs.

Uber said it saw 3.5 million $0 delivery fee trips take place last year as part of its program to support Black-owned businesses. It said it will continue to take steps to highlight Black-owned businesses. Other notable updates: Uber tied executive compensation to its diversity and inclusion metrics in 2019 and is now expanding that model to introduce D&I objectives for the top 50 leaders across the company. — CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

The Phillies’ grounds crew scrambled like an Indianapolis 500 pit crew to fix it. They eventually did. It took 20 minutes 21 seconds from the time the netting hit the warning track to the time Phillies left-hander Cristopher Sánchez threw a 2-1 pitch to Trea Turner to resume play.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9waGlsbGllcy9waGlsbGllcy1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5hdGlvbi10aHJlc2hvbGQtbWxiLWNpdGl6ZW5zLWJhbmstcGFyay0yMDIxMDYwNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Citizens Bank Park fully reopens to fans the Phillies haven't met MLB's COVID-19 vaccination threshold | Scott Lauber,"Phillies manager Joe Girardi and his coaching staff must continue to wear masks on the field and in the dugout according to MLB protocols for teams that haven't reached the 85% vaccination threshold. Read more

Say goodbye to seating capacity limits. Bid adieu to masking requirements for fully vaccinated fans. Signs of (mostly) normalcy will be everywhere this weekend at Citizens Bank Park.

Except for the Phillies’ dugout and clubhouse.

Most teams — 20 to be precise according to the most recent update from Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association — have reached the league-imposed 85% vaccination threshold that permits them to ease many of the COVID-19 protocols that limited their activities since before the start of last season. Two additional clubs have reached the 85% mark and will be considered fully vaccinated by this time next week.

The Phillies are not there yet and probably won’t be “any time soon” manager Joe Girardi said this week.

So as society reopens around them the Phillies must continue to adhere to a set of restrictions notably social distancing in the clubhouse masking for all non-players on the field and in the dugout and stringent rules on the road including not dining indoors at restaurants. Even card games in the clubhouse are verboten.

“Obviously you’d like to have more freedoms” said Girardi who is fully vaccinated. “I think we all would. I think we all get tired of wearing our mask in situations. I would like to go back to be able to go back to normal. But it’s not going to happen it looks any time soon for us unless Major League Baseball changes some of their protocols.”

It doesn’t seem like that’s going to happen either.

As the nation’s infection rate declines the commissioner’s office is consulting with medical experts and players union leadership about potential adjustments to the protocols. So far though there hasn’t been an inclination to ease up on teams that don’t reach the 85% threshold. After widespread outbreaks last year among the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals caused scheduling disruptions and threatened competitive integrity MLB is wary of letting down its guard too much.

And so Tier 1 personnel — defined as major-league and triple-A players managers coaches trainers and medical staff and some front-office members — are still receiving regularly scheduled COVID-19 testing. Through Friday MLB and the Players Association reported a total of 64 positive tests since the beginning of spring training (36 players and 28 staff from among 25 teams). But they also announced that 82.9% of all Tier 1 personnel were considered fully vaccinated and 85.2% had received at least their first dose of a vaccine.

Chicago Cubs president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer recently told reporters that it was “disappointing” that his team hadn’t reached the 85% mark. But the Phillies have maintained that vaccination is a personal decision.

Neither Girardi nor president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski is comfortable pushing players or staff to get vaccinated even as the team announced that it will offer two free tickets to fans 18 and older who get a free one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine at Citizens Bank Park during next week’s series against the Atlanta Braves.

Some players notably Phillies union representative Rhys Hoskins said they planned to get shots when they became eligible. Others including closer Héctor Neris expressed reservations or said they didn’t intend to get vaccinated. Dombrowski said the players did attend a group presentation before a game in Atlanta in April to learn more about the vaccines.

“That’s a personal choice and I can’t tell a player or a coach or whoever it might be in our traveling party that you have to get the shot” Girardi said. “I don’t have any frustration. I would say if there’s any frustration it’s that I’m vaccinated and that I’m outside and that I have to wear a mask. That would be my frustration.

“Because the CDC says if you’re vaccinated and you’re outside go have fun right? And as it gets hotter ... when it’s cold the mask ain’t so bad. But as it’s getting warmer you don’t really want to have it on.”

Indeed as cities across the country reopen there figures to be a natural temptation for players to want to be out and about. Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora whose team also hasn’t reached the 85% mark said recently that he worries about having to put players on the COVID-19 restricted list while they quarantine after violating protocol on the road.

Girardi doesn’t share that concern believing that the Phillies are disciplined in their behavior after living with the protocols since last summer.

But Hoyer and others contend that it’s a competitive advantage to reach 85% because it decreases the chances that players will be quarantined for contact tracing. The Phillies lost pitchers Matt Moore and José Alvarado for a week in April because they were in contact with someone who tested positive. Moore who said he’s vaccinated hasn’t regained his spot in the starting rotation.

Girardi said the restrictions don’t interfere with the Phillies’ game preparations. Although they must wear masks and maintain social distance during scouting meetings for pitchers and hitters they make do by convening in larger indoor spaces.

“The [batting] cage becomes a pretty big room” Girardi said. “It’s not how you want to do it but we’re able to do it.”

Unless the Phillies reach the 85% threshold it’s the way it will have to be.

Sure the auction items are a bit out of my price range but I still have a good time looking over the offerings and fantasizing about what it would be like to say feed giraffes with Andrew McCutchen.

For the second year in a row many of the offerings at the Phantastic Auction were virtual but that doesn’t mean there weren’t plenty of exciting items up for grabs. There were baseball lessons with star players valuable pieces of memorabilia and all sorts of fun experiences at Citizen’s Bank Park. And as tends to be the case with these things there were some pretty bizarre items available as well.

Now that the auction is officially closed (so that this neither comes across as a sponsored post nor an attempt to discourage people from donating to Phillies charities) I’ve decided to do a ranking of the five coolest and the five strangest Phantastic Auction items. Shout-out to The Good Phight’s former managing editor Liz Roscher whose Phillies “Anti-Gift Guide” inspired this post.

The Strangest Items

5. Phillies Alumni Aaron Rowand Crashes Your Virtual Business Meeting

“Imagine the look on your coworkers’ faces when Gold Glove Winner and MLB All-Star Aaron Rowand surprisingly joins your business meeting.”

Aaron Rowand was amazing for the Phillies in 2007 but fourteen years later I’m not sure I could pick him out of a lineup. “Imagine the look on your coworkers’ faces when a strange man they don’t recognize shows up at your business meeting” just doesn’t have the same ring to it.

Also why does it have to be a business meeting? That seems weirdly specific. I’d much rather have him at my virtual birthday party or something like that.

4. Phillies Game Face Player Cutouts Set / 1980 World Series Champions Phillies Game Face Cutouts Complete Set

These are the cutouts that sat in Citizen’s Bank Park last which is pretty cool. My main problem however is what on earth would you do with them? I’d be cool to have one or two cutouts of your favorite players but these just seem unnecessary. The 2020 set comes with 11 players and that’s already too many. No disrespect to Jay Bruce but I’d pay just as much for the set if he was just left out. The 1980 set is a little cooler because at least that was a good team but that set comes with 41 cutouts. Where would you put them??

3. 2020 Game-Used Baseballs Complete Set

“You are bidding on 31 individual baseballs one used from each game during the 2020 season.”

Well there were 60 games in the 2020 season so the above statement is just inaccurate. I guess it means one ball from each game at Citizen’s Bank Park? A “complete” set of balls from all home games during a shortened season just doesn’t seem that impressive to me especially since it was a forgettable season for the Phillies. And once again I wouldn’t even know what to do with all of them. I’d be pretty much just as happy with a single ball.

2. Phillies of the 2000s Autographed Hats Collection of 100

100 hats. 100. What?

Don’t get me wrong autographed hats are really cool and there are plenty of legendary players in this collection. But 100 hats is just absurd.

1. 2010 MLB All-Star Game Mickey Mouse and Phillies Statue

“2020 marked the 10-year anniversary of Roy Halladay Ryan Howard and Chase Utley representing the Phillies in Anaheim California during the 2010 MLB All Star Game. You are bidding on a one of kind item used from the 2010 All-Star Game festivities! This over 8-foot-tall Mickey Mouse Phillies statue was displayed proudly at Citizens Bank Park during the second half of the 2010 season as well as Angel Stadium during the 2010 All-Star Game celebration.”

Number one here was easy. It’s an 8-foot tall statue of Mickey Mouse. What in the world is this thing? And what in the world is that attempt to make it seem relevant to the Phillies?

The funniest thing about this item is that they won’t even deliver it to you – you have to come pick it up yourself. The current bid on it (as of this writing) is $15010.

The Coolest Items

It was a lot harder to narrow this down to just five items. While I mainly wrote this piece to talk about the strangest items in the auction most of the items are admittedly pretty darn cool. Plenty of great items didn’t make my top five like a private pitching session in the Phillies bullpen and batting practice at Citizen’s Bank Park. I almost picked the “Behind the Scenes” day with Sam Fuld just for confirmation that Fuld still exists and that he really is the GM but the top five I settled on speak for themselves.

5. Design Cleats to be Worn by Phillies Shortstop Didi Gregorius During MLB 2021 Players’ Weekend

“After the game has been played the winner will receive the game worn cleats.”

I would take any opportunity to interact with Didi Gregorius and this is a fun and unique idea. The only knock on this item is that I suppose it’s a little weird to own a grown man’s used shoes. But totally worth it in my opinion.

4. Phillies All-Star Catcher J.T. Realmuto Game-Used Catcher’s Gear

This is the coolest piece of memorabilia available. Signed bats and balls are cool but game-used catching gear is next level. If I owned this I think I’d probably just walk around the house in J.T.’s mask all the time.

3. Phillies Outfielder Andrew McCutchen Takes Over Your Social Media Accounts

Cool. Yes please.

2. Kid’s Virtual Hitting Lesson with Phillies Outfielder Bryce Harper

It was tough to choose between the different lessons offered (there’s also a catching lesson with J.T. Realmuto a pitching lesson with Aaron Nola and a workout with Alec Bohm) but my guess is that Bryce is probably the best teacher of the bunch. And I can totally pass as under 16 right?

1. Throw a Ceremonial First Pitch at Citizens Bank Park

Join the ranks of legends like Bruce Willis Questlove and Chase Utley as people to have thrown out the first pitch at CBP. Pretty cool.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYmlsbHlwZW5uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzA1L3Bob2VuaXgtdWx0aW1hdGUtYXVkbC1waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtZGlzYy1mcmlzYmVlLXNwb3J0cy1jb21wbGV4LWhvbWUtb3BlbmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ultimate frisbee shines in South Philly as Phoenix beat Tampa Bay in home opener,"💌 Love Philly? Sign up for the free Billy Penn newsletter to get everything you need to know about Philadelphia every day.

The Philadelphia Phoenix have arrived. At their Friday night home opener Philly’s professional ultimate frisbee team trampled over the Tampa Bay Cannons winning 21-16.

It was an appropriate grand entrance for the 2021 season which sees the Phoenix playing inside their namesake city for the first time. Home field is now the South Philly Super Site directly across the street from the sports complex.

Founded in 2013 the Phoenix is 1 of 22 teams in the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) which runs June through August and culminates in a championship weekend.

After some heavy afternoon thunderstorms the skies opened up to a beautiful spring evening paving the way for hundreds of spectators to pack the stadium. Fans of all ages sat in classic bleacher benches framed by the backdrop of Citizens Bank Park and Lincoln Financial Field.

Showing off in front of the home crowd the Phoenix played hard.

On the field team director of operations and starting player Mike Arcata was lead scorer with three points. New player Nate Little a Philadelphian scored the last point of the game among several other memorable plays.

Quick 101 on AUDL ultimate which is kind of like a cross between soccer basketball and American football:

The game is played on a field that’s 80 yards long bookended by 20-yard end zones. There are 7 players per team and the point is to make a catch in the opposing team’s end zone.

You can’t run with the disc in hand — once you stop you have to establish a pivot foot — so the frisbee must be passed from player to player. You also can’t hold onto the disc for more than 7 seconds.

Quarters are 12 minutes long with a 15-minute halftime.

The stakes are high at this week’s U.S. Women’s Open. But how high exactly?

Seven figure-high for starters. Contestants at the Olympic Club in San Francisco this week are playing for a $1000000 first prize. That makes the USWO the biggest first-place check of any of the five women’s majors.

One other LPGA event the CME Group Tour Championship also offers a million-dollar payday.

In total the U.S. Women’s Open is offering a $5.5 million purse. Sixty-six players made the cut including four amateurs.

Below you can find the prize money payout for each pro who made the weekend. The money that each amateur would have won has been redistributed across the rest of the field.

Each pro who made the field but missed the cut received $4000 in unofficial prize money.

The unique partnership brings the international company and technological non-profit together behind a clear objective: to stem the tide of plastic pollution entering the world’s oceans by first intercepting waste in rivers.

Partnering Coca-Cola’s scale and global network with The Ocean Cleanup’s technology and data solutions the initiative will help to expedite the deployment of cleanup systems across fifteen rivers around the world over the next 18 months including the introduction and implementation of The Ocean Cleanup’s semi-autonomous solar-powered Interceptor™ river cleanup solutions. It also aims to engage and mobilize both industry and individuals around the world to address plastic pollution eliminating plastic waste entering the world’s oceans and supporting ecosystems species and water resources.

“The Ocean Cleanup’s mission is to rid the oceans of plastic” said Boyan Slat Founder and CEO The Ocean Cleanup. “With 1000 rivers emitting nearly 80% of river-carried plastic into oceans this massive problem grows by the day which is why we are always looking to accelerate our progress. Among the waste we collect with our cleanup systems we find many plastic bottles including Coca-Cola packaging so I applaud them for being the first in the industry to join our mission as part of their wider actions to make a positive impact on worldwide plastic pollution. Our clear intent is to take our learnings from this partnership which has the potential to evolve in the future and continue to scale rapidly. That’s why I believe this is good news for our oceans.”

The Interceptor Solution

The Interceptor was unveiled in 2019 and is the first scalable solution to prevent plastic from entering the world’s oceans from rivers. It is 100% solar-powered extracts trash autonomously and is capable of operating in the majority of the world’s most polluting rivers.

Through the partnership The Ocean Cleanup together with Coca-Cola will tackle fifteen rivers by the end of 2022 with the two organizations working collaboratively towards their shared goal of eliminating waste. Two Interceptors included in this partnership have already been installed by The Ocean Cleanup in Santo Domingo the Dominican Republic and Can Tho Vietnam. For these rivers the partnership will help provide support in the development of waste management solutions for collected trash and the organizations plan to extend the footprint of the project across thirteen additional rivers.

The Ocean Cleanup brings demonstrated know-how with the experience and proven expertise in plastic-collecting technologies their deployment the issue and science of plastic pollution the data from their deployments and how to address it. Coca-Cola will support The Ocean Cleanup through its global network which includes operations in more than 200 countries and territories. It will provide support on the ground for the local community engagement needed to deploy new Interceptors as well as in the subsequent processing of the collected plastic via waste management expertise in support of a circular economy. The Ocean Cleanup and Coca-Cola will work together to secure the new partners and investment needed to continue to scale the enterprise through the roll-out of additional Interceptor solutions as well as to secure licensing support and deploy River Monitoring System (RMS) cameras to conduct further analysis of river pollution.

A World Without Waste

“As a global business we are working to ensure that all of the material we use in our packaging is collected and recycled so that none of it ends up as waste” said James Quincey Chairman and CEO The Coca-Cola Company. “We support The Ocean Cleanup teams and technologies that are working to protect ocean ecosystems in the journey to safeguard our waterways.”

The Coca-Cola Company is taking holistic actions to tackle the issue of plastic waste through its vision for a World Without Waste. There are three fundamental global goals: (1) make 100% of our packaging recyclable globally by 2025—and use at least 50% recycled material in packaging by 2030; (2) collect and recycle a bottle or can for each one sold by 2030; and (3) work together to support a healthy debris-free environment. Going further and faster where possible Coca-Cola is also investing in new technologies packaging materials and package-less innovations including new enhanced recycling ultra-light-weighting technologies and plant-based technologies as well as dispensed solutions. It recently set a goal that by 2025 depending on business growth it would use approximately 20% less virgin plastic derived from fossil fuels worldwide than it does today.

Tackling plastic waste requires action and thinking from the best and the brightest including civil society industry peers and the public sector. Accordingly The Coca-Cola Company has helped to establish or has joined global partnerships that will help to realize the vision for a World Without Waste. The collective goal is to encourage more people to recycle and reuse and more organizations to invest in the circular economy in which products and materials at the end of their useful life retain their value and are returned to the manufacturing process as part of a closed loop in which little if anything is wasted.

Brian Smith President and Chief Operating Officer The Coca-Cola Company said: “The Ocean Cleanup has a clear vision and proven technologies to support its goal to rid the world’s oceans of plastic. At Coca-Cola we have teams on the ground who will support the deployment of new Interceptors in rivers around the world as well as the processing and recycling of the waste collected. Working together we believe we can have real impact. That’s exciting: it’s something we know our employees in every corner of the world will get behind by helping to support the local implementation work and as ambassadors for the wider mission.”

About The Ocean Cleanup

The Ocean Cleanup develops advanced technologies to rid the world’s oceans of plastic. They aim to achieve this goal by taking a two-pronged approach: stemming the inflow via rivers and cleaning up what has already accumulated in the ocean. For the latter The Ocean Cleanup is developing large scale systems to efficiently concentrate the plastic for periodic removal. This plastic will then be used to create durable products and fund continued cleanup making cleanup itself circular. In 2019 the organization launched the other half of their solution the Interceptor™ to extract plastic in rivers before reaching the ocean. Founded in 2013 by Boyan Slat The Ocean Cleanup now employs approximately 95 engineers and researchers. The foundation is headquartered in Rotterdam the Netherlands.

The ban passed during a Board of Commissioners meeting on May 17 with a 3-2 vote as a direct response to Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey’s comments calling the voting law “unacceptable” and “a step backwards.”

Commissioner Ed Harris provided “TODAY” Digital with the copy of a letter he sent Quincey calling out the company’s “corporate political commentary favoring the Democratic party” and announcing the decision to remove Coca-Cola machines from government facilities.

“Our Board felt that was the best way to take a stand and express our disappointment in Coca-Cola’s actions which are not representative of most views of our citizens” he wrote. “Our Board hopes that other organizations across the country are taking similar stances against Coca-Cola and sincerely wishes that future marketing efforts and comments emanating from your company are more considerate of all your customers’ viewpoints.”

Quincey has been one of the many voices speaking out against Georgia’s new Republican-backed voting law which was enacted in response to the 2020 presidential election after former President Donald Trump lost the state by fewer than 12000 votes. Coca-Cola is headquartered in Atlanta Georgia.

“Voting is a foundational right in America and we have long championed efforts to make it easier to vote” Quincey wrote in a statement published on Coca-Cola’s website on April 1. “We want to be crystal clear and state unambiguously that we are disappointed in the outcome of the Georgia voting legislation. Throughout Georgia’s legislative session we provided feedback to members of both legislative chambers and political parties opposing measures in the bills that would diminish or deter access to voting.”

The new law lengthens the times for early voting in the general election but it also creates more obstacles for voters. Anyone who chooses to vote by an absentee ballot must show a driver’s license or state ID and barring that must submit additional proof of their identity. Also early voting drop boxes will be placed in early voting locations instead of in additional locations that might be more convenient for some voters such as local government buildings and libraries.

The legislation also strips authority from the secretary of state to oversee elections and instead creates a new chair of the State Election Board. In January Trump called Georgia’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger a Republican and asked him “to find” enough votes to help Trump in the state. Raffensperger pushed back and continued to do his job.

In the letter to Quincey Harris said the beverage company supports “the out-of-control cancel culture and bigoted leftist mob” when it chooses the social issues it wants to speak up about.

“Michael Jordan once said ‘Republicans buy sneakers too’ when asked why he didn’t make public comments about politics” Harris wrote. “Citizens of Surry County and across America are growing increasingly tired of large multinational corporations and their CEOs pushing an increasingly intolerant bigoted left-wing divisive political agenda on its customers.”

A spokesperson for Coca-Cola told “TODAY” Digital that the company is aware of the backlash in Surry County.

Imagine a simple town adorned with greenery so lush that it brightens the environment with clean air fit for human consumption striking a balance between the elements.

In many parts of the world the current situation is a far cry from this. About 13 million tonnes of the world’s plastic waste end up in oceans polluting the planet.

Plastic waste has been a major source of concern for environmentalist policymakers so much that the United Nations chief Antonio Guterres called on world leaders to declare states of “climate emergency” in their respective countries to spur action to prevent “catastrophic” global warming in December 2020.

Guterres’s comments were made during his opening statement at the Climate Ambition Summit a virtual gathering aimed at building momentum to ensure steeper cuts in planet-warming emissions on the fifth anniversary of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord which Nigeria ratified in 2019.

While Nigeria commits to the Paris Accord the reality back home suggests the work required to achieve the goals contained therein must be as meticulous.

Waterways are polluted by the indiscriminate dumping of plastic waste leading to flooding and threats to aquatic life. And with the recent COVID-19 pandemic there has been a large portion of disposable face masks face shields hand sanitiser containers rubber and plastic gloves and more along waterways and drainages.

A recent research study shows that 68 percent of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is indiscriminately dumped in Nigeria with 20.80 percent is disposed of through inappropriate landfill sites and 10.70 percent burnt.

Additionally according to Green House Gas (GHG) emissions inventory from 2000 to 2018 the contribution from inappropriate waste was 3 percent. This development is even more worrisome as this rate is expected to double within the next five years if preventive steps are not taken.

Nevertheless the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) made under the Paris Agreement embodies the country’s efforts to reduce national emissions and to adapt to the effects of climate change. It is also claimed that these efforts will pave way for a low carbon economy and result in about a 50 percent reduction in emissions.

While the projections in this case are optimistic it is evident that the government’s efforts in tackling Nigeria’s long-standing waste crisis require a significant level of support from corporate organisations that have global reach and expertise as well as developed policies and sustainability projects on sensitising the public about better practices to contribute to environmental and economic sustainability.

One of such companies that have shown an undeniable commitment to the cause is Coca-Cola whose track record of sustainability initiatives is extensive.

Over the years Coca-Cola has executed several community high-impact projects making a significant impact in communities where they do business especially as regards the environment.

Coca-Cola’s show of foresight echoes as far back as 1917 during World War I with the company’s participation in disaster relief efforts for decades in partnership with The Red Cross.

From contributing to sustaining humanity and the livelihood of people the company charged on to set up The Coca-Cola Foundation in 1984 ploughing back 1 percent of each previous year’s income annually to fund numerous social causes centred on women water waste and wellbeing through the foundation.

Since the establishment of the foundation a significant impact has been made in keeping the world’s water bodies cleaner and safer.

Worthy of note is Coca-Cola’s milestone completion of the 100 percent water replenishment drive five years before the planned completion date. One of such key initiatives was the partnership with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) started in 2007 which targets five focus points: conserving the seven important freshwater basins improving the company’s water efficiency reducing the company’s carbon footprint agricultural sustainability and inspiring others to take action.

To achieve the goals of the partnership the company plays the role of a ‘big brother’ by inviting others to join in the cause creating a sustainability loop that outlasts generations.

Two years later the company launched the definitive water stewardship programme – the Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN). Over the past decade RAIN has improved access to clean water for communities schools and clinics across 41 African countries enhanced access to hygiene and promoted better hygiene practices.

The programme has also enabled the economic empowerment of people by creating opportunities for employment entrepreneurship and skills acquisition. In addition RAIN has helped to protect critical watersheds supported several African utilities in coping with the rapidly growing water demand in cities and delivered essential hygiene items and personal protective equipment to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

RAIN involves the collective efforts of over 300 international and local public private and civil society partners who have implemented various projects across numerous vulnerable communities.

As of March 2021 a staggering 6 million people have been impacted more than 480000 women and girls have been empowered and over 454500 hectares of land have seen improved management.

In tandem with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) founded by the United Nations in 2015 and a considerable understanding that the onus to spark the desired change falls on the company Coca-Cola expertly created the World Without Waste programme to drive home the importance of plastic recycling and to create initiatives that trigger a whirlwind of efforts towards plastic recycling and environmental sustainability.

Coca-Cola’s World Without Waste vision seeks to ensure that 100 percent of its consumer packaging is recyclable by 2025 while targeting the collection and recycling of an equivalent of 100 percent of its primary packaging by 2030.

The company has sponsored and supported various projects geared towards proper waste management and infrastructure that supports environmental sustainability adopting a strategy focused on collaborations with local and specialised bodies to proffer solutions to improper waste management and its attendant implications.

To drive home its global mandate Coca-Cola Nigeria Limited along with its bottling partner Nigerian Bottling Company in 2005 pioneered a partnership with a recycling company called Alkem to solve the plastic waste challenge in Nigeria.

A total of 24 buy-back centres and over 1 billion PET bottles were recycled into fibre under this partnership from 2005 to 2012. Additionally more than 1800 direct and indirect jobs were created.

Another great milestone that has been recorded is the synergy with other committed top players in the industry such as Nigerian Breweries Seven-Up Bottling Company Nigerian Bottling Company Nestle Guinness Unilever among others to create the Food and Beverage Recycling Alliance (FBRA)–integrating efforts and expertise to build a sustainable recycling system for food and beverage waste and to combat the incessant littering of the environment.

In 2020 following the impact of COVID-19 Coca-Cola Nigeria partnered with a social benefit venture called RecyclePoints to launch a recycling programme called ‘Project Revive’.

The programme is a community-based recycling initiative to support low-income communities that have been hard-hit by the economic challenges of COVID-19 to earn a living while keeping their environment clean. The project has set up more than five buy-back centres within communities like Sangotedo Shomolu Lekki Ikorodu and Ojo amongst others.

Since its inauguration the scheme has attracted over 600 registered subscribers who have continuously earned a living while keeping their immediate community clean.

On the innovation front Coca-Cola launched an all-new clear packaging for its Sprite brand in November 2020 to strengthen its prospects for recycling. The new transparent PET bottle is a shift from its iconic green-coloured packaging and signals the company’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint across the world.

“We’re journeying to a World Without Waste which means more of our plastic packaging can be collected recycled and reused to make new bottles. For us at Coca-Cola clear is better and we’re working to slowly phase out our coloured packaging as clear bottles are easier to recycle” Nwamaka Onyemelukwe Coca-Cola Nigeria’s public affairs communications and sustainability director said.

Other eco-friendly initiatives funded through the company’s philanthropic arm The Coca-Cola Foundation in Nigeria includes the RESWAYE which recently concluded with over 159000kg of plastic waste removed from coastlines and shorelines in Lagos; RecyclesPay Cash 4 Trash Clean Up Naija Mission Zero Plastic Waste in the City Waste to Strap Waste to Wealth Project DORI amongst others.

For Coca-Cola’s commitment to championing sustainable living multiple awards and recognitions have been received. The company has received the Sustainability Enterprise and Responsibility (SERAS) Awards consistently since 2015 in diverse award categories for its unflinching drive for sustainability and its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.

The most recent being the Best Company in the Social Enterprise and Innovation categories (2020) and the Most Outstanding Social Impact Award (2021) in the just concluded Lagos Waste Forum to mention a few.

Coca-Cola has championed major sustainability initiatives by investing over $2.8 million recycling over 1.5 billion bottles and contributing directly and indirectly to the creation of over 2000 jobs across target countries.

The company has shown that sustainable environmental wellness can be achieved and has led by example. With concerted contributions from every individual company and relevant interest group clean and green earth is possible – a waste-free utopia come true."

The 28-year-old Fulmer hasn't appeared in a big league game since May 30 and the IL move was made retroactive to Thursday.

``We're very cognizant of his injury history and also just the difficulty in the pandemic year to this year'' manager A.J. Hinch said. ``And so we almost have to react this way in order to protect him and in order to protect us and give him a little blow. I mean that's really what we view this as.''

Detroit also activated right-hander Jose Urena from the 10-day IL and brought up right-hander Jason Foley from Triple-A Toledo. Urena pitched five innings of three-run ball during Sunday's 3-0 loss to the White Sox his first game since May 26.

``All in all being off for 10 days and just throwing a couple bullpens and not having a ton of activity as he was getting healthy I thought he gave us a nice outing'' Hinch said.

Urena had been sidelined by a strained right forearm. The Tigers cleared the way for his return when they optioned infielder Zack Short to Toledo following Saturday's 4-3 victory over Chicago.

Veteran outfielder JaCoby Jones was designated for assignment. He hit .170 in 36 games with the Tigers before he was optioned to Toledo on May 24.

Hinch said Jones could return to the organization if he clears waivers.

``Certainly for somebody that has been in the organization and has contributed in the organization it's been a difficult couple weeks for him'' Hinch said. ``But hopefully he'll bounce back play well and get back in the big leagues.''

The 30-year-old Fulmer was a starter for his first four seasons in the majors winning the AL Rookie of the Year award in 2016 and making the AL All-Star team in 2017. But he had been working out of the bullpen of late.

Fulmer is 3-1 with a 2.42 ERA in 16 relief appearances this year and 1-2 with a 4.97 ERA in four starts.

Fulmer who missed the 2019 season after he had Tommy John surgery pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings during a 6-2 victory over the Yankees on May 30.

The Tigers had planned to give Fulmer a break after the Yankees series and then get him going again while the team was in Chicago. But Fulmer said Saturday he wasn't feeling well according to Hinch.

``We had nothing to be alarmed about at the beginning of the week and now we're putting him on the injured list at the end of the week'' Hinch said. ``That's a tough turn of events.''

The 25-year-old Foley made his major league debut when he pitched a scoreless sixth inning in the series finale against the White Sox. He hit two batters but he escaped the jam when Tim Anderson bounced to first.

``I thought he handled the situation the best he could'' Hinch said. ``He woke up this morning a big leaguer for the first time and then he gets in the game. It was a good environment today. It's still a close game we needed him to put up a zero and he did.''

The hard-throwing Foley had no record and a 3.60 ERA in nine appearances at Toledo this year. He signed with Detroit in 2016 as an undrafted free agent out of Sacred Heart University. He missed the 2018 season after he had Tommy John surgery.

``It's always a dream of I'm sure all these guys and mine too to play in the big leagues. So it's kind of like whatever obstacle's put in front of you you try to go through'' Foley said before the game. ``It was definitely a tough battle but I just never gave up and always kept working hard.''"

NASA’s replay

How did it go?

CRS-22 is a Commercial Resupply Service mission that arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) on June 5 2021. SpaceX was awarded this mission by NASA in 2016 and launched it on its Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket using a Cargo Dragon 2 C209-1. The rocket lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This mission marked the second flight for SpaceX under NASA’s CRS Phase 2 contract.

CRS-22

The ISS is a lab like no other so are dozens of new experiments that were delivered there by SpaceX’s Dragon. Moreover this mission brought new solar arrays to the ISS and deployed a sole ELaNa 36 CubeSat.

Research Payloads

Water Bears

Tardigrades – AKA water bears or moss piglets – are the first known animals that could tolerate extreme environments such as enormous radiation hard vacuum and the strong solar UV radiation of space. Thus these micro-creatures (fully grown water bears are only 0.5 mm (0.02 in) long) represent a valuable model for studying the mechanisms of stress tolerance. After receiving them at the ISS the crew will conduct experiments that could provide a better understanding of the stress factors affecting humans in space.

Butterfly IQ Ultrasound

Butterfly IQ Ultrasound is a portable ultrasound device designed to be used by the crew without the assistance of physicians. This technology is very timely since it can provide comprehensive diagnostic capability on missions beyond low-Earth orbits (LEO). As an example the average distance between Earth and Mars is estimated at 225 million km. That means that communications delay between the crew and Earth can be between 4 and 22 minutes. Thus immediate ground support will not be possible. This is why the developed instrument might come in handy in some urgent situations on long-term spaceflights. The crew at the ISS will evaluate its performance and give feedback on the ease of handling and quality of the ultrasound images.

Bobtail Squids

Another animal model that joined the crew is bobtail squids. These species are a part of the Understanding of Microgravity on Animal-Microbe Interactions (UMAMI) project. It is well known that beneficial microbes play a crucial role in maintaining healthy immune and digestive systems. However their interactions with animal hosts in microgravity are not fully understood. UMAMI will study these relationships using the bobtail squid and its bacteria.

Pilote

Pilote is a project developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES). The crew will use virtual reality to test the remote operation of robotic arms and space vehicles. This could help to further improve and optimize workstations.

A 3D Kidney Cell Model

A 3D kidney cell model or a tissue chip will be used to study the formation of microcrystals that eventually can lead to kidney stones. In the labs on Earth it is hard to reproduce the environment found in the kidneys. This is because at 1g those microcrystals will easily sink to the bottom of the tissue chip. Microgravity in turn creates conditions in which they remain evenly suspended in the kidney chip tubes. This provides better observation of the processes and more relevant data to design new treatments for both astronauts and everyday people on Earth.

Cotton Plants

The CRS-22 mission brought to the crew not only animals but also some plants. The Targeting Improved Cotton Through On-orbit Cultivation (TICTOC) program will study the influence of the root system on plant functions that are crucial for their survival. Among them are stress resistance and water- and nutrient-use efficiency. Overall this project will evaluate which factors and genes control cotton roots development in space. This could help to develop cotton varieties that require less water and pesticides for normal growth.

Another exciting experiment that was delivered to the ISS is a Colgate-Palmolive project. This is the first-ever private sector oral care experiment that will be conducted in a microgravity environment. It is designed to learn more about the growth and metabolism of the bacteria that can have an impact on both oral and overall health.

ISS Roll Out Solar Arrays (iROSA)

On this mission SpaceX’s Dragon delivered two of six new solar arrays to the ISS. These new panels were provided by the companies Boeing Spectrolab and Deployable Space Systems (DSS). Currently there are four pairs of solar arrays at the ISS the first of which was deployed in 2000. Although they are still functioning quite well some signs of degradation started to appear. This is not surprising since they were only designed for a 15-years life service which means that the first two arrays have already exceeded their lifespan.

The new roll-out solar arrays (iROSA) were delivered in the trunk of SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft and will be installed in front of the current ones shading a little over half of their length. Prior to the installation of each one of them an additional spacewalk is required to prepare the worksite.

ELaNa 36 CubeSat

Among the payload in the Dragon spacecraft was a sole CubeSat that will be deployed under the ELaNa 36 (Educational Launch of Nanosatellites) program. RamSat a small research satellite was developed by Robertsville Middle School in Oak Ridge Tennessee.

ELaNa is an initiative that was proposed by NASA and is managed by the Launch Services Program (LSP) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. The main aim of this program is to collaborate with universities all across the US to design manufacture and launch research satellites into space. ELaNa brings university students closer to real space missions giving them opportunities to dive in and to get involved in the process from A to Z from designing and assembling CubeSats to launching and operating them.

CRS-22 Mission Profile

The CRS-22 mission launched on June 3 2021 from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At T+00:01:15 the Falcon 9 has passed through Max Q with propulsion continuing nominally. Then nine Merlin 1D engines on the rocket’s first stage shut down followed by successful Stage 1 separation and Stage 2 ignition. After separation the first stage performed a flip maneuver and a few seconds later a partial boostback burn to slow itself down for re-entry. From there at T+00:06:00 the booster executed a re-entry burn supported by the ignition of three Merlin 1D engines. Finally a landing burn ignited the center engine to slow the booster rapidly down just before landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship Of Course I Still Love You.

Dragon C209-1 separated from the second stage of the Falcon 9 Block 5 at T +00:12:00 after launch. After that it performed a series of thruster firings to adjust its orbit and reach the ISS. The spacecraft arrived at the ISS at 5:09 am EDT (9:09 am UTC) on Saturday June 5. Dragon autonomously docked to the ISS’ Harmony module. The two Flight Engineers Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur monitored docking operations. Upon Dragon’s arrival the crew proceeded with unloading the cargo.

Dragon C209-1 will spend more than a month at the ISS. Its mission will end in July 2021. After that the spacecraft will travel back to Earth and will splash down under parachutes in the Atlantic ocean returning research and cargo to Earth. The following CRS missions are going to last longer – around 3 months.

What is Falcon 9 Block 5?

SpaceX’s Falcon 9 Block 5 is a medium-lift launch vehicle that stands out among others for its partial reusability. By re-flying boosters and fairings SpaceX not only cuts down the cost of space access but also increases the reliability of the rocket. Block 5 is the final iteration of the Falcon 9 that is designed manufactured and operated by SpaceX.

The rocket consists of a reusable first stage an interstage and a second stage. Falcon 9 Block 5 can be flown with either a fairing or a Dragon spacecraft. On the CRS-22 mission the Cargo Dragon C209-1 was used to deliver research and other payloads to the ISS.

Falcon 9 Block 5 is about 70 meters (229.6 ft) in height and 3.7 meters (12 feet) in diameter. The vehicle’s structures are made of an aluminum-lithium alloy which results in a total dry mass of 549054 kg (1207920 lb). The rocket’s payload lift capacity to low-Earth orbit (LEO) is 22800 kg (50265 lb).

First and Second Stage

First Stage Second Stage Engine 9 Merlin 1D engines 1 vacuum optimized Merlin engine Thrust Per Engine 845 kN (190000 Ib f ) sea level

934 kN (209971 Ib f ) vacuum 992 kN (223100 lb f ) Specific Impulse (ISP) 285 s sea level

313 s vacuum 348 s

The Falcon 9’s first stage is composed of aluminum-lithium alloy tanks for propellants and four landing legs which are stowed at the base and deploy just before landing. This stage is powered by nine sea-level Merlin 1D engines. The second stage also consists of tanks for propellants and is powered by a single vacuum optimized Merlin engine or MVac. The main difference between these two variations of the Merlin engine is that the latter has an expanded nozzle that results in improved performance in near-vacuum conditions. The second stage is what carried Dragon to its intended orbit allowing the spacecraft to rendezvous with the ISS.

The Merlin engine runs on rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) and liquid oxygen (LOx) and uses a gas generator cycle. Falcon 9 uses helium as a pressurant to backfill the propellant tanks as RP-1 and LOx are being consumed by the engines during ascent.

The interstage connects the first and second stages of the vehicle and is responsible for their separation during flight. It also accommodates four hypersonic grid fins at the base. They help to orient the booster during re-entry.

The booster supporting this mission was B1067-1. The CRS-22 mission marked its first flight. This booster will be also used on the Crew-3 mission.

Cargo Dragon 2

The CRS-22 mission was the first mission to the ISS for Cargo Dragon C209-1. This is the second Cargo Dragon 2 produced by SpaceX. It i s 8.1 m (26.6 ft in) in height and 3.7 meters (12 feet) in diameter. Compared to the original Cargo Dragon the upgraded spacecraft can automatically dock to the ISS. The old version had to be manually berthed by the Canadarm2.

The Cargo Dragon 2 shares a similar design with the Crew Dragon intended to carry astronauts to the ISS and back to Earth. However there are some differences. The Cargo Dragon 2 does not have SuperDraco abort engines nor a life support system since there will be no human passengers on board. In the pressurized section the seats and crew displays had been swapped for cargo racks. The environmental control system had been also reduced both in size and complexity.

Overall the CRS-22 mission’s success criteria were the successful deployment of the Cargo Dragon 2 to the dedicated orbit its docking to the ISS and recovery of the B1067-1 booster. All of them were met on this mission.",,,,,,,,,

One of these skyscrapers is the Bell Atlantic Tower at 1717 Arch Street now known as Three Logan Square. Designed by designed by Kling Lindquist the building stands at an imposing height of 739 feet and 55 stories. The all-steel structure was constructed by Turner Construction. The skyscraper located in the Logan Square neighborhood of Center City has a notable presence both during day and night as the cladding features an eye-catching mix of colors as well as incredible nighttime lighting.

The unique building stands blocks away from the three pointed towers to the south – One Liberty Place Two Liberty Place and Mellon Bank Center. The tower was announced at the very beginning of 1987 and the started construction in the same year with steel rising above ground by the summer of 1988. The steel rose at a rapid pace with the tower topping out on February 23 1989. At the time the cladding was halfway up the building. The cladding reached the top of the tower by the very end of 1989.

The tower has stood out noticeably in the skyline for nearly two decades as the red granite cladding makes for a look distinct unique from the nearby skyscrapers. In 2006 the Comcast Center was rising out of the ground to eventually be topped by the next summer blocking the Bell Atlantic Tower from the south. Flash forward to over a decade later and now two Comcast towers greatly block the tower from view with only glimpses visible from the south. Still the building looks at its best during sunrise and sunset as when it is engulfed in sunlight that brings out the tower’s color.

She’d hoped to get a job as a social worker but no one was hiring so she moved back home with her parents and took a position as a nanny while she planned her next move.

Hess decided to become more environmentally conscious an interest she had developed in college. She began cutting up old T-shirts to substitute for paper towels switched from liquid shampoo to a shampoo bar and conducted a trash audit to see how much food the family was throwing away.

Searching the internet for more ideas Hess noticed that businesses called “re-filleries” were starting to pop up around the country. They reduce packaging waste by allowing customers to bring their own jars jugs and plastic tubs and fill them with bulk cleaning supplies and personal care products.

A Google search didn’t turn up any such businesses within a sixty-mile radius of Ann Arbor so Hess decided to start a pop-up version to test customer interest.

She connected with Sue Whitmarsh owner of Breathe Yoga in Chelsea on Facebook and held her first pop-up at Whitmarsh’s studio.

After eight months of events in May Hess opened BYOC Co. in Liberty Square (the name means “bring your own container”). “I had a bigger dream and I wanted to do a storefront” Hess says.

She is the sole investor using savings she accumulated during her days as a professional child actress from 2011 to 2014. As “Emma-Lee Hess” she had roles in three movies and spent her eighth-grade year in Los Angeles hoping to launch a career.

“I really wanted to pursue the TV aspect of it but there was so much rejection out there and I guess I wanted to do something where I would be rewarded” Hess told Chip Mundy for the Michigan High School Athletic Association website Second Half in 2015. “I wanted people to know my name in acting and because it wasn’t happening at the pace that I wanted I decided to focus on something else so volleyball became my motivation.” Back in Chelsea she was a standout player for the Bulldogs.

At BYOC her products include shampoo and shampoo bars conditioner shower gel dishwashing powder all-purpose cleaner Castile soap (which can be turned into the liquid kind by adding water) and hand soap whose length can be cut to order.

Customers are encouraged to bring their own clean containers but they don’t actually fill them. That’s done by a staff member to minimize spillage and contamination. “We don’t want to spend all day sanitizing pumps” Hess says.

A sixteen-ounce bottle of shampoo costs between $14 and $16 depending on the style while dishwashing soap costs about 45 cents an ounce or roughly $7 for a size similar to what is sold in grocery stores.

Higher-priced items include reusable menstrual cups which substitute for tampons at $34.99 and countertop compost bins at $40.

There’s been some concern about the risk of refilleries spreading bacteria between customers’ containers and the items for sale. Hess doesn’t think that will be a problem since staff fill the containers and the store won’t fill any items that look dirty.

“We’re taking every measure we can to avoid contamination” she says.

In her first weeks Hess saw more browsers than customers. “A lot of people who come into the store don’t buy anything” she said in early May. “They’re trying to learn and assess what they have at home.

“They tell me ‘I’ll use up what I have and be back in a couple of weeks.'”

Hess is still nannying while she figures out how brisk business will be. She’s continuing to hold pop-ups elsewhere and hosting vendor pop-ups and other events in the store on weekends (the schedule is posted on her website).

She isn’t aiming for a chain of BYOCs but now envisions a career in a sustainability field. “I know there are many more people we can reach” she says.

BYOC Co. 255 E. Liberty ste. 215. (734) 709-4222. Mon. Wed. Fri. & Sat. 10 a.m.-6 p.m.; Thurs. 4-8 p.m.; Sun. 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Closed Tues. byocco.com

“Just a note on the sustainable products story” Linda Wood wrote in response to our June Marketplace Changes story about BYOC Co. which lets customers reduce container waste by refilling them with bulk cleaning and personal care products. Owner Ella Hess said she began doing pop-ups last year after an internet search turned up no other “re-filleries” within sixty miles.

Disney’s “Cruella” was third with $11.2 million domestically and “Spirit Untamed” took in $6.2 million for the fourth spot in its opening weekend. “Cruella” has had $43.6 million in total domestically Comcast said.

“Raya and the Last Dragon” another Disney film was fifth for the week with $1.3 million and $53.5 million since its opening.

The third installment of “The Conjuring” – and the first not directed by James Wan – reportedly had the biggest opening of an R-rated movie in the pandemic era. After a strong Memorial Day weekend and several big name movies being released the industry is hoping its in the midst of a post-pandemic rebound.

The movie industry was ravaged by the pandemic restrictions and major studios grew gun shy about releasing moves during the height of the coronavirus shutdown last year.

Even as restrictions have eased studios have opted to release movies simultaneously onto big screens and on streaming platforms. That was the case with the latest “Conjuring” which was available on HBO Max over the weekend.

As of last weekend there were 4332 theaters open in North America or 75 percent of the number compared to the same time in 2019 Comcast said. At the start of the year that number was only 2227 or 41 percent.

Sparks fly over Stuy Town power plants plan

BY THE VILLAGE SUN | Adding two new power plants to provide heat at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village might not be such a hot idea tenants say.

The tenants association at the sprawling East Side development will hold a rally against the plan on Sun. June 6 at 10 a.m. on Avenue C between 15th and 16th Sts.

Local politicians expected to attend include Congressmember Carolyn Maloney state Senator Brad Hoylman Assemblymember Harvey Epstein Councilmember Keith Powers and possibly others.

The matter concerns two combined heat and power or CHP plants one on Avenue C that has been built but is not yet operational and one in the planning stages for E. 20th St. east of First Ave.

Since the area south of E. 14th St. may be affected by emissions from both plants the Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village T.A. wants to alert neighbors about the projects and get them involved as well.

The Avenue C plant has been mostly completed but Beam Living the complex’s management company does not have permission to make it operational yet. Beam hopes to build another bigger plant under one of Stuy Town’s garages on E. 20th St.

The T.A.’s concerns include that the plants would add to the area’s already existing air pollution plus would burn natural gas a fossil fuel.

In addition as the T.A. tells it while the new plants would generate both electricity and steam the electricity would be sent to Con Ed — and yet the utility would not reduce its own electrical output as a result.

Currently STPCV purchases both electricity and steam from Con Ed. Electricity except for air conditioning is included in tenants’ rent.

To fuel the power plants Beam would buy natural gas from Con Ed. So under the plan by sending the complex’s self-generated electricity to Con Ed Beam Living would offset its operating costs.

Meanwhile according to the city’s Community Air Survey air quality in Community Boards 3 and 6 covering north and south of E. 14th St. respectively already is subpar while emergency room visits for children ages 5 to 17 are high. Seniors are also at risk due to deteriorating air quality tenants argue. Meanwhile according to the city’s Community Air Survey air quality in Community Boards 3 and 6 covering north and south of E. 14th St. respectively already is subpar while emergency room visits for children ages 5 to 17 are high. Seniors are also at risk due to deteriorating air quality tenants argue.

There is also concern that the power plants’ chimneys as designed would not be high enough leading to potential “downwashing” of pollution onto parks and playground areas.

More to the point the tenants charge “CHP is not the way of the future.” Namely both the city and state have environmental mandates in place that will require reductions about the time the CHP equipment would run down. And again natural gas of course is a fossil fuel.

“We’d rather that the one on 20th St. wasn’t built at all” Anne Greenberg president of the STPCVA T.A. said of the power plants plan. “We’d rather that the one on Avenue C didn’t operate. But if it does it has to operate safely if that’s even possible given that it will be adding pollution.

“Beam Living’s self-congratulatory idea is that they are being green but Con Ed right across 14th St. will not be producing less energy — the amount that the CHP plant will produce” she said. “And there’s the zoning issue: Since the electricity is not being made available to tenants we hold that the plant is not accessory use and therefore doesn’t meet zoning requirements.”

The T.A. has posted its PowerPoint presentation and correspondence with government agencies on the issue on its Web site stpcvta.org.

However in a statement Nadeem Siddiqui the general manager of STPCV said the development already is a leader in sustainability and that the new power plants would only further this fact.

“The project will significantly reduce source greenhouse gas emissions and is part of our ongoing efforts to ensure Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village remains a model for best-in-class sustainability practices” he said.

“The STPCV community has benefited from $25 million in sustainability investments during our ownership including a switch to LED for 13000 light bulbs and installation of solar panels on all building roofs — which doubled Manhattan’s solar capacity and is equivalent to taking 12000 cars off the road annually.

“Stuy Town was the first residential LEED Platinum community and recently received an ‘A’ grade from New York City for building energy efficiency” Siddiqui added.

“This significant investment is our next step in community resilience and energy transformation to modernize our 74-year-old buildings” he asserted “and we are committed to keeping the community updated as we work through state and city approvals.”

According to Beam Living the project would reduce current greenhouse gases by an estimated 903 metric tons annually; the equivalent of 2.2 million miles driven by an average passenger vehicle.

Also according to Beam using co-generation to remove STPCV’s reliance on Con Ed steam would mean that in a power failure the buildings would retain steam for hot water. In addition Beam says this steam would be produced using 40 million gallons less water annually an 8 percent reduction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZXZncmlldmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvc3BlYWtpbmctb3V0LWFnYWluc3QtYW5vdGhlci1wb3dlci5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Speaking out against another power plant for Stuy Town-Peter Cooper Village,Have a story idea or tip about something happening in the East Village?

Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village residents want a cleaner way to power up.

The East Side apartment complex is known for constantly and consistently adding amenities for its 110 buildings and 11250 apartments for residents to enjoy including basketball and tennis courts two fitness facilities a café and more. However there is one new upcoming addition to the complex that some in the development are vehemently opposing.

On Sunday morning the Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village Tenant Association led a rally alongside fellow residents on Avenue C between 15th and 16th Streets to push back against two new fuel plants currently under construction.

A flood of elected officials Council Member Keith Powers Congress Member Carolyn Maloney Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer State Senator Brad Holyman and Assembly Member Harvey Epstein along with leaseholders gathered beneath the scaffolding that is currently being used to help erect one of the controversial facilities.

For the tenant association opposing the new fuel plants isn’t just about protecting the environment — but also the health and safety of the complex’s residents.

“These plants will have the potential to increase carbon dioxide and NOx” said Susan Steinberg president of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village Tenant Association. “Burning fossil fuel increases particle matter which lodges in people’s lungs and ozone and studies have shown that people who are exposed to high levels of these pollutants have health impacts — they have cardiac disease they have respiratory disease and they have cancer.”

The proposed plants are being erected in the shadow of the massive nearby Con Edison power plant. Residents argue that they will not only be sandwiched between three power stations but the two latest constructs will burn natural gas reduce air quality and add emissions which many children growing up in the area will breathe.

Attendees accused Blackstone — the property management — of putting profits before their residents’ lives.

“If you look across the street from us that is Con Edison that is our neighbor” said Powers who also lives in the community. “My neighbors have reached out to me with concerns of the emissions directly next to their window near their playground where their kids play in their community. These concerns include the negative health implications of living so close to these plants the potential harm to the environment and the precedent that would be set if we allow these to be built in a residentially zoned community.”

Powers shared that in 2018 management first announced their plans to create a combined heat and power (CHP) plant to be constructed between 245 and 271 Avenue C which would provide steam for 24 buildings in the complex.

According to the tenant association they claim the electricity generated would go back to Con Edison which they state would benefit the owners but not the tenants.

The elected officials expressed their concern on how the approval process for the construction occurred before the environmental review was conducted and concluded. Tenants and their representatives are requesting that the construction be placed on hold so that the plans can go under public review and have DOB audit the proposed plant.

A spokesman for Beam Living a company that manages the site for Blackstone says that no new construction is currently underway and that it will continue to comply with all state and local permitting requirements. The next steps include a public review process which they say will likely take place over the summer allowing for a formal engagement with the community.

Fran has lived in StuyTown for 24 years and is adjacent to the next proposed power plant. She says she lives in constant fear and anxiety for what is to come.

“This is wrong. This is about adding pollution upon pollution upon pollution” Fran said adding “This is about a big corporation adding green to their pockets and black in our lungs.”

In addition to the thousands of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village residents that will be affected by these plants Assembly member Harvey Epstein pointed out that other nearby community members such as NYCHA’s Pedro Albizu Compos Plaza will also bear the brunt of the health costs.

Holyman agreed having some harsh words for the management.

“We deserve better than this now. I don’t know maybe Blackstone should change their name to black lung because that is exactly what they are going to precipitate if they continue with this plan. Let me also say that as elected officials we’ve known very little about this project. We were informed at the last minute. There have not been the hearings that we need or the public discussion that we deserve.”

In response to the protest Nadeem Siddiqui general manager of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village provided amNewYork Metro with a statement:

“The project will significantly reduce source greenhouse gas emissions and is part of our ongoing efforts to ensure Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village remains a model for best-in-class sustainability practices. The STPCV community has benefited from $25 million in sustainability investments during our ownership including a switch to LED for 13000 lightbulbs and installation of solar panels on all building roofs – which doubled Manhattan’s solar capacity and is equivalent to taking twelve thousand cars off the road annually. Stuy Town was the first residential LEED Platinum Community and recently received an “A” grade from New York City for building energy efficiency. This significant investment is our next step in community resilience and energy transformation to modernize our 74-year-old buildings and we are committed to keeping the community updated as we work through state and city approvals.”

Siddiqui assured the project will remove the complex’s reliance on ConEd steam so that in the event of power failure the site will retain steam for hot water. He also states that the electricity and steam produced will only generate enough to service residents.

Siddiqui shared that the company is in the process of working with the required engineering studies and the appropriate environmental studies which will be published once approved. Additionally it was added that this project will be at no cost to the residents no additional noise will not impact greenspace and there will be no difference to the power heat or hot water within the apartments.",,,,,,

For one it’s a matter of supply and demand. With Connecticut so far north from the bourbon Mecca down south many consumers in the Constitution State have just now turned from whiskey drinkers into connoisseurs. Top bottles fly off of shelves. Tracking down the good stuff is difficult. Often this requires a pricy foray into the secondary market.

Which is why Conti’s talent for selecting single barrel store pick whiskeys has set his businesses apart.

The three locations under his brand’s umbrella vary greatly in size. Sav-Rite Liquors in North Haven contains 10000 sq. ft. of retail space. Greens Farms Spirit Shop in Westport is 2600 sq. ft. while Ye Old Wine Shoppe in Wallingford measures 1500.

Nevertheless each store boasts the same local reputation: they’re place to go for the best whiskeys around. Conti a longtime veteran of the alcohol industry helped introduce store picks into Connecticut when first he bought barrels of Four Roses in 2013.

Nick Conti and his three beverage alcohol retail stores in Connecticut under the Greens Farms brand have become the center of the state’s whiskey culture.

“I remember back then when you could buy all the barrels you wanted” he says with a laugh. He could have purchased eight to nine Four Roses barrels but was unsure how well they would sell. “I left with three. I put a couple in my stores and sold the rest to whiskey groups.”

The picks moved well enough to convince Conti that single barrel whiskeys had untapped potential.

“I began calling everybody about single barrels and what can we do” he says. “I called my friends at Buffalo Trace to see whether they had single barrels for sale. And sure enough they did.”

A Career in Alcohol

It helped that Conti had built up contacts during a career in beverage alcohol that had spanned multiple tiers of the industry.

Some of his earliest hands-on (or feets-on) experience was helping his grandfather make wine in Queens NY. Conti stomped grapes and assisted elsewhere in the homemade process.

Later he opened his first retail store at the age of 23 in 1996. Conti’s Wine & Spirits in Southington CT was 3600 sq. ft. Growing up in Southington in a family that loved wine Conti followed the same path taking WSET classes in Manhattan while running a wine-focused business in central Connecticut.

“My intent was to be all about wine” he says. “At first I had wanted to open up a bar in Boston but ended up coming home to Connecticut and opening up a liquor store.”

Add onto that raising a young family and Conti began to feel overstretched. In 2004 he sold his first business and took a sales position with Robert Mondavi Corp. Soon afterwards Constellation Brands bought the national wine brand and Conti began rising through the corporate ranks. He became sales director for New England for a division of the company.

Many rounds of corporate reorganization followed. Eventually Conti decided that he had had a good run with the company and eyed a return to retail. He purchased Sav-Rite with financial partners in 2011. “My partners are hands-off and really let me do my own thing” he says.

In 2018 Conti solely bought Greens Farms. In doing so he acquired a store with 50 years of celebrated local history. He opened Ye Old two years earlier.

Greens Farms Taps into Whiskey

Operating Greens Farms Sav-Rite and Ye Old afforded Conti an interesting window into the greater potential of American whiskey.

Greens Farms is located in Westport an upscale town in Connecticut’s Fairfield County part of the state’s famous Gold Coast. Ye Old and Sav-Rite are about an hour east more into the state’s middle-class south-central section.

Despite these different socioeconomic surroundings Conti noticed a similarity. No matter the neighborhood good whiskey did not last long on retail shelves .

“When I started seeing whiskey go out the door so quickly at all my locations that’s when I knew I had to get heavily into it” he says.

Greens Farms was already known as a Scotch destination. Conti began building up its bourbon selection as well. With top-brand whiskey distribution not the best in Connecticut he saw opportunity in single barrel picks.

“I honestly think they are more unique than any other product in any other category in the alcohol industry right now” he says. “These are one barrel from one level in one rickhouse. And they can be so different even from the barrel located directly beside it.”

“Single barrels can blow away the unicorn whiskeys” he adds. “And you have guys and girls on social media showing off the unique store pick whiskeys they bought. And they’re drinking these whiskeys with friends. You have people sharing whiskeys that they think are special with the people that they think are special.”

Indeed in Connecticut’s whiskey Facebook groups — like Connecticut Bourbon and Whiskey Enthusiasts  with 2200+ members — Conti’s picks are often posted as a point of pride. He has worked with more than 50 distilleries and this year will do more than 150 barrels.

Making the Pick

How does Conti single out such well-regarded whiskey selections? Naturally he spends a great deal of time sampling kits sent to him and regularly visits Kentucky and distilleries out of state.

When Conti launches a new pick it’s often the first time the brand is available in Connecticut as a single barrel. This is true for a wide variety of distilleries. To date Conti has worked with distilleries from the world of emerging craft producers — which Conti follows closely — to the leaders in American whiskey.

He delighted Connecticut whiskey nerds last year with the state’s first E.H. Taylor Single Barrel store pick. This bottle in the ultimate sign of praise now fetches a number on the secondary market multiple times its original retail price. On Facebook and Instagram  the EHT SiB is often brought up among the best picks in 2020 for Connecticut along with Conti’s equally well received Russell’s Reserve Weller Full Proof and Willett Family Estate 7yr Single Barrel Rye.

The winners arrive in a steady stream. So what does Conti look for in a whiskey?

“Trust your palate and don’t just buy a barrel to buy it” he says. “You will have to sample plenty of barrels before you find the one that fits your store. Very rarely do I visit a distillery with an agenda in mind. Be open to a barrel that sings to you .”

“I’m a big texture guy” he adds. “I want that mouthfeel that viscosity. I like sweet fruity profiles. Those are the ones I tend towards but I keep an open mind to things that are unique to that brand.”

Finding profiles that are right for your store — or intriguingly offbeat — inevitably takes time.

“You may have to pass on a number of picks and sampling kits before you find that right barrel” he says. “Don’t think the distilleries are holding out on you. And go to the distilleries every chance you can get. There’s nothing like becoming an ambassador of a brand yourself because you’ve been to that distillery and know what it’s like there.”

Visiting producers in person you are also more likely to come across a special barrel that is way off the brand’s usual profile.

“Something that’s off the mark that’s a luxury for someone like me who has been picking for a long time” Conti says. “You’re never sure how a consumer is going to react to it. But it’s always better if you can back it up with the knowledge and experience you have of the brand and your reputation with other picks.”

Among his recent releases is a WhistlePig 10 Year that tastes fruitier and less spicy than the rye’s typical profile. “Now a customer will want to put it next to a normal WhistlePig and compare the two” Conti says “and this increases my sales.”

One interesting strategy Conti employs is patience with his releases. Rather than put out new picks right away he will often sit on single barrel inventory for months and months. This is partly because of how much happens on the back end — applying all the stickers and wax that enhance the uniqueness of these bottles.

But it’s also more than that. His stores feature a nonstop flow of new picks with a specific pattern a beat and rhythm.

“I try to find the meaningfully right time to drop every pick” Conti explains. “It’s like making a mixtape. You’ll start off strong and then take it down a little bit and then build it back up. There’s nuance to it.”

“When you introduce something you need to think about what comes after it” he adds. “I lay out all of our releases as a calendar. I know more and more about what the reactions are going to be from the consumers.”

What’s Next for Greens Farms Whiskey?

For someone who helped usher the first wave of single barrels into Connecticut what does Conti see next for the category?

How about micro batches.

“I want to start blending together my own whiskeys” Conti says. “I want to take multiple single barrels and blend together my own stuff.”

“There’s a problem with the single barrel market” he adds. “A lot of barrels that should be used for blending instead become single barrels. Hopefully barrels like that don’t turn off consumers who are trying just that bottle.”

Conti believes that micro batches and blending for store picks will become more common.

“It’s essentially what Maker’s Mark is already doing with their single barrel program” he says. “Once more of the major players realize that retailers are open to it it will take off.”

Conti is known for the creative colorful stickers and wax on his store picks and sees this artful trend continuing.

“Waxing makes a single barrel even more unique” he says. “It makes a good purchase pop. Some bottles deserve wax and some don’t. But it’s one way to make a bottle stand out. Same with the novelty stickers. And that’s partly why I think single barrels are here to stay.”

He also believes that the attractive qualities of this category will eventually cross over into store pick beers rums malt whiskies and tequilas.

“Store picks give me the opportunity to make something unique to me at a relatively low cost” Conti says.

Like other retailers on the forefront of picks Conti is now exploring single barrel tequilas. And he’s “boomeranging” barrels across the border. “I sent some empty bourbon barrels that I picked down to Mexico to age tequila in” he says.

Other Retail Trends at Greens Farms

Greens Farms Sav-Rite and Ye Old sell more than whiskey of course. As with beverage alcohol retailers across the country these stores have recently seen the trend of consumers drinking less but better.

Wine shoppers reach more now for Burgundy and premium red blends Conti observes. Some pre-pandemic trends also remain true. Rosé is still hot along with lighter reds and sauvignon blanc.

“People are becoming more educated about wines” Conti says. “They’re starting to realize that just because a bottle says ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ on it doesn’t mean that wine is all cab.”

With more education comes comfort in making higher-end purchases. “People shopping wine are spending $5 more and trying new things” Conti notes. “I’m selling more $50 wines not $5 wines.”

Premiumization has also extended into beer with more adjunct releases. Sour remains a reliable niche  and still there are customers who ask for quality pilsners. The days of consumers chasing white whale beers however have seemingly ended.

Cutting into beer sales — and all categories except brown spirits — is the explosion of RTDs . Hard seltzer too has hardly cooled off .

But it’s not just White Claw and High Noon that customers buy. Beverage alcohol retail has come a long way since the pandemic first hit in 2020  when people panic-bought name brands in large formats. Now more than a year removed from those frightening first days of Covid Conti notices that consumers are “out trying and asking for new things again.”

And when your stores offer the most diverse and flavorful variety of single barrel picks around that puts you in excellent shape for continued growth ahead.",,,,,,,,,,,,

GRBs are thought to be the biggest explosions in the universe and now scientists have observed one closer than ever before leading to a surprise that challenges our understanding of the massive blasts that can also give birth to black holes.

NASA's Fermi and Swift satellites detected a gamma-ray burst in the direction of the constellation Eridanus on Aug. 29 2019. It was catalogued as GRB 190829A and almost immediately observatories around the world automatically shifted to collect more data on the cosmic event.

It turned out to be about a billion light-years away -- a comfortable distance to watch the very violent show but about 20 times closer to Earth than the typical GRB.

""We were really sitting in the front row when this gamma-ray burst happened"" said Andrew Taylor of the German research center Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron in a statement.

A GRB comes in two phases: an initial chaotic blast wave typically lasting less than a minute or so followed by a slowly fading afterglow that can remain observable for days. Taylor reports that the second phase of GRB 190829A could be observed ""for several days and to unprecedented gamma-ray energies.""

The record-breaking energetic radiation scientists observed is likely due to the relative nearness of the GRB.

Current understanding of GRBs has presumed that the X-rays and gamma rays observed from such bursts are produced by separate mechanisms involving different types of colliding particles (think a particle accelerator on Earth). However the data from this unprecedented GRB points to its X-ray and gamma ray components actually being a result of the same mechanism.

""It is rather unexpected"" says Dmitry Khangulyan from Rikkyo University in Tokyo.

Khangulyan and Taylor are among a number of co-authors on a paper about the find published Thursday in the journal Science. In the end the takeaway from the record-breaking observation is that there's more to learn and understand about GRBs.

""Looking to the future the prospects for the detection of gamma-ray bursts by next-generation instruments like the Cherenkov Telescope Array that is currently being built in the Chilean Andes and on the Canary Island of La Palma look promising"" said Stefan Wagner spokesperson for the High Energy Stereoscopic System a specialized observatory in Namibia that was used to study GRB 190829.

And of course hopefully future GRB detections will continue to be many millions if not billions of light-years away from Earth.

They are categorized into two distinct phases: an initial chaotic prompt phase lasting tens of seconds and a long-lasting smoothly fading afterglow phase.

Recently by using a specialized observatory in Namibia scientists have witnessed the most energetic radiation and the longest gamma-ray afterglow of a so-called gamma-ray burst (GRB) to date. The event dubbed GRB 190829A became one of the nearest gamma-ray bursts observed so far with a distance of about one billion light-years.

Fermi and Swift detected the event on 29 August 2019 in the constellation of Eridanus. Scientists then immediately captured the afterglow of the explosion when it became visible to the H.E.S.S. telescopes. This afterglow was visible for several days and to unprecedented gamma-ray energies.

Co-author Edna Ruiz-Velasco from the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg said “We could determine GRB 190829A’s spectrum up to an energy of 3.3 tera-electronvolts that’s about a trillion times as energetic as the photons of visible light. This is what’s so exceptional about this gamma-ray burst—it happened in our cosmic backyard where the very-high-energy photons were not absorbed in collisions with background light on their way to Earth as it happens over larger distances in the cosmos.”

After following the afterglow for more than three days scientists found surprising similarities between the X-ray and very-high-energy gamma-ray emission of the burst’s afterglow.

D.E.S.Y. scientist Sylvia Zhu one of the authors of the paper said “Established theories assume that separate mechanisms must produce the two emission components: the X-ray component originates from ultra-fast electrons that are reflected in the strong magnetic fields of the burst’s surroundings. This synchrotron” process is quite similar to how particle accelerators on Earth produce bright X-rays for scientific investigations.”

Existing theories suggest that electrons in gamma-ray bursts collide with synchrotron photons and boost them to gamma-ray energies in a process dubbed synchrotron self-Compton.

But GRB 190829A’s afterglow observations now show that both components X-ray and gamma-ray faded in sync. Also the gamma-ray spectrum matched an extrapolation of the X-ray spectrum. It means X-rays and very-high-energy gamma rays in this afterglow were produced by the same mechanism.

Co-author Dmitry Khangulyan from Rikkyo University in Tokyo said “It is rather unexpected to observe such remarkably similar spectral and temporal characteristics in the X-ray and very-high-energy gamma-ray energy bands if the emission in these two energy ranges had different origins. This poses a challenge for the synchrotron self-Compton origin of the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission.”

H.E.S.S. spokesperson Stefan Wagner from Landessternwarte Heidelberg said “Looking to the future the prospects for the detection of gamma-ray bursts by next-generation instruments like the Cherenkov Telescope Array that is currently being built in the Chilean Andes and on the Canary Island of La Palma look promising. The general abundance of gamma-ray bursts leads us to expect that regular detections in the very-high-energy band will become rather common helping us to understand their physics fully.”

Kuehne was 7-under over a 10-hole stretch in the middle of the round.

But Kuehne never wilted. In fact she matched the all-time U.S. Women's Open single-round scoring record shooting an 8-under-par 64 on Thursday and making it appear easy.

Kuehne hit 15 greens in regulation. She needed just 25 putts. At the last two holes she had birdie putts just graze the cup and if either or both of those drop look out.

""I played really solid"" said Kuehne who posted her first top-10 finish two weeks ago in Austin Texas followed by last week's victory at the Corning Classic. ""My goal today was just to hit a lot of fairways and give myself a lot of chances at birdie.

""I've been very confident coming into this week. I think the week in Texas in my home state gave me a lot of confidence coming into Corning. Corning gave me a lot of confidence coming into here.""

Kuehne's round took off with four straight birdies beginning at the sixth hole. She knocked a pitching wedge to 6 feet at No. 6 a 5-iron to 20 feet at No. 7 a 5-iron to 15 feet at the eighth and a sand wedge to 6 feet at the ninth to shoot 5-under 31 on the front.

She added three more birdies on the back nine with room for a couple more at Nos. 17 and 18.

The 64 was one shot off the U.S. Women's Open record set by Helen Alfredsson in 1994 at Indianwood Golf & Country Club in Lake Orion Mich. Alfredsson's mark came on a par-71 course however.

""Old Waverly is an incredible golf course and it's in amazing shape"" said Kuehne who leads by one stroke over Juli Inkster three over Moira Dunn and four over defending champion Se Ri Pak Dottie Pepper and Sherri Steinhauer. ""This is like our Masters. We don't have a Masters but the U.S. Open is the ultimate and premier event in women's golf.

""A lot of birdies are being made because the greens are absolutely perfect. You've got every opportunity to make birdie because the greens are in such great shape.""

Kuehne's game never looked so good but it's only been in the past three weeks that she's showed the form of her amateur past.

Kuehne won consecutive U.S. Women's Amateur titles following her U.S. Girls' Junior championship. Her brother Hank is the reigning U.S. Amateur champion.

After just a year-and-a-half of school at the University of Texas Kuehne turned pro in order to play with friend Tiger Woods at the 1996 JCPenney Classic.

Although she would have to wait nearly an entire year before she could even compete in the LPGA Tour Qualifying Tournament Nike signed her as did three other companies. Reportedly Kuehne is receiving more than $6 million over five years. And the deal was done before she even qualified for the tour.

""It's a business"" Kuehne said. ""This is what I do for a living. Do I think people enjoy me not doing well? I don't really worry about what other people think. I mean I've got to take care of myself.

""I wasn't given any special privileges. I went through Q-School like everyone else. I think people kind of cooled off once I did make it through.""

But then she struggled. Kuehne missed her first seven cuts. She finished 124th on the money list in 1998 meaning a return to Q-School where she missed the cut. Just two weeks ago she was 88th on the money list before her best LPGA finish a tie for seventh at the Philips Invitational. Her victory last week vaulted her to 15th and gave her a three-year exemption starting next year.

""Last year was a year of growing pains for me"" said Kuehne who had to qualify for the U.S. Women's Open two weeks ago. ""I don't know why the jump was so difficult but I had a hard time transitioning into professional golf. ... You get frustrated when you're struggling.""

She certainly has no regrets now.

""I wish I would have known where it's been"" Kuehne said. ""I just feel a whole lot more calm and comfortable being out here. I know where to go and where to eat and where to stay. I know which direction the golf holes go. And I don't have nearly the amount of pressure that I have put on myself in the past year.

""And I know that makes a huge difference.""

Commercial real estate developer Dick Anagnost of Anagnost Investments and The Landing at Nashua LLC are planning on resuscitating the large parcel at 2 East Spit Brook Road which has remained vacant for almost 20 years.

The site sits down East Spit Brook between Old Navy and a Gulf station.

“This proposed Costco Warehouse would be a relocation of the existing Costco that is currently in Nashua” Matt Bruton of BL Companies one of the engineering firms involved with the project told Nashua city planners in April. “They have outgrown that current location and are looking to create a new store to their current standards.”

Anagnost said when he acquired the land at 2 East Spit Brook Road in 2018 for $7.1 million there was no plan to move Costco there.

“When we originally purchased that land I didn’t have as much a plan as it was still contaminated” he said. “We’re the ones who got the Brownfields clean-up done and got the Brownsfields designation. I had to do that before I could figure out a development scheme.”

Previously Anagnost told The Telegraph that the parcel “was the last property of its size in that area – the last major parcel on Daniel Webster Highway in South Nashua.”

The proposal calls for a nearly 157000 square-foot Costco store 800 parking spaces a Costco gas station with nine fueling stations to accommodate 18 vehicles and a three-story True Storage facility.

Anagnost said the concept for that land has always been “twirling around in the back of my head” and he is a big proponent of commuter rail in the region.

“It’s very close to the Mass border” he said. “It’s only nine miles from the Lowell transit station for trains. And it has the side spur so I’ve always had the multi-modal kind of development idea there that would put the first train station in New Hampshire essentially just across the Nashua border.”

It’s built for it Anagnost said adding “I was building in my head a design around the train station.”

Costco did approach Anagnost at one point but the time schedule that they wanted was “too aggressive” for AI at the time. Later Costco’s schedule eased and they and Anagnost began negotiations again.

“They became the centerpiece of the development” he said.

Additionally developers said the site allows for restaurant with retail and office space.

Several years ago the former Hampshire Chemical site also the former W.R. Grace property was listed in a study as one of three possible commuter train stops if commuter rail returns to Nashua.

“As you can see this is a very large project” Fuss & O’Neill’s Brian Pratt told the planning board. F&O and another engineering firm.

Anagnost said that traffic issues have never been a problem with the new proposed location for Costco which is set down East Spit Brook road several hundred feet.

“No” he said “Everybody has welcomed us. There was concern about the size of signs among the neighbors but then they realized we’re 650 feet down the roadway.”

The only “neighbor” to raise a traffic concern was BJ’s Wholesale Club located down the DW near Lowes; BJ’s is planning on opening a members-only gas station on Allen Mello’s property located on Adventure Way.

“We have solutions to what they’re talking about” Anagnost said. “But other than that we’ve not had anybody talk to us to complain about traffic issues.”

In fact for anyone who’s tried to access Costco at their current location at 311 DW Highway address right next to Long’s Jewelers they know traffic congestion when they’re sitting in it.

“Actually our plan would alleviate a bunch of the problems at that intersection” Anagnost said. “When you take out the Costco what replaces it won’t be as traffic-heavy as Costo’s. So that intersection will become better.”

Anagnost said once they get city approvals within 30 days site work will begin. It will take six to seven months to complete that pushing the timeframe to January or February of 2022.

According to the plans on file at Nashua City Hall improvements that are proposed at the East Spit Brook Road and Daniel Webster Highway intersection will aim to increase vehicle capacity in that area and the project will also improve the municipal storm water system at the east end of East Spit Brook Road.

“This property has been vacant for over 15 years” Fuss & O’Neill senior project engineer Amy Sanders said. “The development of the gas station Costco Wholesale and the self-storage facility will increase the property value and promote future economic development including future pad sites and a municipal train station. This development will provide a strong economic community that will foster additional future development.”

Here's Why,"You Probably Shouldn't Buy Costco's Ground Coffee. Here's Why

If you're planning a trip to Costco then you're also probably planning a day to restock rearrange and reprioritize your pantry — that's just the name of the game. Like most warehouse stores everything at Costco is sold in bulk meaning that if you want to have it you better make some room — and coffee's no different. Most Kirkland Signature ground coffee items are sold in 2.5 or 3lb varieties meaning you'll have to clear some space for your caffeine addiction.

While it might make sense to grab a giant pack of toilet paper so you can skip last minute trips to the store or to fill the freezer with endless grab-and-go meals for the whole family Costco's coffee beans are another story.

Reviewers rave about the incredible cup of coffee they can make with Kirkland Signature ground coffee and it makes sense — according to Crazy Coffee Krave Costco offers both Starbucks-produced bags and 100% Colombian Supremo coffee. The Colombian blend is touted for its ""unparalleled flavor"" and Amazon reviewers agree. Some say that the finely ground coffee is ""tasty"" and ""bold"" which may be tempting enough to make you stock up. But bigger isn't always better and three whole pounds of this flavorful Costco brew may not go as far as you'd think.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jb3N0Y28td2hvbGVzYWxlLXN0b2NrLWJlbGlldmVkLWZhaXJseS0xNjAwMDgzODguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco Wholesale Stock Is Believed To Be Fairly Valued,"- By GF Value

One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Costco Wholesale is 8.7% which ranks better than 75% of the companies in the industry of Retail - Defensive. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 8.7% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Retail - Defensive.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Costco Wholesale's return on invested capital is 13.74 and its cost of capital is 4.87. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Costco Wholesale is shown below:

Please check the time stamp on the story to see when it was updated last.

Costco is one of America’s most beloved chain superstores—and for good reason! (Where else can you purchase diamonds buy in bulk at low prices and stock up on free samples?)

However as tempting as the warehouse deals may be nutritionists caution against buying certain foods in Costco’s deli section. Not only are these items high in calories but they can be major health hazards that cause cardiovascular issues later on in life. Yikes!

Make sure to avoid these common meats the next time you’re browsing in the cold-cuts aisle.

Salami

Most deli meats are loaded with extra sodium which can sabotage plans to slim down. According to the Scientific American “Eating a lot of salt can cause your body to retain more water which can show up on the scale as extra pounds.” Even worse? ”High salt diets appear to be linked to higher body fat—in particular the kind of fat that accumulates around your middle.”

Of these salty meats salami is one of the worst offenders. It's packed with sodium fat and preservatives like nitrates. According to kuudose Celeb Health & Wellness Expert Joey Thurman deli meats like salami become a huge problem when consumed along with other processed foods.

Instead Joey recommends that you pass on the salami and ""look for nitrate-free meats and ones that are freshly cut off of the slab."" Good tip!

Shutterstock

Turkey Wrap

While you're avoiding the salami pass on prepackaged sandwiches too.

Specifically Costco's turkey wraps are filled with the kind of fats and high sodium energy that you do not want in your life. ""The calorie count is ridiculously high for a wrap amounting to 830 calories and contains an astonishing 2230 milligrams of sodium"" says Health & Wellness Expert Erin Stone (of Hinterland Co).

Hmm. Keeping this advice in mind it may be a good idea to start brown-bagging your lunch using a healthier turkey alternative like Applegate Naturals Oven Roasted Turkey Breast and skipping pre-made sandwiches altogether.

Shutterstock

Honey Ham

Clearly some types of meat are better for you than others and Oscar Mayer's Deli Fresh Honey Ham is not one of them. According to its nutrition label the deli meat contains 460 milligrams of sodium including sodium phosphate-an ingredient whose high intake has been linked to higher rates of chronic kidney disease and weak bones. Consuming too much phosphate may even increase risk of heart disease. Noted!

To counteract phosphate intake and decrease chlosterol levels try incorporating foods like salmon oatmeal apples and beans into your diet.

Wow-we may never look at a deli counter the same way after this."

I am a big fan and love watching your show. I have an interesting vehicle that you may be interested to learn more about. I believe it is one of the better platforms to build an adventure vehicle. It's a 1988 Volkswagen LT 4x4 with a 2.4TD engine and Hurth axles with front and rear locking differentials. Earlier models used Dana 60s and much of the platform is very similar to older American trucks.

Advertisement

I was planning to do an engine swap to a 2.5TDI five-cylinder from an Audi A6. I will be putting adapters for installing 37-inch HMMWV tires to make a great offroad/all terrain rig/camper.

I've been curious about Cummins and their crate 2.8 engine which I believe would fit nicely inside the engine bay.

Would love to hear back from you

Thank you

Igor

Hi Igor

Thanks for the compliment. We are going to assume that you are talking about Four Wheeler TV with our pal Ian Johnson. Ian is a great guy and in person very down to earth just as he comes across on screen. Honestly he's pretty normal despite his spiked hair but the hair product is kind of like Clark Kent taking off his glasses in our experience. The unspiked-hair Ian is somewhat less bubbly than the spiked-hair Ian. We'd also like to give a shout-out to our pals Fred Williams and Dave Chapelle atDirt Every Dayfor what they do. They are both great guys too and between the three (if we toss Ian in the mix) there isn't much they can't handle in the off-road realm including a metric ton of irreverent and entertaining off-road tomfoolery.

Now to get back on to the topic of your question. We haven't heard much if anything about the Volkswagen LT 4x4 before which is odd since we are generally pretty obsessed with anything 4x4 even obscure overseas 4x4 vans maybe especially obscure overseas 4x4 vans. Still with a little research the Volkswagen LT 4x4 sure seems like a cool unit that is in fact ripe as a platform for an adventure vehicle assuming you can get one in the U.S. or North America or get any service parts. It seems like the VW LT was a unique front-engine rear-wheel work van design a larger and very different VW from the more common (in the U.S. ) VW 4x4 van the Synchro Van. The first-generation of LT built between 1975 and 1996 has a couple of different wheelbase options and a ton of different platforms from truck beds to full-on RV bodies although it doesn't seem like many 4x4 LTs were built. After 1996 the LT became a joint venture with Daimler Commercial sharing the body (but not the drivetrain or assembly) with the more familiar (in the U.S.) Sprinter van.

We totally dig the idea of using one of these rigs as a basis for an adventure build (if you can find one) but we would want to check out the availability of service parts wherever we planned to go first. The stout axles sound great assuming you can get parts fairly easily both here and internationally. Also we can't say we know much about swapping in the Audi 2.5L TDI. And honestly we're not sure these were ever offered in an A6 in the U.S.... that means getting parts will be difficult at best. Also you mention the Cummins R2.8 and after having built four Ultimate Adventure rigs using this engine we can soundly recommend that engine for a build like this. It is larger than almost any light-duty VW diesel and has a timing chain rather than the VW's timing belts. It's a refined yet industrial-strength turbodiesel. Two of the past four Ultimate Adventure rigs ended up being pretty heavy and despite that their large tires dual transfer cases one-ton axles and more all of the Cummins R2.8L-powered rigs we've driven and seen did great. The Ultimate International is one of the heavy ones and it easily does 75 on the highway and is as capable as any non-buggy-based 4x4.

The Cummins R2.8 with its 161 hp and 310 lb-ft of torque provides ample power on-road and off. You can use an AX-15 or NV3500 five-speed behind the R2.8 and a passel of automatic transmissions (including our preferred trans for this engine the ZF 8HP eight-speed auto). We'd opt for as many forward gears as you can get and our UA rigs with Offroad Design's dual transfer cases make for awesome gearing in many environments at just about any speed although one low range may be more than adequate for a larger adventure rig.

Lastly we'd also hate for someone—anyone—to spend more or almost as much rebuilding and refurbishing to install a used lesser diesel engine with the R2.8's $8150 price tag in mind. After all that's a complete engine package with starter accestories fuel system heck it even comes with fuel fittings and a fan belt (it will run in the crate but still needs adapters mounts and a charge air system) with a ton of conversion support and a two-year warranty from Cummins.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRyaXZpbmdsaW5lLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90aGUtc2xpY2tlc3QtZGllc2VsLXN0cmVldC10cnVja3MtZnJvbS11Y2MtMjAyMS1wYXJ0LTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Slickest Diesel Street Trucks From U.C.C. 2021 Part 1,"The Slickest Diesel Street Trucks From U.C.C. 2021 Part 1

Story By Mike McGlothlin

This just in: diesel pickups and Nitto tires are still an extremely popular combo. While taking in this year’s Ultimate Callout Challenge and DPI Expo we couldn’t help but notice all the diesel workhorses sitting on Nitto tread. From the Mud Grappler to the Ridge Grappler and Trail Grappler to the NT420V nearly every tire Nitto manufactures was well-represented—and we’ve got three street-bound examples to show you below. The first showcases the ultra-clean no-expenses-spared type of build: a well-executed dentside Ford with a compound turbocharged P-pumped 5.9L Cummins under the hood. The second—a second-generation 24-valve Cummins that also packs a pair of turbos—is a little more blue collar but still plenty showy. And the third candidate exemplifies what the average Joe might do: add a unique set of wheels and a few other cosmetic upgrades to his late-mode Super Duty which in this case is a nearly-blacked-out Excursion.

Stay tuned for the next edition which confirms the Mud Grappler isn’t losing any ground as the ultimate digging tool for big heavy diesels that compete in the dirt.

’79 F-250 Crew Cab

You’ve seen this beast on Driving Line before but that doesn’t mean this masterpiece sits in a climate-controlled shop under a dust cover. It definitely makes the rounds on the show truck circuit. We found Hunter Clark’s show-stopping dentside Ford on a dead-end street in the manufacturer’s midway—but it was front-and-center on the show ‘n shine judges’ minds. Hunter collected Best-In-Show honors and visual approval from virtually every show-goer that passed by it. Here you can see the BDS dual steering stabilizer with Fox Racing Performance Series 2.0 shocks mounted in front of the Super Duty-derived Dana 60 front axle.

Overhauled 12-Valve And Compound Turbos

Legendary Diesel Performance rebuilt the core 5.9L 12-valve Cummins Hunter brought them and the end result is one of the cleanest Cummins swaps you’ll find. The engine bay is subtly silver and black—and a compound turbo system from Diesel Power Source certainly makes things interesting. The DPS arrangement mounts an S300 over an S400 and was specifically designed as a Ford/Cummins swap kit. Each BorgWarner charger benefits from a Stainless Diesel turbo blanket which contains heat and helps drive them harder.

Trail Grapplers And 24’s

The modern big wheel craze is a very far cry from the small wheel/big rubber days that existed when this truck was in its youth but the 24x12-inch Fuel Off-Road FF75 forged wheels look right at home on Hunter’s dentside. His choice of Nitto Trail Grapplers (sized in LT375/40R24) gives the old Ford an aggressive stance and the M/T’s measure 36-inches in diameter. Don’t worry everything clears and nothing rubs thanks to an air spring suspension system built by Clark & Smith Fabrication which provides up to 10-inches of lift.

One Bad Black Second-Gen

If you’re biased toward regular cab trucks and VP44-fueled 24-valve 5.9L’s like we are this is the kind of everyman’s build you’ll enjoy. It belongs to YouTube sensation Greg Alberalla and while it may not be as polished as the best-in-show ’79 F-250 above it’s clean and well-done nonetheless. The de-badged bad-in-black second-gen Cummins is a six-speed manual too so now we really want it. We also like the low profile look the traction bars provide.

Side By Side Compounds

The truck’s stainless steel compound turbo arrangement was built by Evil Fab Performance and incorporates V-band connection points for holding big boost. We love that Greg decided to leave the raw look of the stainless piping well enough alone. This is a side-by-side style compound configuration also unlike the conventional over/under setups you typically see. The chargers were provided by Fleece Performance Engineering with one of its 63mm Holset HE351CW based turbos acting as the high-pressure unit (bolted to a T3 Steed Speed exhaust manifold) and an S475 serving as the atmosphere turbo. A Mishimoto drop-in replacement intercooler helps keep EGT in check and a Mishimoto radiator was added as well.

29-Inch 420V’s On 22’s

A small tire big wheel combination makes for very little sidewall but it does provide a pretty unique look. Greg’s 22x12 Specialty Forged wheels ride on 295/30R22 NT420V’s. And while this is a stretch fitment it’s nowhere near as over the top as some of the examples you see these days. Greg solved the wheel well gap he encountered at the factory ride height by cutting down the front coil springs and adding 2-inch drop shackles in the rear.

The Right Touch

It’s more of an Average Joe setup but we appreciate the subtle touches performed on this Ford Excursion. The blacked-out badging cowl hood aftermarket mesh grille and clear headlights make for a clean look and nice truck without the need to go big on performance. As these giant first-generation Super Duty-based SUV’s age it’s nice to know there are Excursions this clean still out there in the wild.

Unique 20’s On Hybrid Terrains

From 24’s to 22’s to now 20’s you can see that all of these diameters are still popular wheel choices in the diesel world. Whether you like the red clear coat on these satin black milled XD wheels it really sets the Excursion off. The 20x10 XD820 Grenade wheels ride on LT305/55R20 Nitto Ridge Grapplers which are equivalent to a 33x12.50 in size and also carry an F load range.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMS9kaW5lc2gta2FydGhpay1yZXZlYWxzLXBhdC1jdW1taW5zLWhpbXNlbGYtc2FpZC10aGF0LWhlLXdpbGwtbm90LWNvbWUtZm9yLWlwbC0yMDIxLWluLXVhZS0yNDU2OTQ50gGIAWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2lwbC0yMDIxL2RpbmVzaC1rYXJ0aGlrLXJldmVhbHMtcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtaGltc2VsZi1zYWlkLXRoYXQtaGUtd2lsbC1ub3QtY29tZS1mb3ItaXBsLTIwMjEtaW4tdWFlLTI0NTY5NDkvYW1wLzE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Dinesh Karthik Reveals Pat Cummins ""Himself Said That He Will Not Come"" For IPL 2021 In UAE","Last month the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had confirmed that the remainder of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021 season will be held in the United Arab Emirates ""considering the monsoon season in India in the months of September-October"". While this news brought much joy to IPL fans around the world many were left wondering about the participation of their favourite overseas stars. There has been a lot of speculation that many big names will be missing when IPL 2021 resumes in the UAE and on Friday Dinesh Karthik all but ruled out Kolkata Knight Riders' star pacer Pat Cummins.

The former KKR captain revealed that the Australian pace sensation has himself said ""that he will not come"". Karthik's comments will come as a big blow to a team which was languishing in seventh place in the IPL Points Table when the tournament had to be postponed.

""Pat Cummins has himself said that he will not come"" Karthik told TOI.

It's still unclear whether the England players will be allowed to participate in the tournament by their board but Karthik said he his ready to lead the KKR team if regular skipper Eoin Morgan doesn't turn up.

""But when it comes to Eoin Morgan there are still three months to go. A lot can change from now till September. But if I am asked to lead I will be ready for it"" said the wicketkeeper-batsman.

Numerous international stars especially those from Australia had to make a quick exit from India after the IPL 2021 was postponed after COVID-19 breached the IPL bio-bubble with several players and staff members across teams testing positive.

“When you look at the recent greats it is hard to look past Virat Kohli” Lee said when asked who his favourite Test batter is in an interview with ICC.

“What an incredible record he has got. He is only getting better with age. He has got a great mindset a great cricket brain as well” he added.

Kohli is currently the highest run-scorer among active cricketers in the world with more than 22000 international runs. The right-hander also has 70 international centuries to his name.

Kohli will next be seen in action in the World Test Championship final against New Zealand starting on June 18 in Southampton.

When asked about Kohli’s captaincy skills Lee referred him as a dynamic player and a great influencer to the team.

“Kohli he is such a dynamic player such a great influencer for the team world-class batter. We know that that's a given. But I think that with his emphasis on how important Test cricket is to him and his team and his nation it is going to weigh in very heavily on him and that will improve his performance. We know that Kohli steps up on the big occasions. And as you mentioned he wants to see his side be the first winners of the ICC World Test Championship. It means a lot to him. And I think that will be the talk. Once everything is said and done once the preparations are done when they arrive there when the quarantine is done just before they walk out I think that will be the last comment - Let us enjoy it but let us become the first side to ever to win this ICC World Test Championship!” he said.

Lee picked current Test No.1 bowler Cummins as the best among bowlers.

“My favourite bowler at the moment is probably Pat Cummins. You might think that I am biased being an Aussie or because he was a former teammate of mine but what I will say about Pat Cummins is that he is absolute quality” he said of the No.1 bowler on the ICC Test rankings.

“The skills he has got ... he has got a great technique. He has got a wonderful bag of tricks up the sleeve.

WASHINGTON DC — A trip to the Super Bowl an international vacation and a VIP package to the iHeartMedia Radio Music Festival could await people in Virginia and the District of Columbia who have received the coronavirus vaccine at a CVS Health pharmacy or plan to schedule theirs at a CVS before mid-July.

The pharmacy chain released its initial plans for its “#OneStepCloser sweepstakes” that began June 1 as a way to encourage vaccinations at CVS pharmacies across America. Thousands of winners will be selected in various drawings over a six-week period this summer the pharmacy said in a news release. The move is part of a growing push by states and companies to vaccinate Americans against the coronavirus. Maryland launched a COVID-19 vaccination campaign to entice residents to get their shot by offering a total of $2 million in cash prizes. Each day through July 3 the Maryland Lottery randomly awards $40000 to a vaccinated resident. Then on July 4 one winner will receive a cash prize of $400000.

CVS pharmacy locations across DC and Virginia offer the coronavirus vaccine. If you haven't yet received a COVID-19 vaccine you still can. Go here to see the CVS Health locations in your area and confirm that they offer coronavirus vaccines. Dr. Kyu Rhee a CVS chief medical officer said more than 17 million coronavirus vaccine doses have been administered at locations throughout the United States “but we have a long way to go.”

“Getting as much of the population fully vaccinated will bring us one step closer to all the things we’ve missed during the past 14 months and keep our country moving in the right direction” Rhee said in a statement. That direction for some winners of the sweepstakes will include a seven-day cruise for two on the Norwegian CruiseLine a trip to Bermuda or a two-night weekend getaway at a Wyndham hotel according to the sweepstakes’ description. CVS said it will also give away $500 in cash to 125 winners and $5000 to five.

The company said it is “working to close gaps in hesitancy” to inoculation citing a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey that shows 17.6 percent of adults are hesitant about the vaccines produced by Pfizer Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. CVS’ vaccination incentive effort is among the latest across the country to encourage people to get vaccinated for the coronavirus. In Ohio the state is offering $1 million to randomly selected residents who have received the vaccine.

Related On Patch: Everything You Need For An Amazing Memorial Day Weekend In California 10 vaccinated people will all get $1.5 million when selected on June 15. The Golden State is also offering $50000 in cash to 30 others earlier in June. Budweiser White Castle and Krispy Kreme are among other companies that have offered free items for vaccinated people.

Columbus Hy-Vee Pharmacy Manager Kara Johnson said some children 12 and older have already received the Pfizer vaccine at the Hy-Vee in town.

According to Hy-Vee's website minors must have parental or guardian consent to receive the Pfizer vaccine. Hy-Vee also asks that a parent or guardian accompany all minors to their vaccine appointments -- first and second dose.

Johnson said the Columbus Hy-Vee Pharmacy 3010 23rd St. is only offering the Pfizer vaccine.

""It has only been Pfizer here at our location"" Johnson said.

In Nebraska Hy-Vee locations are receiving doses of vaccine from the federal government through the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program along with Walmart CVS Health Walgreens and others.

In Columbus CVS Health and Walgreens are also offering the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine according to vaccines.gov which is a free federal website where users can search for vaccine locations.

""All children ages 12 – 15 are now eligible to receive the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine at CVS Pharmacy provided there is parental or legal guardian consent and the child is accompanied by an adult"" said a statement from CVS Health emailed to the Telegram on Friday by CVS Health Midwest Region Corporate Communications.

Similar guidelines are in place at Walgreens according to a statement emailed to the Telegram on Friday by a Walgreens corporate spokesperson.

""Parents or guardians can utilize Walgreens guest scheduling functionality to book an appointment for their children which is required for adolescents who are 12-years-old"" the Walgreens statement said. ""Adolescents ages 13 and older can make an appointment themselves.""

Those wanting to receive a Pfizer vaccine in Columbus should schedule using the appropriate online sign-up tool for Hy-Vee CVS Health or Walgreens each of which can be found on their respective websites.

Currently the Pfizer vaccine is approved for use on people 12-years-old and older in the United States. Right now it is the only COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. approved for minors or people younger than 18.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorsed the use of the Pfizer vaccine for people ages 12 and older on May 12 right after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized it for people ages 12 to 15 on May 10. Before that the FDA had already approved the Pfizer vaccine for those age 16 and older.

Columbus Community Hospital (CCH) and the East-Central District Health Department (ECDHD) are also providing COVID-19 vaccines in Columbus. Currently they are only offering Moderna.

""Good Neighbor/East-Central is not doing the Pfizer vaccines here. Our vaccines are Moderna"" ECDHD Communications Development and Marketing Director Julie McClure said.

Minors are not eligible to receive the Moderna vaccine which the FDA has only authorized for use on people 18 and older.

""ECDHD nor any of the hospitals within the jurisdiction have received Pfizer vaccine recently"" ECDHD Chief Public Health Officer Chuck Sepers said. ""CCH's first round of vaccines were Pfizer in December but never received another allocation.""

People can schedule a vaccine appointment at ECDHD in Columbus by registering online using Nebraska's vaccine sign-up portal vaccinate.ne.gov.

However Sepers noted that Federal Retail Pharmacy Partners like Hy-Vee are not required to use vaccinate.ne.gov. As such there is no guarantee that people will receive a Pfizer vaccine if they use vaccinate.ne.gov to sign up for an appointment in Columbus.

According to vaccines.gov the Columbus Walmart is offering Moderna. However as with the other Federal Retail Pharmacy Program participants people who want to receive a Moderna vaccine at the Walmart in Columbus may wish to use the scheduler on Walmart's website.

Benzene a known carcinogen was found in 78 of nearly 300 sprays and lotions tested — about 27% — including products sold by Banana Boat and CVS according to Valisure.

In a petition the company has asked the FDA to recall these contaminated batches. The regulating body is reviewing the claim.

""The FDA takes seriously any safety concerns raised about products we regulate including sunscreen"" the FDA told CBS News in a statement.

Sunscreens and after-sun classified as cosmetics are generally subject to FDA regulation.

The chemical is identified as ""a colorless or light-yellow liquid chemical at room temperature."" Valisure states that it's been used ""primarily as a solvent in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.""

Trace levels of benzene can be found in cigarette smoke gasoline glues adhesives cleaning products and paint strippers.

Valisure also reported that 14 sun care product lots with some of the highest contaminations are sold across four different popular brands — Neutrogena Sun Bum CVS Health and Fruit of the Earth. Not all of the aforementioned brands' products were found to contain benzene and lists of products found to contain and not to contain benzene are included further down the page in Valisure's petition form.

For example Neutrogena's Ultra Sheer Weightless Sunscreen Spray SPF 100+ and Ultra Sheer Weightless Sunscreen Spray SPF 70 were among 14 products Valisure claims have some of the highest levels of benzene tested. But products like Neutrogena's Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 and Oil-free Facial Moisturizer with Sunscreen SPF 15 were not found to contain the carcinogen.

All of the samples tested have ""contained up to three times the conditionally restricted FDA concentration limit of 2 parts per million"" of benzene according to Valisure's website.

David Light the founder and CEO of Valisure believes the issue is manufacturing contamination affecting specific batches. While the source of the contaminant is unknown and more of the products tested passed than failed Light urged manufacturers and consumers to take the matter seriously.

""Benzene is one of the most studied and concerning human carcinogens known to science. Its association with forming blood cancers in humans has been shown in numerous studies at trace levels of parts per million and below. The presence of this known human carcinogen in products widely recommended for the prevention of skin cancer and that are regularly used by adults and children is very troubling"" Light said in the company's statement.

He is also urging the FDA to better define its standards for contamination and ""address current regulatory gaps regarding benzene in both drug and cosmetic products.""

Valisure is encouraging people to send in their own samples of sunscreen and sun care products for evaluation.

The company also made their FDA petition public which includes a list of the batches with detected benzene levels. The products can be found on pages 12 to 15.

Johnson & Johnson the maker of Neutrogena products told CBS News that ""benzene is not an ingredient in any of our personal care products.""

The maker of Banana Boat defended its products as well stating that ""our sun care products undergo rigorous testing to ensure safety and quality and meet all FDA regulations.""

CVS said in a statement that products they sell are ""safe"" and ""we are in the process of reviewing and evaluating information in and related to Valisure's petition and we will respond accordingly.""

Sun Bum told CBS News in a statement ""To further ensure the quality of our products we will work with suppliers to understand how trace amounts may have been detected.""

However Valisure stressed to consumers that they should not avoid using sunscreen and should continue to do so.

""It is important for people especially heading into the summer months to understand that many sunscreen products tested by Valisure did not have benzene contamination and those products are presumably safe and should continue to be used along with appropriate hats and sun-protective clothing to mitigate skin cancer risk"" Dr. Christopher Bunick MD PhD Associate Professor of Dermatology at Yale University was quoted as saying in the company's press release.

Beyoncé and Jay-Z showed up to watch in their best courtside outfits and Queen B in particular really elevated the game day ensemble—something she has done many times before.

In a dazzling look styled by Zerina Akers Beyoncé turned the basketball game into her runway by wearing a leather mini dress and embellished sweater by David Koma. She then accessorized with Christian Louboutin pumps sparkling jewels and large shield-like sunglasses by Magda Butrym x Linda Farrow that may have offered a little bit of privacy if there hadn’t been a Jumbotron around. All together the look was ready for a red carpet or fashion show appearance but the fact that Beyoncé wore it nonchalantly to a game? It makes it all that more epic. In terms of flexing she clearly won.

Rob worked in the oil field as a farmhand and bred paint and quarter horses. He was a member of the American Quarter Horse Association and a founding member of the Flatlanders Motorcycle Club. He also served in the US Army.

Rob worked harder than the next guy and played harder than the next ten guys. He was a man of few words. He listened more than he talked but when he did speak it was something you wanted to listen to. He loved motorcycles arrowheads rock-and-roll music horses his John Deere 4020 tractor shade trees old westerns and family. He was not a complicated man but definitely one you wanted on your side. Rob never took himself too seriously and his sense of humor was not always evident at first but was appreciated by all who knew him well. He leaves behind a wealth of family friends and fond memories.

Rob is survived by his wife Frances Krantz; a son Chad Traub and wife Jennifer; and 2 grandsons Owen and Eli Traub all of Flora. He is also survived by a brother Bill Krantz of Farina; a sister Wanda McDowell and husband Ronnie of Tennessee; and several nieces and nephews.

The people who keep these planes flying are proud of their capable airlifter but it’s hard to show them off. Solution: build a scaled-down version more suitable for driving off base for a parade down Main Street and other community events.

While the real thing was built under an expensive and contentious military procurement process the miniature was built with volunteer labor using castoff materials. The volunteer force included maintenance crew whose job is to know the C-17 inside and out. Combined with fabrication skills that comes with the job the impressive baby plane faithfully copied many curvatures and details from full-sized originals. (Albeit with some alteration for its cartoony proportions.) Underneath are mechanicals from a retired John Deere Gator utility vehicle. They usually resemble a large golf cart except with a cargo bed and more rugged suspension. Basically they are to golf carts as a C-17 is to a 767. Amusingly the little plane has its own rear loading ramp superficially preserving the cargo-carrying capacity of the original Gator chassis.

Interior features continue though the official picture gallery doesn’t show them. There is a flight deck with control panels and various sights and sounds to keep visitors entertained. Enough details were poured into the exhibit that some people had to ask if the little plane can fly and the answer is a very definite no. The wings and the engine pods mounted to them are only for show carrying The Spirit of Hope Liberty & Freedom. It is quite a long official name for such a short stubby thing.

We always love to admire impressively put-together miniatures and not all projects require skill of aircraft mechanics. Like this very approachable miniature forklift project. But there are plenty of other projects whose skills put us in awe like this remote-control car powered by a miniature V-10 engine.

The small cargo aircraft has captured the hearts and awe of the internet particularly because of its reimagination as a small aircraft.

When people say or mention the C-17 or the latest issued C-17 Globemaster III it is thought of to be among the largest of aircraft in the world especially as it is intended for cargo and massive loads. Boeing's C-17 is a popular aircraft amongst the ranks of the US military as it is known to transport the various needs of the country to foreign destinations.

The US Air Force has been known to look into different pieces of technology for the advancement of its equipment and needs that it uses for its day-to-day basis. This includes the single-passenger 18-rotor flying car which would soon be a standard issue along with the soon debuting B-21 stealth bomber for its military needs.

USAF's 'Baby' C-17 a Mini Version That Took Over the Internet

However as much as the Air Force looks into new technology and massive equipment on its lineup it also has created a cute and adorable little version of the popular C-17 Globemaster III from Boeing. According to the 315th Airlift Wing a Mini C-17 or the Baby C-17 was created to commemorate the massive aircraft from the military.

Volunteers from the 315th Airlift and 437 Airlift Wings have fabricated this from several materials including that of a retired John Deere Gator Utility Task Vehicle (UTV) used by the US military. The baby C-17 now resides at Charleston Air Force Base and is intended to join military parades and other showcases to bring forth that of the C-17.

The original Boeing C-17 is massive enough to be parading on streets so this baby C-17 will be the perfect cargo plane to roll out on the streets and bring a scaled-down version of the aircraft to the public. What is more iconic is its rear loading ramp that has the capabilities to open and close much like the original version.

Can the Baby C-17 Fly?

The Baby C-17 was four years in the making and as much as it is a treat to see it is not functional and cannot fly particularly because it lacks the power and propulsion to do so. Since it is only coming from a utility and off-road vehicle its engine cannot sustain the need for a lift off the ground much so the added weight it has with the castings.

What the Baby C-17 can do is to serve as the mascot or replica of the Boeing C-17 and can run around the air and military base for soldiers to see and marvel upon. Most of the C-17's features can be seen in its mini version including the flight panel and cockpit the door-stairs on the side its wings and many more.

A passenger attempted to breach the cockpit of a Delta Air Lines flight from Los Angeles to Nashville on Friday forcing the plane to make an emergency stop in Albuquerque New Mexico according to officials.

The cockpit was never breached and the passenger was taken into federal custody Stephanie Kitts with the Albuquerque International Sunport told CNN.

The FBI confirmed via Twitter that it responded to the incident but added “There is no threat to the public at this time.”

A passenger on the flight who spoke to CNN said the man “seemingly unprovoked just got up and rushed the pilot’s cabin and began banging on the doors.”

Grace Chalmers said the man was quickly taken down by another passenger who was then assisted by the cabin crew. She said he was held to the ground for about 20 minutes until the pilots could land the plane at the Albuquerque International Sunport.

Video taken by Chalmers shows the man barefoot and bound at the wrists and ankles being pulled from the jet. He can be heard quietly but repeatedly saying “Stop this plane.”

Passengers were kept in Albuquerque for hours while Delta made arrangements for them to continue to Nashville.

“We’ve all been able to relax” Chalmers said by phone from the Albuquerque airport “but I would say in the moment it was extremely stressful.”

In a statement Delta praised the passengers and crew on board Flight 386. “The aircraft landed without incident and the passenger was removed by law enforcement” the statement said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vdmlkZW9zL3RyYXZlbC9haXJsaW5lLW5ld3MvMjAyMS8wNi8wNS9kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtZmxpZ2h0LWF0dGVuZGFudHMtZGV0YWluLXVucnVseS1wYXNzZW5nZXIvNzU2MDI1NDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines flight attendants detain 'unruly' passenger,"Delta Air Lines flight forced to divert after 'unruly' passenger is detained on board

The ‘time capsule’ was discovered after demand picked up so much the Atlanta-based airline decided to reactivate the plane.

First Officer Chris Dennis attached the note to the tray table of ship 3009 on March 23 2020 after parking it amongst row upon row of other Delta planes at Victorville airport in Southern California – the famed desert plane boneyard that has been the new home to hundreds of surplus planes from airlines around the world.

Chris picked up the trip from Minneapolis–Saint Paul International to Victorville just as the pandemic was first decimating the airline industry and at first he didn’t realize that the flight was to put the aircraft into long-term storage. “It wasn’t until we were on final approach headed in for landing when it hit me” Dennis explains.

“The VCV instructions noted to go behind a ‘follow-me vehicle’ that brings you to a parking spot. As we crossed the runway: Delta aircraft. It’s hard to fathom how many aircraft Delta has until you see that many of them parked in one place.”

“I thought about how many people’s jobs rely on just one of those airplanes” Dennis said. “From the Reservations agent to the ticket agent to the pilot flight attendants mechanics the ramp crew. Then you go a level deeper: the rental car agency the hotels the tourism companies.”

Ship 3009 was scheduled to be parked for 14-days. But 435 days later on June 1 2021 a different Delta pilot First Officer Nick Perez dropped the tray table and found the message that Chris had left.

“Hey pilots – It’s March 23rd and we just arrived from MSP. Very chilling to see so much of our fleet here in the desert. If you are here to pick it up then the light must be at the end of the tunnel. Amazing how fast it changed. Have a safe flight bringing it out of storage!” the message read.

Not that ship 3009 was left alone all that time. Engineers had to pay it regular visits and during its stay in long-term storage engineers ‘borrowed’ some parts for other planes in service – in fact 120 different parts in total were loaned to other aircraft during its stay in the desert.

Ship 3009 might now be out of longterm storage but there are still plenty of aircraft stuck in desert awaiting demand to pick up still further – mostly international travel which is still heavily impacted by continuing travel restrictions."

The artificial intelligence (AI) platform aims to prevent financial crime and enable secure collaboration among financial institutions while helping to protect privacy and secure data.

Why it Matters

According to the United Nations between 2-5% of gross domestic product (GDP) is laundered globally every year which amounts to $800 billion – $2 trillion. Recognizing the need to move beyond a manual and fragmented monitoring system Consilient built an intelligent collaborative and always-on solution that leverages federated learning and Intel SGX to detect financial fraud.

By automating this process through federated learning access to multiple data sets databases and jurisdictions are encrypted without ever revealing the data or sensitive customer information to the different parties involved. Government and financial institutions can use this new platform to more accurately and efficiently detect illicit activity with lower false positive rates helping to combat financial crime thwart higher-value money laundering and enable legitimate individuals and businesses to manage risk more effectively.

“When banks try to detect illicit and fraudulent activity the system is highly inefficient and ineffective with over 95% of transaction monitoring rendering false positives and institutions unable to see risk beyond their own walls. With Consilient’s federated machine learning technology backed by Intel SGX we are redesigning the way financial institutions and authorities discover and prevent financial crime risk dynamically and securely. This new approach allows organizations to save costs redeploy personnel and manage and prioritize more serious illicit finance risks efficiently and effectively.“

— Juan Zarate global co-managing partner and chief strategy officer at K2 Integrity and first-ever assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes

How it Works

Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) technique and confidential computing model that enables AI training without centralizing data. Consilient has created a behavioral-based ML-driven platform that runs on its DOZER™ technology. ML models can be trained across multiple data sets to detect and analyze “normal” and “abnormal” patterns that humans and most current technologies cannot. This allows participating institutions authorities and regulators to collaborate while uncovering and managing systemic risks more effectively efficiently and sustainably without putting private data at risk.

This computing model is made possible through Intel SGX which uses a hardware-based trusted execution environment (TEE) to help isolate and protect specific application code and data in memory. The technology helps ensure the root of trust is limited to a small portion of the central processing unit’s hardware and the ML application itself reducing the attack surface for potential threats and better protecting the confidentiality and integrity of code and data.

“The application of the Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) technology in the financial space is incredibly exciting said Anil Rao Intel vice president and general manager Data Platforms Security and Systems Architecture. “Finance as we’ve seen in many industries is often limited by secure information sharing and initial trial results between Intel and Consilient hold tremendous promise for the future of collaborative finance.”

More information on using federated learning in the financial services industry is available in the white paper titled Federated Learning through Revolutionary Technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY29sb3JhZG9zdW4uY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMDUvZ3VpbGQtZWR1Y2F0aW9ucy1hbmQtc2VydmljZS1lbXBsb3llZXMtaGlyaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's Working: Guild Education's latest $150 million round means more Colorado jobs,"One of the fastest growing technology companies in Denver just got another burst of funding of $150 million in venture capital this week. Guild Education which helps large employers offer education as an employee perk will use the money to double its size.

What that really means is more jobs said Rachel Carlson Guild’s co-founder and CEO.

And it’s not just another hiring frenzy for the company — which employs 937 people and plans to get to 1300 employees by the end of the year (it’s hiring) — but also improving opportunities for service workers everywhere who feel stuck in a dead-end job.

This has become the mantra for some folks during the pandemic as federal unemployment benefits give lower-wage workers a chance to explore new opportunities. That won’t resolve the ongoing labor crisis of employers desperately seeking seasonal help. But what Carlson is trying to do with Guild is change jobs into careers.

Rachel Romer Carlson CEO and co-founder of Guild Education meets with with Terrence Cummings vice president for Client Success and Nancy Holum director of Client Success for a team check-in brainstorming session from Guild’s downtown Denver offices on November 30 2018. (Kathryn Scott Special to The Colorado Sun)

“The conversation mostly because it’s been driven by national policy is about the $15 minimum wage. We forget to talk about what’s the next step on the staircase and I actually think step two is the most important” she said. “Which companies actually have career paths and where you can go from wherever that company’s entry wage is to the next? How do you get a chance at a family-sustaining middle-class wage? That’s the conversation that no one’s actually having because it’s nuanced and it’s harder than bullet points that politicians say in speeches.”

Guild’s customers are familiar brands with tons of entry-level positions — Chipotle Disney Walmart and Discover Financial to name a few. Their employees can opt in to Guild to get connected to free training or even get a bachelor’s degree from an online university.

In return clients like Chipotle are noticing a significant return. “Chipotle has a 3.5-times higher retention rate among Guild employees versus their employees who don’t use Guild” Carlson said. They’re moving into management roles and “into middle-class wages.”

Moving into a better career used to take generations with a grandfather starting in agriculture his son moving into the industrial economy and the grandson going to college. That’s no longer the simple formula she said.

“Now for millennials Gen X or Y” she said “you’re going to have to reskill yourself every three to five years because the new half life of a technical skill is four years.”

Carlson acknowledged that some of these traditional service-type jobs are on the wane. There’s a desperate need for truck drivers even as self-driving trucks have already hit the road in pilot programs. More grocery stores retailers and fast-food chains are going cashierless to eliminate that type of work in stores. Other companies used the pandemic closures to add automation and robotic systems.

Yet there’s a need today for more restaurant staff warehouse workers drivers and service employees that is pushing minimum wage several dollars above Colorado’s $12.32 an hour. That’s still hard to live on so workers typically cycle through moving on to better-paying gigs.

“People are willing to do hard work they’re willing to start at the bottom. It’s part of the American dream to know that you can work your way up” Carlson said. “We have to stop it with these jobs that are designed for basically a three year in-and-out cycle. … You’re seeing companies that are basically designing jobs that are there to expire.”

While Guild doesn’t share all the companies that are clients prominent brands are listed in the company’s news releases so one can scout around for employers who want to offer this benefit. Here are a few more sites that have rounded up companies offering education as a perk:

Colorado’s economy by the numbers

Labor shortages and livable wages continue to be a hot topic as America emerges from the pandemic.

May data released Friday shows that U.S. jobs are returning after the big drop last year. The number of non-farm jobs is still down by 7.6 million or 5% from February 2020 before the pandemic according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But industries with notable recovery include leisure and hospitality plus public and private education.

Restaurants and hotels continue to struggle to fill jobs but that’s partly because there were issues prior to the pandemic and employers are now competing with one another for the same workers as restaurants and hotels open for the summer season.

In Colorado’s eight largest metro areas nearly every region’s labor force grew and unemployment dropped in April not only from last year but from March.

More recent data from the state Department of Labor and Employment also shows a slight improvement in the state’s economy compared with the previous week:

0.6% — Decline in the number of Coloradans on continued unemployment benefits for the week ending May 22. This means roughly 144426 are still unemployed

— Decline in the number of Coloradans on continued unemployment benefits for the week ending May 22. This means roughly 144426 are still unemployed Of those 27.8% are on regular state unemployment; the rest are receiving federal benefits

5464 — Number of unemployed Coloradans opting into Colorado Jumpstart as of May 31 to qualify for a bonus of $1200 to $1600 for returning to work

— Number of unemployed Coloradans opting into Colorado Jumpstart as of May 31 to qualify for a bonus of $1200 to $1600 for returning to work 106323 — Job postings on ConnectingColorado.com the state’s job board as of June 4

— Job postings on ConnectingColorado.com the state’s job board as of June 4 $1.01 billion — How much Colorado has borrowed from the federal government to pay unemployed workers as of June 2

Other bits…

While the federal Restaurant Revitalization Fund is now closed to applications we now know how many Colorado restaurants got some aid.

In a press tour from Fort Collins to Denver Sen. John Hickenlooper traveled with U.S. Small Business Administration head Isabella Guzman to announce that 1587 Colorado restaurants and bars received more than $309 million in the few short weeks the program was offered.

Sen. John Hickenlooper and SBA Administrator Isabella Guzman meet at Coffee on the Point with founder Ryan Cobbins during a tour to publicize the federal Restaurant Revitalization Fund which provided $309 million in grants to more than 1500 Colorado restaurants bars and food trucks. (Provided by Sen. John Hickenlooper’s office)

But despite several organizations deeming it a success and asking for extensions including the Colorado Restaurant Association it hasn’t been extended by Congress.

In a statement Hickenlooper said “We will continue to work together to help small businesses in Colorado and across the nation build back better.”

→ PPP ends: In other SBA news the federal Paycheck Protection Program loans ended May 31 though the program ran out of funding much earlier. Overall 6.7 million small businesses were approved for loans valued at $278 billion this year. In Colorado 87088 businesses received $4.7 billion.

Unemployment beat

The biggest issue I now hear about from unemployed Coloradans is how do I get paid for past weeks? That’s a hard question for me to answer because every case is truly unique. This also isn’t new. People have been trying to get back pay for more than a year.

But if you’re in this situation call CDLE’s customer service line to get someone on your account right away. This will likely take an investigator to dig into your files to verify that you are owed money.

I also asked the labor department whether back payments requests are still being processed or should people give up?

Don’t give up said Jessica Hudgins Smith press secretary for the Division of Unemployment Insurance.

“Claimants may always request a backdate” Smith said in an email. “For extremely old requests the facts surrounding why the request was not initially made in a timely manner is taken into consideration to determine whether to grant or deny any such request.”

Requests made for weeks after Dec. 27 “might need until the end of the month to process” she added. And if you’re trying to claim weeks prior to Dec. 27 you must schedule a callback by calling 303-318-9000.

→ Mixed earners? A handful of people (OK maybe two readers) continue to ask what happened to the Mixed Earners Unemployment Compensation. This was the extra $100 a week for people who straddled regular state unemployment and Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. CDLE has repeatedly responded that it’s focused on larger groups with payment issues. The latest? “The answer remains the same” Smith said.

→ ID.me and minors: If you’re unemployed and under 18 the state’s identity verifier ID.me won’t verify your ID. Why? It’s a privacy issue and the company prohibits people under 18 from using its site. In Colorado that means unemployed folks under 18 must call 303-536-5615 and tell a customer service agent they’re underage and need to verify their ID. CDLE updated its “Contact us” page with all sorts of instructions on how to get answers.

Incoming…

Companies that move jobs to Colorado or expand in the state can qualify for tax credits as part of the state’s Job Growth Incentive Tax Credits run by the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade. The catch is the company must add workers at an above average regional wage within eight years. Here are some of the latest companies committing to Colorado:

→ FileInvite a New Zealand tech company offering a simpler way to collect documents and share them picked Denver for its U.S. headquarters. It needs to fill 140 jobs in the state although it looks like the only one listed right now in Denver is for an account executive. If company fills those positions at an average annual wage of $102049 in the next eight years it qualifies for a $1.7 million tax credit. >> JOBS

→ Datadog a cybersecurity company also picked Denver for its Western U.S. hub. The company plans to add 400 jobs in the state adding to its existing 98-person workforce. Wages must average $122194 annually to qualify for $5.4 million in tax credits. >> JOBS

→ Crusoe Energy is already in Denver but is expanding its headquarters to the tune of 286 people. It currently has 58 employees of which 20 are in Colorado. The company captures wasted natural gas from oil and gas extraction and turns it into electricity for use in data centers.

DG,Dollar General,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWxtYXJ2YW5vdy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZS8yMDIxLzA2LzA1L2VjaS1pbm1hdGVzLWdyb3ctZnJ1aXRzLXZlZ2V0YWJsZXMtZmVlZC1kZWxtYXJ2YS1mYW1pbGllcy1icmlkZ2UtZm9vZC1pbnNlY3VyaXR5LXN1c3NleC13aWNvbWljby83NTIxOTA3MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ECI inmates grow produce for Delmarva families bridge food insecurity,"Their work begins just after 8 a.m. each day.

Five or six men are assigned to tend to each of three gardens where more than a dozen varieties of fruits and vegetables are grown.

There's no irrigation system. The men do it all — from manually watering the crops to pulling weeds as they work toward harvesting thousands of pounds in organic produce each year.

They take a break at about 1 p.m. then return to nurture the gardens until about 7 p.m.

Behind the walls of Eastern Correctional Institution in Somerset County 16 inmates continue this labor seven days a week even toiling through the winter months to ensure the soil is ready for planting come spring.

Their first harvest of the 2021 season weighed in at 764 pounds which is believed to be the gardens' largest yield yet for the start of a season.

The gardens' spread of produce includes kale cabbage beets tomatoes yellow onions eggplant cantaloupe watermelon zucchini and bell peppers.

""That's beautiful"" officials exclaimed as they combed through boxes of fresh greens from the first harvest Thursday before piling them into the bed of a pickup truck.

Project director Sharon Lynch of the Somerset County Health Department explained that the boxes will be divvied up among roughly 20 community partners. From there they will reach family tables in Somerset and Wicomico counties.

The initiative began in 2014 funded by grant money from the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission as a project to address food insecurity and childhood obesity in Somerset County.

With only two grocery stores and a Dollar General in the county the options for fresh fruits and vegetables are slim.

And what is available isn't always affordable.

""With just a little bit of money — less than $3000 a year — the inmates at ECI have been able to grow and maintain and harvest this garden for us"" Lynch said. ""In seven years they have grown for us 66000 pounds of produce.""

The program started with a three-quarter-acre plot on the prison property but it has since expanded to place a garden on each side of the main prison compound and at the annex.

For some the experience of gardening is new.

Somerset County Health Officer Danielle Weber noted there are men in the gardens who never touched this kind of work before coming to ECI.

""There is a whole new skillset for these individuals that they will have"" she said.

One inmate said the best part of the work is all the fresh air he gets and for another it's as simple as loving gardening — neither was allowed to be identified by name or face.

Correctional officer Cynthia Dodson who supervises the gardens said the inmates' ""awesome job"" this year is going to help a lot of people.

""They’re proud of what they do. I mean you can tell just in the way they work and the way things look and how they keep it"" Dodson said.

The return on investment both in financial and human terms makes it a ""home run program"" in the eyes of Secretary Robert Green of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services or DPSCS.

Weekly harvest collections are set to occur through the end of October — a prospect that has Green looking forward to the impact the gardens can have as local families recover from the past year's financial strain.

The 2020 season alone saw the inmates harvest 13000 pounds of produce despite the constraints of a pandemic.

Families needed that help more than ever.

""We’re a lot more than a facility of confinement ..."" Green stressed. ""You allow us to be part of the communities that we’re in.""

DPSCS works to place people in correctional facilities in regions that our closest to where they live which means many of the inmates at ECI are from the Eastern Shore or have family in the area explained O. Wayne Hill the department's deputy secretary of operations.

Working in the gardens gives those men a chance to have a positive direct influence on people they know by providing them healthy food options.

""It’s really a full circle kind of program"" Hill said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd29ya2Vycy1yYWdlLXF1aXR0aW5nLWpvYnMtaW4tYS10aWdodGVuaW5nLWxhYm9yLW1hcmtldC0yMDIxLTXSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3dvcmtlcnMtcmFnZS1xdWl0dGluZy1qb2JzLWluLWEtdGlnaHRlbmluZy1sYWJvci1tYXJrZXQtMjAyMS01P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Workers are 'rage quitting' jobs in a tightening labor market,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='businessinsider.mx', port=443): Read timed out.

✖

It looks like the 100 Days of Baja are officially underway. Over the weekend eager MTN DEW fans began to discover the two latest flavors to join the DEW portfolio out ""in the wild"" as they say: Baja Punch and Baja Flash. Both inspired by Taco Bell's MTN DEW Baja Blast both new additions serve as the foundation for the soda's 100 Days of Baja promotion where DEW drinkers can redeem codes for various prizes. One lucky winner will even win a $100000 cash prize.

The arrival of the flavors was revealed earlier this year when designs for the bottles and can boxes surfaced online. Baja Punch is Baja Blast combined with tropical punch flavors while Baja Flash is a mixture of Baja Blast and pineapple/coconut flavors. Popular Instagram snack-trackers Marcus and Matthew (@mnmtwinz) shared that they obtained the new flavors at a ShopRite in Monroe New York.

""These flavors hit just like Baja Blast but quickly swerve and switch lanes offering a nice change of pace"" the brothers wite. ""Baja Punch gives you a citrusy pineapple cherry flavor while Baja Flash is straightforward Pina Colada vibes heavy on the coconut—which we wish wasn't so strong. But if you prefer more coconut in your drink this is for you!""

They add ""If you don't want coconut at all Maui Burst is Mountain Dew's pineapple soda exclusively sold at Dollar General in select states. Baja Blast still remains our favorite among these 3 but Baja POunch is a VERY close second!"" The brothers also mention with one of the codes they redeemed they won a Baja Blast beach towel as one of the prizes.

She was always inviting friends to join plans.

She dubbed herself official taste tester of her mom’s baked goods would suggest trips to Dollar Tree for fun and had a beta fish named Bubble Buddy. She helped her younger stepsiblings with their schoolwork.

She worked at Pizza House to buy the things she wanted but didn’t need: Vans shoes perfume incense and energy drinks. She made art.

Hart was deciding if she wanted to study teaching or finance. But she knew she’d go to Indiana University Kokomo and live at home.

An all-day event:Noblesville High School celebrates graduation in three parts

Saturday should have been her graduation day from Hamilton Heights High School.

It's the day she'd be done with high school and moving on to a summer of traveling before starting college. But about a month earlier Hart along with Lendon Byram a junior at Cathedral High School died after a two-vehicle crash in rural Hamilton County.

They — along with other teens who had non-life threatening injuries — were on their way to visit Hart’s mom before heading to Heights prom.

“I don’t like using Kalen in the past tense” said her mom Jody Conaway. “She’s still lives on in me and her siblings and her dad. And we’re all trying to be better people because of Kalen.”

Heights is honoring Kalen at graduation

During graduation on Saturday evening Hamilton Heights will honor Hart and her sister Bailey Burnworth — also a graduate of Heights — will accept her diploma.

“That was an opportunity taken away from Kalen” Conaway said.

Although Conaway was invited to multiple senior celebrations she said graduation is the first one she’s attending.

“I’m proud of all the kids that have been a constant part of my life and how they all handled everything that has happened” she said.

Hamilton Heights High School has less than 200 students in the senior class and Hart who attended Heights her entire school career knew most of her classmates that entire time.

After Hart’s and Byram’s deaths the school canceled prom and made counselors available. Both the Cathedral and Heightscommunities had memorials. A fundraiser helped pay for Hart’s funeral and local businesses donated to create a rescheduled prom for her classmates.

Conaway praised the community for how it has come together and for sharing stories with her about her daughter.

“She’s a great daughter I don’t want to say she’s perfect because no one is perfect” Conaway said. “She’s an amazing young woman (and now) there’s a giant hole.”

Family friends celebrate her life share memories

Conaway was working on the invitations for Hart’s graduation open house when she got the call there had been a crash.

She said Hart had wanted to have her party the weekend before graduation instead of after graduation because there were multiple parties already scheduled for after and she didn’t want people to have to choose between parties.

On the day of her party family and friends did what Kalen loved to do – go to Morse Beach and spend the day fishing talking and eating. Conaway said they had a potluck and about 50 people came to spend time together and tell stories.

While some of the stories she’s heard since her daughter’s death were new they weren’t surprising – like the time Hart went out of her way to introduce herself and befriend a new student.

But the one that Conaway loves is a video from choir that played at senior night. In it Hart has a cupcake in her hand and is belly laughing. Then she puts the entire cupcake in her mouth and is on the floor belly laughing.

It shows her being ""absolutely silly"" her mom said.

Conaway said that the remaining funds from the fundraiser to pay for her funeral were given to things that were important to Byram and Hart.

At Heights funds went to two groups that Hart participated in: the choir program and the gay straight alliance.

Conaway said she learned after her daughter’s death that one of Hart’s goals was to create a space that gives students a place to go and feel included and the funds to the GSA will be used for items for that space.

""She was very passionate"" Conaway said ""about little things like that.""

'Little things are the big things'

Conaway said she’s been living by: ""What would Kalen do?""

She’d give money to the homeless person. She’d pay for the groceries of the woman behind her in line. She’d donate a little more to the fireworks show she loved. She’d take the advice of the sign she bought for her mom that says “Enjoy the little things” and is surrounded by cacti.

“Now I realize the little things” Conaway said ""are the big things.""

Conaway said she’s planning to attend the graduation parties that she was invited to but wants to keep the focus on the graduate when she does. And she’s trying to find gifts that Hart would give. She said Hart was very particular in her gift giving and always put thought in.

Plus she said she feels compelled to go because Hart would have made her go with her to the parties.

If she could go back in time Conaway said she’d go to 10:36 a.m. May 1 2021 when Hart was leaving to get ready for prom.

Conaway said good-bye from the doorway not wanting to embarrass her with a hug and kiss in front of her friends.

“Let your mom embarrass you and I’m never going to be able to do that again” she said. “I want people to take advantage of every opportunity you have with your child and take the extra second…you don’t get that opportunity again.”

D,Dominion Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdmlyZ2luaWFtZXJjdXJ5LmNvbS9icmllZnMvaW5ib3gtb24tZWxlY3RyaWMtcmVndWxhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,INBOX: On electric regulation and deregulation • Virginia Mercury,"To the Mercury:

There is a debate brewing in Virginia over whether or not to deregulate the state’s electricity. Which essentially means allowing various companies to compete with Dominion Energy by selling power to residents and businesses.

Supporters of deregulation like the organization Clean Virginia insist that creating competition will be good residents of the commonwealth and ostensibly bring more clean energy to the state. Ivy Main a volunteer with the Sierra Club in a recent op-ed in the Virginia Mercury took aim at the group Power for Tomorrow of which I am the executive director.

Ms. Main states that we are a front group for Dominion Energy.

In reality Dominion Energy is public about their support of Power for Tomorrow and our group is made up of energy experts both Democrats and Republicans utilities consumer advocates and a national labor union. Our focus also extends well beyond Dominion’s reach in Virginia. We are a national 501(c)(6) nonprofit organization and we will file paperwork with the Internal Revenue Service that allows everyone to see who funds us and how we spend our money.

You can go to our website and see all of our experts and supporters. We are not a “front group” for anyone – we are vocal advocates who all believe that deregulation raises electric rates for regular customers. Additionally we seek exhaustive government oversight of utilities to ensure that electric prices and grid maintenance are fully regulated.

Ms. Main claimed that we are not being sincere when we assert that deregulation will create a situation in Virginia that resembles what happened in Texas last winter when a winter storm left dozens of people dead and millions without power. She asserts that this happened because mostly natural gas generation froze because there was a “failure to regulate” by Texas officials and not “deregulation.”

However legislation introduced in the Virginia Assembly in 2020 to deregulate the commonwealthwould undermine the regulatory structure in place that ensures reliability.

In fact Ed Hirs an economist at the University of Houston has just joined Power for Tomorrow because he strongly believes deregulation creates risks for customers. After Winter Storm Uri devastated the Lone Star state Texas Monthly published a piece titled: “Ed Hirs Has Been Predicting This Mess for Years.”

Finally I believe it is critical that we address what supporters of deregulation refuse to acknowledge: deregulation raises electric rates and allows unscrupulous third-party suppliers to target less sophisticated customers with false promises of lower electric bills.

A recent Wall Street Journal analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data reported: “U.S. consumers who signed up with retail energy companies that emerged from deregulation paid $19.2 billion more than they would have if they’d stuck with incumbent utilities from 2010 through 2019.”

Former Maryland Governor Parris Glendenning who has also joined Power for Tomorrow signed legislation allowing the state to deregulate when he was in office. He says that decision was his biggest policy mistake. A Democrat Glendenning laments aggressive salespeople working for shady third-party electricity suppliers who go to Maryland welfare agencies to prey on the economically insecure.

As the commonwealth starts to appreciate what deregulation actually means people are speaking out. Since we began our education campaign a few weeks ago 4324 Virginians have sent letters to elected officials and 1607 people signed our petition; both urging lawmakers to avoid risky deregulation.

It might not surprise one to see the color purple or the term “I Purple You” being used as a marketing tool by companies who collaborate with the global pop stars BTS. From Samsung to UNICEF the term coined by member V is today an integral part of the septet’s brand itself. However recently numerous other creative gems of V have been adopted by various popular brands to promote their products.

1. “McFlurry One Please” by McDonald's

In one of the seasons of BTS’s travel series “Bon Voyage” member V visited the fast-food restaurant McDonald and placed an order in English that tremendously delighted the fans. Even though it has been a few years since the episode aired the clip especially his order for “big breaker beef burger” and “Oreo McFlurry” continues to receive massive love on social networking sites and has recently made headlines due to BTS’s collaboration with the brand.

Owing to V’s influence “Oreo McFlurry” has been reported as a best-seller despite not being a part of the ‘BTS MEAL.’ McDonald Korea has also jumped on the bandwagon by advertising the product with V’s iconic line “McFlurry One Please.”





Pizza Slice Hand Gesture / “Don’t Eat Your Fingers” by Dominos (Philippines)

On May 25th BTS guest-starred on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” to promote their smash hit “Butter” and surprised their fans with a hilarious comedy sketch titled “Break The Internet With These Hand Gestures.” In particular member V who introduced the “Pizza Slice '' sign caught the eyes of Dominos who promptly shared an advertisement inspired by V’s skit.





“My Name Is VTS. I am good sub” by Subway (Malaysia)

Recently Subway (Malaysia) announced their new Veggie Tambah Sub (VTS) with the slogan “My name is VTS. I am good sub” derived from V’s iconic line “Hi my name is V and I am a good boy.” This introductory phase is from V’s interview at “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” which became a humongous hit last year especially on TikTok. The influence of the “Good Boy V” is even today running strong finding new fans even in popular brands.





The impact of V and his words on such renowned companies is not only remarkable and praiseworthy but also a testament to the sheer power of his impeccable brand and popularity. No wonder he is titled the “Blue Chip of the Advertisement World.”

A TikTok user summarized the phenomenon: It begins with Gerard Way who created the band My Chemical Romance after witnessing the attacks on 9/11. That band's music then inspired Stephanie Meyers who wrote the ""Twilight"" books series that in turn inspired E.L. James author of the ""Fifty Shades"" trilogy.

On Jan. 4 2020 a viral Tumblr post made the following claim:

gerard way personally witnessed the twin towers falling while on a ferry to new york city. this event inspired him to start my chemical romance. as a result stephanie meyer used him and the band's music for inspiration for twilight. as a result of that book el james wrote a twilight fanfic that eventually became the best selling book fifty shades of grey.

On Jan. 12 2020 a Reddit post made a similar claim:

Here's the domino effect: Gerard Way witnessed 9/11 while in NYC He created My Chemical Romance (which became his therapy for the PTSD of witnessing 9/11) Stephanie Meyer used MCR's music to inspire her as she wrote her books that became Twilight E. L. James wrote a Twilight fanfic and got it published as the book we all know 50 Shades of Grey

Let's start at the beginning. Gerard Way singer for My Chemical Romance was indeed in New York City working as an intern on Sept. 11 2001. In a 2005 interview with Spin Magazine he described how the day of the tragedy while coming into Manhattan he had an epiphany of sorts:

Like many life changing stories of the 21st century it all began on September 11 2001. On that clear-blue-sky day Way who had graduated from New York's School of Visual Arts to a sunlight-free existence drawing in his mom's basement was coming into Manhattan unaware of the tragedy. ""Something just clicked in my head that morning"" he says. ""I literally said to myself 'Fuck art. I've gotta get out of the basement. I've gotta see the world. I've gotta make a difference!'""

In an interview with Newsweek in 2019 Way said:

One of the biggest reasons I started My Chemical Romance was because I was one of the people to witness 9/11 in New York City. That felt like the end of the world. It felt like the apocalypse. I was surrounded by hundreds of people on a dock on the Hudson River and we watched the buildings go down and there was this wave of human anguish that I've never felt before. Since then I've continued to think about what we would do at the end of the world if we knew we only had a little time left. Someone actually pointed out to me that the music video for ""Black Parade"" also looked a bit like the aftermath of 9/11 and it came out just a day or two after the anniversary.

In another interview during the 2019 Los Angeles Comic Con he described how forming the band My Chemical Romance and writing songs became ""therapy for me.""

""So 9/11 happens and I pick up the guitar again and I write 'Skylines And Turnstiles' and then I called Otter [Matt Pellissier drummer] and then I called Ray [Toro guitarist] and we got Mikey [Way bassist] in – and we just started building this momentum"" Way said. ""It became my therapy from the PTSD that everyone had experienced from 9/11 and processing that.""

He made the comments around 16 minutes into this video:

Author Stephanie Meyers has also publicly stated that My Chemical Romance was one of her inspirations as she wrote the vampire romance ""Twilight"" series. In an EW interview she said the band helped her with the character of werewolf Jacob Black:

This band is so in touch for me with Jacob's character. This really raw uncontrolled emotion — where it's not about some person who's grown up and callused over and learned how to control things. It's someone who's feeling it for the first time and just wants to go out and blow things up. The song 'Famous Last Words' is a really romantic version of Jacob saying 'Okay I'm putting myself out there and you're probably going to break me but that doesn't change the fact that I'm still going to make the offer.

As it turns out the band was just not that into ""Twilight"" however. None of the band members had read the series back in 2009 and they refused an offer to do a song for one of the ""Twilight"" film adaptions.

Meyers would go on to inspire another author who herself would go on to create a cultural phenomenon: E.L. James author of the ""Fifty Shades"" trilogy. It has been widely reported that the controversial romance novels started out as ""Twilight"" fan fiction which is defined as writing that takes characters and situations from existing works of fiction and creates new stories based off of them normally as an act of fan appreciation. This is typically unauthorized by the original creator.

James originally posted her work as unauthorized fan fiction online under the title ""Master of the Universe."" The main characters initially were named Edward and Bella after the primary characters in ""Twilight."" It re-imagined the story as Edward being a very sexually active human businessman and not a chaste teen vampire. Ultimately its popularity led to the book deal and the ""Fifty Shades"" franchise as we know it today.

While the internet may have drawn vivid and even convincing links from 9/11 to Fifty Shades it doesn't account for all the other variables that may have led to the development and ensuing success of all these cultural creations. Random historical connections may be fun and fascinating but the factors that enabled these cultural touchstones to exist are a bit more complex than that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3MvaGFja2VkLXVybHMtaGF2ZS1iZWVuLWJsb2NrZWQtcmVtb3ZlZC1pbi1kb21pbm9zLWRhdGEtbGVhay1nb3Z0LXRvLWRlbGhpLWhjLTI0NTcyNjfSAXlodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pbmRpYS1uZXdzL2hhY2tlZC11cmxzLWhhdmUtYmVlbi1ibG9ja2VkLXJlbW92ZWQtaW4tZG9taW5vcy1kYXRhLWxlYWstZ292dC10by1kZWxoaS1oYy0yNDU3MjY3L2FtcC8x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino's India Data Breach: Hacked URLs Removed Centre Tells High Court,"Domino's Data Breach: Data of Jubilant Good work Limited was hacked and leaked online. (File)

After a large number of data of Jubilant Good work Limited the company which operates Domino's Pizza stores in India was hacked and leaked online the government on Saturday informed Delhi High Court that the concerned departments have already blocked and removed the hacked URLs supplied to them.

The Jubilant Food Works Limited had approached the Delhi high court and sought direction from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Department of Communications Ministry of Communications to direct and notify the intermediaries such as telecom service providers internet service providers search engines to immediately remove or disable access to the uniform resource locators (URLs) created by one or more unknown persons/hackers to illegally share the data of thousands of its customers on the internet.

On that the bench of Justice Yogesh Khanna was informed by the counsel for UOI Advocate Kirtiman Singh that the URLs supplied to them have already been blocked and they will continue to take proactive steps as and when the complaints will be filed by the petitioner before them. ""Besides this there are other respondents who are also directed to act as per law"".

Senior Lawyer Dayan Krishnan submitted that hackers have illegally and unauthorisedly accessed such data from the petitioner's secure computer resource and hosted it on the URLs without consent thus invading the privacy of the petitioner's customers. It is alleged the hackers had also attempted to intimidate and extort ransom from the petitioner.

Counsel for Dominos also alleged that due to delay in the action be the concerned respondents the hackers merrily continue to re-post re-direct and re-publish the data of the petitioner's customers from one URL to another resulting in severe reputational risk and harm to the petitioner and more importantly a compromise of the personal data of thousands of petitioner's customers.

The court granted liberty to petitioner/food chain to make written communication to the investigating officer for removal/access disablement of the same or similar offending content appearing including URLs on any other website/online platform or search engines whether in the same or in a different context and the investigating officer is to notify such website/online platform or search engines to comply with such request immediately and in any event within 72 hours of receiving such written communication from the petitioner.

Recently in a hacking incident a large number of data of Jubilant Good Work Limited was hacked and leaked online by one or more unknown persons/hackers to illegally share the data of thousands of its customers on the internet.

In fact in 2019 motorcyclist Norman Chung died from injuries he sustained after he was involved in an accident on one of the problematic corners which is now badly in need of repairs.

Another motorcyclist Lance Douglas also succumbed to injuries from an accident at the venue in 2012.

Gore told The Sunday Gleaner that his association is desperately seeking the more than $5 million it will take to resurface sections of the track in time for the reopening of the St Ann-based facility.

“I would say that there are four corners and a straight that need intervention right away and that would probably (cost) in the region of about five million dollars” said Gore.

“I think if we can find a sponsor that can take up something like that then I can tell you that brand or whatever they decide to promote will be placed all over the racetrack just like Miracle Corporation who sponsored us two million dollars is going to be all over the racetrack” he added. “We will definitely make sure that they get their money’s worth as far as advertising is concerned at Dover Raceway.”

He pointed out that his organisation is very big on the safety of their drivers and motorcyclists and therefore all the COVID-19 safety guidelines will have to be followed once they are granted approval by the Government for resumption.

TRACK SAFETY IMPORTANT

“There are many different things that can happen which can cause an accident but as a club we have to look at the scenarios that are in front of us which are track preparations and the safety of the track itself for everyone” Gore said.

“If we can also go around and use the tyres that we have to make barricades and use the infrastructures that we have to make it as safe as possible then we need to do this which is very important” he said.

There have been no competitive racing at Dover Raceway for more than a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and despite this Gore shared that the JRDC has still managed to maintain the facility with help from a number of sponsors and well-wishers.

“The likes of Sherwin Williams has come on board and they have donated paint to help paint up the place and to make the place look pretty” he said. “We have people who are going and cutting the grass every Tuesday and so Dover is looking beautiful right now.”

The death was confirmed by his son Dow McVean. ""He passed away about 1:30 this morning at Baptist East with his whole family there around him"" he said.

The cause was complications from Parkinson’s disease his son wrote in an email. He was 78.

""Dad was a high energy passionate entrepreneur and philanthropist with a passion for education and the City of Memphis"" his son wrote.

He preferred the nickname ""Charlie"" to Charles his son wrote and was the founder of McVean Trading & Investments a company that specializes in trading meat grain and other commodities.

“Charlie McVean had a brilliant creative and innovative mind"" U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen D-Memphis said in a statement. ""He used it for Memphis in the areas of public education and amenities.""

""The Harahan Bridge’s 'Big River Crossing' is illustrative of his imagination and of his get-it-done mentality. It is a project that is a forever gift to Memphis at our front door. He helped East High students learn and achieve. We need more Charlie McVeans who give back to make us better. His was a unique valuable important life. I extend my deepest condolences to his wife Kay and his entire family.”

His son wrote that his father believed in family friends work education and Memphis. He was also passionate about M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Texas and was a member of their Board of Visitors.

McVean leaves his wife Kay McVean his son Dow daughters Katherine Kaelin Courtney McVean and Gwen Coffey 11 grandchildren and four great grandchildren.

A funeral service is scheduled for 3 p.m. Wednesday at St. Michael Catholic Church 3863 Summer Ave.

Trading cattle

Charlie McVean's career in business was marked with significant honors including selection for the Memphis City Council's annual Humanitarian Award in 2007 and induction into the Society of Entrepreneurs in 2011.

A 2011 profile in The Commercial Appeal said he graduated from East High School and Vanderbilt University. After that McVean accepted a job as a trader in the grain industry working for companies in cities including Memphis and New York.

He moved back to Memphis in 1974 taking a job with brokerage firm Refco where he focused on cattle trading and eventually became a principal the 2011 profile said.

""My grandfather was an old cattle trader and he used to say that at the end of the day if you're going to be in a business like this you have to know where legitimate business ends and where gambling begins"" McVean said at the time. ""I've based my career on knowing the difference between the two and making the right decisions for my clients.""

He launched his own company McVean Trading & Investments in 1986.

The business focused on commodities but over the years McVean also pursued outside ventures.

In the 1980s he invested millions of dollars in a concept for an indoor track at which people would bet on ponies carrying remote-controlled robot jockeys. The concept didn't win a license. The business also brought significant legal trouble for McVean.

He was accused of attempting to bribe a state senator in 1987 to vote for a gambling bill. After a two-week trial in 1990 the jury deadlocked 6-6. The charges were dismissed. At the time McVean issued a brief statement in which he thanked his family friends investors and employees for ''their unyielding support and confidence through the ordeal just concluded.''

In 2010 he described investing millions of dollars in another venture: Aerobic Cruiser Hybrid Cycle LLC a company that made plug-in electric moped bicycles. At the time he said the bikes could help fight climate change the obesity epidemic the foreign trade deficit and a diminished manufacturing base.

""It's fun. It's exercise. But most of all it's serious transportation"" he said.

Big River Crossing

He not only promoted the Aerobic Cruiser he was an avid bike rider himself his son wrote. ""He was frustrated with the lack of long stretches of safe places to ride and saw the (Big River Crossing) as a way to access longer trails.""

""Dad only had one speed: wide open. But he really saw the Big River Crossing as a way to drive international tourism through Memphis and create more and higher paying jobs for Memphians.""

McVean presented the Big River Crossing concept at a gathering at his East Memphis home in 2014.

In short it would be a retrofit of the old Harahan Bridge which carried railroad traffic. A pedestrian boardwalk would run parallel to the trains and connect Memphis and West Memphis.

McVean contributed his own money to the project and helped secure more — the bulk of the dollars came from federal grants.

Big River Crossing held its grand opening in 2016. Here's how The Commercial Appeal wrote about it at the time.

""City and state officials mused over all of the teamwork and fundraising it took to get the boardwalk built but said it wouldn't have happened at all if not for Charlie McVean.""

""Described as a 'force of nature' and 'superman of the Big River Crossing' McVean was credited with having the initial vision for the bridge's future and convincing all the players necessary to see the project to fruition. He received two standing ovations as he spoke about the bridge noting Union Pacific was not initially keen on the idea.""

""'Crowds of people will be closer to moving freight trains than ever before. I didn't dare say that until we got this project finished'"" McVean joked.

The following year in 2017 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused McVean and two other people associated with his company of using deceptive practices to manipulate the cattle futures markets.

Without admitting or denying wrongdoing McVean and the others reached a settlement with the regulatory commission and agreed to pay fines totaling $5 million. At the time the company said the settlement ""avoid(ed) the need for ongoing discussions and litigation that could have created a significant distraction from McVean's primary goal of serving its clients.""

In recent years McVean retired from the company but continued as chairman emeritus his son wrote.

Meanwhile another of McVean's creations continued to flourish in local schools.

​​​​Peer Power

McVean graduated from East High School in Memphis and supported the school through his Greater East High Foundation. The foundation created and funded Peer Power a program in which high-achieving students would tutor other students. The program began at East High in 2004 and McVean later expanded it to other schools.

His son wrote that his father drew on his own mother's experience teaching in a one-room schoolhouse in rural Missouri when he was a child. ""Her passion for education ran deep in Dad and again he saw education as the one and only way to truly transform Memphis and improve the lives of its less fortunate citizens.""

Today Peer Power trains and employs high-performing college students from the University of Memphis to tutor in public school classrooms and mentor high school students. The tutors' hourly wage starts at $13.25 and goes as high as $16.50 said Bill Sehnert who has served as executive director of the Peer Power Foundation since its launch. The program currently has 150 coaches teaching in nine local schools and continues to expand Sehnert said.

“His favorite saying was the greatest underrealized resource in America is its youth. And then he put his money where his mouth was” adding that McVean pumped millions of dollars into the program.

“Because some of our neighborhoods are tough neighborhoods and jobs don’t exist. And when you go in and you pay a fair wage for meaningful work for a student it makes them a better student and you get good outcomes.”

Sehnert said one of the former students who benefitted from McVean's program is Mario Fortney who went through the Peer Power program as a paid tutor and went on to earn an MBA. ""As Mario said 'Charlie McVean changed my life the first day I got paid for being a great student and helping others.'” Sehnert said Fortney now lives in Miami and has told him he plans to come back for the funeral Wednesday. He expects many other beneficiaries of the program to come too.

“Charlie gave them a ladder and they climbed they ladder.”

The utility on June 4 said River Rouge located just southwest of Detroit Michigan operated for the final time on May 31.

The retirement of River Rouge is among moves taken as part of DTE Energy’s program to reduce carbon emissions. The Detroit-based utility has increased its investment in solar and wind power and is placing more of an emphasis on natural gas-fired power generation along with the continued operation of its Fermi nuclear plant.

The company’s current goal is to cut emissions by 50% by 2030 and 80% by 2040.

DTE plans to close three of its remaining five coal-fired power plants by the end of next year a number that includes the 358-MW River Rouge. The utility has said the closings represent the single largest carbon emissions reduction happening in the state of Michigan.

“As Michigan’s need for electricity grew over the decades our employees at River Rouge worked together to serve our customers and communities as an engine of progress” said Jerry Norcia president and CEO of DTE Energy in a statement. “Now that this plant has achieved its generation lifespan and we move into the next evolution of power generation I would like to thank the men and women who gave their energy to the plant over the years and to the communities that supported them.”

Norcia continued: “DTE is proud to be Michigan’s largest producer of wind and solar energy and within two years we will generate enough renewable energy to power approximately 900000 homes. We firmly believe that our clean energy generation transformation is the right thing to do for our customers and the communities we serve. That’s why we are doing as much as we can as fast as we can to provide our customers and the state of Michigan with clean energy that is affordable and reliable.”

Other Utilities Phasing Out Coal

Consumers Energy along with DTE one of Michigan’s largest electricity providers in 2018 said it would phase out its coal-fired units over the next two decades.

DTE said River Rouge which at its peak had three units and about 840 MW of generation capacity supported about 300 jobs. The plant’s other units were closed in 2008 and 2016 according to Global Energy Monitor. DTE’s two remaining operating coal-fired power plants are the 1547-MW St. Clair Power Plant in St. Clair and the 536-MW Trenton Channel Power Plant in Trenton with both scheduled to be retired next year.

The St. Clair plant came online with Unit 1 in 1953 and added six more units over the next 16 years. Unit 4 which came online in 1954 was retired in 2017; Unit 1 was retired in 2019. Unit 5 was taken out of service in 1979 due to a mechanical problem with the boiler.

The Trenton plant also known as the Trenton Stacks was originally completed in 1924 with six turbine generators—the last was brought online in 1929—and 13 coal-fired boilers. The Trenton units were the first in the U.S. to use electrostatic precipitators to capture fly ash from the stacks. A second plant at the site with two more generators entered service in 1950.

Unit 9 at Trenton the only unit still in operation at the site came online in 1968.

DTE’s closure of River Rouge came the same day as PSEG Power announced the retirement of that utility’s last coal-fired plant Unit 3 at the Bridgeport Harbor Station in Bridgeport Connecticut. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has said it expects more than 4 GW of coal-fired generation capacity will be retired this year down from 9.4 GW in 2020.

EIA said about 22 GW of coal-fired capacity is scheduled for shutdown through 2024. The U.S. has about 220 GW of generation capacity in its current coal-fired fleet.

That's what a Safe Haven Baby Box provides for mothers who need a safe option when they feel they cannot care for their newborn baby.

On Friday Bedford city officials unveiled the county's first baby box. Installed at the Bedford Fire Department H Street headquarters the box faces H Street and is equipped with a sensor that will alert firefighters inside when it is opened.

Monica Kelsey Safe Haven Baby Box founder spoke at the dedication along with two families whose children were surrendered by mothers who placed them in a Safe Haven Baby Box.

Tessa and Keegan Higgs of Paoli were foster parents hoping to adopt a child but never dreamed they would get a baby. In 2019 little Nola came into their life when her mother placed her in a baby box near Fort Wayne.

""At that time there weren't many baby boxes"" she said.

They drove five hours to be interviewed by the Department of Child Services returned home and learned the following day Nola would be theirs.

""She's been a blessing to us ever since"" Tessa said.

Because moms who surrender babies under the state's Safe Haven Law are safe from prosecution not much is known about these babies.

""We just know she was born at a healthy weight without any drugs in her system; she was wrapped in a warm table"" Tessa said. ""She was breastfed before handing her over so we know her mother very much loved her. We also know without Safe Haven baby boxes her outcome could've been very different. We're very thankful for the organization what it stands for and we're especially thankful to have one so close to home. ""

Jennifer and Mario Melgoza drove from Hammond with their daughter Grace who will be 2 in September for the dedication.

""So many mothers have nowhere to turn and don't know about these boxes. Without them we wouldn't have Grace"" Jennifer said as the dark-haired toddler stood near her mother.

The couple had been trying for a year to adopt an older child but were not selected because they had no other children in the home. Then they got the call about Grace.

As it turns out the box that Grace was placed in was just blocks away from the Melgozas' home.

""If given the opportunity I would do nothing more than hug her biological mother and tell her thank you for making the choice she made. And to other mothers who feel they have nowhere to turn there is nothing wrong with choosing this"" she said.

Kelsey explained why she started the Safe Haven Baby Box Foundation. In 1972 a teenage girl was attacked and raped. She identified her attacker and pressed charges. Later she learned she was pregnant. Abortion was illegal and so she and her pregnancy were hidden.

""She gave birth in April 1973 and abandoned her child two hours after she was born and that child was me"" she said. ""So my biological father was a rapist and I was abandoned like a piece of trash but I am still a human being and my life isn't worth less because of the way I was conceived.

""Today I stand on the front lines of this movement taking my pain and turning it into purpose. We've had 11 babies put in our boxes and I think that was a good choice for me to turn my pain into purpose.""

Following Kelsey's remarks Bedford Mayor Sam Craig addressed the large assembly outside the station.

""Today is a great day in Bedford Indiana"" he said to applause. ""We're giving the gift of life today and giving an option for mothers. We're here to help and not pass judgment. We need to support mothers put in this situation.""

After years on Dupont Playa Cabana Hacienda and La Libre closed last month.

A staff member at another Playa location tells blogTO they suspected Playa Cabana Hacienda and La Libre may have been too big to afford during lockdown.

Playa Cabana Hacienda was a two-story taqueria that served Mexican food like tacos tostadas and ceviche. La Libre was a seperate 90-seat backyard patio in the back.

La Libre had a separate kitchen menu and bar that focused on dishes from the Yucatan in southern Mexico.

There continues to be five other restaurants currently operated by the people behind Playa Cabana including the recently opened Bar Esquina.",,,,,,

Mark Eaton of the Utah Jazz seems to have Los Angeles Lakers player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in hand during their NBA playoff game at the Forum in Inglewood California May 8 1988. (AP Photo/Douglas C. Pizac)

For Las Vegas sports fans of a certain age the image is frozen in time.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar dressed in Forum Blue flicking a sky hook toward the basket against the Utah Jazz.

An even bigger guy in a white uniform with purple green and yellow piping flailing his arms in a futile attempt to block it.

History being made as the ball nestled into the net for the 31420th and 31421th points of Abdul-Jabbar’s illustrious career moving him past Wilt Chamberlain atop the NBA’s career scoring list.

The big guy wearing Mardi Gras trim was Mark Eaton who was 64 when he died May 28 after apparently crashing his bicycle in Utah.

“When that picture came out of Kareem scoring and Mark unsuccessfully defending … he thought that was going to be (how he was remembered)” said longtime Las Vegan Laura Herlovich the Jazz’s public relations director during the 1983-84 season when the NBA club helped christen the Thomas & Mack Center by playing 11 home games in Las Vegas.

“As I read the summaries of Mark’s career they’ve been so glowing. Isn’t it nice that his legacy is more than that one unsuccessful blocked shot?”

Despite seldom having gotten off the bench at UCLA Eaton blocked 3064 shots as a pro that twice led to him being named NBA Defensive Player of the Year and once to the league’s all-star team.

He also campaigned on behalf of other retired NBA players and made lasting friendships with contemporary ones such as Jazz current big man Rudy Gobert with whom he shared a passion for pedaling custom-made bicycles around scenic Utah vistas.

According to Herlovich and old game programs Eaton stood 7-foot-4 but will always be remembered in his personal life for never looking down on anybody.

Around the horn

— Kris Bryant is having an MVP-type season for the Cubs that also is giving the team’s miserly owners a major headache.

The former Bonanza High star is part of Chicago’s holy trinity of pending free agents — he Javier Baez and Anthony Rizzo all are in the last year of their contracts. It’s doubtful the Cubs can afford/want to keep all three and it was thought Bryant would be first to go in a trade.

But now he’s hitting .316 with 13 homers and 38 RBIs and the surprising Cubs are in first place.

Surmised Front Office Sports: “Sell Bryant now and the Cubs risk tossing away a division title and postseason run. Hold on to him and they risk a second-half regression — or his decision to walk this winter with all the leverage to find a deal elsewhere.”

These efforts align with the company’s 2030 sustainability targets of certifying its some of it manufacturing facilities worldwide as zero-water discharge. To be deemed zero water discharge sites must discharge less than two percent of their industrial wastewater.









From January 2019 to December 2020 Eaton has saved over 20 million litres of water in Nasik Ahmednagar and Ranjangaon. Through its various measures such as – regular maintenance of water tanks repairing defective water pipes ensuring minimum generation of effluents through continual improvements and theme kaizens; Eaton continuously strives to fulfill its communal responsibility towards water management.

At Nasik facility over 8000 Kiloliter water is conserved with the use of cooling tower storage tank and plumbing lines & chamber leading to seepage of water. Eaton has introduced automatic sensor taps and installed Ozone generator in the ETP & STP at all its sites to efficiently manage water.

Shailendra Shukla Managing Director Vehicle Group India Eaton said “It is our responsibility to use water wisely to help save our planet and the lives that resides in it. We need to focus on reducing our carbon impact and optimizing the operational footprint to support Eaton’s Global 2030 sustainability targets.”

Three Eaton sites in India have been certified as Zero Waste to Landfill – Eaton’s Vehicle Group’s manufacturing facilities at Nashik and Ranjangoan and Eaton’s MTL plant at Chennai. Eaton India Innovation Center (EIIC) was recognised in the CII Environmental Best Practice competition for Life cycle assessment and product stewardship. The project ‘Zero Waste to Landfill’ received CII Environmental Best Practices Award 2020.

Measures implemented at the Ranjangaon plant earned it a “GreenCo Gold” rating from India’s Sohrabji Godrej Green Business Centre works which works with stakeholders to promote industry “green” practices and offer advisory services on the conservation of natural resources. To earn the rating the facility had to score 75-90 percent in all GreenCo rating parameters.

Globally Eaton is working to reduce carbon emissions from its operations by half lower product and supply chain emissions and certify all manufacturing sites as zero-waste-to-landfill to reduce its environmental footprint. To meet these environmental objectives it is adopting innovative technologies including solar panels motorized windows for natural ventilation reflective roofs for low solar gain and a daylight-harvesting system that uses natural light to minimize energy consumption.

Rating: About this rating True Context It's true that the chicken nugget sold for almost $100000 on eBay but as of this writing we don't know the identity of the buyer.

A chicken nugget from a McDonald's BTS-themed meal sold on the online auction site eBay for just a few dollars shy of $100000 and although the concept seemed too outlandish to be true we can confirm.

The chicken nugget sold at the stratospheric price after an intense bidding war that started on May 28 2021 when it was placed by eBay by a seller that appears to be located in Utah. It ended June 4 is viewable on the eBay platform showing that the nugget sold for $99997 just $3 shy of $100000.

The Verge also observed that a factor driving up the price may have been that the nugget was from a McDonald's BTS-themed meal named after the mega-popular K-pop band.

""Among Us"" is a multi-player social deduction video game developed in 2018 by InneSsloth. CNET describes the game like this:

In the game you play as a crew member aboard a spaceship airship sky headquarters or planet base attempting to keep your ship together and return back to Earth. But one crew member has been replaced by a parasitic shape-shifting alien who wants to eliminate the rest of the crew before the ship reaches home. Problem is the imposter looks just like everyone else and will sabotage the ship sneak through vents deceive fellow players and try to frame others all in an attempt to remain undetected and kill off the rest of the crew.

It's true that the chicken nugget in question does in fact look like an ""Among Us"" crew member. Here is a screenshot of the nugget from eBay:

So why all the excitement?

Well this misshapen chicken nugget slightly resembles one of the Among Us characters.

What is Among Us?

Among Us is a multiplayer game for four to 10 players where up to three players are randomly chosen to be the imposter each round.

At the start of the game crewmates are assigned “tasks” to complete around the map in the form of minigames consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as fixing wires and downloading data.

Imposters are given a fake list of tasks to blend in with crewmates. However they cannot legitimately perform tasks.

Imposters can sabotage vital systems (such as the ship’s oxygen supply) covertly travel through vents and work with other Impostors to kill crewmates.

If a player dies they become a ghost.

Rumors about EA’s next Battlefield title have swamped the internet in the months since the first hints of the game began to emerge. With an official reveal event scheduled for June 9 the hype and speculation surrounding the game have risen to new levels.

Ahead of EA’s official event new potential leaks have emerged pointing towards an official title that many weren’t expecting. Despite previous assumptions that the game would simply be called Battlefield 6 a piece of leaked artwork is now indicating the game will bear the name ‘Battlefield 2042.’

Electronic Arts Some fans are speculating the next Battlefield title could be a call-back to Battlefield 2142.

The latest Battlefield leaks came after information from Tom Henderson’s Discord server — Tom being a well-known leaker who has shared information about the upcoming title in the past — was posted to Reddit.

Article continues after ad

While the post’s titled referred to Battlefield 6 it quickly pointed to a new shared title: Battlefield 2042. Information from the leak indicated that the game is set “20 years after Battlefield 4” which would land its setting right around that 2042 timeframe.

Another piece of apparently leaked evidence began to circulate on social media that appeared to corroborate that information: a screenshot of what a leaker claimed was the cover art for the next game which clearly displayed the title ‘Battlefield 2042.’

As these leaks purportedly originated from his Discord server Henderson took to Twitter and issued a series of comments regarding the latest round of information spreading amongst fans.

He shared that after digging into the leak further the new 2042 image seemed to come from a different location than other leaked files and Henderson noted that “although this doesn’t prove or disprove anything I would approach [the new leak] with caution.”

Despite urging fans to take the latest leaks with a grain of salt Henderson did reiterate that EA has already discussed the next Battlefield title’s setting as the “near future” and while it hasn’t officially been confirmed “a 2042 setting is definitely plausible.”

Several shrewd fans also pointed to another link between the proposed 2042 title and an older Battlefield game: Battlefield 2142. Both end with 42 and fans also noticed that Battlefield 2142 was released in 2006 — putting its debut exactly 15 years before this year’s Battlefield release.

Despite the information suggested by these leaks the next game’s official title will likely remain a mystery until EA’s event on June 9.

Overall this might just be one of the most exciting times in the Fortnite community.

Furthermore this season has also fixed some of the biggest gameplay issues that have been bugging the competitive community as well. The state of competitive gameplay has been on the receiving end of harsh criticism from fans. However Epic Games has seen to it that the game features as few issues as possible.

The arcade vibes of sitting on a chair and driving a car with breaks and gear were perhaps the first time we tried driving a car. It’s no surprise that we still remember the good old days of Need For Speed: Most Wanted and Burnout Paradise. We surely cannot miss out on the Colin McRae Rally and Dirt racing game series. The first version came back in 1998.

About Dirt5

The fifth sequel of the Colin McRae Rally and Dirt racing game series saw the publication and development under Codemasters. Initially the game came out for the Sony PlayStation 4 Microsoft Windows and Xbox One on a universal date on the 6th of November 2020. The ninth-generation consoles also got their version where

Xbox Series X|S – 10th of November 2020

Sony PlayStation 5- 12th November 2020 (in Oceania Japan South Korea and North America)

19th November (rest of the world)

19th November (rest of the world) Stadia- 24th March 2021

Codemasters developed a video game for the last time as their former rival Electronic Arts (EA) bought their stocks on the 18th of February 2021.

Players in Dirt5 focused on off-road racing. Genres of various types of race within the game consist of rallycross Stadium Super Trucks ice racing and off-road buggies. Players get a range of locations spanned across the world. Alphabetically they are Arizona (USA) Brazil China Greece Italy Morocco Nepal New York City (USA) Norway and South Africa.

A touch of realism comes with the inclusion of a dynamic weather system and seasons which affect the racing significantly. So in the winter season a player can only compete in ice racing events in New York. Multiplayer reaches another level with an introduction of a four-player split-screen system.

Dirt 6 Release Date for PS5 Xbox Series X & Windows: When Is It Coming Out

Looking at the recent release of Dirt5 it seems that new owners EA (Electronic Arts) would focus on popularising the game and work on its marketing with events and tournaments taking place. The rumoured Dirt6 would take some time to come into the market. The release of Dirt5 in Stadia can present the image that the fifth part of the game is here to stay for some time.

But let us look at the pattern of all the release dates of titles under the Dirt racing game series:

Colin McRae: Dirt (2007)

Colin McRae: Dirt 2 (2009)

Dirt 3 (2011)

Dirt: Showdown (2012)

Colin McRae Rally (2013)

Dirt Rally (2015)

Dirt 4 (2017)

Dirt Rally 2.0 (2019)

Dirt 5 (2020)

Keeping this chronology in mind we can expect either a Dirt Rally 3.0 on the horizon which can come 2022 or perhaps 2023. When it comes to Dirt 6 we can expect the game not to release before 2023 (or perhaps 2024.) Electronic Arts (EA) would be profiting from the current latest title of the racing game series.

Migraine recurrence rates associated with INP104 were 7.1% and 14.3% at 24 hours and 48 hours respectively reported Stewart Tepper MD of Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth in Hanover New Hampshire in a post hoc analysis of data from the STOP 301 study.

Previous STOP 301 findings showed that 38.0% of patients reported pain freedom 52.1% reported freedom from their most bothersome symptom and 66.3% reported pain relief at 2 hours for their first INP104-treated migraine.

""The INP104 device propels DHE to a capillary-rich area in the upper nose for optimal drug delivery by the use of an HFA propellant"" Tepper said.

""One of the most useful features of DHE is that it tends to give a complete acute migraine treatment that is a pain-free response without return of headache and without need for retreatment or rescue medication -- a one-and-done outcome"" he told MedPage Today.

""Migraine recurrence was defined differently in different acute studies in the past which is why the International Headache Society definition of sustained pain freedom is now the standard"" Tepper added. ""However no matter how recurrence is defined the INP104 formulation of DHE resulted in high sustained results and low recurrence as predicted for acute treatment of migraine with DHE.""

STOP 301 was a pivotal phase III open-label study that evaluated the safety tolerability and exploratory efficacy of INP104. The trial enrolled 360 patients at 36 sites in the U.S. who had a documented diagnosis of migraine with or without aura and at least two attacks per month for the previous 6 months.

Participants were provided with up to three doses per week of INP104 (1.45 mg in a dose of two sprays) to administer nasally with migraine attacks. They completed daily electronic diaries to capture headache and migraine details headache medication usage and most bothersome symptom severity.

In the post hoc analyses researchers used self-reported STOP 301 data collected over 24 weeks. Among people who reported pain freedom 2 hours after using INP104 recurrence was defined as the percentage with onset of a new headache within 24 or 48 hours; sustained pain freedom was defined as the percentage with no other headache 24 or 48 hours post-INP104.

Of 126 patients who reported pain freedom 2 hours after using INP104 for their first treated migraine nine people reported recurrence at 24 hours and 18 people reported recurrence at 48 hours.

A total of 117 people (35.2%) reported sustained pain freedom at 24 hours and 108 people (32.5%) reported sustained pain freedom at 48 hours post-INP104.

Rescue medication use was reported by 18.2% of patients for their first INP104-treated migraine. Only non-ergot non-triptan acute treatments were allowed as rescue medication for patients who still had headache pain and only after 2 hours had elapsed since INP104 administration.

STOP 301's limitations include its reliance on self-reported data. INP104 has an FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of Sept. 6 2021 developer Impel NeuroPharma said. If approved INP104 will be marketed under the trade name Trudhesa in the U.S.

The stock of iRobot (NAS:IRBT 30-year Financials) appears to be modestly undervalued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $97.55 per share and the market cap of $2.7 billion iRobot stock shows every sign of being modestly undervalued. GF Value for iRobot is shown in the chart below.





iRobot Stock Is Estimated To Be Modestly Undervalued

Because iRobot is relatively undervalued the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth which averaged 17.6% over the past five years.

Since investing in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss investors must carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. iRobot has a cash-to-debt ratio of 9.11 which ranks better than 76% of the companies in Hardware industry. Based on this GuruFocus ranks iRobot's financial strength as 7 out of 10 suggesting fair balance sheet. This is the debt and cash of iRobot over the past years:

It is less risky to invest in profitable companies especially those with consistent profitability over long term. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. iRobot has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months the company had a revenue of $1.5 billion and earnings of $6.06 a share. Its operating margin is 11.22% which ranks better than 77% of the companies in Hardware industry. Overall the profitability of iRobot is ranked 8 out of 10 which indicates strong profitability. This is the revenue and net income of iRobot over the past years:

iRobot Stock Is Estimated To Be Modestly Undervalued

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. iRobot's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 88% of the companies in Hardware industry. iRobot's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 22.8% which ranks better than 76% of the companies in Hardware industry.

Another way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months iRobot's ROIC was 29.48 while its WACC came in at 8.63.

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. Tencent Holdings's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 76% of the companies in Interactive Media industry. Tencent Holdings's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 27% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Interactive Media industry.

Another way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months Tencent Holdings's ROIC was 11.82 while its WACC came in at 8.25. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Tencent Holdings is shown below:

Tencent Holdings Stock Appears To Be Fairly Valued

As of 9 a.m. Friday Lake Ouachita was at 578.67 feet above mean sea level having dropped 0.13 feet over the previous 24 hours. The full pool level is 578 feet msl.

""In order to prepare for the additional expected rainfall in our area next week the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has requested for us to maximize flows from Blakely Mountain Dam in an effort to draw Lake Ouachita down below the Flood Pool as quickly as possible"" Entergy Hydro Operations said in an email earlier this week.

""This will result in flows exceeding 10000 CFS (cubic feet per second of water) out of Remmel Dam throughout the weekend. Flows of this magnitude could endanger the general public if they were to attempt to float the river and damage vehicles left in the tailrace area of Remmel Dam. We will therefore be required to cancel the recreational releases for Saturday June 5 and Sunday June 6 and restrict vehicle access to the tailrace area over the weekend"" it said.

While the paved road to the Ouachita River Access will be closed the footpath to the river will remain open for those who wish to fish from the bank of the river or to view the increased flows it said.

Entergy intends to provide recreational flows of approximately 3600 CFS the following weekend and will add additional weekdays of recreational flow this summer to make up for canceling this weekend's release the email said.

Entergy said to check its Facebook page or to visit http://www.entergy.com/operations_information/hydro/flow_releases for updated flow release plans.

""We advise lakefront property owners and downstream river users to be aware of the weather and understand that this is a flash flood-prone river valley. Please take the appropriate precautions against flash flooding"" it said.

Entergy normally closes the vehicle access gate to the area below Remmel Dam for safety reasons at 10 p.m. and reopens it at around 5 a.m. daily.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW5uaW5ndG9uYmFubmVyLmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL3N0dWRlbnQtc3VjY2Vzcy1jZWxlYnJhdGVkLWF0LXN1bnJpc2UvYXJ0aWNsZV9kZDBmNWUzNC1jNTY0LTExZWItYWVhYi1jM2U0NjVlYjI0ZWIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Student success celebrated at Sunrise | Local News | benningtonbanner.com,"If you'd like to leave a comment (or a tip or a question) about this story with the editors please email us

The latest dark kitchen startup to raise new funding is Curb a one-year-old Nordic startup which currently runs four kitchens across Sweden and Denmark. The company has today announced it’s secured €20m in new funding from Point72 Ventures and EQT Ventures.

Curb’s funding follows French dark kitchen startup Taster’s $37m round in April. In January Deliveroo announced it’s set to double its number of dark kitchens and Spanish company Glovo also continues to expand its kitchen network.

“The pandemic has put the industry ahead maybe four or five years” says Curb’s founder Carl Tengberg.

“But I’m excited not solely because of the pandemic’s effect but because of the inefficiencies we see that can be solved meaning we have better concepts at lower prices and available to more people.”

Curb creates brands specifically to sell on delivery apps. It’s developed nine brands so far and Tengberg says the company has “many more” in development.

He says the success of the dark kitchen model will be built on the changing habits of younger generations and building brands that cater to their tastes precisely is what will make companies successful.

“If out of 25 meals a week people order 15 of those via food delivery it has to go beyond burgers and pizza. It has to be a much more personalised experience and to offer much more choice so what we’re trying to figure out” Tengberg says.

To do that they deconstruct the components needed to make a good brand from the food itself to the marketing and visuals; as well as from what customers want to order to how the kitchen can produce the food in the most efficient manner.

Curb’s focus is on collecting data and analytics on all stages of these processes to measure precisely what works and what doesn’t. The idea is to create brands that reflect precisely what the customer wants not what they think the customer wants Tengberg says.

“The power of data accumulates with the amount of data. We are able to draw conclusions already but the bigger we get and the more data we get then the more brand conclusions we can make.”

Curb isn’t the only dark kitchen startup to be heavily data focused. Kbox the London-based company backed by Balderton and Hoxton Ventures which develops brands in kitchens with spare capacity has platforms to monitor food brands’ performance.

It learns what impact external events (like the weather) and promotions have on orders on delivery platforms enabling kitchens to change their prices based on demand and better forecast demand.

Tengberg says the data approach will start to move into more traditional restaurants soon too.

“We’re only at the very start of this but I think [that between] the way a kitchen is operating now and how it’ll be operated in 2035 we’ll see a huge shift in the definition of what a restaurant is — but also in terms of operations and what’s possible to produce in a space.”

Curb says it will use the new funding to continue developing its tech as well investing in operations and hiring more staff. It’s looking at expanding across geographies too both within and outside of Scandinavia.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Rebuilding Together Philadelphia selects a community partner to do the recruiting for eligible homeowners and choose a block. In this case ACHIEVEability a social services program specializing in housing for low-income single-parent and homeless families teamed up with the organization. Then Rebuilding Together staff evaluates the homes and comes to agreements with the homeowners. When that is done subcontractors are lined up for the more specialized work. The last step is the “block build” which is when the volunteers do their work.

Seldin said the pandemic only intensified the need for revitalization work like this.

“When everyone was forced to stay at home you really realize how important it is to have a safe and healthy home” Seldin said. “If you don’t have running water how can you wash your hands during a pandemic? If you have no heat and you can’t go anywhere else what are you going to do? Housing really has been proven during the pandemic to be health care.”

Imani Hamilton from North Philadelphia has been a volunteer with Rebuilding Together Philadelphia for about a decade. She said she enjoys the work because of how personal it is.

“You get to work and see directly who’s being impacted” Hamilton said. “Not only are you helping to beautify the bathroom paint or lay floors down but you’re actually working alongside the homeowners.”

At Spradley’s house Friday at least seven volunteers were at work. She had a smile on her face the entire time watching the repairs she’s needed for so long become a reality.

At one point she looked across the street and saw volunteers go into her neighbor’s house. She stopped in the doorway a bit to gaze at her block.

“I’m just glad that it’s able to be done” Spradley said. “I’m glad for my neighbors who needed things done and were able to get it done because they were neglected or just couldn’t afford it.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The supermodel will appear in flagship brand Estée Lauder’s makeup and skincare campaigns across digital in-store TV and print with her first campaign to be revealed in July.

“Adut is one of fashion’s biggest and most influential stars” said The Estee Lauder Companies President and Estée Lauder and Aerin Global Brand President Stéphane de La Faverie. “We believe her incredible story personality and beauty will help us continue to inspire and connect with our consumers and establish her as a beauty icon of her generation.”

Akech is one of fashion’s highly-rated supermodels and was awarded Model of the Year at the 2019 The Fashion Awards. She was also included on the TIME 100 Next List in the same year.

The 21-year-old spent her early days as a refugee in the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. Adut and her family eventually emigrated to Adelaide Australia where she eventually joined a local modeling agency as a student.

She has appeared in campaigns for Bottega Veneta Fendi Givenchy Marc Jacobs Moschino Saint Laurent Valentino Versace and Chanel and regularly appears on fashion magazine covers.

Outside of her fashion career Adut recently began working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to promote causes that support refugees worldwide. She hopes that her own story can serve as an inspiration for many to become more invested in alleviating the plight of refugees.

Speaking on being named Estée Lauder’s newest Global Brand Ambassador Adut Akech said: “To be part of the Estée Lauder family is a dream come true. Estée Lauder has such an amazing heritage and the story of Mrs. Estée Lauder continues to be an inspiration to women around the world. Like her I hope to inspire girls everywhere to never give up on following their dreams.”

But the digital platform is not so easy to navigate for the retailers that try to use it to sell their wares.

""[Amazon's] business is figuring out different ways the consumer can shop on their platform and buy as many products as possible so when you talk about the seller the seller has a tougher job on their hands than the consumer"" said Darrin Levine founder of retail management software company Asdal.

Levine 26 first started working on software and e-commerce programs during a college project. He launched Asdal in 2017 and it was a finalist in 2019 for Meda's Million Dollar Challenge. It has grown to have more than 20 employees who work mostly remotely and helps retailers achieve an average of $67000 in monthly gross revenue in less than 16 months.

The company headquartered in north Minneapolis has a goal to help direct-to-consumer retailers better manage their digital stores on a range of online marketplaces including Amazon Etsy Shopify and Instagram.

Especially after the acceleration of e-commerce adoption by consumers during the pandemic Levine said his company's mission has become more urgent as it focuses on helping retailers use online platforms more efficiently and make sense of data.

""The digital market is here now"" Levine said as he walked Nicollet Mall with a couple of his business partners. ""COVID sped that adaption up. Grandmas are buying stuff online now grandpas are buying stuff online and when baby boomers are starting to buy stuff online go!""

Specialty retailers unlike the big-box stores that many have flocked to during the pandemic will increasingly become what consumers turn to online as their shopping patterns change Levine said.

""No one is is really here fighting for these retailers these up-and-coming retailers. … These specialty retailers what they have that the Amazons and the Targets will never have they have these humanistic bonds [to their customers]"" Levine said.

Asdal has developed four versions of a suite of programs called Grit that offers retailers a platform to address account management sales tracking marketing data and analytics customer service logistics and more depending on how much assistance the client needs.

In the last few weeks Asdal has released its most comprehensive service Grit Automation. With the service the company's staff works with partners including e-commerce company Ecom Capital to help clients develop a product create brand identity and marketing build the supply chain and sell the product online.

""It's basically doing everything A to Z for a client somebody who has wanted to get into the space almost like a different aspect of investing if you want to say"" said Levi Strowder another partner at Asdal who works to get new clients.

Besides working with clients from big to small Asdal also intentionally tries to support minority-run companies said Levine who is Black. It is still hard for minority-owned startups to obtain venture capital in the Twin Cities he said.

""It's still political for no reason and so underrepresented for Blacks"" Levine said.

The economic issues caused by the pandemic did affect Asdal. The company charged less for some of its services because so many retail clients were hurting including some clients that they consulted. Soon Asdal plans to expand internationally to integrate into online marketplaces in other countries.

""There's almost an Amazon in every corner of the world now"" Levine said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYWxhYmFtYWJhcHRpc3Qub3JnL21pc3Npc3NpcHBpLWNyYWZ0c21hbi13aXRoLWhlbHAtZnJvbS1mYW1pbHktc2hhcmVzLWZhaXRoLXRocm91Z2gtbWV0YWwtc2lnbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mississippi craftsman with help from family shares faith through metal signs,"When an elderly wood carver was asked how he could whittle a dog out of a block of wood he replied “Well the dog was in there all the time. I just helped him come out.”

“This is basically the same approach to crafting ironwork decorations from 14-gauge steel” says Alan Moore of Houston Mississippi owner of Iron Works of Houston which produces metal designs many with a Christian theme.

When people think of “ironwork” they may visualize more of a structural form such as steel beams in a building. Moore’s work is typically more creative — home decorations as well as farm and ranch signs and address markers.

Sharing verses

Many of the designs give Moore an opportunity to share Bible verses or inspirational thoughts and thus share his faith with those who browse his work on Facebook or Etsy.

“I like to think that when people read a Bible verse or see an inspirational thought they are reminded that God loves them” says Moore.

As a young boy growing up in west Tennessee Moore mowed grass for neighbors to earn spending money. As a teen he restored antique cars. His love of math led him to pharmacy school and he worked 35 years as a pharmacist.

A good fit

In 2016 Moore began working with iron … “to keep my sanity” he said. The hobby also seemed a good fit because his son Ross attended welding school. Metalwork seemed like a good opportunity for father and son to spend time together.

“I never thought about it becoming a second career” Moore said.

But that’s just what has happened and the entire family is involved. In addition to Ross’ help Moore’s daughter Kali a nurse in Tupelo often provides inspirational thoughts for his designs.

Today Iron Works of Houston is known from coast to coast and internationally. His metal Christmas nativity designs are especially popular.

While Moore and his wife Lesa were visiting a “Jerusalem House of Prayer for all Nations” in Israel he was approached about supplying signs that say: “It is well with my soul” and “Speak Lord your servant is listening” (1 Sam. 3:10).

These signs now hang in the House of Prayer in Jerusalem where those who visit from around the world are reminded of God’s greatness.

“When tourists visit the church I hope these Bible verses and other inspirational thoughts will make a difference in the life of those who read them” Moore said.

Moore and his family are active members of First Baptist Church Houston Mississippi where Moore participates in Mississippi Baptist Disaster Relief missions projects and other ministries where his pharmacy background is a great help.

Greg Simmons FBC Houston student minister said “Alan is always ready to work with church programs and encourages others to step up.”

Recently Moore discovered an ancestor known as Black Jack McKnight from the mid-1800s who was the blacksmith in west Tennessee. In his shop McKnight not only took care of horses he also repaired metal farm equipment.

“Perhaps working with iron is in my DNA and I’m just now finding it out” says Moore.

London-based Depop’s acquisition by Brooklyn-based Etsy for $1.6bn (£1.1bn) last week came just days after Oxford-based WaveOptics a maker of displays used in augmented-reality glasses was bought up by the Santa Monica-headquartered owner of Snapchat for $500m.

Depop may not be of such strategic importance to the UK economy as the likes of Arm or fellow chip-maker Imagination Technologies both bought by foreign buyers. But its 30 million users – a number that has tripled in less than three years – are mostly under 26 and mark out the future direction of retail: more online sustainable and social.

London crowed about securing the listing of Deliveroo where the poor performance of the share price has reflected concerns about the welfare of its thousands of delivery drivers. Depop marked out a more hopeful future – but with it now in Etsy’s hands British retailers have no obvious way of following the lead of John Lewis and then Marks & Spencer which invested in Ocado enabling both to buy their way into the fast-growing world of online grocery shopping.

Initially Depop was a tale of triumph for the UK. Entrepreneur Simon Beckerman founded the company in Italy in 2011 but moved to London in 2015 after winning $8m in funding from Balderton Capital the UK-based investment firm which has previously backed Betfair and the online lingerie specialist Figleaves.

The business now has offices as far afield as New York and Sydney but is led from the UK where it built its market from an aesthetic steeped in British fashion trends from Burberry coats and chunky trainers fit for a Spice Girl to Y2K fashions born out of clubs in London and Manchester.

Technology is enabling growth in the market as parents sell baby clothes via Facebook and young people trade sought-after trainers from their own Instagram shops

It taps into Generation Z’s obsession with “side hustles” – a way to earn money outside one’s day-to-day life. Trading in cast-offs is a rapidly expanding activity expected to grow 15-20% a year for the next five years outgrowing fast fashion.

That growth is not only fuelling more established players such as eBay but generating new entrants such as Vinted Poshmark and The RealReal which provide a challenge to traditional high street brands.

The resale market is becoming increasingly mainstream with even the UK supermarket Asda trying out secondhand sections in stores in partnership with Preloved Vintage Wholesale. Department store John Lewis furnishings group Ikea and sports retailer Decathlon are all experimenting with resale businesses too.

Technology is enabling that growth as parents sell baby clothes via Facebook and young people trade sought-after trainers from their own Instagram shops. Selfridges now has an outlet for vintage fashion specialist Vestiaire Collective while handbag label Mulberry is refurbishing and reselling its used products online.

Etsy is to allow Depop to continue as a standalone business run by the existing team from London. That is some good news at least for jobs and knowhow in the UK although with upstarts such as Vinted and Asos’s marketplace already on its tail it’s not clear if Etsy will enable Depop to keep its edgy underground feel.

The change in ownership also will not prevent young UK entrepreneurs developing via Depop skills in online selling design and merchandising that could lay the foundations for new standalone businesses.

There is hope the UK can capitalise on their expertise to keep the resale sector on British shores even if we can’t compete with the deep pockets of the US tech giants.

AMC cinemas become star of their own Wall Street drama

What do you do when legions of small investors are buying your company’s shares to use as a stick with which to beat Wall Street? The answer for AMC Entertainment – the world’s largest cinema company and owner of the Odeon chain in the UK – is to make sure they’re buying at least some of that stock from you.

AMC has become a focal point for amateur investors coordinating via Twitter and Reddit to buy shares in previously unpopular companies – called “meme stocks” – hoping to catch pantomime-villain hedge funds in a “short squeeze”.

When the same thing happened to GameStop the US video game retailer was little more than a passenger in the proceedings.

AMC is trying to ride the tiger. In January it escaped bankruptcy thanks to a $917m debt-and-equity cash-raising exercise. Now instead of thinking about survival it is capitalising on the surge in its stock price to issue more new shares at higher values that it could otherwise have achieved. It has even offered investors free popcorn.

Cash from new investors can be used to pay down some of the rescue debt and even to expand.

Last Tuesday it sold stock for $230.5m to Mudrick Capital Management (a hedge fund ironically) having previously raised $428m in mid-May when the small-investor frenzy began lifting its share price. And on Thursday it filed to sell 11.5 million more shares.

Speaking via Twitter increasingly the platform of choice for market-moving statements chief executive Adam Aron said this was “not mindless dilution but rather this is very smart raising of cash so that we can grow this company”.

He is banking on vaccinations and a pent-up flurry of blockbuster movies to deliver a dramatic turnaround for a firm that looked like a total turkey just a few months ago.

Whether one sees the “meme stock” phenomenon epitomised by GameStop and AMC as an exercise in futility borderline market manipulation or a welcome piece of anti-Wall Street online activism Aron seems to have found a solution that works for AMC. It may not be long before his own cinemas are showing the movie.

Exxon chief on short leash after shareholder uprising

ExxonMobil’s chief executive Darren Woods has has the dubious honour of overseeing probably the most calamitous period in the oil giant’s history since taking the reins a little over four years ago. Under his watch the company has lost a third of its market value been ousted from the Dow Jones index and reported its first annual loss since Exxon and Mobil merged in 1998.

But it is Woods’s handling of ExxonMobil’s first major shareholder rebellion that is likely to raise questions over his future at the helm of America’s biggest oil company. Engine No 1 the upstart hedge fund that toppled three senior business figures from the Exxon board last week did not target Woods. But its boardroom coup has been seen by industry observers as a clear indictment of his leadership.

Engine No 1 put forward four alternative board members after accusing Exxon of failing to adapt to the climate crisis – and the company’s largest shareholders agreed. Investors may be willing to forgive Woods for inheriting a difficult situation before the Covid-19 oil slump but his failure to set a future-proof vision for navigating the transition to low-carbon energy has become deeply worrying for its long-term institutional stakeholders which include some of the biggest money managers in the world.

Woods survived the boardroom battle because a greater concern – over the short term – would be losing the chief executive at a time of major upheaval for the board and when existential decisions for the company still hang in the balance. Shareholders voted in favour of his position on the board at the annual meeting but the disruption has assured that this future will be far tougher than he expected.

Before next year’s meeting Woods will need to prove that he is up to the challenge and set out a clear future for one of the world’s biggest climate polluters in a net-zero-carbon world. The chief executive may be down but he is not out. Yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYnV5LXQtcmV4LWFybXMtY2hpY2tlbnMtMDQwMDAwMjY1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Can Buy T-Rex Arms For Your Chickens And I Can't Stop Laughing,"There’s more to raising chickens than buying a backyard coop and decorating it with some charming amenities. Chickens require entertainment as well not just for their happiness but for their overall health. A lack of stimulation can lead to physical and behavioral issues for these birds such as bullying obesity and feather pulling. This is especially true during the winter months when the colder weather limits their typical activities. Luckily there are plenty of toys for chickens available that are specifically designed to keep boredom at bay.

The most ideal chicken toys are ones that engage their senses and activate their instincts. Foraging toys are particularly popular for chickens as they encourage play with their beaks and claws. Some of these include places to hide treats and others are simply appealing due to their various textures and bright colors. If you’re looking to really get your chickens moving you could also opt for a swing ladder or even a jungle gym to inspire them into physical activity. Whichever route you choose you’ll be making a good investment in the well-being of your chickens. On top of their new toys just remember that they’ll also appreciate interaction from their owners whether it’s cleaning their coop or just saying hello.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0dWZmLmNvLm56L2J1c2luZXNzL3Byb3NwZXIvMTI1MzExNDk1L2Nob29pY2Utd2Vic2l0ZS1jaGFsa3MtdXAtMi1taWxsaW9uLWluLXNhbGVzLWZvci01NjAwLWFzcGlyaW5nLWVudHJlcHJlbmV1cnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chooice website chalks up $2 million in sales for 5600 aspiring entrepreneurs,

MERIDEN Conn. — Emergency crews were called out Saturday morning after a car hit a pole and brought down wires and lead to the road being closed.

The crash happened on Broad Street and Gale Avenue around 5:30 am. A car hit a utility pole according to police and wires came down as a result closing the road. One man was sent to Hartford Hospital where he is in stable condition.

Sgt. Stanley Zajac Meriden Police said speed was a factor in the crash ""About 5:30 this morning the car ... was traveling southbound on Broad Street obviously speed was an issue here slight curve in the road wasn't able to negotiate the curve and hit two telephone poles. The two telephone poles were right next to each other part of the telephone pole went through the window of that building behind us. And the car landed down the street further.""

Police said the driver Franklin Ortiz of Meriden was unconscious and live wires were on the car after the crash which delayed him being extricated.

Police said he was in serious but stable condition.

The road reopened Saturday evening after repairs were made by Eversource.

And no I'm not talking about a hotel room.

Instead JetBlue's brand-new Mint business class is now flying in an all-suite configuration.

The New York-based carrier first unveiled the next-generation product back in February and like its TPG Award-winning predecessor the second-generation of Mint features two types of seats.

In JetBlue's original biz cabin seats alternated between a 2-2 and 1-1 configuration with four lucky flyers scoring a private suite.

Mint 2.0 gives everyone a private suite with a sliding door. Thanks to its 1-1 arrangement the new Mint is noticeably more private and spacious.

If you're looking for the utmost personal space you'll want to snag one of the two ""studios"" in the bulkhead row 1. The extra space comes at an added cost but it could definitely be worth the upcharge for longer trips.

When JetBlue's new Mint entered service on June 1 I sat — and reviewed — one of the studios on the inaugural from New York-JFK to Los Angeles (LAX).

For the return to my home in New York City I flew the following day in a standard Mint suite. Read on for how it went.

Booking

Booking a ticket in the new Mint will require a bit of patience and persistence.

For now the airline's got just one jet flying with the new Mint an Airbus A321neo registered N2105J and christened ""a NEO Mintality.""

The A321LD as it's referred to internally is being deployed exclusively between JFK and Los Angeles on select frequencies. More of these jets are expected to be delivered in the coming months so it's possible JetBlue expands the new Mint's footprint beyond this route.

To see if your flight will feature the new Mint check the seat map and look for the 1-1 configuration in the pointy end of the plane.

When JetBlue first announced the inaugural I quickly booked a one-way ticket home in the Mint suite.

The fare totaled $877.40 and I purchased it using the Platinum Card® from American Express to maximize the card's 5x bonus on airfare.

Though you can redeem JetBlue TrueBlue points for Mint I'd recommend saving them for more valuable economy redemptions. TPG values TrueBlue points at 1.3 cents per point but Mint redemptions typically hover around 25% below our valuations.

As a Mosaic elite member I earned 3x base points 3x Mosaic bonus points and a 3x direct booking bonus for the one-way ticket totaling roughly 7200 TrueBlue points worth $94 according to TPG's valuations.

When booking the new Mint cabin you'll have a choice between the Mint suite or an upsell to the studio. The additional collection for the studio on the JFK to LAX route is currently $199 and you can read my full review to see if you think it's worth it.

Though JetBlue's new Mint cabin is currently only available on the A321LD it'll make its way to London when the carrier's first transatlantic flights launch on Aug. 11 onboard the A321LR or long-range.

My afternoon with JetBlue began at LAX's Terminal 5.

I quickly found the carrier's empty ticket counter and received my printed boarding pass moments after stepping into the dedicated Mint and Mosaic priority check-in queue.

From there it was only a short walk to security. Both the Clear and Precheck lanes were open when I visited and I was airside shortly thereafter.

I arrived with about an hour to spare before boarding so after quickly peeking at Gate 50 I made a beeline for the Tom Bradley International Terminal (TBIT) to check out the new Amex Centurion Lounge that I reviewed just before the pandemic.

Unfortunately the lounge is still closed for indoor seating. Instead the issuer is offering a selection of takeaway sandwiches so I picked one up and retraced my steps to the gate.

I accessed the Centurion Lounge with the Amex Platinum Card — JetBlue doesn't operate any lounges nor does it offer any lounge access with its partners.

I also hold a Priority Pass membership so I could've theoretically visited the Alaska Lounge in Terminal 6. I wanted to be one of the first onboard though so I just waited patiently at the gate.

You wouldn't have been able to tell that the plane was about to operate its fourth-ever commercial flight. There was just one inflight entertainment engineer who was visibly excited about trying the new cabin. The rest of the passengers were just ready to get to New York.

Boarding began promptly at 2:16 p.m. local time and I was back onboard ""a NEO Mintality"" roughly 24 hours since parting ways after the inaugural.

You'll notice that the ground experience in this review scores higher than the outbound from New York. Though JetBlue doesn't offer lounge access LAX has a plethora of airside membership lounges that are easily accessible with the right credit cards.

JetBlue's new Mint business class is outfitted in a 1-1 configuration meaning that every seat is a private suite.

The two pods in row one are designated as studios and offer added space more storage a larger 22-inch TV and more for an additional charge on top of the standard Mint fare.

For this leg I was flying ""in the back.""

The standard Mint suites occupy rows 2 through 8 and all suites seats are roughly identical. They're each based on the Thompson VantageSolo seat and customized exclusively for JetBlue.

The only difference between suites is the number of windows and location within the cabin.

I selected suite 8F the last row seat on the starboard side of the plane. This way I'd get a good overview of the cabin and service flow without disrupting other passengers with my photography. Note that row 8 is missing a window which surprisingly didn't bother this aviation enthusiast all that much.

Despite the aisle-facing herringbone configuration I was still able to gaze out the sole window without needing to twist my neck too much.

Though I didn't mind the missing window I'll still avoid row 8 going forward.

The proximity to the lavatory and walk-up pantry was bothersome. The bathroom door kept opening and closing allowing the noxious odors to spread quickly to my seat.

Additionally the line for the lavatory often spilled into Mint cabin which could get uncomfortable since you're facing the aisle.

When I flew in the studio on the inaugural I noted that the bulkhead location means that you get an up-close view of the crew working in the galley.

Row 8 was the exact opposite — I couldn't've been further from the crew which would definitely be my preference on red-eye flights.

That's why I'll likely choose a suite in row 6 or 7 going forward — far from both the crew and the mid-cabin lavatory.

As for the seat itself it measures 22 inches wide which was definitely large enough for my average-sized frame.

One drawback to a herringbone configuration is that the seat can feel a bit claustrophobic. Despite comfortably fitting into the seat I felt a bit cramped around my shoulders when reclining.

The feeling of claustrophobia is exacerbated by the fact that neither of the seat's armrests can be raised or lowered. I personally couldn't find a comfortable position for my elbows while working in the reclined position.

Speaking of working the tray table swivels out from underneath the side table at the push of a button. It measures 17 inches wide and 12 inches long plenty large for my 13-inch MacBook Pro.

In terms of storage you'll find a narrow tray that slides out from below the seat-back monitor. It comfortably fit my laptop and some cords but it wasn't deep enough to store my charging brick.

There's a second enclosed storage area to the right of the seat. This triangle-shaped compartment was large enough to store my glasses and other loose items.

You can also leave some larger items on the side table but be sure that they don't move around during turbulence.

There are two places to store your shoes during the flight either in the exposed compartment underneath the seat's ottoman or in the purpose-built container on the side of the seat.

You'll find the ease-to-use seat controls at elbow level. As you'd expect for a brand-new plane the buttons were incredibly responsive. Despite inadvertently bumping into the seat controls with my arm the panel only responded to my fingers thankfully.

Perhaps the biggest improvement in the new Mint is that each suite features a sliding door for added privacy.

Though the door rises just 44 inches from the ground it was a great way to avoid staring at my aisle-mate throughout the flight.

The attention to detail on the pod's walls creates an elevated and luxurious feeling similar to the design of the doors in Qatar's Qsuite.

Each Mint seat converts into a lie-flat bed at the touch of a button.

When fully reclined the bed measures 76 inches long. My nearly six-foot frame fit perfectly but taller passengers will likely have a harder time getting comfortable.

The footwell area could pose a problem for those with long feet — it's just 13 inches tall.

The bed itself did the trick for an hour-long nap before landing. I was tired so it wasn't too hard to fall asleep. I'll reserve full judgment until I try the bed on a red-eye hop.

However if you're a side sleeper or get claustrophobic in tight spaces you'll likely have a much harder time sleeping in the new Mint suite. Because of the seat's configuration there's limited space to wiggle around at hip and knee level.

I did appreciate that the bed was well-padded thanks to the built-in Tuft & Needle mattress pad. It's a night-and-day difference from the inflatable cushions in the legacy Mint seats.

There's one standard-sized lavatory for Mint passengers at the front of the cabin as well as one shared with coach flyers next to the snack bar behind row 8.

All in all the Mint suite is a considerable improvement compared to the legacy product. The seats are significantly more private offer more storage and are decked out with modernized touches.

Though it doesn't win the transcon war — that title goes to the Mint studio — it brings a top-notch seat to an incredibly competitive market. If you don't get too claustrophobic you can't go wrong with the new Mint suite.

JetBlue's Mint suite is decked out with tons of flyer-friendly amenities.

Waiting at my seat during boarding was the carrier's new Wanderfuel-branded amenity kit. We were given the renewal-themed kit which included an assortment of trendy products like Supergoop everyday cream and Mist Lumion's facial mist.

The snooze kit which includes an eye mask earplugs and dental kit was also waiting at my seat.

Each seat is equipped with two AC power outlets one USB-A and one USB-C port which is capable of charging devices at higher speeds than the older USB standard.

There's also a Qi wireless charging mat built into the side of the seat. Finding the right alignment to charge my iPhone wasn't easy but I had no problem wirelessly charging my AirPods case.

Every Mint suite comes with a Tuft & Needle pillow and blanket which are both quite comfortable for a transcon business-class flight.

JetBlue's inflight entertainment system is one of the most robust in the skies. Plus it's entirely free even in coach.

Mint suites each feature a 17-inch high-definition television which swivels toward the seat. It can be tilted downwards for easy viewing while in bed. Plus it can be used during taxi takeoff and landing without needing to be locked into its original position.

JetBlue uses a Thales-powered IFE system which is loaded with 145 movies and 89 TV shows as well as over 100 live DirecTV channels. With on-demand play-and-pause functionality you'll never miss that important scene.

You have three options for controlling the television. You can either use your fingers wirelessly pair your phone as a remote or use the seat's built-in remote control. Unfortunately the physical remote isn't currently working in the Mint suite cabin though the carrier is aware of the issue and working on a fix.

JetBlue's latest IFE software also includes a personalization feature that some have called ""creepy."" It asks you to verify your name and date of birth before linking with your frequent flyer account to pull your recommended picks.

While the system has worked for me in the past I was misidentified on this flight. No I hadn't changed my name to Richard.

Though you're welcome to bring your own headphones JetBlue provides a pair of above-average Master and Dynamic noise-isolating ones for your use during flight.

Though JetBlue's A321LD is equipped with the latest ViaSat-2 satellite receiver the plane's Wi-Fi network wasn't working as seamlessly as you'd expect.

Just like the inaugural the day before the network was spotty at best and I had trouble connecting to some apps like Slack and Outlook. Others worked just fine like browsing the web or scrolling through my Instagram feed.

Despite the connectivity hiccups I managed to capture multiple speed tests with downloads blazing past 70 Mbps and uploads around 1 Mbps.

Once JetBlue fixes the network issue this plane will provide some of the best inflight speeds you'll find in the sky. The best part? JetBlue's Wi-Fi is free for all passengers not just those seated in Mint.

Despite setting a very high bar the day before JetBlue's food and beverage service consistently knocks it out of the park.

Even since JetBlue introduced its refreshed Mint ""soft product"" in November 2020 it's been hard to find a better meal in the sky and in some cases on the ground than in the carrier's biz cabin.

The carrier's budding partnership with New York-based Delicious Hospitality Group (DHG) just received a revamp to coincide with the carrier's big lie-flat launch: JetBlue's now serving food from a DHG staple Pasquale Jones. Previously the menu features highlights from Charlie Bird another DHG restaurant.

Menus were waiting at the seat during boarding and flight attendants came through the aisles once we crossed 10000 feet to take our orders.

The Mint fare is served tapas-style with a choice of three out of five small plates. On this flight I selected the burrata warm tomato tart and sea trout.

Though I raved about my food on the inaugural this was even better.

The burrata was served with a delectable basil and mint accompaniment and it was topped with charred zucchini and a generous topping of pine nuts.

While JetBlue's serving one of the most expensive nuts in the air — seriously Costco sells a bag of pine nuts for over $30 — its competitors are only now starting to ramp up meal service once again with far less appetizing or expensive choices.

The tomato tart was also incredible — the flavor contrast between the warm cherry tomatoes and the melted goat cheese was a hit with my taste buds.

Though the fish was cooked just a tad too much for my liking the bean puree and tomato accompaniment blended together perfectly to give the dish a savory kick.

Dessert in the form of a satisfying vanilla bean gelato with rhubarb and cake crumble was served on the same tray with dinner.

It wasn't just the restaurant-quality taste or presentation that wins JetBlue a perfect score. The carrier's drink offerings continue to impress as well.

I tried both signature cocktails on this flight — the mint condition and the black maple old-fashioned — and enjoyed them both throughout my meal.

Fives wines picked by the sommeliers at Parcelle were available as well but I stuck to soft drinks and cocktails for the ride back home.

In addition to refreshing cocktails JetBlue's non-alcoholic choices are quite impressive. Mint flyers can sip on espressos from Brooklyn Roasting coffee from Dunkin' and an assortment of teas from Teapigs in addition to Pepsi-branded soft drinks.

Plus the carrier stocks oat milk for those looking for a trendy non-dairy milk alternative.

JetBlue's A321LD features a walk-up self-serve pantry with drinks and snacks for both Mint and coach flyers but it's currently closed for added safety due to the pandemic.

The service on this flight couldn't have been better.

As I walked onto the plane I recognized James and Tara — the same flight attendants who served the Mint cabin on the inaugural the day before.

James remembered my food preferences (no meat) and was happy to bring me a second serving of fish when I remarked that it was one of the best seafood dishes I've had in the air. (The other one that comes to mind is the Balik salmon I was served in Swiss first class.)

By selecting the last row I had a birds-eye view of the service flow. Both flight attendants worked together seamlessly with Tara plating the dishes in the galley and James doing the serving.

While service on the inaugural felt disjointed this was the exact opposite — the crew hustled and the meal was delivered roughly an hour after takeoff despite me being the last one in the cabin to receive my food.

It seems like it won't take long for crews to learn the new cabin and service flow.

I'm continually impressed by the first-class touches that JetBlue incorporates into the Mint experience like cocktails that are shaken and poured at your seat and a hand-written thank you card at the end of the flight.

Though the crew's service was flawless on this sector JetBlue could consider implementing two service-related adjustments as Mint evolves.

The first is prioritizing meal orders by elite status. By sitting in the last row I had the last pick at the remaining small plates. Fortunately the galley was well stocked and I received my preference but the carrier could consider taking orders from Mosaic elites before going around to the rest of the cabin — a practice common at some of the legacy carriers.

The second is installing a cabin divider between Mint and core. Though the carrier has shied away from installing a curtain between cabins — JetBlue's mission is to ""bring humanity to air travel"" — the crew kept asking coach passengers to avoid standing in the Mint cabin while waiting for the lavatory.

Some premium-cabin passengers might find those disturbances to be annoying especially during red-eye flights.

Bottom line

JetBlue's new Mint business class is a big improvement compared to the original product.

Thanks to its 1-1 configuration every pod is an individual suite with added privacy from a sliding door. The suite is decked out with a host of high-tech touches like wireless charging pads large high-definition screens two power outlets and more.

Plus the airline's refreshed food and beverage service shines in the new cabin.

The one notable downside to the new cabin is that the seat can feel claustrophobic due to the herringbone configuration.

If that's a deal-breaker for you then I'd consider upgrading to the Mint studio. If not you'll have a great flight living your best suite life.

Trainers in Pokemon GO have a finite amount of space to store the many creatures they have come across however. This doesn't mean they have to pick and choose.

The game allows for storage upgrades. This expands the amount of Pokemon that can be held at any given time. Keeping the entire Pokedex a multitude of legendaries and an army of Shiny Pokemon will be no problem.

How to increase storage size in Pokemon GO

Increasing Pokemon GO storage size is an easy feat to accomplish. In fact players can now store more Pokemon than ever before in the global mobile game.

Niantic has updated the number of Pokemon that can be kept a handful of times. Currently Pokemon GO trainers can store up to 4500 different Pokemon. This includes first time catches and any duplicate Pokemon.

Maximum Pokemon Storage has just been increased to 4500 in the Game Master and a special 2 for 1 bundle added to the shop! pic.twitter.com/zuqWdmqyVF — PokeMiners (@poke_miners) June 4 2021 Expand Tweet

Maxing out that storage is a bit pricey but it can be done. Trainers need to enter the shop found within Pokemon GO. From there they can purchase a Pokemon storage upgrade for 200 coins.

Each 200 coins spent gives trainers an additional 50 Pokemon slots. If trainers are interested in grabbing that additional storage they can simply keep purchasing until they hit the max.

PokeCoins can be bought in bundles of 100 550 1200 2500 5200 and 14500. Of course those all come at various price points depending on how many of them trainers want to purchase.

Currently Pokemon GO is offering two upgrades for the price of one in a special Event Box. This lasts throughout Gible Community Day and ends at 3 PM CT on Sunday June 7 2021.

Be sure to take advantage of that while it lasts because two storage upgrades for only 200 coins is too good to pass up on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVud2ljaHRpbWUuY29tL2xvY2FsL2FydGljbGUvQS1sdXh1cnktamV0LWNvbXBhbnktd2FudHMtdG8tYnVpbGQtYS1uZXctaGFuZ2FyLTE2MjI2Mjc4LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A luxury jet company wants to build a new hangar at Westchester County Airport.

“All radioactive sources used for our operations are managed in accordance with environmental permits and strict safety standards such as those set out by the International Atomic Energy Agency” the company said in response to questions from Stabroek News.

“There is no treatment or disposal of radioactive sources in Guyana” it also pointed out.

As some members of the public voiced concern about the location and treatment of hazardous waste coming from oil and gas production former Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Dr. Vincent Adams last week told this newspaper that he had introduced a “cradle to grave” principle used in the US regulations and set it as a requirement for ExxonMobil to develop and deliver to the EPA for approval.

ExxonMobil was asked about this and it said that it had completed the study and submitted it to the EPA but the agency had asked for clarifications on some issues which are being addressed for response later this month.

“We submitted a `cradle to grave’ waste analysis study to the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year and we have since received comments and requests for clarification which are currently being addressed. We plan to submit our responses later this month” ExxonMobil’s local Public Relations and Government Affairs officer Janelle Persaud told this newspaper.

Adams said that he is pleased to know that the company did submit the document but is still concerned over the nation’s human resource capacity to assess given that the EPA currently doesn’t have the specialist personnel to manage the process.

“The process includes the development and approval of waste acceptance criteria documents of third party treatment facilities and landfill that will ensure that the facility has the capability to treat the pedigree and characteristics of the waste accepted to the regulatory standards for treatment disposal.

“Here again it shows the urgent necessity for the government to invest in the capacity building of the agency specifically to invest in training of its employees including … abroad (at) companies involved in handling these types of waste that come with the petroleum sector and is new to Guyana” he added.

He underscored the need for overseas training in areas new to this country pointing out that some staff had gone to the United States Trinidad and the United Kingdom and he hopes that the EPA continues to invest in its human resources.

Adams told this newspaper that “the cradle to grave principle means that ExxonMobil and not just third party companies would be responsible for the waste and all of its residuals emitted in the air water and solids from the time the waste is generated to its final disposition such as burial.”

Adams had also introduced what he termed the standard principle of having a “waste acceptance criteria” that must be applied by all treatment and/or waste disposal facilities after approval by the EPA. He set this requirement for ExxonMobil’s main waste manager at the time Tiger Tanks or any other treatment facility to have “waste acceptance criteria” to ensure that their facility has the necessary equipment to treat the waste being handed to them by ExxonMobil.

“This waste acceptance criteria would have required a full analysis of the waste received by them to be sure that it doesn’t exceed the concentrations and capabilities that they are designed to handle. Any waste type or concentrations exceeding that criteria means that the facility is not capable of handling that waste to get it to the required safe treatment levels and therefore has to be rejected” he said.

“I imposed upon Exxon that they would have to be responsible for all of the waste from the time it is generated (cradle) through treatment and to final disposal (grave) of whatever is left over. They are also responsible for emissions which enter the air water and soil during treatment” he had explained.

“There is a rule of chemical law that matter is never destroyed. So for example in the case of Incineration when you burn if you put a pound of waste in you get a pound back out. However it comes out in different pieces. Some will go into the air in the form of such contaminants as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide some in the water and some in the residual solid ash. The types of emissions in the air water and soil and their quantities all depend upon the characteristics of the waste and the equipment treatment capabilities” he added.

Concerns have been raised by Houston East Bank Demerara (EBD) residents about approval being granted for the setting up of a waste treatment facility in the village. Last year Coverden EBD residents also raised the same concerns.

The EPA recently announced that approval was also given to another company for the storage of a radioactive source at Coverden not far from where the waste storage facitlity was proposed to be sited.

Dr. Adams said he could recall that “Halliburton had applied for a similar permit” and he had attended a meeting of the Board of the Central Housing and Planning Authority where that company had to give a presentation on how they would handle the sources to ensure no exposure to the public during storage transportation and use.

“Of major concerns were the securing of the sources during storage and transportation so that it won’t get into the wrong hands or someone breaching the storage facility and getting access to the sources” he said.

It is unclear whether Halliburton was issued the permit. This newspaper has been trying for months to schedule an interview with current EPA Director Sharifah Razack to no avail. Emails have not been replied to and calls to her office have always been met with comments that she was either busy or out of office.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzA1L2JsYWNrcm9ja3Mtbm8tMS1nb2FsLWluLXdva2UtaW52ZXN0aW5nLWh1Z2UtZXNnLWZ1bmRzLWhhdWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BlackRock's 'No. 1' goal in 'woke' investing: Huge ESG-funds haul,"Progressives love the story of Engine No. 1 a small activist investor that just fought its way onto the board of what many wokesters consider the most vile company in the world: oil giant Exxon­Mobil.

Most activists — think Paul Singer and Carl Icahn — are in it for the money. Engine No. 1 wants to make money with a progressive twist: The fund’s founders argue that there’s gold in green.

These savvy veteran investors say making the world a better and greener place will translate into big earnings for companies and bigger returns for shareholders. Windmills apparently can produce efficient ­energy at a profit. Electric cars will soon be replacing gas guzzlers.

Whether this sentiment expands beyond the woke is a matter of debate. I know plenty of investors who aren’t convinced that green investing is anything more than a politically ­induced fad that will never make money and wouldn’t get financing if it weren’t for government grants. As proof they point to the world’s greenest company — electric-car maker Tesla — which feasts on government subsidies and barely turns a profit despite its much-hyped stock price.

Of course that hasn’t stopped the progressive celebrations over the news that Exxon will now have to place three reps from Engine No. 1 on its board to force change.

Engine No. 1 wants the company to figure out ways to reduce its carbon footprint which again sounds good until you realize it’s also a fancy way of saying it wants Exxon to do less of what it’s good at. And by the way what does Engine No. 1 know about running an oil company?

Giving credibility to this apparent lunacy has been one of the biggest and most profitable institutional ­investors out there: BlackRock. The $9 trillion investing monster run by Larry Fink may be the most powerful financial firm in the world because it holds shares in large doses of so many big companies and thus can ­direct corporate policy.

And guess what? BlackRock backed this no-name cadre of woke activists even as Exxon persuasively argued that Engine No. 1 wasn’t qualified to help run an oil company. With BlackRock on the fund’s side ExxonMobil eventually folded like a cheap tent.

While Elon Musk keeps flaunting Tesla’s stock prices he can’t neglect how much funding he relies on from Uncle Sam just to remain profitable. AP Photo/Britta Pedersen Pool File

A spokesman for Engine No. 1 and BlackRock had no comment. But a BlackRock company official said the company’s vote was a result of its concern that Exxon doesn’t have clear climate-change strategy and its long-term performance will suffer in a “low-carbon economy.”

Fink has been a huge cheerleader for so-called ESG (environmental social and corporate governance) investing. ESG is all about ensuring that companies BlackRock holds in its multitudes of funds adhere to certain progressive edicts (like executives not paying themselves too much money).

Sounds good on paper — until you drill down. For starters such investing methods are highly political and veer far to the left. Companies often get good grades for supporting lefty causes such as Black Lives Matter. Oil companies like Exxon will get higher marks for building wind farms that produce energy inefficiently.

Something else for investors to consider: These funds lately haven’t beat ­indices that are simply created to make you money and only do so when they pack themselves with high-flying tech names.

But here’s where Fink and BlackRock still come out ahead: They have sensed that with all the media hype of ESG investing as the next frontier they can also make a lot of money creating a new type of fund dedicated specifically to ESG — and then charge more for it.

My sources inside BlackRock say that over the past year Fink has transformed the place into an ESG cultural center. Fink talks ESG nonstop at company town halls. Seminars on ESG investing seem to take place every week. An executive named Brian Deese was promoted to push money managers to consider ESG in all their investment decisions.

Deese is now one of several BlackRock officials who hold key positions in the Biden administration as director of the president’s National Economic Council.

This revolving door between Washington and Wall Street gives Fink a huge voice in US economic policy. It’s no surprise that the Biden White House is issuing new environmental rules left and right to satisfy its woke base and by extension those who want woke investments which Fink is happy to provide.

By the end of the year BlackRock could have as many as 150 so-called exchange-traded funds that adhere to ESG standards. ETFs are supposed to carry lower fees than normal funds because they mirror a typical basket of stocks like the S&P 500.

But with ESG screening methods BlackRock has found a way to inflate management fees of this seemingly prosaic investment. In fact studies show that management fees on ESG funds are more than 40 percent higher than other ETFs.

BlackRock currently manages about $200 billion in ESG client money which means that number is likely to grow and add to BlackRock’s profits.

Now with Engine No. 1 likely to occupy three seats on Exxon’s board it isn’t too much of a stretch to see the company passing Fink’s ESG screens for his ETFs with flying colors.

In short Fink will look like a darl­ing to Democratic politicians he’ll get a lot of left-leaning rich people to put cash in what they feel are “moral” stocks — and he’ll laugh all the way to the bank.

Will the rest of the investors make money?

Well Brooks Koepka is threatening to pocket the whole $40 million after which he may send a couple of cases of beer to Bryson DeChambeau.

The animosity between the two appears genuine. They ratcheted it up another notch this weekend as fan participation escalated beyond those shouts of “You da man!” For a while anyway golf is worth watching even if it isn’t a major tournament.

Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau are feuding

Hearing fans call out “Brooksy” has become a major irritant to Bryson DeChambeau this week at the Memorial Tournament where several fans have been removed from the course. | Ben Jared/PGA Tour via Getty Images

Koepka took the week off and apparently is home in Jupiter Florida. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t living rent-free in DeChambeau’s head a thousand miles away in Dublin Ohio.

DeChambeau is competing in the Memorial Tournament which is Jack Nicklaus’ annual stop on the PGA Tour. Jon Rahm playing some masterful golf should have been the story through 36 holes. Instead all that people could talk about was DeChambeau struggling to break par while tormented by Koepka fans calling him “Brooksy.”

It’s the latest escalation of bickering that began with Kopeka complaining about slow play DeChambeau mocking his rival’s physique and Kopeka bragging about having won way more majors. Casual fans unaware of the animosity loved watching Koepka flub an interview at the PGA Championship DeChambeau distracted him by walking past.

Koepka has intertwined ‘Brooksy’ and beer

Capping off a long day with @MichelobULTRA! Thanks for all the support today. Also we’ve got something for you… pic.twitter.com/kwtwXg3Kqb — Brooks Koepka (@BKoepka) June 4 2021

A video clip on social media showed DeChambeau taking umbrage at a fan calling him “Brooksy” at the PGA Championship last month. Knowing that the comment’s effect more fans started in on him with the same taunt this week and it resulted in security removing them from the gallery.

Whether the crackdown originated with a request from DeChambeau or tournament officials is irrelevant. What matters is that it blew up into a huge story that overshadowed the rain-delayed tournament on Friday.

Watching from afar a delighted Koepka dropped a video onto social media. You knew it would be dynamite as soon as Koepka opened with “What’s up guys? It’s Brooksy!” Vaguely referencing the taunting he announced a deal for free cases of beer for fans whose time was “cut short” at the Memorial.

Boom! The clip reached 1 million views on Twitter in just over 20 hours practically guaranteeing further fan shenanigans throughout the weekend. Some casual golf fans exhausted by the pandemic lockdowns undoubtedly said “Aw screw it. I can handle being indoors one more weekend. I think I’ll watch some golf on TV and see if DeChambeau loses his mind.”

Koepka vs. DeChambeau is both funny and worrisome

As rivalries go Koepka vs. DeChambeau isn’t Nicklaus vs. Palmer or even Tiger vs. Phil for that matter. But it does bring eyeballs to a sport that launched the $40 million “Player Impact Program” in which connecting with fans is a crucial piece of determining who collects the cash.

Fans chirping “Brooksy” is relatively harmless – until it leans to boorish behavior from the gallery while someone is standing over a 15-foot putt on the 72nd with huge money on the line.

If PGA Commissioner Jay Monahan can’t broker a truce between DeChambeau and Kopeka that takes the fan behavior out of the equation then Steve Stricker should sue for peace.

Stricker is the captain of the U.S. Ryder Cup team and the two golfers are all but certain to earn spots in the competition. He doesn’t have to pair them in the first two days of competition but he does need them to co-exist at team functions that week. Sending them to their rooms without supper if they can’t get along isn’t an option and they’re sure not going to work out their issues over a beer by themselves the week of the Ryder Cup.

After winding up tied after regulation at 13-under 275 Cantlay and Collin Morikawa went to a playoff on the par-4 18th hole. On that playoff hole Cantlay managed to save pare and beat Morikawa whose mudball from the fairway didn't get to the putting surface.

Scottie Scheffler finished alone in third two shots out of the playoff.

Jon Rahm was 54-hole leader with a six-shot advantage but he was forced to withdraw from the tournament when he was informed of a positive COVID-19 test after he completed his third round.

Cantlay won the $1674000 winner's share of the $9300000 purse.

the Memorial Tournament recap notes

Cantlay earned 68 Official World Golf Ranking points with the win in the 72-hole stroke-play championship which will boost his world ranking.

Cantlay also earned 550 FedEx Cup points with the win which will get him closer to a spot in the Tour Championship.

A total of 68 players finished the tournament in the 32nd event of the 2020-2021 PGA Tour season after a 36-hole cut was made at 2-over 146 or better.

A

Shoals’ nonunionised workers at four factories in Tennessee and Alabama make the guts for big solar installations—basically everything you need other than those shiny photovoltaic panels and the inverters necessary to feed power onto the grid. They craft cable assemblies combiner boxes external fuses. It’s exactly the sort of unsexy manufacturing that nearly everyone thinks fled to China years ago.

Indeed most of Solon’s competitors are Chinese companies like GCL System Integration and Wuxi Sun King. The Chinese-made components are cheaper than Shoals’ but Solon has an edge: His stuff is seen as safer more reliable and easier to install. That means companies are willing to pay 5 to 10 percent more for it believing they’ll make up for it in lower labour and maintenance costs. Last year that premium added up to earnings of $34 million on $176 million in sales. After a January IPO the 57-year-old Solon is worth some $2.2 billion thanks to his 40 percent stake in the company and after-tax proceeds from prior equity sales.





To keep that made-in-America premium as low as possible Solon makes the manufacturing process as foolproof as he can. Screens mounted on the front of each machine show workers how to do each task—from stripping and crimping wires to installing fuses and finishing cable assemblies—with cycle times measured not in man-hours but man-seconds. It’s a “Pavlov’s dog” world Solon says in which workers are trained to self-correct when a light atop their station starts blinking indicating they’ve slipped behind schedule and have about 15 minutes to sort it out before the blinking gets faster and “maintenance” is summoned. They’re told never to worry about messing up. “If this process makes something wrong shame on us—we designed it wrong we didn’t bulletproof enough for you not to make mistakes” he says.





Plant managers sit above the factory floor on a mezzanine platform Solon calls Pride Rock after the prominent slab in The Lion King. They rarely get involved; teams help one another sort out problems because if one person slows down for too long the next in line runs out of parts. “Don’t yell at anyone; let them have a self-win” Solon says. “I don’t need to squeeze another 10 seconds out of them. If the green light is on we’re making money.”





Solon has taken his family to Disney World twice a year for decades and has long been inspired by the park’s orchestrated perfection. “On the surface everything is calm and happy and serene but underneath there’s hundreds of people making sure the magic is right.” On a recent trip to Orlando however he’s headed not to Disney but to a nearby solar field owned by Origis Energy. On sunny days this 270-acre installation generates 60 MW—enough to provide around a quarter of the Magic Kingdom’s power needs. Michael Eyman managing director of Origis Services says Shoals products “are not always the cheapest but always the best”. Origis tried installing competitors’ gear “and without exception they all failed in their warranty period”.





Shoals’ “plug-and-play” hardware eliminates the need for a crew of expensive electricians out in the field stripping wires and crimping millions of connections by hand. “We don’t turn our customers’ fields into our proving grounds” Solon says showing off a wall of five testing chambers fridge-size boxes where he can subject prototypes to 40 days and nights of heat cold and 100 percent relative humidity.





Solon is the named inventor on 30 granted and pending patents. He owns at least that many pairs of jean shorts his preferred uniform along with a black Shoals collared T-shirt.





He prides himself on being so uninterested in bean counting and SEC filings that 15 months ago he handed the CEO reins to longtime chief technical officer Jason Whitaker.





Solon remains on the board of directors focusing on new products. Shoals’ chairman Brad Forth is also a senior advisor to Oaktree Capital which bought more than half the company from Solon in 2017 and cashed out $2 billion in the recent IPO. Now that it’s public is there any impetus to squeeze out a few more margin points by loosening some of Solon’s obsessions? “We are never going to sacrifice quality or reliability for anything” says Whitaker 41 “because it’s built into the process itself.”





Solon got his start at age 8 carrying a toolbox for his dad who did air conditioning and refrigeration repair and taught at the vocational school in Gary Indiana. Young Dean took apart everything to see how it worked and put it back together from lawnmowers to V8 engines sometimes with a few pieces left over. By 16 he had his own clients and his own truck. He studied engineering at Purdue but dropped out. He quit an internship at Inland Steel when it refused to give him credit for innovations he had developed. By the late 1980s he was engineering and selling automotive parts for a joint venture between General Electric and Bosch. He made a point of cutting his commission in order to keep customers coming back for more—then quit when his bosses resented that he was still making more money than they were.





In 2003 he got a call from First Solar which needed some wiring and junction boxes to connect solar panels. Soon Cypress Semiconductor wanted the same gear for its SunPower solar spin-off. “I’d been a gearhead my whole life—I thought I would retire making car parts.” Instead he introduced manufacturing perfectionism to the “PhD thinkers and basement tinkerers” of solar who had no idea how to efficiently scale up their output. “All I knew was scale.”





The solar revolution is still in its early days. In 2020 US solar power generation grew 25 percent to 130 GW hours but renewables excluding hydroelectric still account for only 12.5 percent of total domestic energy supply. Beyond higher quality there’s another window of opportunity through which native players can shine: In late 2019 China’s Huawei shuttered its US solar business after Congress made public its concerns that Huawei’s equipment could serve as vectors for cyberattack.





For someone so process-driven it’s refreshing that Solon remains dedicated to the human element of his business. Animatronics might be fun at the theme park but not in Shoals’ factories. “It’s cool that a robot can work 24/7 but the robot doesn’t go home to a family and have to feed it at the end of the evening” Solon says. “I could install automation and do this completely robotically this whole factory. But then I’m just a jerk.”





t Shoals Technologies’ 100000-square foot factory in Portland Tennessee Dean Solon’s quest for simplicity starts with the colour-coded shirts inspired by Sesame Street that his workers wear. “The SunPower logo was yellow so that’s Big Bird. First Solar was red for Elmo” he says. Those working on an order for Blattner Energy a big solar contractor sport Cookie Monster blue. “And then we have the Count in purple. He’s always counting. Those are the quality control people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZ2Vhci5jb20vcmluZy1vZi1maXJlLXNvbGFyLWVjbGlwc2UtaGFwcGVucy1vbi10aHVyc2RheS0wNTY3NjM5Ni_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ring Of Fire Solar Eclipse Happens On Thursday,"Ring of Fire solar eclipse happens on Thursday

Skywatchers will want to be on the lookout for a solar eclipse happening Thursday morning June 10. It will be the first solar eclipse of the year and the moon will almost entirely block the sun leaving only a little of the sun outside of the moon's shadow. The only part of the sun visible from behind the moon is a ring which gives the eclipse its ring of fire name.

Unfortunately only a few locations will be able to see the total eclipse. Areas include parts of Canada Greenland and northern Russia. Most of the world will only see a partial solar eclipse which will be more visible in the northern hemisphere. Skywatchers in parts of the eastern US northern Alaska most of Canada parts of the Caribbean Europe Asia and northern Africa will see the partial solar eclipse.

A solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun blocking some or possibly all of the light produced by the sun. During the annual eclipse the moon is far enough from the earth that it's too small to block out the entire sun leaving a ring of light in the sky.

The eclipse will last about 100 minutes starting at sunrise in Ontario Canada traveling northward until the greatest part of the eclipse happens around 8:41 AM local time in Greenland. The eclipse will end at sunset in northeastern Siberia. NASA says the ""Ring of fire"" phase occurs when the moon covers at least 89 percent of the sun and can last up to three minutes and 51 seconds at every point along its path.

The partial solar eclipse seen in other areas will only see part of the sun blocked. It will appear as if the moon has taken a bite out of the sun. Anyone planning to look at the eclipse should remember that you can't look directly at the sun.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlidGltZXMuY29tL3JpbmctZmlyZS13aGVyZS1ob3ctd2F0Y2gtd2Vla3MtYW5udWxhci1zb2xhci1lY2xpcHNlLTMyMTg2MDPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Ring of Fire': Don't Miss This Week's Annular Solar Eclipse,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ibtimes.com/ring-fire-where-how-watch-weeks-annular-solar-eclipse-3218603 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlidGltZXMuY29tL3JpbmctZmlyZS13aGVyZS1ob3ctd2F0Y2gtd2Vla3MtYW5udWxhci1zb2xhci1lY2xpcHNlLTMyMTg2MDPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvY2FuZGVsYS1jLTctZWxlY3RyaWMtYm9hdC1mbGllcy1vdmVyLXdhdGVyLWZsZXhlcy1sb25nLXJhbmdlLWFuZC1zcGVlZC0xNjIzNjEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Candela C-7 Electric Boat Flies Over Water Flexes Long-Range and Speed,"Since summer is here hydrofoils are already spiking up in sales all over the world. This ""flying boat"" from Swedish boat-builder Candela is already making waves with barely touching the water. So if you want to have the best of both worlds this is going to be right up your alley or dock in this case.

kWh

Dubbed C-7 the electric boat has been gliding over the Caribbean Archipelago and Austrian lakes since last year. Introduced by Candela as the ""world's first and only electric foiling boat"" it claims to pack a greater range and higher speed than other conventional e-boats.Incorporating fully submerged foils the C-7's computer-controlled system is designed to offer a silent driving experience and a smooth ride even in choppy conditions. The hull is entirely lifted above the water's surface reducing friction by 80 percent.This translates to an increased range of 57 miles (93 km) at a speed of 25 mph (41 kph). While that's not lightning fast according to Candela it's still about three times the range of other electric boats on the market.Its top speed can reach 35 mph (56 kph) on a single charge of its 40lithium battery pack from BMWi3. That's enough juice for a trip on the entire San Francisco Bay. With a wake of only 5 cm (2-in) high the waves produced will not impact neighboring boats or buildings even when operating in narrow passages. C-7 can operate in shallow water because its foils and propulsion unit are retractable. This system also allows for more accessible storage. All controls including ones for retracting the hydrofoils are accessible on the 12-inch touchscreen.Its foils' angle can be automatically adjusted 100 times per second via its digital flight controller that uses ultrasonic sensors gyroscopes accelerometers and GPS to measure the position speed and acceleration of the boat. The C-7 can accommodate six passengers on board with running costs up to 95 percent less than an equivalent boat that navigates on fuel.According to Italian publication Repubblica  the ""flying boat"" is currently being tested in Venice Italy. Candela seeks to provide the city with a non-harmful alternative to the thousands of motorboats that cross the canals causing additional deterioration of the city's buildings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kcmVhbS1oZWFsdGgub3JnLzIwMjEvMDYvc29sYXItZW5lcmd5LWF0LXRoZS1kcmVhbS1jZW50cmUtaW4tYmFuZ3VpLWZvci1hbi1pbnRlZ3JhbC1lY29sb2d5LXdvcmxkZW52aXJvbm1lbnRkYXkvP2xhbmc9ZW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar energy at the Dream centre in Bangui for an integral ecology #worldenvironmentday,

An aerial saw suspended from a helicopter flew over Washington County in recent weeks to trim trees along power lines.

Potomac Edison a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. is using the device to maintain electrical clearances along about 100 miles of difficult-to-access transmission line corridors in Maryland West Virginia and Virginia the company reported.

The crew has finished the aerial sawing in Maryland which included a swing over Washington County according to an email from Will Boye a FirstEnergy spokesman.

The workers are sawing along lines in Virginia and will move to West Virginia next he wrote.

The company said in a news release that maintaining clearances around transmission lines and electrical equipment can help reduce the frequency and duration of tree-related power outages.

“Taking this step to safeguard our high-voltage power lines is an important part of our vegetation management program and an effective way to reduce service interruptions for our customers” James A. Sears Jr. president of FirstEnergy's Maryland operations said in the release.

The equipment was used to trim along a 230-kilovolt line in Washington and Frederick counties that runs nearly 18 miles from the Smithsburg area to Boonsboro according to the release.

It also was used to trim along two other lines in Frederick County.

Cutting edge:Potomac Edison 2021 tree trimming underway

Weather-related:Winds topple trees power lines

The aerial saw is suspended on an adjustable 90-foot boom under the helicopter according to Boye.

Two joints on the boom let the pilot maneuver the blades forward and backward as well as side to side. A quick-release safety hook allows the boom to be dropped in the event of an emergency Boye wrote.

The aerial saw equipped with multiple 24-inch rotary blades is typically used along transmission lines in areas that are environmentally sensitive or inaccessible to bucket trucks and other vehicles the company reported.

The method typically covers more area in a day than a ground crew might complete in a week. The saw also eliminates the risk of injury to workers using bucket trucks or climbing trees to cut limbs near high voltage equipment.

The saw cuts tree limbs 8 to 10 inches in diameter. The limbs fall straight to the ground propelled by air from the helicopter rotors. Ground crews move limbs that have fallen onto roadways yards agricultural fields or in streams into adjacent wooded areas.

Even before its splashy reveal last month Ford Motor's all-new electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck had already been declared a success.

Truck sales have exploded in the last 15 months. The F-Series' reign over its pickup competitors -- 44 years and counting -- was ironclad. Americans seemed eager for an electric vehicle that suited their daily driving needs and off-roading fantasies.

The F-150 Lightning may be one of Ford's most important vehicles in the company's storied history. The Dearborn automaker has already received more than 70000 deposits for the truck Ford's second electric vehicle following the 2019 debut of the Mustang Mach-E SUV.

To build and develop these innovative highly technological EVs Ford has to follow the same tried-and-true strategy it has done for years: Sell gas-gulping trucks and sport utility vehicles to the masses. SUVs and trucks have proliferated in showrooms as automakers -- and consumers -- largely abandon passenger cars.

""Automakers need to keep producing high-margin vehicles with internal combustion engines [ICE] to fund this electric transition"" Arun Kumar managing director at AlixPartners a consulting firm with a focus on automotive told ABC News. ""Automakers take that cash and put it toward EVs. This transition to electrics takes a long time. It's not a tomorrow thing.""

Ford's new all-electric truck the F-150 Lightning goes on sale next spring. Ford Motor Co.

Ford says the F-150 Lightning which starts at $39974 and qualifies for federal and state tax credits can travel an EPA-estimated 230 miles on a standard-range battery or 300 miles with an extended-range battery. The Mach-E can get up to 305 miles of driving range. By 2030 Ford expects 40% of its global vehicle volume to be fully electric and the company recently increased its commitment to electrification from $22 billion to $30 billion.

As Ford accelerates its efforts to get longtime customers to buy EVs the rollout of the long-awaited Bronco the legendary nameplate Ford revived last year goes into full gear.

Demand for the boxy ute has been so strong that customer deliveries could extend into 2022 Ford has warned. The Bronco gets an estimated combined 21 mpg -- if owners choose the 2.3-liter turbo-four engine. The Sasquatch package and Black Diamond trim each return a paltry 18 mpg; opting for the manual transmission further reduces the Bronco's fuel economy.

The 4x4 Bronco gets a combined 21 mpg though that number drops depending on the trim and engine configuration. Ford Motor Co.

The gas-powered F-Series Ford's lifeblood can be configured with a 3.5-liter PowerBoost V6 engine the only full hybrid powertrain available in a pickup and has an EPA-estimated 25 mpg rating on 4x2 models. Without the hybrid engine the fuel economy slips to 19 mpg with the 5.0-liter V8 4x4 (or 20 mpg for the 4x2). The 2021 Ford Expedition MAX 4WD a massive three-row SUV gets a measly combined 18 mpg according to EPA estimates.

""These vehicles don't sell to the EV crowd and making moves to get away from gasoline gas-guzzlers is inherently risky"" Ed Kim vice president of industry analysis at AutoPacific told ABC News. ""Automakers are really trying to appeal to a new customer type on the backs of their existing customers. The fact that these vehicles print money is what's allowing automakers to invest in EVs.""

The 2021 Ford Expedition. Ford

Karl Brauer executive analyst at iSeeCars.com said automakers will have to carefully balance EV production with the market's appetite for gasless vehicles.

""It's very popular now to make a bold statement about removing ICE models from your lineup"" he told ABC News. ""It's a great PR message to put out but these nice predictions never really mean that much. No one knows what will be going on in five years. Who will hold these executives accountable?""

He added: ""If automakers don't produce cars that people want to buy they'll have to retrench and make a different move.""

Nearly every automaker currently sells at least one EV and electrics account for 2% of the U.S. automotive market. Kumar predicts 20% of new vehicle sales in North America will be EVs in less than a decade though he acknowledged that industry predictions swing wildly from 5% to 75%.

""Lots of trial and error is going on in the market"" Kumar noted. ""Automakers are pushing lots of EVs but there's only so much volume out there that consumers are willing to buy.""

Sweden's Volvo said in March that its entire lineup would switch to battery power by 2030. British automaker Jaguar informed the world in February that it would reinvent itself as an EV automaker by 2025. The marque sells just one EV now the I-PACE SUV with sales totaling only 5000 units since its debut in 2018.

""The brand is at this fork in the road -- continue with multiple powertrains or go electric?"" Rob Filipovic director of product planning at Jaguar Land Rover North America told ABC News. ""We have to remain relevant as a brand and our focus is on going electric.""

That doesn't mean fans of Jaguar's melodious throaty V8 engine are out of luck. Jaguar on Wednesday said its flagship F-TYPE sports car will only be built with V8 engines in 2022 -- dropping both the four- and six-cylinder engines available now. The 5.0-liter supercharged V8 produces 444 or 575 horsepower depending on the P450 or R model.

The 2022 Jaguar F-TYPE sports car will only be sold with a V8 engine. Jaguar

Bentley Motors was the first automaker to transform itself committing to a fully electric lineup by 2030. The decision marks a radical departure for the 102-year-old automaker prized for its 12-cylinder engines and Babylonian conveyances that do not at least currently have environmentally-friendly reputes.

The Continental GT and GT convertible are listed by the EPA as two of the least fuel efficient vehicles on the market with 15 mpg slightly better than the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport (10 mpg) and Lamborghini Aventador (10 mpg). There's the Bentayga Speed (14 mpg) fitted with a W12 engine that makes 626 hp moves from 0-60 mph in 3.8 seconds and has a top speed of 190 mph.

In May Bentley unveiled its latest addition to its SUV family: The Bentayga S a sporty muscular SUV with a 4.0-liter turbocharged V8 that produces 542 hp and 568 lb.-ft. of torque. The Flying Spur Bentley's large cushy sedan went on sale with a V8 for the first time this year. Its EPA rating is a combined 17 mpg versus 15 mpg for the 12-cylinder model.

The new Bentayga S SUV comes with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 that produces 542 horsepower. Bentley Motors

A hybrid powertrain for the Flying Spur is planned with an electric version to follow according to Bentley product manager Hans Holzgartner.

""A lot of people can no longer justify a W12 in today's world"" Holzgartner told ABC News. ""It's such a big powerplant. The V8 is 16% more efficient [in fuel consumption] and delivers 99% of what drivers need in terms of performance with less weight at the front of the car and therefore better balance benefiting fuel economy and CO2 emissions.""

Kim of AutoPacific said automakers will experience little if any pushback from consumers if they cannot meet these good-intentioned EV goals. Plus selling highly profitable trucks and SUVs while promoting eco-friendly cars has been done before he argued.

""Toyota for years has been perceived as a very green brand almost entirely due to the Prius"" he said. ""In reality Toyota is a full-line automaker. There's the V8-powered Tundra pickup Sequoia and Land Cruiser -- gas-guzzlers like the trucks General Motors and Ford put out. Companies can absolutely do both.""

General Motors said it plans to support its core ICE products via updates and new technologies through 2035 as it aggressively moves to eliminate tailpipe emissions. Its new battery-powered vehicles -- the GMC Hummer EV upcoming electric Chevrolet Silverado Cadillac LYRIQ and refreshed Bolt EV -- are part of GM's wave of 30 electrics offered globally by 2025.

The Cadillac LYRIQ an all-electric luxury SUV is expected to arrive in the first half of 2022. Cadillac

""To be successful in our mission the company must offer the best ICE vehicles on the market as we accelerate development of our EV programs"" Doug Parks GM executive vice president of global product development purchasing and supply chain told ABC News. ""Our focus is on providing desirable durable and capable products that will help all of our customers including truck and SUV drivers make the transition to EVs over time.""

He added: ""GM is committed to an all-electric future because it is the right thing to do and critical to the long-term viability of our business as the world transforms.""

Of course the biggest roadblocks to all EVs are the charging challenges and high prices. Kumar of AlixPartners said automakers also face another dilemma.

""Not all new EVs will be successful"" he said. ""Can automakers sell enough of them to make a profit on this investment? That is the question.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzEwLXJlYXNvbnMtdGhlLTE5NjQtZm9yZC1ndDQwLXdhcy1vbmUtb2YtdGhlLWdyZWF0ZXN0LXNwb3J0cy1jYXJzLWV2ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Reasons The 1964 Ford GT40 Was One Of the Greatest Sports Cars Ever,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzEwLXJlYXNvbnMtdGhlLTE5NjQtZm9yZC1ndDQwLXdhcy1vbmUtb2YtdGhlLWdyZWF0ZXN0LXNwb3J0cy1jYXJzLWV2ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS1mb3JkLWJyb25jby1vd25lcnMtbWFudWFsLWluZGlyZWN0bHktY29uZmlybXMtcGhldi1vcHRpb24tMTYyNjY3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Ford Bronco Owner's Manual Indirectly Confirms PHEV Option,"kW

The Ford Motor Company also mentions a high-voltage battery and 50 percent state of charge details that further indicate that a hybrid powertrain is on the horizon. Directly confirmed by former chief executive officer Jim Hackett and indirectly confirmed by the “ EV Coaching ” feature we’ve covered last year the partially electrified Bronco is expected to launch in the latter half of 2022 as a 2023 model. Given the current state of the chip shortage the Dearborn-based automaker may also delay the plug-in hybrid.Although unconfirmed it’s very likely for this variant to integrate the e-motor in the 10-speed automatic transmission. If the Ford Motor Company utilizes the same 35-motor as the F-150 PowerBoost with the 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder turbo then expect approximately 347 horsepower.While on the subject of powertrains page 107 of the owner’s manual confirms a configurable gauge for the digital instrument cluster. “Turbo boost gauge” to be more precise and its role is to indicate the amount of manifold air pressure in the 2.3-liter EcoBoost. From the looks of it customers who pony extra for the 2.7-liter EcoBoost won’t get this gauge.For those who plan on sleeping on a roof rack-mounted tent or going off-road with loads of gear on the roof rack be warned that you can’t go higher than 450 pounds or 204 kilograms while stationary. When the vehicle is in motion the roof load shouldn’t exceed 110 pounds or 50 kilograms.Last but certainly not least quite a few owners are interested if you can turn off the auto start-stop feature. The answer is yes Ford allows you to press the button every time you turn on the vehicle. But on the downside you can’t switch the system off permanently because it “plays an important role in reducing fuel consumption and carbon-dioxide emissions.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFtZXNtb3JyaXMvMjAyMS8wNi8wNS9tdXN0YW5nLW1hY2gtZS0yMDIxLXJldmlldy1hLWdlbml1cy1tb3ZlLWJ5LWZvcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mustang Mach-E 2021 Review: A Genius Move By Ford?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmorris/2021/06/05/mustang-mach-e-2021-review-a-genius-move-by-ford/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFtZXNtb3JyaXMvMjAyMS8wNi8wNS9tdXN0YW5nLW1hY2gtZS0yMDIxLXJldmlldy1hLWdlbml1cy1tb3ZlLWJ5LWZvcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lcy9vYml0dWFyaWVzL25hbWUvamVycnktbWlkZGxldG9uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P3BpZD0xOTg5ODYzMTQmdj1iYXRlc3ZpbGxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jerry Middleton Obituary - Dearborn Michigan,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/funeral-homes/obituaries/name/jerry-middleton-obituary?pid=198986314&v=batesville on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lcy9vYml0dWFyaWVzL25hbWUvamVycnktbWlkZGxldG9uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P3BpZD0xOTg5ODYzMTQmdj1iYXRlc3ZpbGxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Fortinet is 22.6% which ranks better than 83% of the companies in Software industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 53.2% which ranks better than 89% of the companies in Software industry.

One can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months Fortinet's ROIC is 18.49 while its WACC came in at 8.46.

U.S. cellphone carriers are offering their most generous discounts in years handing some customers brand-new devices for no money down or small monthly payments stretched over many months. The discounts from AT&T Inc. Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. require customers to make long-term commitments that give carriers the stability they need to reassure investors as they increase spending on 5G network upgrades.

AT&T kicked off the trend in October by offering high-end smartphones such as the iPhone 12 free with an eligible trade-in device. Its discount later dropped to $700 which covers the entire price of an iPhone 12 Mini and most of a standard iPhone 12 among other gadgets.

Verizon followed suit on Tuesday dangling trade-in credits of $700 toward new iPhones and $800 toward high-end Android phones. Both companies' most generous offers require that customers stick with an unlimited data plan for a set time.

""It's essentially a contract"" said Jeff Moore the head of telecom research firm Wave7 Research. ""We're seeing carriers locking in the customer base that they have as opposed to encouraging switchers.""

The free-phone strategy is a throwback to the wireless market a decade ago when U.S. carriers subsidized the price of most new smartphones in exchange for subscribers' guaranteed monthly payments.

The status quo shifted around 2013 and carriers began hawking no-contract wireless plans to customers who bought their own devices.

Subscribers could also pay off the cost of a new smartphone through monthly installments added to their bills.

AT&T and Verizon are now footing most or all of those purchases in exchange for reliable revenue. Verizon's free-phone offer requires a two-year commitment. AT&T on Friday stretched its 30-month payoff plan to cover three years. Both companies are offering the deals to existing customers not just new ones or those adding a new phone line.

T-Mobile is offering trade-in credits worth up to $1000 toward new smartphones paid off over two years. Its offer covers a wider range of mobile data plans but only applies to customers activating a new phone line.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % T AT&T INC. 16.99 +0.14 +0.83% VZ VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. 39.33 +0.44 +1.13% TMUS T-MOBILE US INC. 162.37 -2.23 -1.35% AAPL APPLE INC. 181.71 -1.67 -0.91%

Each carrier covers the cost of the smartphone through monthly bill credits equal to what their regular equipment installment payments would be. More expensive devices such as the iPhone 12 Pro Max -- sticker price $1100 -- yield low monthly installment payments. Verizon's $700 to $800 offer also throws in a $300 gift card for new customers. The discounts require continuous wireless service for at least two years; otherwise customers must pay off the balance of the smartphone purchase.

Wall Street analysts say the offers to existing AT&T and Verizon customers affect a much wider range of eligible users than previous promotions did. Paying to equip new and existing customers with new smartphones has already cost AT&T as much as $2 billion per quarter according to estimates from industry researcher MoffettNathanson LLC.

PCS ARE BACK AS DELL HP DELIVER STRONG SALES FOR DESKTOPS AND NOTEBOOKS

The handouts have yielded AT&T the sharp subscriber growth that investors tend to reward. The Dallas company added nearly 1.4 million postpaid phone connections to its base over the six months that ended in March.

David Christopher executive vice president of AT&T's wireless division said the device credits are more like interest-free financing than a long-term contract for wireless service. He said the carrier started offering subsidized financing because the sticker price on top smartphones has risen from $600 a few years ago to $1000 or more today and buyers wanted more ways to cover the purchase.

""Our customer base is very valuable and low churn is represented by customers voting to stay with AT&T"" he said. ""It resonated in the marketplace. We like the formula.""

Industry executives also say the generous phone deals reveal fiercer competition in the wireless market which has shrunk to three national carriers since T-Mobile's takeover of rival Sprint Corp. in 2020. Satellite operator Dish Network Inc. gained the ingredients for a fourth national system through a Justice Department-brokered settlement but its first cell towers won't go live until later this year.

GE VERIZON TEAM UP ON 5G

The consolidation hasn't yet led to sharply higher service charges though monthly rates haven't fallen either. MoffettNathanson estimates the average revenue per user on a postpaid plan which carriers value for its reliable monthly payments has hovered around roughly $47 over the past three years.

Cable-internet providers Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. are adding to the fray with their own low-price wireless plans. Those deals are only available in the cable providers' footprints where they have arrangements to provide cellular service with help from Verizon's network.

""We see a competitive healthy market out there"" T-Mobile Chief Executive Mike Sievert said last month. ""When more people start to enter the switching pool you have more people that are jump balls. And when more people are jump balls T-Mobile tends to do well.""

Verizon meanwhile is counting on customers with cheaper wireless service to upgrade to its most expensive unlimited-data plans which include high-speed 5G access and subscriptions to media services such as Disney+. The carrier said about a fifth of its postpaid wireless accounts subscribed to these premium unlimited plans at the end of 2020 a share executives hope to boost to about 50% by the end of 2023.

AT&T's offers apply to several wireless plans but its executives have touted their ability to upsell customers to premium-tier service bundled with other perks such as HBO Max. The telecom giant recently unveiled plans to spin off HBO owner WarnerMedia into a new company combined with rival Discovery Inc. The carrier hasn't detailed its plans for HBO Max after the deal closes but has said the Hollywood business will remain part of AT&T through mid-2022.

All three national carriers are working to shore up their customer bases as they increase spending on 5G infrastructure. U.S. companies bid about $81 billion earlier this year to secure new federal spectrum licenses that support the high-speed connections adding to the sector's overall debt. Executives have said those down payments will yield benefits once their customers start to notice 5G's faster internet speeds in the coming years.

MARK LEVIN FOX NEWS HOST: Hello America. I'm Mark Levin and this is LIFE LIBERTY & LEVIN. This is a very important program and I'm glad you're here.



We pride ourselves in America being a nation of laws. We have this beautiful Constitution of the United States. We have something called due process. We have all kinds of systems in place to protect the individual from government especially a rogue government.



What happens when that government becomes a criminal enterprise? What do I mean by that?



What happens when a District Attorney in a city or an Attorney General in a state use their power to advance a political agenda? Politicians dressed up as prosecutors. And what happens when one individual a prominent individual is focused on and targeted by an entire political party including their prosecutors? Is that what we want in America?



Now we're used to seeing that sort of thing in the old Soviet Union or the modern day Russia under Putin. We're used to seeing that sort of thing happen in Communist China and other totalitarian regimes. But what if I were to tell you what's happening in the United States of America as I speak?



You see we pride ourselves that after an election we don't chase down defeated candidates or even victorious candidates. We don't chase them down to punish them to destroy them and to make sure that they can never have a political career again or any kind of career. That is exactly what's happening to former President Donald Trump.



It is receiving virtually no attention nationwide virtually no outrage. The so-called civil libertarians which haven't been around for the last five years still aren't around. The joke and corrupt media that we have in this country don't give this fair coverage and so I thought we would spend tonight's program doing exactly that.



Every single one of us has a right to competent counsel every single one of us that's at the heart of our justice system. And in our justice system we protect that counsel and we protect the advice that the counsel gives the client. We protect the material that the counsel collects. We protect the notes we protect it all otherwise the individual you me a citizen even a noncitizen cannot get fair representation in our justice system.



So we have rules like the attorney-client privilege. We have attorney work product. We have confidentiality. And we have case law that surrounds all of it to do what? To protect this cocoon to create this cocoon around all this information so the government can't get it specifically. Investigators and prosecutors.



Otherwise what are we? We are the old Soviet Union. We are a totalitarian regime.



And yet for one man in this country Donald Trump it doesn't seem to matter. Does he have a right to counsel? Doesn't his counsel have a right to attorney-client privilege? Attorney work product confidentiality? All which in the end is protecting the client? In this case Donald Trump.



Michael Cohen one of Donald Trump's previous private attorneys is a criminal. He has pled to being a criminal. He has served time in Federal prison. He is a criminal and he had a plea deal and he wants to get even with his former client Donald Trump.



And under that patina of an argument Donald Trump's attorney-client privilege or rights the attorney-work product and confidentiality apparently have gone out the window. Well that's not how the system is supposed to work is it ladies and gentlemen?



Now President Trump has faced a criminalized political system that never wanted him elected and never want them elected again. He was investigated as was his family as were his friends as were his actions as were his campaign compatriots and so forth under the Mueller investigation. When it comes to Donald Trump and his family and his organizations they found nothing.



The Internal Revenue Service has been auditing the President and his organizations endlessly year after year. No criminal prosecutions.



The vast media in this country with all its investigative reporters 99.9 percent have been targeting this President and his circle. They haven't come up with a damn thing. Although the President's taxes were leaked to ""The New York Times"" and nobody seemed to have much of a problem with that there have been endless congressional investigations really Democratic Party investigations by congressional committees led by Chairman from places like New York City Massachusetts and California.



And they've done everything they can -- subpoenas and investigations and hearings -- empty. They came up with nothing.



Two unconstitutional impeachments endless coup conspiracies including out of the F.B.I. and the Intelligence Agencies and I could go on and on but that's not my point today.



There are two Democrats elected Democrats with long-time political histories on behalf of the Democratic Party who have enormous power. One is a prosecutor in Manhattan the other is a State prosecutor in Albany who are trying to destroy Donald Trump and his family and his organization as I speak.



First is Cy Vance. It is Cy Vance Jr. actually because his father was the Secretary of State under Jimmy Carter. He resigned because he was unhappy that Carter was too much of a hawk. That tells you about the Vance family does it?



We have a ""Washington Post"" article here that says that ""Cy Vance has convened a grand jury."" A grand jury to do what? To potentially indict the President?



""Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has convened a special grand jury to hear evidence about potential charges in his investigation of the Trump Organization"" ""The Washington Post"" has learned citing to anonymous sources as they do. The newspaper reported the grand jury has begun to meet recently didn't specify a start date.



""Vance has been investigating Trump for more than two years. A grand jury issued a subpoena for the former President's tax returns on August 2019."" The grand jury is the plaything of the prosecutor just so you know the facts "" ... which Trump successfully fought off until the 2020 election. During that time Vance has suggested in public filings that bank insurance tax fraud all may be focus of his probe.""



In other words they are on a witch hunt. ""The Washington Post"" described Vance's probe as expansive saying it has been focusing on Trump's business career before he ran for President.



And you notice the leaks from the prosecutor's office.



Then ""The Daily Mail"" -- what's really going on here. We have a long list of things that have been leaked to ""The Daily Mail"" from the prosecution's perspective. Jennifer Weisselberg the former daughter-in-law of the President's Chief Operating Officer of the Trump Organization I say former because she divorced the CFO's son she's all over the place talking about how it has got to be corrupt and so forth and so on.



Apparently she is being interviewed by Vance. Her ex-husband Barry Weisselberg managed skating rinks for the Trump Organization and paid for - - and Allen paid for his grandkid's pricey private school -- big deal.



Former Trump Organization executive Barbara Res believes Trump Lieutenant Allen Weisselberg has flipped on the former President -- so you're getting all the gossip all the -- all the in the weeds which we get all the time. We got it with Russia collusion. We got it with the other phony scandals that they tried to create and now it is in full bloom because this is what prosecutors do.



Who is Cy Vance?



I want you to know a little bit about Cyrus Vance. I don't particularly think he is this upstanding independent ethical prosecutor -- just my opinion. He is an elected hack Democrat.



Let me give you some examples. From ""The New York Post"" ""The New York Police Department secretly recorded disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein apologizing for groping an Italian model and admitting that he was used to behaving that way according to a bombshell report. The incriminating audio clip posted online by the 'New Yorker' Magazine reveals Weinstein alternating between desperate pleas and angry threats as he tried to get Ambra Battilana Gutierrez (an Italian actress) into a downtown Manhattan hotel room.""



So the cops had the goods. They had a recording. ""The exchange reportedly took place inside the Tribeca Grand Hotel one day after Weinstein allegedly pawed Gutierrez. (He grabbed her breasts.) A one-time finalist of the Miss Italy contest in his nearby office on March 27 2015. On the two minute recording that the NYPD had and gave to the prosecutors Gutierrez then 22 has heard directly accusing Weinstein of manhandling her saying with a thick accent 'Why yesterday you touched my breasts?'""



Now what did Vance do with this tape? He refused to prosecute the case. He refused to prosecute Weinstein and in many reports in New York -- I'm not drawing it they drew the connection -- Weinstein's lawyers it is reported by several of these sources later donated to Vance's re-election campaign.



So early on he did nothing about Weinstein even though we had a recording. What else? Here we have a piece from ""The Daily Caller."" ""Manhattan DA Cy Vance looks inept again with the reemergence of Epstein case."" Now what in the world could this be about?



""Billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein was charged with running a sex trafficking ring making him another high profile sexual abuse case Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance's office may have botched.""



""Back in December 2018 'The New York Post' reported Vance believed Epstein's lawyers who claimed according to records in 2011 that there are no real victims here. Then Deputy Chief of Cyrus Vance's Sex Crimes Unit Assistant DA Jennifer Gaffney requested of a Manhattan judge in January 2011 to change Epstein's status in the New York sex offender registry for the most dangerous level three to the least restrictive level one.""



This comes out of Vance's office. ""According to 'The Post' Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Ruth Pickholz was flummoxed by the appeal. She said 'I've never seen the prosecutor's office do anything like this. I've done many cases much less troubling than this one where prosecutors would never make a downward argument like this.' When asked by the judge as to why she was asking for the classification downgrade Gaffney the Deputy to Vance disclosed she never actually spoke to the Florida U.S. attorney who dealt with the investigation into Epstein. The judge said 'I don't think you did much of an investigation here. I am shocked.'""



This is Vance's office who can't do enough investigating of Donald Trump.



""One prosecutor made a mistake Vance's spokesman Danny Frost told ""The Post"" of Gaffney who claimed that Vance himself was not aware of the hearing until many years later.""



That sounds like bull baloney to me.



What else? There is more. ""In an interview with CNN Evelyn Yang wife of Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said that while she was pregnant with her first child in 2012 she was sexually assaulted by her OB GYN at Columbia University. She is one of dozens of patients the doctor allegedly assaulted. Now she and 31 other women are suing Columbia University (this is in 2020) its affiliates and the doctor for allegedly concealing and enabling his misconduct for decades.""



""Yang eventually joined an open case the Manhattan District Attorney's Office had against the doctor (that's Cy Vance) and found that at least 17 other patients had made claims against the doctor and while a grand jury indicted the doctor on multiple felony sex charges. In 2016 the DA's office reached a plea deal with the doctor in which he pleaded guilty to only two of the nine charges against him. One count of forcible touching another count of a third degree sexual abuse. The doctor lost his medical license but he did not go to jail.""



""The Manhattan DA's Office CNN notes is headed by Cy Vance the same attorney who has been criticized for failing to prosecute Harvey Weinstein for misdemeanor sex crime in 2015 and for asking a judge to reduce billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's sex offender status in 2011.""



Now ladies and gentlemen I've got much much more here. ""Manhattan DA Cy Vance spent $250000.00 in asset forfeiture funds on fine dining first class airfare and luxurious hotels during his frequent trips across the country. He lived high on the hog.""



Also the city newspaper reports Vance's spending over a period of that time dwarfs that of any of the other District Attorneys in the other boroughs would go off to Paris and other parts of the world and so forth.



And notice of course nobody investigates him.



This is the District Attorney. I said there's a lot more who has taken off after Trump and his family and his business.



I'll be right back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



LEVIN: Welcome back America. I want to bring in Professor Glenn Reynolds of the University of Tennessee Law School.



Now Professor Reynolds you heard my statement. What do you make of this? What do you make of the focus on Trump in these Democrat strongholds and what I'm saying is clearly the criminalization of politics here?



GLENN REYNOLDS PROFESSOR UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE LAW SCHOOL: Oh absolutely. I mean I wrote a book on this quite a few years ago called ""The Appearance of Impropriety"" which was on the substitution of sort of criminal law and regulation for politics and it has only gotten worse since then.



And it's -- I mean it's sort of weird. I mean you know the Democrats beat Trump. They say he is a loser. He is unpopular yet they act like they're deathly afraid of him. They impeached him a second time after the election was over. And now you see all these prosecutors wanting to wage what we call law-fare against him clearly to try to neutralize him and keep him from running again.



And I think probably also to send a signal to any other outsiders who try to come in as Trump did and sort of disrupt the system that they're going to be punished for doing so.



It is a bigger problem than just Trump but they are absolutely milking it.



We have a weird thing in the American legal system and I had a piece in ""The Columbia Law Review"" recently about what I called ""ham-sandwich nation."" They say a prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich because they control the grand jury as you earlier noted and that's really right.



When you deal with a police officer who is arresting you you have all kinds of due process protections the Supreme Court has given you. When you're on trial in a court you have a lot of due process protection. But the single most important decision in almost every criminal case is when a prosecutor decides whether to bring charges and what charges to bring and prosecutors are utterly unaccountable for that.



They have absolute immunity to lawsuits even if they act in bad faith or for corrupt reasons. They are not regulated by due process. They are very free and that's an enormous amount of power for a prosecutor to have.



A grand jury is meant to constrain that but grand juries have evolved in such a way that they are basically tools of the prosecutor which is what gave rise to the saying that any competent prosecutor should be able to indict a ham sandwich.



LEVIN: And this prosecutor is clearly highly political and thinks a great deal of himself. And so we have a Supreme Court ruling that allows him to go through eight years of Donald Trump's or his organization's tax returns. He is putting pressure on -- according to local reports -- on his chief operating officer that is Vance is the prosecutor putting pressure on his family members trying to exploit the divorce between his son and his former daughter-in-law looking into gift giving to a private school gift giving to pay tuition payments.



The Supreme Court really has opened up a can of worms here hasn't it because you have local DAs all over this country you have Attorneys General in states throughout this country and if it's the position of the Supreme Court that these local elected prosecutors and state elected prosecutors are free to look into a President's tax returns under a pretext of looking for something criminal and so forth I think we've gone down the horrible road here. What are your thoughts?



REYNOLDS: Well yes and you know the truth is if a prosecutor decides to go after you they're probably going to find something. I mean Harvey Silverglate wrote a book called ""Three Felonies a Day"" because he said that's how many felonies the average American commits without realizing it because the law is so complicated and technical.



And Tim Wu who is a Law Professor at Columbia he used to work for the Federal prosecutor in New York at the southern district and they used to play a game where they would pick some famous person Mother Teresa or John Lennon or whoever and the game was to figure out what you could get on them. And then you got extra points if you picked obscure statutes like false pretenses on the high seas or obstructing the mail.



But the outcome was always the same -- jail time.



They have tremendous resources the law is complicated and technical. They can make almost anybody look bad if they're just given free rein to do it. It's not like the old days where we would you know find Professor Plumb dead in the Conservatory and start looking around to see who had had access to the lead pipe that hit him in the head.



Now instead we say well you know that Colonel Mustard seems like a bad guy. Let's see what we can find on him and that's certainly what's going on with Trump here.



LEVIN: Well you talk about eight years of tax returns for a massive far- flung corporation that has billions of dollars in transactions and everybody knows including the prosecutors that you're hiring the best accountants and tax lawyers you can to help you work through this massive Internal Revenue Code which is purposely complex because there are easy ways to collect revenue without having a complex code like that.



And that in the end of the day many of these CEOs and others they sign these tax returns they hope that they're correct. I mean it's not like we can all go to school and learn every aspect of the new Tax Code and what is slipped into the Tax Code. So it is particularly pernicious to focus on that don't you think?



REYNOLDS: Well I think it's sort of funny because you recounted one example where Cy Vance would say well I can't be held responsible for what a junior prosecutor in my office does I didn't even know about it. And yet in essence that's exactly what you're describing as a criminal charge holding somebody liable for something that happened lower down in their company that they probably didn't know about.



LEVIN: And to pressure the son and to take information from his ex-wife that is the son of the CEO or the COO of the Trump Organization and to really start pressuring seeking plea agreements and everything. This is the sleazy underbelly of the prosecutor's office isn't it?



REYNOLDS: It is and you know actually in ""The Appearance of Impropriety"" which is kind of an old book now we talk about how when they were going after Henry Cisneros the prosecutors went so far as to try to trump up a claim of mortgage fraud against his housekeeper as a way of pressuring her into testifying against him.



And while that is deeply unethical it's also extremely common for prosecutors to try to put pressure on friends and family and employees and acquaintances to get them to talk and you know what they say under that kind of pressure may or may not be true but it's got to be what the prosecutor wants.



LEVIN: You know it's interesting Joe Biden and his wife they made their tax returns public. And I looked at their tax returns and others have some experts did and they found something very interesting that I'd like you to comment on when we come back.



They found that they set up two S-corporations made multimillions of dollars flushed the money through the S-corporations so they would not be viewed as employees as they gave basically speeches and got money for speeches and writings and so forth for the sole purpose of evading the Medicare and Obamacare taxes.



Nobody is looking at that. Nobody is investigating that. Nobody is even coming in on that. And there's a serious question whether that is legitimate or not. I would be interested in your input when we come back.

Harris will try to deepen diplomatic ties with Guatemala and Mexico on this trip. Those two nations are key to the Biden administration's efforts to stem the spike in migration at the U.S. border but corruption in the region could complicate those efforts.



Prince Harry and Meghan Markle welcome their second child Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten Windsor. She is named after Queen Elizabeth and Harry's mom Princess Diana. Lili was born in Los Angeles and weighs in at seven pounds 11 ounces. The Little Princess is eighth in line for the British throne.



I'm Jon Scott we take you back now to LIFE LIBERTY & LEVIN.



LEVIN: Welcome back. You know Professor Reynolds I'm not opposed to prosecutors I am not opposed to criminal laws I am not opposed to people being prosecuted for violating laws. Like if they're going to riot and burn down homes and beat cops and do stuff like that I get it and I'm all for it.



What I do not support is the criminalization of politics and these totalitarian tactics against one individual in this country.



So I've mentioned briefly Joe Biden and his tax returns. Do you think the local prosecutors in Wilmington Delaware are going to take a good look at the Biden tax returns?



REYNOLDS: I'm certainly not qualified to offer a tax opinion. But it was surprising what -- how small a splash that made. But you know the press pretty much drives the narrative in this country and the press isn't interested in driving a bad narrative about Joe Biden at least not right now.



LEVIN: You made a point earlier which is correct which is the gap between the investigation and the actual prosecution that these prosecutors have a free run of the field from the one yard line all the way to the to the goal line of the opposing team. And is there anything a citizen can do or try to do to defend themselves?



I mean you look at New York it's a one-party state. You've got one-party judges you've got a one-party elected prosecutors you've got an elected one-party Attorney General. You have the New York Bar which is extremely liberal I don't think a single one of those entities would be sympathetic to former President Donald Trump. So what does one do?



REYNOLDS: At the risk of sounding sad and cynical move somewhere else. Obviously that's something that former President Trump can do. I mean he has already moved to Florida. But they are after him anyway.



For an ordinary citizen I'm sorry to say your resources are a lot less of Donald Trump's and if a local prosecutor goes after you you know you're at some risk and you're probably better off living in a place where the local prosecutor is more likely to be sympathetic or at least not antagonistic.



And you know what they want you to do and this is certainly what Cyrus Vance wants for Trump to do is to keep your head down. They want you not to draw their attention. They want you not to become a public controversial figure. They want you not to draw that kind of assault.



And to some degree even if they don't ever convict you of anything we have a saying in the law the process is the punishment. Being investigated being subjected to possible criminal liability is very stressful it is very expensive.



You know I'd be happy to have a loser pay system in the criminal law where if you are investigated or charged with a crime and you win they have to pay your legal fees out of their budget. That would encourage a much more humble approach but that's not going to happen.



I think that as a citizen in general what you have to do is call them out when they do it and criticize them and make them feel bad because they are political actors. They're elected. But more importantly like all politicians and certainly most prosecutors they are full of ego.



They want to be liked they want to be admired or at least feared; and honestly being mocked and called crooks and being called political thugs and being told that what they're doing is wrong and un-American is painful to them and they should hear it as much as possible when they do things that are wrong and un-American.



Prosecutors have a tough job. Everybody understands that they have to make judgment calls but on the other hand sometimes it is obvious that what's going on is not just a questionable judgment call and when you go out first you say we don't know what crime somebody may have committed but we're going to investigate it because we don't like them. You've admitted what's going on. And that's what's happened here.



LEVIN: And as I listen to you Professor something does come to mind. You know there's a great debate on immunity for police officers -- not in my mind but in the mind of others apparently and they have limited immunity not total immunity. What about a debate about immunity for prosecutors and prosecutorial abuse?



You and I sit here we're relatively intelligent. We've been around a block 4000 or 5000 times. We look at this case and we are struggling to figure out what an innocent citizen can do. And we're all innocent. What an innocent citizen can do when confronted with a rogue prosecutor and the answer is not a hell of a lot.



This is not a Federal case where we have a Supreme Court decision but even that's quite limited. These are local and state prosecutors and it appears to me that if you have a rogue prosecutor and they are elected and if they want to take you down or take you out or mire you and years and years of expensive litigation and as you say try and push you off to the corner so you're not a public face for anything anymore there is damn little you can do about it.



So maybe we ought to start having a debate in this country when you want to talk about immunity you want to talk about abuse well let's talk about immunity and abuse when it comes to Cy Vance's operation or the Attorney General in New York's operation and they are just two. There are many others.



Glenn Reynolds I want to thank you for coming on the program. I want to thank you for all you've been doing over the years. Your wonderful site Instapundit which is really the original it is the original site on the internet that I used to go to and I go to every day now. And so I want to thank you. Take care of yourself.



REYNOLDS: Thank you.



LEVIN: We'll be right back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



LEVIN: Welcome back America. Letitia James is the Attorney General in New York. She has quite an interesting path always in radical ultra-left politics both at the state and local level.



But I wanted to inform you America about who she actually is.



There's a great piece in ""The Washington Times"" by Rowan Scarborough and he says ""The New York Attorney General Letitia James ran for office in 2018 on a campaign promise to charge then President Trump with crimes. She said 'I believe that the President of these United States can be indicted for criminal offenses.' She said in a campaign clip she announced last week (which was a few weeks ago) that she has moved her inquiry into the Trump Organization that he founded from a civil matter to a criminal matter.""



""Her campaign record shows that she pronounced the former President guilty of crimes such as money laundering and vowed to use the power of her office to vanquish him. Once elected she immediately opened an investigation of how the Fifth Avenue headquartered Trump Organization and its real estate empire borrows money and values land. And she's relying on testimony from Michael Cohen (as you know who is a confessed criminal). Once the President's loyal attorney pleaded guilty in 2018 and went to prison for tax fraud and a side taxicab business and for lying to banks to obtain mortgages.""



""Furthermore before the 2018 New York Democratic primary at a time when special counsel Robert Mueller was in his second year trying to find a Trump-Kremlin conspiracy Miss James put herself in the same camp as Mr. Mueller and elevated Mr. Cohen as her star witness quote 'The President of the United States has to worry about three things' she said. 'Mueller Cohen and Tish James' she told Yahoo News. 'We're all closing in on him' as James won the hard fought September 13 primary with a campaign video in which he said she was running because quote 'I will never be afraid to challenge this illegitimate President.'""



""Her video stands has her anti-Trump manifesto being carried out today.""



Well what are they looking at? Well it's already been leaked to the media. Well we're looking at tax issues and we're looking at laundering issues and we're looking at this and we're looking at that.



Brett Tolman was a United States Attorney in Utah. He is fantastic prosecutor former Federal prosecutor. He is the founder of the Tolman Group.



And I wanted to ask you Brett when you have a person like this who is running for office who is hard left who makes it abundantly clear in my view that she is a political hack and that one of her targets and focuses if she is elected will be the former President now of the United States. Is that ethical? I mean shouldn't she even recuse herself? And yet nobody even raises a voice? What do you say?



BRETT TOLMAN FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Yes you know Mark you're right. I think about what Justice Burger said in the Supreme Court case a very famous case about a prosecutor. He said that while a prosecutor could be aggressive what a prosecutor was was the servant of the law and could not strike foul blows.



This is the very essence of striking a foul blow that is to target someone before you have facts in front of you to push for a prosecution.



I mean a prosecutor wields the most powerful authority that we give to any member of the government the ability to take away someone's freedom. And you know I never thought -- I wrote an article Mark about abuses in prosecutors and there are many and accountability is an issue but I never thought I would see the day when when you could do -- you could write an article about a prosecutor who basically got into office on the notion that they would bring a case before they've looked at any facts or had any referral from any investigative body.



I mean that's scary to me and it should be scary to the American people.



LEVIN: And I don't know Brett if I were a judge handling this case and the Attorney General's Office came into my courtroom I would raise the question because I'm an officer of the court but I also have an obligation under the Code of Ethics of New York. And I would raise the question as a Judge it doesn't have to be presented to me I see it in the newspapers I hear what she has said.



Why is your office even in this courtroom? How can you even prosecute this case? How can this be fair? How can there be due process in this matter? Get the hell out of my courtroom.



If I were a judge that's what I would say what do you think?



TOLMAN: Well you'd be a terrific Judge. Hopefully you don't draw a Judge like Judge Sullivan who you know we start to see also the judiciary politics starting to play but there are still really good judges I think and notwithstanding the politics the first level of analysis on this is why is your office involved when you've indicated that you can't be impartial?



And a prosecutor is supposed to be just as willing to decline a case as they are to bring a case. That's not the case in this instance because they built up such hatred for a single individual in the White House and such political animosity towards him that they'd be willing to compromise their own ethical standards and hopefully a court would see that and say exactly as you did; and even more so sanctions should be leveled against any office that tried to bring a case that they indicated before they had any evidence before them that they were intent on bringing.



LEVIN: We'll be right back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



LEVIN: Former U.S. Attorney former Federal prosecutor Brett Tolman founder of the Tolman Group. Brett I had asked didn't the Supreme Court throw the doors wide open now to this kind of abuse of prosecutorial power? I mean there are tens of thousands of local prosecutors and thousands of state prosecutors I think they made a grave mistake here. What do you think?



TOLMAN: Yes the dirty secret in the criminal justice arena is the protection that the prosecutor has from real accountability and the Supreme Court has expanded immunity to such a degree that it's very very difficult to bring any case against a prosecutor even when there is considerable abuse.



But even more than that Mark I think about the fact that prosecutors are largely able to avoid even in their states being monitored and supervised by the State Bar. You look at the Department of Justice prosecutors and the only way that you can bring an ethics claim against them would be for them to institute it themselves internally.



And so the public at large and especially an individual who is targeted has very little ability to ever bring accountability to a prosecutor who is willing to compromise their ethics in order to get some success and that is what we see happening it is a win-at-all cost mentality and now politics drives their investigations and their prosecutions.



LEVIN: And you know Brett it seems to me these elected left-wing hack Democrats who are dressed up as prosecutors that there really needs to be a way and this is something I think the nation needs to now begin to seriously focus on to hold them to account for them to be deposed to determine on what basis they made certain decisions. For them to have their personal finances and their careers on the line when they make decisions about who to take on or not.



This is abundantly clear to any objective person -- any objective person that they are targeting this former President to try and silence him and to try and ruin him and his businesses. That's what's going on.



The Internal Revenue Service of the United States is constantly auditing his taxes. So there's no big issue there. I'm sure the state authorities are constantly auditing his taxes. And what they're doing now is they're pressuring the family members of the Chief Financial Officer or the COO of the Trump Organization threatening him threatening his son exploiting his ex-wife dragging in tuition payments that were made for their children to a private school.



In other words this is penny ante stuff when you're talking about a former President of the United States and this smells like Joseph Stalin to me. This smells like tyranny to me and these so-called civil libertarians in this country are all sitting on their mouths. How do you see this?



TOLMAN: Yes I see the left has been willing to pick and choose what they want to follow especially when it comes to the Constitution and our rights under the Constitution. The First Amendment for example they care nothing about you know circumventing the First Amendment. They want to control the media. They want to control the voices that that we listen to.



And now they are willing to even attack the Fourth Fifth and Sixth Amendments the due process clauses which have been perhaps the most important amendments to the Constitution to protect us from abuse by government when they wield the power to deprive us of our freedom.



And I look at this and I think we can no longer have the faith and the confidence that prosecutors feel that they have a sacred obligation under the law to do justice and that justice does not always mean bringing a case against an individual because you like or dislike them.



Justice recalls -- if we recall what the mandate for the Department of Justice is it is that you are supposed to have fairness in the administration of justice it requires consistency.



Well we do not see consistency we see one political side being attacked and prosecuted while the left escapes accountability. And that's how we know that we need to adjust the criminal justice system especially if we want to have confidence that going forward that those rights under the Constitution means something.



LEVIN: Well said and you know what those judges those members of the New York Bar the New York Bar itself they don't need complaints to be filed against these prosecutors to take steps and to take action.



The integrity of the judicial system in the City of New York and the State of New York is a disgrace right now when you take a high profile case like this and you hear and see what this Democrat hack Manhattan District Attorney is doing and this left-wing unhinged Democrat prosecutor Attorney General is doing and the fact that so far they've been able to get away with it shows me a breakdown in the judicial system in the city and state of New York.



Brett Tolman I want to thank you very much for your great work as a U.S. attorney and for coming on the program as well.



God bless you my friend.



TOLMAN: Thank you Mark.



LEVIN: We'll be right back.

LEVIN: Welcome back America. This is the pocket version of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States which are under absolute assault from a thousand different directions.



This is my new book ""American Marxism"" which is intended to protect this and your individual liberty and your due process rights and your free speech and your freedom of association and what goes on in your kids' classrooms and what goes on in our economic system all of which are under attack.



I want to encourage you to preorder a copy of ""American Marxism"" because this is the most important book I've ever written and I've written many.



Why? Because of our times. This system is under assault by radical leftists. It's true whether it's in the classroom where racism is being taught; whether it's phony climate change which is an attack on capitalism I try to explain each and every one of these progenies of Marxism.



""American Marxism"" where they come from who is responsible for them how they are pushing what their strategies are so we know how to confront them.



I believe a movement is building in this country that is every bit as big as a Reagan Revolution every bit as big as the Tea Party revolution and we need to have a push back against the counter revolution that we are confronting today which seeks to destroy the American Revolution.



This is a fantastic country. We don't judge each other by race we are red blooded Yanks -- Americans. Hope you'll get your copy of ""American Marxism.""



See you next time on LIFE LIBERTY & LEVIN.

U.S. cellphone carriers are offering their most generous discounts in years handing some customers brand-new devices for no money down or small monthly payments stretched over many months. The discounts from AT&T Inc. Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. require customers to make long-term commitments that give carriers the stability they need to reassure investors as they increase spending on 5G network upgrades.

AT&T kicked off the trend in October by offering high-end smartphones such as the iPhone 12 free with an eligible trade-in device. Its discount later dropped to $700 which covers the entire price of an iPhone 12 Mini and most of a standard iPhone 12 among other gadgets.

Verizon followed suit on Tuesday dangling trade-in credits of $700 toward new iPhones and $800 toward high-end Android phones. Both companies' most generous offers require that customers stick with an unlimited data plan for a set time.

""It's essentially a contract"" said Jeff Moore the head of telecom research firm Wave7 Research. ""We're seeing carriers locking in the customer base that they have as opposed to encouraging switchers.""

The free-phone strategy is a throwback to the wireless market a decade ago when U.S. carriers subsidized the price of most new smartphones in exchange for subscribers' guaranteed monthly payments.

The status quo shifted around 2013 and carriers began hawking no-contract wireless plans to customers who bought their own devices.

Subscribers could also pay off the cost of a new smartphone through monthly installments added to their bills.

AT&T and Verizon are now footing most or all of those purchases in exchange for reliable revenue. Verizon's free-phone offer requires a two-year commitment. AT&T on Friday stretched its 30-month payoff plan to cover three years. Both companies are offering the deals to existing customers not just new ones or those adding a new phone line.

T-Mobile is offering trade-in credits worth up to $1000 toward new smartphones paid off over two years. Its offer covers a wider range of mobile data plans but only applies to customers activating a new phone line.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % T AT&T INC. 16.99 +0.14 +0.83% VZ VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. 39.33 +0.44 +1.13% TMUS T-MOBILE US INC. 162.37 -2.23 -1.35% AAPL APPLE INC. 181.71 -1.67 -0.91%

Each carrier covers the cost of the smartphone through monthly bill credits equal to what their regular equipment installment payments would be. More expensive devices such as the iPhone 12 Pro Max -- sticker price $1100 -- yield low monthly installment payments. Verizon's $700 to $800 offer also throws in a $300 gift card for new customers. The discounts require continuous wireless service for at least two years; otherwise customers must pay off the balance of the smartphone purchase.

Wall Street analysts say the offers to existing AT&T and Verizon customers affect a much wider range of eligible users than previous promotions did. Paying to equip new and existing customers with new smartphones has already cost AT&T as much as $2 billion per quarter according to estimates from industry researcher MoffettNathanson LLC.

PCS ARE BACK AS DELL HP DELIVER STRONG SALES FOR DESKTOPS AND NOTEBOOKS

The handouts have yielded AT&T the sharp subscriber growth that investors tend to reward. The Dallas company added nearly 1.4 million postpaid phone connections to its base over the six months that ended in March.

David Christopher executive vice president of AT&T's wireless division said the device credits are more like interest-free financing than a long-term contract for wireless service. He said the carrier started offering subsidized financing because the sticker price on top smartphones has risen from $600 a few years ago to $1000 or more today and buyers wanted more ways to cover the purchase.

""Our customer base is very valuable and low churn is represented by customers voting to stay with AT&T"" he said. ""It resonated in the marketplace. We like the formula.""

Industry executives also say the generous phone deals reveal fiercer competition in the wireless market which has shrunk to three national carriers since T-Mobile's takeover of rival Sprint Corp. in 2020. Satellite operator Dish Network Inc. gained the ingredients for a fourth national system through a Justice Department-brokered settlement but its first cell towers won't go live until later this year.

GE VERIZON TEAM UP ON 5G

The consolidation hasn't yet led to sharply higher service charges though monthly rates haven't fallen either. MoffettNathanson estimates the average revenue per user on a postpaid plan which carriers value for its reliable monthly payments has hovered around roughly $47 over the past three years.

Cable-internet providers Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. are adding to the fray with their own low-price wireless plans. Those deals are only available in the cable providers' footprints where they have arrangements to provide cellular service with help from Verizon's network.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % CMCSA COMCAST CORP. 38.49 -0.20 -0.52% CHTR CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS INC. 271.47 +5.54 +2.08%

""We see a competitive healthy market out there"" T-Mobile Chief Executive Mike Sievert said last month. ""When more people start to enter the switching pool you have more people that are jump balls. And when more people are jump balls T-Mobile tends to do well.""

Verizon meanwhile is counting on customers with cheaper wireless service to upgrade to its most expensive unlimited-data plans which include high-speed 5G access and subscriptions to media services such as Disney+. The carrier said about a fifth of its postpaid wireless accounts subscribed to these premium unlimited plans at the end of 2020 a share executives hope to boost to about 50% by the end of 2023.

AT&T's offers apply to several wireless plans but its executives have touted their ability to upsell customers to premium-tier service bundled with other perks such as HBO Max. The telecom giant recently unveiled plans to spin off HBO owner WarnerMedia into a new company combined with rival Discovery Inc. The carrier hasn't detailed its plans for HBO Max after the deal closes but has said the Hollywood business will remain part of AT&T through mid-2022.

All three national carriers are working to shore up their customer bases as they increase spending on 5G infrastructure. U.S. companies bid about $81 billion earlier this year to secure new federal spectrum licenses that support the high-speed connections adding to the sector's overall debt. Executives have said those down payments will yield benefits once their customers start to notice 5G's faster internet speeds in the coming years.

Until then AT&T and Verizon could keep battling it out in the market with discounts to avoid bleeding subscribers.

""It's a stalemate"" said Craig Moffett a MoffettNathanson analyst. ""History says it's a lot easier to start these kinds of price wars than it is to end them.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3RyYW5zY3JpcHQvbGlmZS1saWJlcnR5LWxldmluLW9uLW1lZGlhLWNyaW1pbmFsLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24taW50by10cnVtcC1vcmdhbml6YXRpb27SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS90cmFuc2NyaXB0L2xpZmUtbGliZXJ0eS1sZXZpbi1vbi1tZWRpYS1jcmltaW5hbC1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWludG8tdHJ1bXAtb3JnYW5pemF0aW9uLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Life Liberty & Levin’ on media criminal investigation into Trump Organization,"This is a rush transcript from ""Life Liberty & Levin"" June 6 2021.

MARK LEVIN FOX NEWS HOST: Hello America. I'm Mark Levin and this is LIFE LIBERTY & LEVIN. This is a very important program and I'm glad you're here.



We pride ourselves in America being a nation of laws. We have this beautiful Constitution of the United States. We have something called due process. We have all kinds of systems in place to protect the individual from government especially a rogue government.



What happens when that government becomes a criminal enterprise? What do I mean by that?



What happens when a District Attorney in a city or an Attorney General in a state use their power to advance a political agenda? Politicians dressed up as prosecutors. And what happens when one individual a prominent individual is focused on and targeted by an entire political party including their prosecutors? Is that what we want in America?



Now we're used to seeing that sort of thing in the old Soviet Union or the modern day Russia under Putin. We're used to seeing that sort of thing happen in Communist China and other totalitarian regimes. But what if I were to tell you what's happening in the United States of America as I speak?



You see we pride ourselves that after an election we don't chase down defeated candidates or even victorious candidates. We don't chase them down to punish them to destroy them and to make sure that they can never have a political career again or any kind of career. That is exactly what's happening to former President Donald Trump.



It is receiving virtually no attention nationwide virtually no outrage. The so-called civil libertarians which haven't been around for the last five years still aren't around. The joke and corrupt media that we have in this country don't give this fair coverage and so I thought we would spend tonight's program doing exactly that.



Every single one of us has a right to competent counsel every single one of us that's at the heart of our justice system. And in our justice system we protect that counsel and we protect the advice that the counsel gives the client. We protect the material that the counsel collects. We protect the notes we protect it all otherwise the individual you me a citizen even a noncitizen cannot get fair representation in our justice system.



So we have rules like the attorney-client privilege. We have attorney work product. We have confidentiality. And we have case law that surrounds all of it to do what? To protect this cocoon to create this cocoon around all this information so the government can't get it specifically. Investigators and prosecutors.



Otherwise what are we? We are the old Soviet Union. We are a totalitarian regime.



And yet for one man in this country Donald Trump it doesn't seem to matter. Does he have a right to counsel? Doesn't his counsel have a right to attorney-client privilege? Attorney work product confidentiality? All which in the end is protecting the client? In this case Donald Trump.



Michael Cohen one of Donald Trump's previous private attorneys is a criminal. He has pled to being a criminal. He has served time in Federal prison. He is a criminal and he had a plea deal and he wants to get even with his former client Donald Trump.



And under that patina of an argument Donald Trump's attorney-client privilege or rights the attorney-work product and confidentiality apparently have gone out the window. Well that's not how the system is supposed to work is it ladies and gentlemen?



Now President Trump has faced a criminalized political system that never wanted him elected and never want them elected again. He was investigated as was his family as were his friends as were his actions as were his campaign compatriots and so forth under the Mueller investigation. When it comes to Donald Trump and his family and his organizations they found nothing.



The Internal Revenue Service has been auditing the President and his organizations endlessly year after year. No criminal prosecutions.



The vast media in this country with all its investigative reporters 99.9 percent have been targeting this President and his circle. They haven't come up with a damn thing. Although the President's taxes were leaked to ""The New York Times"" and nobody seemed to have much of a problem with that there have been endless congressional investigations really Democratic Party investigations by congressional committees led by Chairman from places like New York City Massachusetts and California.



And they've done everything they can -- subpoenas and investigations and hearings -- empty. They came up with nothing.



Two unconstitutional impeachments endless coup conspiracies including out of the F.B.I. and the Intelligence Agencies and I could go on and on but that's not my point today.



There are two Democrats elected Democrats with long-time political histories on behalf of the Democratic Party who have enormous power. One is a prosecutor in Manhattan the other is a State prosecutor in Albany who are trying to destroy Donald Trump and his family and his organization as I speak.



First is Cy Vance. It is Cy Vance Jr. actually because his father was the Secretary of State under Jimmy Carter. He resigned because he was unhappy that Carter was too much of a hawk. That tells you about the Vance family does it?



We have a ""Washington Post"" article here that says that ""Cy Vance has convened a grand jury."" A grand jury to do what? To potentially indict the President?



""Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has convened a special grand jury to hear evidence about potential charges in his investigation of the Trump Organization"" ""The Washington Post"" has learned citing to anonymous sources as they do. The newspaper reported the grand jury has begun to meet recently didn't specify a start date.



""Vance has been investigating Trump for more than two years. A grand jury issued a subpoena for the former President's tax returns on August 2019."" The grand jury is the plaything of the prosecutor just so you know the facts "" ... which Trump successfully fought off until the 2020 election. During that time Vance has suggested in public filings that bank insurance tax fraud all may be focus of his probe.""



In other words they are on a witch hunt. ""The Washington Post"" described Vance's probe as expansive saying it has been focusing on Trump's business career before he ran for President.



And you notice the leaks from the prosecutor's office.



Then ""The Daily Mail"" -- what's really going on here. We have a long list of things that have been leaked to ""The Daily Mail"" from the prosecution's perspective. Jennifer Weisselberg the former daughter-in-law of the President's Chief Operating Officer of the Trump Organization I say former because she divorced the CFO's son she's all over the place talking about how it has got to be corrupt and so forth and so on.



Apparently she is being interviewed by Vance. Her ex-husband Barry Weisselberg managed skating rinks for the Trump Organization and paid for - - and Allen paid for his grandkid's pricey private school -- big deal.



Former Trump Organization executive Barbara Res believes Trump Lieutenant Allen Weisselberg has flipped on the former President -- so you're getting all the gossip all the -- all the in the weeds which we get all the time. We got it with Russia collusion. We got it with the other phony scandals that they tried to create and now it is in full bloom because this is what prosecutors do.



Who is Cy Vance?



I want you to know a little bit about Cyrus Vance. I don't particularly think he is this upstanding independent ethical prosecutor -- just my opinion. He is an elected hack Democrat.



Let me give you some examples. From ""The New York Post"" ""The New York Police Department secretly recorded disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein apologizing for groping an Italian model and admitting that he was used to behaving that way according to a bombshell report. The incriminating audio clip posted online by the 'New Yorker' Magazine reveals Weinstein alternating between desperate pleas and angry threats as he tried to get Ambra Battilana Gutierrez (an Italian actress) into a downtown Manhattan hotel room.""



So the cops had the goods. They had a recording. ""The exchange reportedly took place inside the Tribeca Grand Hotel one day after Weinstein allegedly pawed Gutierrez. (He grabbed her breasts.) A one-time finalist of the Miss Italy contest in his nearby office on March 27 2015. On the two minute recording that the NYPD had and gave to the prosecutors Gutierrez then 22 has heard directly accusing Weinstein of manhandling her saying with a thick accent 'Why yesterday you touched my breasts?'""



Now what did Vance do with this tape? He refused to prosecute the case. He refused to prosecute Weinstein and in many reports in New York -- I'm not drawing it they drew the connection -- Weinstein's lawyers it is reported by several of these sources later donated to Vance's re-election campaign.



So early on he did nothing about Weinstein even though we had a recording. What else? Here we have a piece from ""The Daily Caller."" ""Manhattan DA Cy Vance looks inept again with the reemergence of Epstein case."" Now what in the world could this be about?



""Billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein was charged with running a sex trafficking ring making him another high profile sexual abuse case Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance's office may have botched.""



""Back in December 2018 'The New York Post' reported Vance believed Epstein's lawyers who claimed according to records in 2011 that there are no real victims here. Then Deputy Chief of Cyrus Vance's Sex Crimes Unit Assistant DA Jennifer Gaffney requested of a Manhattan judge in January 2011 to change Epstein's status in the New York sex offender registry for the most dangerous level three to the least restrictive level one.""



This comes out of Vance's office. ""According to 'The Post' Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Ruth Pickholz was flummoxed by the appeal. She said 'I've never seen the prosecutor's office do anything like this. I've done many cases much less troubling than this one where prosecutors would never make a downward argument like this.' When asked by the judge as to why she was asking for the classification downgrade Gaffney the Deputy to Vance disclosed she never actually spoke to the Florida U.S. attorney who dealt with the investigation into Epstein. The judge said 'I don't think you did much of an investigation here. I am shocked.'""



This is Vance's office who can't do enough investigating of Donald Trump.



""One prosecutor made a mistake Vance's spokesman Danny Frost told ""The Post"" of Gaffney who claimed that Vance himself was not aware of the hearing until many years later.""



That sounds like bull baloney to me.



What else? There is more. ""In an interview with CNN Evelyn Yang wife of Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said that while she was pregnant with her first child in 2012 she was sexually assaulted by her OB GYN at Columbia University. She is one of dozens of patients the doctor allegedly assaulted. Now she and 31 other women are suing Columbia University (this is in 2020) its affiliates and the doctor for allegedly concealing and enabling his misconduct for decades.""



""Yang eventually joined an open case the Manhattan District Attorney's Office had against the doctor (that's Cy Vance) and found that at least 17 other patients had made claims against the doctor and while a grand jury indicted the doctor on multiple felony sex charges. In 2016 the DA's office reached a plea deal with the doctor in which he pleaded guilty to only two of the nine charges against him. One count of forcible touching another count of a third degree sexual abuse. The doctor lost his medical license but he did not go to jail.""



""The Manhattan DA's Office CNN notes is headed by Cy Vance the same attorney who has been criticized for failing to prosecute Harvey Weinstein for misdemeanor sex crime in 2015 and for asking a judge to reduce billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's sex offender status in 2011.""



Now ladies and gentlemen I've got much much more here. ""Manhattan DA Cy Vance spent $250000.00 in asset forfeiture funds on fine dining first class airfare and luxurious hotels during his frequent trips across the country. He lived high on the hog.""



Also the city newspaper reports Vance's spending over a period of that time dwarfs that of any of the other District Attorneys in the other boroughs would go off to Paris and other parts of the world and so forth.



And notice of course nobody investigates him.



This is the District Attorney. I said there's a lot more who has taken off after Trump and his family and his business.



I'll be right back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



LEVIN: Welcome back America. I want to bring in Professor Glenn Reynolds of the University of Tennessee Law School.



Now Professor Reynolds you heard my statement. What do you make of this? What do you make of the focus on Trump in these Democrat strongholds and what I'm saying is clearly the criminalization of politics here?



GLENN REYNOLDS PROFESSOR UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE LAW SCHOOL: Oh absolutely. I mean I wrote a book on this quite a few years ago called ""The Appearance of Impropriety"" which was on the substitution of sort of criminal law and regulation for politics and it has only gotten worse since then.



And it's -- I mean it's sort of weird. I mean you know the Democrats beat Trump. They say he is a loser. He is unpopular yet they act like they're deathly afraid of him. They impeached him a second time after the election was over. And now you see all these prosecutors wanting to wage what we call law-fare against him clearly to try to neutralize him and keep him from running again.



And I think probably also to send a signal to any other outsiders who try to come in as Trump did and sort of disrupt the system that they're going to be punished for doing so.



It is a bigger problem than just Trump but they are absolutely milking it.



We have a weird thing in the American legal system and I had a piece in ""The Columbia Law Review"" recently about what I called ""ham-sandwich nation."" They say a prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich because they control the grand jury as you earlier noted and that's really right.



When you deal with a police officer who is arresting you you have all kinds of due process protections the Supreme Court has given you. When you're on trial in a court you have a lot of due process protection. But the single most important decision in almost every criminal case is when a prosecutor decides whether to bring charges and what charges to bring and prosecutors are utterly unaccountable for that.



They have absolute immunity to lawsuits even if they act in bad faith or for corrupt reasons. They are not regulated by due process. They are very free and that's an enormous amount of power for a prosecutor to have.



A grand jury is meant to constrain that but grand juries have evolved in such a way that they are basically tools of the prosecutor which is what gave rise to the saying that any competent prosecutor should be able to indict a ham sandwich.



LEVIN: And this prosecutor is clearly highly political and thinks a great deal of himself. And so we have a Supreme Court ruling that allows him to go through eight years of Donald Trump's or his organization's tax returns. He is putting pressure on -- according to local reports -- on his chief operating officer that is Vance is the prosecutor putting pressure on his family members trying to exploit the divorce between his son and his former daughter-in-law looking into gift giving to a private school gift giving to pay tuition payments.



The Supreme Court really has opened up a can of worms here hasn't it because you have local DAs all over this country you have Attorneys General in states throughout this country and if it's the position of the Supreme Court that these local elected prosecutors and state elected prosecutors are free to look into a President's tax returns under a pretext of looking for something criminal and so forth I think we've gone down the horrible road here. What are your thoughts?



REYNOLDS: Well yes and you know the truth is if a prosecutor decides to go after you they're probably going to find something. I mean Harvey Silverglate wrote a book called ""Three Felonies a Day"" because he said that's how many felonies the average American commits without realizing it because the law is so complicated and technical.



And Tim Wu who is a Law Professor at Columbia he used to work for the Federal prosecutor in New York at the southern district and they used to play a game where they would pick some famous person Mother Teresa or John Lennon or whoever and the game was to figure out what you could get on them. And then you got extra points if you picked obscure statutes like false pretenses on the high seas or obstructing the mail.



But the outcome was always the same -- jail time.



They have tremendous resources the law is complicated and technical. They can make almost anybody look bad if they're just given free rein to do it. It's not like the old days where we would you know find Professor Plumb dead in the Conservatory and start looking around to see who had had access to the lead pipe that hit him in the head.



Now instead we say well you know that Colonel Mustard seems like a bad guy. Let's see what we can find on him and that's certainly what's going on with Trump here.



LEVIN: Well you talk about eight years of tax returns for a massive far- flung corporation that has billions of dollars in transactions and everybody knows including the prosecutors that you're hiring the best accountants and tax lawyers you can to help you work through this massive Internal Revenue Code which is purposely complex because there are easy ways to collect revenue without having a complex code like that.



And that in the end of the day many of these CEOs and others they sign these tax returns they hope that they're correct. I mean it's not like we can all go to school and learn every aspect of the new Tax Code and what is slipped into the Tax Code. So it is particularly pernicious to focus on that don't you think?



REYNOLDS: Well I think it's sort of funny because you recounted one example where Cy Vance would say well I can't be held responsible for what a junior prosecutor in my office does I didn't even know about it. And yet in essence that's exactly what you're describing as a criminal charge holding somebody liable for something that happened lower down in their company that they probably didn't know about.



LEVIN: And to pressure the son and to take information from his ex-wife that is the son of the CEO or the COO of the Trump Organization and to really start pressuring seeking plea agreements and everything. This is the sleazy underbelly of the prosecutor's office isn't it?



REYNOLDS: It is and you know actually in ""The Appearance of Impropriety"" which is kind of an old book now we talk about how when they were going after Henry Cisneros the prosecutors went so far as to try to trump up a claim of mortgage fraud against his housekeeper as a way of pressuring her into testifying against him.



And while that is deeply unethical it's also extremely common for prosecutors to try to put pressure on friends and family and employees and acquaintances to get them to talk and you know what they say under that kind of pressure may or may not be true but it's got to be what the prosecutor wants.



LEVIN: You know it's interesting Joe Biden and his wife they made their tax returns public. And I looked at their tax returns and others have some experts did and they found something very interesting that I'd like you to comment on when we come back.



They found that they set up two S-corporations made multimillions of dollars flushed the money through the S-corporations so they would not be viewed as employees as they gave basically speeches and got money for speeches and writings and so forth for the sole purpose of evading the Medicare and Obamacare taxes.



Nobody is looking at that. Nobody is investigating that. Nobody is even coming in on that. And there's a serious question whether that is legitimate or not. I would be interested in your input when we come back.

Lili was born in Los Angeles and weighs in at seven pounds 11 ounces. The Little Princess is eighth in line for the British throne.



I'm Jon Scott we take you back now to LIFE LIBERTY & LEVIN.



LEVIN: Welcome back. You know Professor Reynolds I'm not opposed to prosecutors I am not opposed to criminal laws I am not opposed to people being prosecuted for violating laws. Like if they're going to riot and burn down homes and beat cops and do stuff like that I get it and I'm all for it.



What I do not support is the criminalization of politics and these totalitarian tactics against one individual in this country.



So I've mentioned briefly Joe Biden and his tax returns. Do you think the local prosecutors in Wilmington Delaware are going to take a good look at the Biden tax returns?



REYNOLDS: I'm certainly not qualified to offer a tax opinion. But it was surprising what -- how small a splash that made. But you know the press pretty much drives the narrative in this country and the press isn't interested in driving a bad narrative about Joe Biden at least not right now.



LEVIN: You made a point earlier which is correct which is the gap between the investigation and the actual prosecution that these prosecutors have a free run of the field from the one yard line all the way to the to the goal line of the opposing team. And is there anything a citizen can do or try to do to defend themselves?



I mean you look at New York it's a one-party state. You've got one-party judges you've got a one-party elected prosecutors you've got an elected one-party Attorney General. You have the New York Bar which is extremely liberal I don't think a single one of those entities would be sympathetic to former President Donald Trump. So what does one do?



REYNOLDS: At the risk of sounding sad and cynical move somewhere else. Obviously that's something that former President Trump can do. I mean he has already moved to Florida. But they are after him anyway.



For an ordinary citizen I'm sorry to say your resources are a lot less of Donald Trump's and if a local prosecutor goes after you you know you're at some risk and you're probably better off living in a place where the local prosecutor is more likely to be sympathetic or at least not antagonistic.



And you know what they want you to do and this is certainly what Cyrus Vance wants for Trump to do is to keep your head down. They want you not to draw their attention. They want you not to become a public controversial figure. They want you not to draw that kind of assault.



And to some degree even if they don't ever convict you of anything we have a saying in the law the process is the punishment. Being investigated being subjected to possible criminal liability is very stressful it is very expensive.



You know I'd be happy to have a loser pay system in the criminal law where if you are investigated or charged with a crime and you win they have to pay your legal fees out of their budget. That would encourage a much more humble approach but that's not going to happen.



I think that as a citizen in general what you have to do is call them out when they do it and criticize them and make them feel bad because they are political actors. They're elected. But more importantly like all politicians and certainly most prosecutors they are full of ego.



They want to be liked they want to be admired or at least feared; and honestly being mocked and called crooks and being called political thugs and being told that what they're doing is wrong and un-American is painful to them and they should hear it as much as possible when they do things that are wrong and un-American.



Prosecutors have a tough job. Everybody understands that they have to make judgment calls but on the other hand sometimes it is obvious that what's going on is not just a questionable judgment call and when you go out first you say we don't know what crime somebody may have committed but we're going to investigate it because we don't like them. You've admitted what's going on. And that's what's happened here.



LEVIN: And as I listen to you Professor something does come to mind. You know there's a great debate on immunity for police officers -- not in my mind but in the mind of others apparently and they have limited immunity not total immunity. What about a debate about immunity for prosecutors and prosecutorial abuse?



You and I sit here we're relatively intelligent. We've been around a block 4000 or 5000 times. We look at this case and we are struggling to figure out what an innocent citizen can do. And we're all innocent. What an innocent citizen can do when confronted with a rogue prosecutor and the answer is not a hell of a lot.



This is not a Federal case where we have a Supreme Court decision but even that's quite limited. These are local and state prosecutors and it appears to me that if you have a rogue prosecutor and they are elected and if they want to take you down or take you out or mire you and years and years of expensive litigation and as you say try and push you off to the corner so you're not a public face for anything anymore there is damn little you can do about it.



So maybe we ought to start having a debate in this country when you want to talk about immunity you want to talk about abuse well let's talk about immunity and abuse when it comes to Cy Vance's operation or the Attorney General in New York's operation and they are just two. There are many others.



Glenn Reynolds I want to thank you for coming on the program. I want to thank you for all you've been doing over the years.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



LEVIN: Welcome back America. Letitia James is the Attorney General in New York. She has quite an interesting path always in radical ultra-left politics both at the state and local level.



But I wanted to inform you America about who she actually is.



There's a great piece in ""The Washington Times"" by Rowan Scarborough and he says ""The New York Attorney General Letitia James ran for office in 2018 on a campaign promise to charge then President Trump with crimes. She said 'I believe that the President of these United States can be indicted for criminal offenses.' She said in a campaign clip she announced last week (which was a few weeks ago) that she has moved her inquiry into the Trump Organization that he founded from a civil matter to a criminal matter.""



""Her campaign record shows that she pronounced the former President guilty of crimes such as money laundering and vowed to use the power of her office to vanquish him. Once elected she immediately opened an investigation of how the Fifth Avenue headquartered Trump Organization and its real estate empire borrows money and values land. And she's relying on testimony from Michael Cohen (as you know who is a confessed criminal). Once the President's loyal attorney pleaded guilty in 2018 and went to prison for tax fraud and a side taxicab business and for lying to banks to obtain mortgages.""



""Furthermore before the 2018 New York Democratic primary at a time when special counsel Robert Mueller was in his second year trying to find a Trump-Kremlin conspiracy Miss James put herself in the same camp as Mr. Mueller and elevated Mr. Cohen as her star witness quote 'The President of the United States has to worry about three things' she said. 'Mueller Cohen and Tish James' she told Yahoo News. 'We're all closing in on him' as James won the hard fought September 13 primary with a campaign video in which he said she was running because quote 'I will never be afraid to challenge this illegitimate President.'""



""Her video stands has her anti-Trump manifesto being carried out today.""



Well what are they looking at? Well it's already been leaked to the media. Well we're looking at tax issues and we're looking at laundering issues and we're looking at this and we're looking at that.



Brett Tolman was a United States Attorney in Utah. He is fantastic prosecutor former Federal prosecutor. He is the founder of the Tolman Group.



And I wanted to ask you Brett when you have a person like this who is running for office who is hard left who makes it abundantly clear in my view that she is a political hack and that one of her targets and focuses if she is elected will be the former President now of the United States. Is that ethical? I mean shouldn't she even recuse herself? And yet nobody even raises a voice? What do you say?



BRETT TOLMAN FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Yes you know Mark you're right. I think about what Justice Burger said in the Supreme Court case a very famous case about a prosecutor. He said that while a prosecutor could be aggressive what a prosecutor was was the servant of the law and could not strike foul blows.



This is the very essence of striking a foul blow that is to target someone before you have facts in front of you to push for a prosecution.



I mean a prosecutor wields the most powerful authority that we give to any member of the government the ability to take away someone's freedom. And you know I never thought -- I wrote an article Mark about abuses in prosecutors and there are many and accountability is an issue but I never thought I would see the day when when you could do -- you could write an article about a prosecutor who basically got into office on the notion that they would bring a case before they've looked at any facts or had any referral from any investigative body.



I mean that's scary to me and it should be scary to the American people.



LEVIN: And I don't know Brett if I were a judge handling this case and the Attorney General's Office came into my courtroom I would raise the question because I'm an officer of the court but I also have an obligation under the Code of Ethics of New York. And I would raise the question as a Judge it doesn't have to be presented to me I see it in the newspapers I hear what she has said.



Why is your office even in this courtroom? How can you even prosecute this case? How can this be fair? How can there be due process in this matter? Get the hell out of my courtroom.



If I were a judge that's what I would say what do you think?



TOLMAN: Well you'd be a terrific Judge. Hopefully you don't draw a Judge like Judge Sullivan who you know we start to see also the judiciary politics starting to play but there are still really good judges I think and notwithstanding the politics the first level of analysis on this is why is your office involved when you've indicated that you can't be impartial?



And a prosecutor is supposed to be just as willing to decline a case as they are to bring a case. That's not the case in this instance because they built up such hatred for a single individual in the White House and such political animosity towards him that they'd be willing to compromise their own ethical standards and hopefully a court would see that and say exactly as you did; and even more so sanctions should be leveled against any office that tried to bring a case that they indicated before they had any evidence before them that they were intent on bringing.



LEVIN: We'll be right back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



LEVIN: Former U.S. Attorney former Federal prosecutor Brett Tolman founder of the Tolman Group. Brett I had asked didn't the Supreme Court throw the doors wide open now to this kind of abuse of prosecutorial power? I mean there are tens of thousands of local prosecutors and thousands of state prosecutors I think they made a grave mistake here. What do you think?



TOLMAN: Yes the dirty secret in the criminal justice arena is the protection that the prosecutor has from real accountability and the Supreme Court has expanded immunity to such a degree that it's very very difficult to bring any case against a prosecutor even when there is considerable abuse.



But even more than that Mark I think about the fact that prosecutors are largely able to avoid even in their states being monitored and supervised by the State Bar. You look at the Department of Justice prosecutors and the only way that you can bring an ethics claim against them would be for them to institute it themselves internally.



And so the public at large and especially an individual who is targeted has very little ability to ever bring accountability to a prosecutor who is willing to compromise their ethics in order to get some success and that is what we see happening it is a win-at-all cost mentality and now politics drives their investigations and their prosecutions.



LEVIN: And you know Brett it seems to me these elected left-wing hack Democrats who are dressed up as prosecutors that there really needs to be a way and this is something I think the nation needs to now begin to seriously focus on to hold them to account for them to be deposed to determine on what basis they made certain decisions. For them to have their personal finances and their careers on the line when they make decisions about who to take on or not.



This is abundantly clear to any objective person -- any objective person that they are targeting this former President to try and silence him and to try and ruin him and his businesses. That's what's going on.



The Internal Revenue Service of the United States is constantly auditing his taxes. So there's no big issue there. I'm sure the state authorities are constantly auditing his taxes. And what they're doing now is they're pressuring the family members of the Chief Financial Officer or the COO of the Trump Organization threatening him threatening his son exploiting his ex-wife dragging in tuition payments that were made for their children to a private school.



In other words this is penny ante stuff when you're talking about a former President of the United States and this smells like Joseph Stalin to me. This smells like tyranny to me and these so-called civil libertarians in this country are all sitting on their mouths. How do you see this?



TOLMAN: Yes I see the left has been willing to pick and choose what they want to follow especially when it comes to the Constitution and our rights under the Constitution. The First Amendment for example they care nothing about you know circumventing the First Amendment. They want to control the media. They want to control the voices that that we listen to.



And now they are willing to even attack the Fourth Fifth and Sixth Amendments the due process clauses which have been perhaps the most important amendments to the Constitution to protect us from abuse by government when they wield the power to deprive us of our freedom.



And I look at this and I think we can no longer have the faith and the confidence that prosecutors feel that they have a sacred obligation under the law to do justice and that justice does not always mean bringing a case against an individual because you like or dislike them.



Justice recalls -- if we recall what the mandate for the Department of Justice is it is that you are supposed to have fairness in the administration of justice it requires consistency.



Well we do not see consistency we see one political side being attacked and prosecuted while the left escapes accountability. And that's how we know that we need to adjust the criminal justice system especially if we want to have confidence that going forward that those rights under the Constitution means something.



LEVIN: Well said and you know what those judges those members of the New York Bar the New York Bar itself they don't need complaints to be filed against these prosecutors to take steps and to take action.



The integrity of the judicial system in the City of New York and the State of New York is a disgrace right now when you take a high profile case like this and you hear and see what this Democrat hack Manhattan District Attorney is doing and this left-wing unhinged Democrat prosecutor Attorney General is doing and the fact that so far they've been able to get away with it shows me a breakdown in the judicial system in the city and state of New York.



Brett Tolman I want to thank you very much for your great work as a U.S. attorney and for coming on the program as well.



God bless you my friend.



TOLMAN: Thank you Mark.



LEVIN: We'll be right back.

LEVIN: Welcome back America. This is the pocket version of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States which are under absolute assault from a thousand different directions.



This is my new book ""American Marxism"" which is intended to protect this and your individual liberty and your due process rights and your free speech and your freedom of association and what goes on in your kids' classrooms and what goes on in our economic system all of which are under attack.



I want to encourage you to preorder a copy of ""American Marxism"" because this is the most important book I've ever written and I've written many.



Why? Because of our times. This system is under assault by radical leftists. It's true whether it's in the classroom where racism is being taught; whether it's phony climate change which is an attack on capitalism I try to explain each and every one of these progenies of Marxism.



""American Marxism"" where they come from who is responsible for them how they are pushing what their strategies are so we know how to confront them.



I believe a movement is building in this country that is every bit as big as a Reagan Revolution every bit as big as the Tea Party revolution and we need to have a push back against the counter revolution that we are confronting today which seeks to destroy the American Revolution.



This is a fantastic country. We don't judge each other by race we are red blooded Yanks -- Americans. Hope you'll get your copy of ""American Marxism.""

The officials are likely to be held guilty for violation of the Prevention of Fraudulent and Unfair Trading Practices (PFUTP) norms conflict of interest and other code of conduct issuess the sources said. The SEBI order is expected within the next fortnight.

Confidential information

The regulator has found that these senior executives in their fiduciary capacity had access to confidential information such as scheme borrowings regulatory filings and other updates before they were made public.

FTMF decided to shut six debt schemes on April 23 2020 by suspending redemptions for more than 3 lakh investors locking up their investments worth around ₹26000 crore. However just weeks ahead of this decision to shut the six schemes the executives and their close relatives withdrew their investments.

SEBI has found that just five executives their spouses and relatives withdrew ₹56-60 crore from the schemes between March and April 2020. This was when the fund was battling stress and liquidity crunch and had written to SEBI to hike the borrowing limits in March.

Another company MyWish Marketplaces which has been under the scanner of SEBI and the Enforcement Directorate too withdrew around ₹22 crore during the same time.

Vivek Kudva Head of Asia Pacific for FT his wife Roopa who is a partner and managing director of Omidyar Network India and his mother Vasanthi are alleged to have redeemed over ₹30 crore from the debt schemes between March 20 and April 3 2020. SEBI found that the concerns of redemption concentration and liquidity risk were known to Vivek Kudva as per various e-mails dated March 18 and 19.

This apart Kudva and Alok Sethi another trustee of FTMF are also directors of MyWish Marketplaces. Other key officials too withdrew their money from the schemes and SEBI is likely to take action against them the sources said.

Course of action unclear

However it is not clear what course of action the regulator will take against other redemptions as it was difficult to ascertain who informed these corporate bodies and large institutions to exit the schemes before they were shut the sources said. The FTMF debt scheme matter is already being before the Supreme Court.

Franklin refuses comment

When contacted an FTMF spokesperson said “We cannot comment on queries which are based on factual inaccuracies speculation and conjecture.”

FT further said that it had robust policies related to personal transactions of employees directors and for managing conflicts of interest.

The six schemes under winding up have distributed ₹14572 crore to unitholders as on April 30 2021 and an amount of ₹3205.25 crore is available for distribution as of June 4 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMCw3MzQwLEwtMzkwOTMzNiwwMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gong employees heading for $1 billion payday: “We celebrated for five minutes and moved on” | Ctech,"Gong employees have got a big payday coming their way. The company which last week became Israel’s highest valued privately owned tech startup following its $250 million Series E round at a valuation of $7.25 billion after money is expected to allow its employees to sell their shares in the company as it did in the previous round last August.

Gong which developed software for analyzing calls from sales and service representatives employs 600 people - all of whom hold options. It is estimated that about 10%-15% of the company's holdings are in the hands of the employees valued between $750 million in a conservative estimate and about $1 billion in other estimates.

On average each employee holds options worth around $150000-$200000 but CEO and co-founder Amit Bendov noted in a conversation with Calcalist that according to the company’s new value there are employees (more than a few according to Calcalist's estimate) with at least $1 million in options. “We have nearly 600 employees some with millions of dollars in options. In the previous round we allowed employees to sell their shares and only 40% chose to do so. I guess a similar amount of employees will sell this time. It makes me very happy that people can sell and get rich. I guess many will be able to pay off their mortgage or buy a new car.""

First-time investor alongside industry insider

The current round of fundraising was led by investment firm Franklin Templeton in its first significant investment in a private Israeli company. The global investment firm was founded in New York in 1947 and currently manages $1.5 trillion in assets. One of the largest shareholders in the company and one of its first investors is Shlomo Kramer. Existing investors also participated in the current round including Coatue Salesforce Ventures Sequoia Thrive Capital and Tiger Capital.

According to estimates Kramer founder of Check Point and Imperva and now CEO of Cato Networks owns about 10%-15% of Gong a holding worth about $1 billion. Kramer also has significant holdings in At-Bay which ensures companies against cyber threats; cyber company Aqua which announced a $135 million funding round at a $1 billion valuation in March; American company SomaLogic which recently went public and is traded at a market value of about $2.2 billion; fintech unicorn Fundbox as well as a 20% share in Exabeam valued at around $500 million.

The funds raised in this round are expected to be used to double the workforce in the company with plans to reach about 300 employees in Israel and about 1000 employees in total worldwide by the end of 2021. It is worth noting that back in December 2018 Gong won Calcalist and Microsoft promising start-up competition in the field of big data and AI. Gong customers include Autodesk Hubspot LinkedIn Outreach PayPal Shopify Slack Twilio Zillow Zoominfo.

The value Gong reached recently was higher than any other private Israeli company. Next Insurance recently announced a company valuation of $4 billion with cyber company Snyk being valued at $4.7 billion. Gong surpassed those companies by a significant margin. ""We try not to make a fuss about it but there is also no need for fake modesty it is a beautiful milestone. We do not live for it and are not excited about the value. We celebrated for five minutes and moved on.""

“A proportional spike”

Bendov said that the company did not demand a specific value during this round and rather let investors who wanted to invest in the company view the data and make appropriate offers. ""We received many offers and built a consortium of investors because many were willing to take up the whole round. We did not necessarily go with the highest offer we looked at the identity of the investors and looked for deep pockets for the long term.""

The record-breaking value of the company does not scare Bendov who said that ""Gong can reach much more than $20 billion but the burden of proof is on us. We are not heading for an IPO in the coming months and we do not know what the market will be like and what the market multipliers will be by then. We always thought about something big about a company that is worth billions. I always thought it was possible to reach a hundred billion.""

The company's growth rate has accelerated significantly in the last ten months and it is estimated that its annual revenue rate is at $100 million rising from $30 million in its previous round. ""The spike in our value is proportional to the spike across all the data not only in revenue but in the quality of transactions in the caliber of transactions the number of innovations and how many customers are increasing their use of our software"" said Bendov.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9waGlsaXBwaW5lLW1vYmlsZS13YWxsZXQtZ2Nhc2gtYnV5LXNlbGwtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY2llcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Popular Philippine Mobile Wallet Gcash Explores Letting Users Buy Sell Store Cryptocurrencies – News Bitcoin News,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcmFuZGJlbmNoLmNvbS9hcHByZW50aWNlLWxhd3llci93aHktdGhlLWNvbGxlZ2l1bS1uZWVkcy10by1jb25zaWRlci1hcHBvaW50aW5nLW1vcmUtd29tZW4tdG8taGlnaGVyLWp1ZGljaWFyedIBhQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYXJhbmRiZW5jaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2FwcHJlbnRpY2UtbGF3eWVyL3doeS10aGUtY29sbGVnaXVtLW5lZWRzLXRvLWNvbnNpZGVyLWFwcG9pbnRpbmctbW9yZS13b21lbi10by1oaWdoZXItanVkaWNpYXJ5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the Collegium needs to consider appointing more women to higher judiciary,"As it was stated by the South African Judicial Services Commission (2010) it is also important to keep in mind the message which is sent to the community at large whenever an appointment to the Apex Court is made. Hence in order for the Supreme Court to show that they are committed to the agenda of women empowerment and better representation of all genders in the judiciary it is vital that India receives a female Chief Justice. However the same remains a distant reality as of now.

After the recent retirement of two prominent female supreme court justices Indu Malhotra and Justice R. Banumathi there is only one female justice in the Apex Court Justice Indira Banerjee who is also set to retire in 2022. Having one female justice and a male dominated Supreme Court hardly seems fair in a country where 48 percent of the population is women and there is an increasing focus on improving the representation of women in all the pillar of democracy. The new Supreme Court collegium which is headed by India’s 48th Chief Justice N.V Ramana is burdened with a huge but necessary imperative of reducing the gender disparity in the Indian judiciary.

The former Chief Justice S.A. Bobde stated that “Time has come for a woman Chief Justice of India” however his actions stated otherwise when it was upon him and the collegium headed by him to appoint Justice B.V Nagarathna of the Karnataka High Court.

Justice Nagarathna stands at Rank 46 in the seniority list to the Supreme Court who one day could have become the Chief Justice. However the collegium headed by CJI Bobde failed to reach a consensus for her appointment and this now serves an example of how the glass ceiling in the judiciary is becoming prominent with each passing day.",,,
FCX,Freeport-McMoRan,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3R1Y3Nvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9wZWNhbi1mYXJtZXItbWluaW5nLWNvbXBhbnktaG9wZS10by1hdm9pZC1iaWctY3V0cy1pbi1jYXAtd2F0ZXIvYXJ0aWNsZV82ZTFkNjU4YS1iOGVkLTExZWItYjdjYS0wNzFlMTFiMjZiMzYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pecan farmer mining company hope to avoid big cuts in CAP water,"For two of the Tucson area’s biggest suburban water users the impact of Central Arizona Project shortages is all about the long term.

Officials of Farmers Investment Co. which grows pecans in Sahuarita and Freeport McMoRan which runs a major copper mine in the Green Valley area say they are not concerned about shortages on the scale likely to befall the CAP in the next few years.

But they are concerned about the effects of shortages should the current drought last a long time — which is what many scientists are forecasting.

FICO’s pecan groves now get about 40% of their water from CAP supplies owned by Freeport and Tucson Water. They might at some point have to replace at least some of that with the groundwater pumping that CAP was brought in to replace.

In addition Dick Walden FICO’s president and CEO said he believes this region will need to eventually bring in additional water supplies possibly by building a desalination plant for seawater or brackish groundwater to counteract impacts of increasingly arid weather and accelerating population growth.

Brackish water found in groundwater in parts of western and west-central Arizona has more salts and other dissolved solids than fresh drinking water but less than seawater.

“We also need to leverage technology to use water more efficiently as we are doing here on the farm” Walden said. “Hopefully more efficient water consumption and use of renewable water will get us through this challenging period.”

Major investments

Both companies have invested heavily in bringing CAP’s Colorado River water to Southern Arizona.

FICO and Freeport last year jointly finished work on a $17.1 million project to build a series of CAP-bearing pipelines totaling 11 miles to take the water to FICO’s pecan groves in the Sahuarita-Green Valley area.

Freeport supplies 65% of the 10000 acre-feet of CAP water that’s now used on the pecan groves and paid $11.2 million for construction. FICO supplied the balance of the construction tab.

The remaining CAP water used at the groves is owned by Tucson Water.

In all Freeport says it imports about 30000 to 50000 acre-feet of CAP a year to the Phoenix and Tucson areas. The company exchanges the CAP water besides what’s used on the pecan groves with other users for the rights to groundwater lying closer to its mines in the Green Valley area and in Gila County’s Miami.

Freeport leases 22000 acre feet of CAP water from the Gila River Indian Community that is being stored at other farms around the state which the state recognizes as “groundwater savings facilities.”

Able to pump elsewhere

Putting that CAP water onto the farms allows Freeport to do future exchanges of that water for other groundwater or to gain long-term credits from the stored CAP that allow Freeport to pump groundwater elsewhere including at its Sierrita Mine just west of Green Valley.

The credits are granted by the Arizona Department of Water Resources which regulates groundwater pumping under a 1980 state law calling for an end to over-pumping of aquifers in the Tucson area and other urban areas by 2025. These credits provide legal compensation for the groundwater pumped elsewhere and Tucson Water gets similar credits for the CAP water it uses to irrigate the groves.

Between them the pecan groves and the Sierrita Mine use 48000 to 51000 acre-feet a year. That’s equivalent to about half of what the 739000 people served by Tucson Water use each year.

No immediate cuts

When shortages occur both Freeport’s and Tucson Water’s CAP supplies being used at the groves won’t be affected for at least the first two years because that water has a higher priority than the CAP water that will be cut at first.

Those first-round cuts likely to begin next year will fall largely on Pinal County farms.

Under the complex system that state and federal officials have established to manage potential future cuts in CAP deliveries CAP users with a lower priority will get their supplies reduced or eliminated before those with a higher priority.

The water irrigating the pecan groves south of Tucson in Pima County is a mix of two different types of CAP supplies that have higher priorities than the Pinal farmers so will be be cut off at later stages of shortages.

Starting in 2023 some of the CAP water belonging to Freeport that is used at the pecan groves could start being cut. At first the cuts will be “mitigated” by other water supplied by the state and the CAP’s operators.

2026 to be a key year

By 2026 assuming shortages continue through then no more mitigation will occur. But Freeport even then could make use of credits it gets from other CAP supplies that it has stored elsewhere for many years said Linda Hayes a Freeport spokeswoman.

Also when no more mitigation water is available Freeport could send some of the CAP water it leases from the Gila River tribe to the groves if some of the supplies now being used for the pecan trees are reduced Hayes said.

But starting in 2026 if levels at Colorado River reservoir Lake Mead continue to fall CAP could suffer a more severe shortage that would start to cut some of even the top priority project water now being placed at the pecan groves.

Hopes for new technologies

Walden said he hopes that as clean water becomes more scarce and expensive the market will develop new technologies to use water more efficiently and clean it more effectively.

He cited desalination of brackish groundwater and recycling of wastewater for human consumption as possible examples.

“Other countries such as Israel Australian and Switzerland and even (California’s) Orange County are leaders in developing state-of-the-art purification techniques that make water fit for human consumption that would otherwise go to waste. Desalinization has come a long way as well especially with brackish as opposed to ocean salt water” Walden said.

FICO officials are “proud of the fact that we’ve been able to be helpful in reducing our groundwater use through the waterline and will continue to do so by farming in the most efficient way possible” Walden said.

If the current drought persists “we’ll respond by using the water available to us in the future be it reclaimed water groundwater reduced deliveries of CAP water or some combination thereof” he said.

Climate change analysis

Freeport’s Hayes added: “A sustained drought for longer periods is a concern. We know that climate change is expected to exacerbate drought conditions.”

To deal with that and other potential climate-related risks across Freeport’s entire business the company has started work on “a robust and comprehensive climate change scenario analysis” with help from an outside consultant Hayes said.

The analysis will identify potential climate-related risks and opportunities including those involving water stretching to 2050 Hayes said.

Freeport will also study opportunities to enhance its resilience and that of nearby local communities. The company expects to provide more information about its findings and recommendations later this year.

In addition the mining company has taken significant steps to switch to as much renewable recycled low quality and reused water as possible Hayes said. It continues to evaluate additional water reuse and recycling options and improve water efficiencies at all operations she added.

“Company-wide we used four times more recycled water than new water in 2019 achieving a water-use efficiency rate of 87%” Hayes said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ian Boswell Takes Men’s Race

Retired WorldTour pro roadie Ian Boswell’s last victory took place 11 years ago at the Nevada City Classic Stage Race. But as an important domestique for winning WorldTour teams like Team Sky and Katusha he raced in all three grand tours throughout his career and was a part of several team victories.

Boswell came into this year’s World Series of Gravel as cool and relaxed as Spicoli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High and left as the champion of the 2021 Garmin UNBOUND Gravel presented by Craft Sportswear.

“You know that Toby Keith song? I ain’t as good as I once was But I’m as good once as I ever was.” Ian Boswell said moments after his UNBOUND Gravel victory.

When asked what the win meant to him he added: “Not much really. It’s a gravel race. I’m a retired athlete nothing really changes. I’m going to work on Monday” he said. “But I can’t believe I won a sprint!”

Boswell said that it was an eventful day in the pack going so far as to call it ‘mayhem.’

“People were racing like squirrels… and typical [for me] I was the last person to make every split.” Boswell’s years of riding for Team Sky and Katusha translated into expert pack riding skills and an ability to close gaps; he knows where to be in a bike race.

De Crescenzo on a Honeymoon Break

Women’s race winner Lauren De Crescenzo got married in Colorado on Sunday and on a detour to Emporia on the way back home to Atlanta won the 2021 Women’s Garmin UNBOUND Gravel race.

“This is our little honeymoon to Emporia” said De Crescenzo at the Garmin UNBOUND Gravel press conference in the Emporia Chamber building. “We had to do a big push. I was just focused on getting married. And then I just was focused on Unbound Gravel. We’re on a road trip back to Atlanta and we had to make a little pit stop in Emporia on the way home.”

This wasn’t De Crescenzo’s first time at Unbound but it was definitely her best. She first raced at the 2019 event but a crash left her with a broken collarbone. After being in the lead early on with her teammate Flavia Oliveira it looked like this race could have gone a similar way. For a few moments it appeared De Crescenzo’s race might suffer an untimely and disappointing retirement for a second time but this time it was De Crescenzo’s bike that took the beating. She suffered two flats in the first third of the race and looked to be out of the mix early.

“I had two pretty bad flats” said De Crescenzo. “It was very stressful. I put a tube in it wasn’t sealing. I was like ‘awww my race is over’ but then I was like ‘no I’ve got this.’”

If nothing else it would have been good training for her as she will toe to the line in Knoxville Tenn. for the Professional National Championship races in two weeks.

“Every time I was by myself I would get in the drops” she said. “I’ve been training on my TT bike a lot getting ready for Pro Nats in two weeks…I’m getting very used to the position. So this was good training for Nationals. It really helps being lower and not in the wind.”

At the end of the day just after 6pm CDT Lauren proved that she did in fact have this. The one remaining question to answer is how UNBOUND Gravel training works for Pro Nationals.

In a dramatic conclusion to Saturday’s Unbound Gravel Ian Boswell out-sprinted Laurens ten Dam to claim victory in the premier 200 Mile gravel race.

It’s an impressive win for the former WorldTour pro in his first appearance in the classic U.S. gravel event. Boswell retired from full time racing in 2019 and now works for Wahoo.

And your 2021 Garmin UNBOUND Gravel 200 presented by Craft Sportswear Champ is Ian Boswell!!! A tight battle all the way to the end with Laurens ten Dam coming in second. HUGE congrats to both riders!! pic.twitter.com/zibrJoGREf — UNBOUND Gravel (@unboundgravel) June 5 2021

Boswell and ten Dam were the last remaining riders of a five-rider group that led for much of the race’s later stages. 2019 Unbound winner Colin Strickland Ted King and Peter Stetina dropped off the two leaders pace in the dying miles.

After 200 miles of racing Boswell and ten Dam entered the streets of Emporia side-by-side. In the sprint to the line it was Boswell edging out ten Dam for the win.

Behind Ted King and Peter Stetina also approached the finish line together. Stetina edged out King riding on a custom painted Canyon Grizl for the event. Strickland crossed the line several minutes later in fifth.

Ian Boswell crossed the line arms raised and showing off a transgender pride wristband. Unbound takes palce just days into the start of Pride month and the U.S. rider is a vocal ally of the LGBTQ+ community. Boswell recently had transgender rights activist and pro cyclocross racer Molly Cameron as a guest on his Breakfast with Boz podcast.

RELATED: Ian Boswell sprints to win 2021 Unbound Gravel

The riders rode more than 10 hours through the Emporia Kansas course spending most of the event with a group of five elite gravel cyclists including Ted King and Peter Stetina.

In the last miles of the race Boswell and ten Dam pulled ahead of the group leaving a gap of a little more than a minute between themselves and the chase group. The experienced cyclists looked relaxed as they pulled into the final paved segment of the race chatting as they prepared for the end of a full day on the bike.

The riders’ pace slowed as they came into the final few hundred meters of the race and each cyclist waited for the other to attack. Finally ten Dam made a move to attack but ultimately Boswell held him off finishing the race in 10 hours 14 minutes and 27 seconds.

Though both riders have competed in WorlTour races the energy as they crossed the finish line was decidedly different than at a professional road race. Instead of teammates and soigneurs bringing them water a volunteer offered the cyclists a free t-shirt.

Boswell a vocal LGBTQ2S+ ally crossed the line with a transgender pride armband prominently displayed as he raised his arms in celebration.

Solo win

Unlike the men’s race in the women’s category American cyclist Lauren de Crescenzo crossed the finish line without a competitor in sight. The former U.S. national team athlete was alone as she rode through the final stretch to win the 2021 Unbound Gravel women’s 200 race. De Crescenzo finished with a time of 12 hours six minutes and 49 seconds fifteen minutes ahead of 2019 Unbound winner Amity Rockwell who took second this year.

Oregon Army National Guard Colonel Eric Riley was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General on Saturday during a ceremony at Heritage Park in Salem.

The Roseburg native is scheduled to become the Oregon National Guard’s Joint Deputy Operations Commander after completion of his assignment as commander of the 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team. A release from the Oregon Military Department said Riley led the unit during a mobilization to Kosovo in 2020 along with subordinate battalions mobilizing across the world. That became the second largest call up of Oregon troops since World War II.

The release said in his new role Brigadier General Riley will be assigned as the Assistant Adjutant General Oregon Army National Guard and will be responsible for assisting in formulating developing and coordinating programs policies and plans affecting the Oregon Army National Guard.

Colonel Riley serves as the Executive Director of the Partnership for the Umpqua Rivers where he leads a staff of six at the non-profit organization. They are responsible for restoring salmon habitat and monitoring water quality throughout the Umpqua Basin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2dhbWluZy9iZXN0LWdhbWVzLWZvci1pbnRlbC1oZC1ncmFwaGljcy_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsdHJlbmRzLmNvbS9nYW1pbmcvYmVzdC1nYW1lcy1mb3ItaW50ZWwtaGQtZ3JhcGhpY3MvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best games you can play on Intel integrated graphics,"Although a dedicated graphics card is considered by many to be a must-have for PC gaming it is not as important as it once was. Sure you need it to play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt at ultra graphics settings but if you don’t mind losing a little bit of visual quality and delving into the many great indie games out there there are tons of great games you can play using your onboard graphics.

This guide is for those who find themselves without a dedicated graphics card. This is our list of the best games you can play on Intel integrated graphics. It’s important to note before we start that some of these games are not designed to be run using onboard graphics. They can all be played at decent frame rates but you will have to sacrifice visual quality to do so. You may also need to make manual adjustments to graphics settings before you can start to play properly. For tips on that Intel has its own guide.

Best games for onboard graphics

Overwatch

As pretty as it is Overwatch‘s brand of MOBA-inspired first-person shooter combat is a very inclusive game when it comes to its requirements. Although you want to make sure that you have at least 4GB of RAM graphically an Intel HD 4400 is enough to meet the official minimum specifications. That is not going to get you much beyond the lowest graphical settings but it is playable.

There are videos around of people making Overwatch work on even weaker hardware though that tends to require big sacrifices in terms of resolution. This will likely stop happening when Overwatch 2 finally arrives.

Giving Overwatch a go for the first time? Here’s our beginner’s guide to Overwatch.

Hearthstone

Blizzard is often quite considerate of gamers with entry-level hardware and like Overwatch Hearthstone is no exception. As a collectible card game Hearthstone is a much less frantic experience so its specifications are lower than that of its popular FPS cousin. Although the official specifications don’t mention Intel HD graphics there is a ton of evidence of people being able to run the game on a variety of integrated Intel graphics chips. In some cases you might even be able to opt for medium-detail levels.

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is the biggest breakout hit of 2017 being hailed by many as the pinnacle of “battle royale” gameplay. It would never have reached such heights if gamers with weaker systems couldn’t actually play it. While the minimum system requirements do suggest having at least a low-level graphics card some have managed to make it work without that and if you’re willing to put up with sapped colors and a blocky resolution Battlegrounds is perfectly playable on a variety of Intel HD graphics chips. Take a look at our PUBG beginner’s guide to get started off right.

Grand Theft Auto V

The Grand Theft Auto series of anarchy simulators is one of the most popular franchises in gaming history. Its most recent entry GTA V is often held up as an example of beautiful world building and it looks just as good today as it did following its 2013 release. That doesn’t mean you can’t play it on integrated graphics though. You might need to sacrifice detail levels and frame rate smoothness depending on your preferences but there are plenty of people who have made this game work without a graphics card.

There are even GTA V mods that can help you run the game on ultra-low-end hardware if you need to.

League of Legends

Arguably the most popular competitive PC game in the world and poster child for the MOBA’s dominance of online gaming League of Legends is easy to get running on a variety of hardware. You want to make sure you’re hitting a good frame rate as low frames per second can give you a disadvantage in online play but that’s not hard to do even with older Intel HD graphics.

Riot Games is continually tweaking its game’s visuals to make sure that it looks good while still supporting lower-end and older hardware. Its minimum specifications barely even hint at the need for a graphics card.

Dota 2

The other big MOBA name in the game Dota 2 is a little more taxing on a system than League of Legends but it’s still playable on entry-level hardware. You may need to make some tweaks to the settings and sacrifice some visual clarity to get it running smoothly but there’s no reason to think you can’t be competitive online even if using integrated graphics.

Portal series

As one of the most beloved franchises in gaming history the two Portal games are considered classics by almost anyone who has played them. As well as being cutesy surprisingly dark action puzzlers they are also very easy to get running on all sorts of hardware. As older games than some of the others on this list that is perhaps not too surprising but it doesn’t take away from both Portal and its sequel’s well-deserved inclusion on this list.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive otherwise known as CS:GO is one of the most enduring titles on Steam. Built upon the strong foundations of its predecessors CS:GO offers the same great gameplay today as it always has and that’s irrespective of the hardware you’re running it on. Although it’s not quite as well optimized for lower-end systems like some of the other games on this list with a few tweaks you can get it working nicely on Intel HD graphics of various strengths.

Mount and Blade: Warband

The Mount and Blade series has never been known for its graphics but what it lacks in visual beauty it more than makes up for in gameplay. Warband offers enormous open-ended single-player campaigns as both a ruler and soldier in a combination of action and management. The fact that it isn’t that pretty lends itself well to being played on older systems though the heftier your CPU is the more soldiers you will be able to have in your battles.

Rocket League

Combining soccer with rocket cars might not seem like a combination that would work but when Rocket League debuted in 2015 it quickly became the breakout hit of the summer. It’s maintained a solid fan base ever since and the skill ceiling just keeps on rising with it. Playing Rocket League doesn’t need a powerful PC at all and as long as you’re willing to forego a few of the fancier particle and lighting effects you can play Rocket League using integrated graphics without difficulty. Rocket League is cross-platform making it one of the best games to play with friends online right now.

Left 4 Dead 2

Left 4 Dead gave gamers the zombie apocalypse they wanted well before the genre became oversaturated. As good as the original Left 4 Dead was though its sequel contains all of the first game’s campaigns and features with plentiful additions of its own.

Left 4 Dead 2 is as fun today as it was when it was first released in 2009 and it plays well on integrated graphics. You will have to run it at reasonably low settings but the game still looks good for its age even with a few jagged edges.

Half-Life series

Half-Life and its sequel are some of the most well-remembered first-person shooters ever made — the fact that Half-Life 3 is still missed tells you just how much. They are solid games and although a little dated in some mechanics they still make for great single-player and multiplayer experiences. Better yet due to their age you can play them on most modern Intel integrated graphics chips at full or near-full settings.

They might not be quite the visual feasts that they were when first released but Half-Life and Half-Life 2 are still fantastic games and being able to play through them without a graphics card is a real treat.

Firewatch

Firewatch is as much an experience as it is a game. Some might call it a “walking simulator” but everyone knows it as a fantastic looking game. While it might not look quite as good as it can on Intel graphics chips stylized visuals still suck you into its relaxing atmosphere even at lower settings.

Divinity Original Sin

Divinity Original Sin is a real Kickstarter success story. Beyond its financial success though it is also a really solid old-school RPG with great characters deep and varied combat and a beautiful world to explore. You do lose some of that when playing with Intel integrated graphics but not enough to negatively impact the experience.

Don’t Starve

An extremely quirky survival title with a Burtonesque art style and feel Don’t Starve is a brilliant game to play either by yourself or using the standalone multiplayer expansion Don’t Starve Together. It’s not remotely demanding on your system so should be playable even with older integrated graphics chips.

Its cartoonish graphics mean you don’t even lose too much visual detail when running it at lower settings.

FTL: Faster Than Light

A tough roguelike with resource management real-time strategy and branching randomized quest events FTL: Faster Than Light is a brilliant indie game that is far from taxing to run. You will be able to run it on all sorts of integrated graphics chips with no trouble at all though higher resolutions might benefit from a slightly faster chip.

Kingdom: New Lands

Kingdom: New Lands is a deceptively simple game that can suck up hours of your life if you let it. Its pixelated graphics look good on powerful and older hardware alike and all you need is a graphics chip with DirectX 9.0c support to run it. If your processor is a little on the weak side you may encounter some slowdown in the later stages of the game but most of the gameplay will be buttery and pixel-smooth even on integrated graphics.

Five Nights At Freddy’s series

For a simple premise the Five Nights at Freddy’s series of games are surprisingly spooky and full of jump scares for those who love a good fright. Since they aren’t particularly visually intensive they play perfectly well with onboard graphics chips and there are a ton of them to play through if you like this style of gameplay.

Diablo 3

As you can tell Blizzard games perform particularly well on integrated graphics. Diablo 3 the 2012 action-RPG is a game you can easily sink hundreds of hours into. Its isometric perspective lends itself well to less fancy graphics cards and performance remains steady even on most non-gaming laptops. Thanks to a continuously evolving content stream and enticing loot-based loop Diablo 3 remains exciting long after you’ve seen the credits. Keep an eye out for Diablo 4 the next iteration in the series.

Civilization VI

It shouldn’t be too surprising that Civilization VI one of the best strategy games around can run on integrated graphics. After all it’s available on iOS and Nintendo Switch. The downgrade in visuals when playing with integrated visuals though apparent doesn’t hinder the overall experience. If you’ve never played a Civ game before it’s a turn-based franchise that plays out over long stretches of time. Your ultimate goal is to expand your kingdom which leads to many exciting battles and interactions with leaders around the world. Civilization VI is one of the deepest strategy games one that sets up nicely for short daily spurts. Take a look at our Civ VI beginner’s guide if you’re just getting started.

Cuphead

For a game as uniquely beautiful as Cuphead it’s admittedly odd that it runs so well on integrated graphics. Stylized after 1930s cartoons Cuphead is a run and gun boss rush game with a steep difficulty level. With an interesting array of bosses each with their own distinct personalities and tendencies Cuphead shines throughout each of its impeccably designed stages. We highly recommend connecting an Xbox One or PS4 gamepad to your PC or Mac to play Cuphead though.

Factorio

The infamously addictive Factorio doesn’t really care about graphics. Instead it’s focused on building mechanics that encourage you to create automated factories that break down mined elements and create products and structures. The simple premise of “build more so you can build more” is enough to get started but Factorio can become mind-bendingly complex which has led to the rise of a devoted online community filled with ideas. There are also some defense aspects as you need to protect your base from attacks over time but it’s the building that’s the real draw.

Crypt of the Necrodancer

If you haven’t played this inventive roguelike dungeon explorer yet we highly advise giving it a try. The focus of the game is music and you can choose one of 15 characters to quite literally dance your way through the dungeon with rhythm as your guide. The original soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky includes 40 songs and has won awards but you can upload your own MP3s for a more personalized experience too!

Mark of the Ninja

If stealth games are more your preference Mark of the Ninja delivers a serious beautiful experience that’s very deep compared to its lightweight requirements. Navigate a rapidly industrializing city and utilize a variety of shadows weapons and techniques to survive. Even the lowliest guard can be deadly and every encounter leaves you with choices to slay avoid or distract. The combination of stealth and puzzle gameplay can become addictive as you learn what sort of Ninja you prefer to be and face continuing challenges.

Borderlands 3

The cell-shaded nature of the Borderlands games makes them well-suited to running without worrying about how your GPU will do as long as you don’t mind playing with the right settings. Put the Visual Settings in the menu on Very Low keep the resolution a bit below full HD and your computer should do just fine without affecting your gaming experience. Then you’re ready to explore the crazy and hostile world of this looter shooter where every gun is zanier than the last. Take a look at our guide to Borderland 3 characters and the best weapons in the game if you’re just getting started.

Fossil executives Greg McKelvey and Steve Prokup told CNET in an interview that the company's existing Wear OS watches won't get upgrades to the reworked software. Your Fossil Gen 5 will likely be stuck with an aging interface unfortunately.

If you want Fossil wristwear using the latest software you'll have to pay. McKelvey said the company was planning a lone ""premium"" Fossil watch (Gen 6?) to lead the charge in the fall with sub-brands like Michael Kors and Skagen releasing equivalents. This device would boast some ""pretty major hardware upgrades"" Prokup said.

Past models would most likely get price cuts to serve as the budget options in Fossil's lineup. McKelvey added that full-fledged smartwatches have been ""much more successful"" than hybrid models suggesting these analog-digital mixes wouldn't be the focus in the future.

The upgrade cut-off suggests new watches based on the new Wear OS will represent a significant leap for the platform but also that Google Samsung and brands like Fossil are taking calculated risks. They appear willing to leave current owners behind if it improves the chances of attracting more buyers going forward.

Update (5:42 PM ET): Fossil has released a statement seeking to clarify the situation. You can read it in full below however the exact content of future updates remains unknown.

At Fossil our product and engineering teams continue to innovate on the Gen 5 and Gen 5E smartwatches which will result in new software features being launched later this year and into next year. With regards to the operating system we will be leveraging the unified platform announced at I/O and our policy is to bring the maximum amount of innovation that Google will enable to each of our generation of smartwatches. Future upgrade plans are still being developed and we will continue to make announcements later this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRveGVlLmNvbS9ibG9nL21hcmtldGluZy82LXRyYXZlbC1pbmR1c3RyeS1kaWdpdGFsLXRyZW5kcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 travel industry digital trends: A journey into the future,"Even in this strange and complicated year some digital trends in the travel industry have emerged that are worth following to understand how business is transforming and how they need to transform starting with the smart hotel room and ending with overtourism.

Needless to say as we’ll see when analyzing the digital trends in the travel industry digital transformation has radically changed the way people travel and how they conduct themselves as tourists to the point that it is no longer possible for operators to avoid these considerations.

And although this has been a “complex” period as a result of the pandemic that has affected the entire world the trend towards digitalization continues with all that this entails.

Obviously in this period the speed and relevance of these trends has been less than in the past if only because the movements and consequently the investments made within the sector have clearly decreased due to the contingencies.

This does not prevent us from making some considerations on the future of the sector and trying to imagine the features that will characterize its future.

We know that forecasts are always fallible – and right now they are more so than usual. However we can still identify at least six interesting digital trends in the travel industry.

Travel industry’s first digital trend: Continued growth of digital

Although the first trend we are reporting on is not strictly digital it concerns the entire sector and as such represents a sort of premise for all the others. And it’s not an insignificant trend since it marks a very interesting fact namely that digital transformation has given a considerable boost to the sector which appears to be driven by its digital component.

While even 2019 showed general growth in the overall market it should be noted that at the beginning of 2020 the main increase in turnover was detected precisely in ecommerce travel which totaled +9% reaching 15.5 billion euros mainly thanks to mobile which as we will see is destined to have great relevance in the future.

This is because the spread of the internet is now an essential part of travel.

Just think about how often tourists use digital technologies to choose book and manage their trips.

It is precisely in light of this that we can understand why the digital sector of tourism has become equally relevant and in a sense “parallel” to the analog sector not only for travelers but also for operators who can no longer wait to develop and integrate customer-facing digital solutions into their businesses

Second digital trend in the travel sector: The digitalization of the experience

On closer inspection it is precisely from the first trend that we can derive the second namely that the tourist experience during travel is increasingly digital. Today it is increasingly common for people to use digital tools and technologies to enjoy a better experience.

One example is the use of the smartphone which is undoubtedly the ideal companion for every tourist.

Thanks to its multifunctionality travelers use their smartphones for a range of different uses.

For example 68% of Italian tourists look for information through their mobile device instead of using a computer or a tablet; for 42% of respondents instead the smartphone is essential for sharing their experiences on social profiles; finally 38% use it to leave comments and reviews on dedicated applications and sites (statista.com).

On closer inspection therefore mobile is and is destined to become an increasingly important touch point for any operator who wants to reach potential customers.

It’s clear that smartphones have a formidable impact on the behavior of tourists and above all on their choices from buying flights to booking experiences once they reach their destination. Consider that in just 5 years from 2015 to 2020 the number of American tourists who say they “always” use their cell phone when traveling has risen from 41% to 70%.

This data indicates one thing: Operators who want to be relevant in the market must think not only digitally but above all “mobile first.”

Travel industry’s third digital trend: Hotels open the doors to digitization

If the second trend was mainly about tourists the next trend mainly concerns travel operators.

Digital transformation has radically changed tourists and their expectations. At the same time however hotels have more tools at their disposal in terms of the increasingly sophisticated technologies that they can implement in their facilities.

The third trend is precisely this: more hotels are investing in advanced digital solutions to make their guests’ stay memorable.

We are therefore moving away from the purely digital dimension also because the digital transformation also has an impact on physical places which are being changed and modified by the players themselves according to clear guidelines for both digitalization and simplification.

With that in mind here comes the opening of the first smart hotel where customers can open the door adjust the temperature in their room and even pay at the end of their stay all with a simple tap on their smartphone.

Even a famous hotel chain like Marriott International has realized the importance of following this trend and has initiated a collaboration with Samsung and Legrand to create a smart room equipped with the most advanced responsive IoT systems and devices to make every experience as unforgettable as possible.

This type of technology will allow the guest to request for example virtual assistance to set the alarm clock or to follow a yoga class through an interactive mirror to customize the cleaning service or even to operate the shower.

All of this of course can be done via voice command or using a specific application.

The Starwood chain is also following this digital evolution path with the primary objective of “automating” certain processes such as check-in allowing guests to check in autonomously once again using their smartphone which is transformed into a “digital key” to open the room (digitalmarketingturistico.it).

Among other things this type of transformation will allow hotel facilities to constantly improve their efficiency learning directly from customer behaviors which can be tracked collected and analyzed. In other words the digital transformation of hotels puts them in a position to really take advantage of big data which is increasingly important and relevant to the travel industry.

Travel industry’s fourth digital trend: Big data is welcome

The fourth trend in the travel industry is precisely this: the increasing use of big data and the consequent increase in its importance.

Digital transformation and the change in tourist habits which increasingly involve the use of the internet and smartphones during travel leaves sector operators with a huge amount of data at their disposal which they can use in a variety of ways.

One way as we have seen is using it to improve the customer experience they are able to offer. By intercepting reviews left online operators have a wealth of indicators about how and where to make changes to meet customers’ needs

Another way to take advantage of big data is competition scouting. By monitoring and analyzing the information available online operators can understand and learn from the behaviors and strategies implemented by competitors.

Observing their strengths and weaknesses detecting which aspects are most appreciated and criticized by users their communication strategy their way of addressing their audience: it is possible to do all this by collecting the right data which is the necessary premise for drawing relevant conclusions about the changes to be applied to your business.

These are just some of the many ways that companies can use big data.

Fifth digital trend in travel: From big data to predictive personalization

The sophistication with which big data can be read is leading many in the industry to focus on developing predictive personalization solutions which represents the fifth digital trend in the travel industry. The term “predictive personalization” refers to the ability of a system to predict the behavior of a certain category of users based on their past behavior.

This is typically done by the most advanced chatbots which “converse” with users and are able to understand their needs and anticipate their future requests.

In the travel sector this type of capacity is becoming increasingly important on a competitive level but in a different way than in other sectors since “personalized prediction” is becoming simultaneous with tourist behavior.

If you think about it it’s rare for a tourist to buy the same flight or stay at the same facility since once there that destination loses appeal at least for a while.

It’s not like a restaurant or a regular store: for a hotel for example the current behavior is more important than past behavior since the guest will most likely never return thus not providing the facility with the opportunity to implement what they learned.

It’s the current stay that needs to be made special and memorable not (just) the future one. That’s why predictive personalization for the travel industry is important right from the moment of booking.

It is precisely based on search behaviors that the operator must be able to outline a profile of the user in front of him – as precisely as possible -in order to reach him with an offer that is as suitable as possible in terms of cost facilities and services. This is what predictive personalization is all about: giving the user the feeling of maximizing in terms of the expected experience their investment while choosing an offer.

From the operator’s point of view it means being able to identify the amount that each potential guest is willing to spend and offer him a package that can meet his needs even before he expresses them.

Sixth digital trend in the travel industry: Between overtourism and undertourism

The sixth trend concerns two phenomena that while not strictly digital themselves their root cause is all digital.

For some time now we’ve been hearing talk of overtourism or an excess of tourists concentrated in certain periods of the year in certain areas which would represent a real danger for the balance and sustainability of certain locations. But what does overtourism have to do with digital transformation?

It’s easy to trace the link if you think about how much social networks influence people when it comes to choosing a destination to visit.

Many people begin to dream about their next vacation starting from content posted on the social profiles of their acquaintances or connections. Econsultancy even talks about the “Insta effect” since 40% of those under the age of 30 consider “Instagrammability” one of the important factors in choosing a trip (econsultancy.com).

So it’s obvious that the more a destination is visited photographed and shared on social networks the more other users are enticed to go and visit it in an uninterrupted cycle that leads to overtourism which is perhaps the negative consequence of the influence of social networks in the travel sector – which by the way can be considered another trend.

However as it so often happens the cause of a problem is also its solution. If digital transformation has favored this excess of tourists in some well-known locations the web and social networks also provide an avenue for dealing with this phenomenon.

The opposite trend of undertourism visiting less popular or undiscovered destinations instead of the classic and most well-known ones (ninjamarketing.it). This is confirmed by Booking.com which found that 51% of users are increasingly looking for the so-called “next best place” to visit those that are little known and far from the famous routes (wearemarketing.com).

To find such destinations tourists turn to the Internet and social networks which are now actual travel guides where it’s easy to find different trips and destinations that fit one’s needs and interests.

This means that even less “trendy” places can leverage the web to become relevant and most importantly attract tourists.

This last trend also reinforced by COVID-19 sums up the impact of digital transformation on this sector.

As new solutions and new available technologies emerge the paradigm of a certain business also changes; this can cause problems some of which are not easy to deal with but it also opens up new opportunities for growth and development as long as you know how to adapt and learn to manage this transformation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvZGlnaXRhbGZvdW5kcnktMjAyMS1pbnRlbC1jb3JlLWk1LTExNDAwZi1yZXZpZXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i5 11400F review: the best mainstream gaming CPU,"The Core i5 11400F has emerged as something of an unlikely champion in the wake of Intel's Rocket Lake S launch. The upper end of Intel's new lineup is certainly performant but for many buyers the value simply isn't there while discounted 10th-gen equivalents are still available (especially when the 10900K's extra cores give it an outright lead over its successor for content creation workloads). So it's been the low and mid-range part of the stack that has garnered the most positive press where Intel's roughly 20 percent gen-on-gen performance gains and more feature-rich B560 motherboards have created some pretty unreal value.

The pitch here is pretty simple: the Core i5 11400F costs around £150/$175 yet its six core and twelve thread design still hits the current sweet spot for gaming and occasional content creation. It's clocked just 400MHz slower than the Core i5 11600K (4.2GHz vs 4.6GHz for max all-core turbo) and each of its cores ought to be quite powerful given its modern Cypress Cove design. In the best case scenario it wouldn't be outrageous to hope for performance in line with the Ryzen 5000 series - but at a considerably lower asking price than AMD's £260/$300 entry-level Ryzen 5 5600X. That sounds like the recipe for a value champion so we were keen to get testing.

As we're only adding one CPU to our charts we'll keep this introductory page brief - after all you can read our full 11900K and 11600K review for a more detailed write-up of the new features arriving with Intel's 11th-gen desktop chips and 500-series motherboards.

Processor Cores/Threads Base Clock Single/All Core Turbo TDP Cost Core i9-11900K 8/16 3.5GHz 5.3GHz/4.8GHz 125W $539 Core i9-11900 8/16 2.5GHz 5.2GHz/4.7GHz 65W $439 Core i7-11700K 8/16 3.6GHz 5.0GHz/4.6GHz 125W $399 Core i7-11700 8/16 2.5GHz 4.9GHz/4.4GHz 65W $323 Core i5-11600K 6/12 3.9GHz 4.9GHz/4.6GHz 125W $262 Core i5-11600 6/12 2.8GHz 4.8GHz/4.3GHz 65W $213 Core i5-11500 6/12 2.7GHz 4.6GHz/4.2GHz 65W $192 Core i5-11400F 6/12 2.6GHz 4.4GHz/4.2GHz 65W $157

Given that most people won't be pairing their 11400Fs with a £500+ Z590 motherboard we've swapped in something more price-appropriate for our primary testing: the £150/$175 MSI MAG B560M Mortar WiFi. As with other B560 boards it supports two major new features: PCIe 4.0 components (storage and graphics cards) and memory overclocking with the latter previously reserved only for Intel's highest-end Z-series boards.

This has been paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition two 8GB sticks of G.Skill Trident Z Royal RAM running at 3600MHz CL16 a Gamer Storm 850W 80+ Gold power supply and two coolers - our standard Eisbaer Aurora 240mm AiO for the bulk of our testing and the Intel box cooler that comes with the 11400F for a few supplemental tests. Windows 10 and our games were installed on a massive 2TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus NVMe SSD from Box. As usual the latest Windows updates and Nvidia graphics drivers were installed for testing with the Z590 board using BIOS version 610 and the B560 board using BIOS version 7D17v12.

We normally use the excellent OpenBenchTable for testing but this time we used Cooler Master's $200 MasterFrame 700. This titanic combination test bench and open-air display case is basically the opposite of the 11400F in every way and we'll share a small review of the new test bed at the conclusion to this review.

of Attribution

Before we get into the content creation and gaming benchmark results a quick note about our RAM setup: non-Core i9 processors technically don't support RAM faster than 2933MHz if you're using the 'Gear 1' setting in your BIOS which uses a 1:1 ratio between the memory and memory controller. However in practice both the motherboards we tested the 11400F with used 1:1 by default even on our 3600MHz RAM so this doesn't appear to be a part of the Intel guidance that is closely adhered to.

Finally primary testing was done with power limits effectively removed which is done by default if you say you have an AiO or high-end air cooler upon first entering the BIOS. This reflects a typical use case scenario where the user will be accepting the default motherboard options to enable extra performance and matches our previous testing methodology for CPUs. We also performed a handful of tests with the standard box cooler and the default 65W limit which we'll cover separately in this review.

So with that proviso out of the way - content creation. We've opted for two relatively brief tests here to give you the broad strokes of how the 11400F performs for common tasks like 3D rendering and transcoding video from one format to another. The two specific apps are Cinebench R20 a benchmark application that mimics rendering a 3D scene in professional graphics package Cinema 4D and Handbrake where we encoded a high-quality Patreon video into h.264 and h.265 (HEVC) formats using the free Handbrake application. We ran the tests twice once using the box cooler and the default 65W limit once with the 240mm AiO installed and its 255W power target.

The single-core scores for the 11400F were 538 in both cases (as with the rest of the cores idle we're still some distance from that 65W power target). This is a great result as we're more or less tied with the Core i9 10900K and considerably beyond the 493 score we recorded for the 11600K. That does mean we're still around 10 percent slower than the Ryzen 5600X and Core i5 11600K but that's a tighter margin than I expected and shows the IPC advantage that Intel has been able to find with their 11th-gen designs.

Moving onto multi-core now and here we see a clear difference between the 65W and 255W modes. The box cooler provides a decent score of 3600 but the unlimited power result is about 10 percent faster at 3959. For reference that puts the 11400F just ahead of the 10600K at 3587 and just behind the Ryzen 3600X at 3705. The Ryzen 5600X is significantly faster at 4446 but this CPU costs nearly twice as much. (By the way we also ran Cinebench R20 with the box cooler and the power limits disabled which resulted in a multi-core score of 3953 - so at least for relatively short workloads the box cooler is enough to keep CPU temperatures in check at the expense of relatively high noise levels.)

The Handbrake encoding results show a similar spread with the 11400F gaining around 15 to 20 percent when it's unfettered by its 65W TDP. Its 28.47fps result in the H.264 encoding test puts it ahead of the 10600K once again and only nine percent behind the Core i5 11600K and Ryzen 5 5600X. (It's also basically tied with the 9th-gen i7!)

In HEVC encoding the 11400F is nearly 10 percent faster than its closest Ryzen competitor the 3600X but it does consume more power at its peak: 242W was the highest full system readout we saw compared to 149W for the 3600X (which was of course using a different motherboard so don't read into that too much.) With Intel's default power limits enabled the 11400F system maxed out at 207W dropping to 150W once the turbo limit expired. So AMD retain the power efficiency lead but the 11400F at least uses far less power during HEVC encoding than the 11900K.

With the content creation workloads completed it's time to turn our attention to games. We tested the 11400F in nine games including six titles that were introduced with our 11900K and 11600K review earlier this year.

Capt. David Hart is assigned as the Major Program Manager and Katherine Connelly as the Deputy Program Manager. DDG(X) leadership is tasked with developing an acquisition strategy a design/technical data package and ship construction testing fleet introduction and sustainment plans.

“The Guided Missile Destroyer will provide the flexibility and margins necessary to succeed the DDG-51 class as the Navy’s next enduring large surface combatant combining the DDG 51 FLT III combat systems elements with a new hull form an efficient Integrated Power System and greater endurance reducing the fleet logistics burden” the navy said in a release.

The establishment of the program office is the latest in a series of attempts over the last years to establish a path forward for the replacement of the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruisers and Arleigh Burke guided-missile destroyers.

As announced by the service DDG(X) is expected to pair the Aegis combat system with the integrated electric propulsion system first introduced for the Zumwalt-class destroyers.

The service is already undertaking conceptual designs in cooperation with Huntington Ingalls Industries and General Dynamics Bath Iron Works the two yards building the Arleigh Burke- and Zumwalt-class destroyers.

This collaboration will continue into fiscal year 2022 with the start of Preliminary Design. A Detail Design is scheduled for fiscal year 2026 while the start of construction is expected in fiscal year 2028.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHNlY3VyaXR5Lm9yZy9taWxpdGFyeS93b3JsZC9pbmRpYS9maWN2Lmh0bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV),"Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV)

The backbone of the Indian Armys infantry combat vehicles is the Russian-designed BMP (Sarath BMP-II) series which are being made by Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) since its induction in 1980. Approximately 1900 ICVs BMP-2/2K are in service with the Indian Army and are likely to remain operational till 2017. The Indian Army was worried about its operational capability particularly in terms of rapid deployment post the 2017 scenario. Thus the FICV project was a strategic and critical programme which would define Indian Armys mobility deployability and lethality in the future to come and its ability to execute its proactive strategy.

The FICV project was approved in 2008 but had seen little progress since then. By mid-2013 the Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle Request for Proposal (RFP) had been withdrawn and refomulated. Armored vehicle manufacturers were out in force at DefExpo 2016 lured by the massive Future Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV) program for the Indian Army. Under FICV some 2610 vehicles would replace in-service BMP-2/2K Sarath IFVs beginning in 2022.

Expressions of interest in the resurrected Rs. 65000 Crore Make in India project were lodged by six contenders in mid-February: TATA Motors Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Mahindra Defence TATA Power SED (with Titagarh Wagons) Reliance Defence and the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB; joint venture with Russian MBT Manufacturer - Uralvagonzavod). The government would provide 80% of development costs for two vendors for the 20 tonne tracked and amphibious IFV. Two development agencies will be shortlisted and the shortlisted vendors will build one prototype each within 24-36 months.

The FICV project initially envisaged 70:30 allocations to the winner and the runners up of the contract with an 80:20 funding distribution by the Government and industry respectively. The Army identified a need of nearly 2600 ICVs over 20 years with the following specifications:

a) Weight of around 20 tonnes so that it can be transported by air and other means

b) Strike power of a 45 tonne Main Battle Tank (MBT) including a rapid fire cannon a 7.62 mm machine gun grenade launcher and an anti-tank missile

c) To be operated by a three man crew consisting of the commander gunner and driver with an additional capacity to carry seven fully equipped infantrymen

d) Fully amphibious and all terrain capability for high mobility to keep pace with armour

e) Buy and Make (Indian) category open only to domestic firms

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) which had called for the request of proposal (RFP) for the Rs 100000-crore futuristic infantry combat vehicle (FICV) project in eary 2011 planned to shortlist two of the contending firms by July 2011. About 10 private firms including the Tata's Larsen and Toubro (L&T) and the Mahindra & Mahindra-BAE Systems joint venture Defence Land Systems India (DLSI) were among the firms waiting to be shortlisted for a project that would see the Army procure at least 2500 such vehicles. The project would set a new precedence in the Indian defence procurement system. It not only encouraged pure private participation for what defence sources term a ""sensitive"" project but it also did away with the system of granting the deal on the basis of the lowest bid a strong feature in Indian projects.

The MoD completed the field and facility visits of companies it had shortlisted in February 2011. Sources claimed it had asked for assurance of overseas transfer of technology (ToT). Also the Centre was particular that the execution of the project lie in the hands of a domestic firm although the need for foreign collaboration is almost a 'mandate'. The Centre was keen on firms with foreign collaborations/tie-ups and that they would have an edge over the others as the project would require high precision. US defence major General Dynamics was said to be in the fray looking for possible tie-ups with Indian firms to bag the deal. The US firms competing for the other major defence contracts in India - the $10 billion medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) for the Indian Air Force lost to their European competition.

Mahindra Defence Systems in partnership with BAE Systems Larsen Toubro & company also works on foreign partnerships. Company Tata Motors is also trying to find a foreign partner after deal with Rheinmetall has reached a deadlock due to the Indian blacklist its Swiss subsidiary. State-owned Ordnance Factory Board is also participating in the project.

The nearly $10 billion Indian Armys Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV) project was slated to be the largest indigenous defense program. The FICV project was classified under the ""Buy & Make category mentioned in Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP-2011). The vendors for the Indian Armys FICV project were shortlisted on the basis of technical functional and commercial aspects and only local Indian firms could bid. However local firms could opt for technology tie-ups with foreign companies. It would help develop a whole eco-system of small and medium sized companies as suppliers to the winners of the contract. The FICV development would provide a big boost to Indias pursuance of self-reliance and indigenisation in the form of a robust domestic defence industrial base.

At the 6th International Land and Naval Systems Exhibition also called DEFEXPO India 2012 held at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi from March 29 to April 1 Tata Motors displayed the scaled models of its concept futuristic infantry combat vehicle (FICV) including the turret. In addition the proposed layout of the production facility was also displayed. Tata Motors is one of the four Indian companies which has been issued the Expression of Interest (EoI) by the Indian Army for the FICV a Make Indian project. The company has accordingly responded to the EoI based on indigenous design and development in association with key technology partners and submitted its response in October 2010.

Two short-listed companies were to make an FICV prototype and after field trials of the prototype the winning company would produce up to 2600 FICVs. After nearly two years of discussions no final decision was made about which companies would participate. The Defense Ministry had selected state-owned Bharat Earth Movers and a consortium of Larsen & Toubro Mahindra Defense and Tata Power but former Indian Army chief general V.K. Singh questioned the ability of the Indian companies to take on such a big project.

In December 2012 Russia offered to transfer BMP-3 combat vehicle technology to India if India cancelled its project as India's its homemade Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV) can be commissioned no earlier than in ten years time. Russia offers India to buy BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles instead of further implementation of its stalled project for the development of such a vehicle. The Indian Defence Ministry wanted to produce the BMP-3 under the license since this has a great sense because India would be able to start producing a similar vehicle no earlier than ten years.

The Indian Defence Ministry wanted to produce the BMP-3 under the license since this has a great sense because India will be able to start producing a similar vehicle no earlier than ten years.

By June 2013 it appeared that the $10 billion Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV) had been shelved with the Indian Ministry of Defense instead accelerating the upgrade of its Russian-made BMP-2 infantry combat vehicles and issuing tenders to buy 2000 engines for the program. The Indian Armys more than 1500 BMP-2s would be upgraded at a cost of more than $1.2 billion over three to five years under a program that received formal MoD clearance in May 2013. Though this move did not necessarily shut down the homegrown FICV project it was less likely to come to fruition. The upgrade would improve observation and surveillance night-fighting capability and fire control and would provide an improved anti-tank guided missile system and 30mm automatic grenade launcher.

The tender for the purchase of 2000 engines to power the upgraded BMP-2 was sent to domestic auto majors Mahindra & Mahindra Tata Motors Force Motors Ashok Leyland Maruti Udyog and Crompton Greaves and to MTU of Germany Thales of France and Rosoboronexport of Russia. The Army required engines able to generate 350 to 380 horsepower and are easy to maintain and operate in extreme weather conditions. The existing engine of the BMP-2 had 285 horsepower and is not suited for cross-country mobility. This tender purchase 2000 engines for the upgrade was cancelled because none of the domestic vendors fulfilled the engines requirements. Now a global tender is likely to be issued for the engines.

India will not shelve its homegrown $10 billion Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV) program in favor of advanced Russian BMP-3 combat vehicles. The decision was conveyed to the Russian side at the 18 November 2013 meeting of the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military Technical Cooperation held in Moscow.

Indias Mahindra Defence Systems tied up with BAE Systems Larsen & Toubro was working on overseas tie ups and Tata Motors was also working to connect with overseas companies after its tie up with Rheinmetall stalled following the blacklisting of the German company. State-owned Ordnance Factories Board was also in the race. The MoD will shortlist two competitors to develop their prototypes which will be put to trial.

India cleared a bulk of defense projects worth $13 billion in a bid to boost the country's national defense preparedness the Indian Defense Acquisition Council (DAC) said 25 October 2014. The DAC decided to buy 362 infantry fighting vehicles at a cost of 662 crore rupees.

A consortium of three defense companies ""Tata Motors"" ""Bharat Forge"" and ""General Dynamics Land Systems"" will develop and manufacture an infantry fighting vehicle of the future. The customer is the defense department of India. The cost of the project is estimated at $ 10 billion. This was reported in March 2016. Development and production will take place on the territory of the Indian state. At the same time the share of foreign developments will not exceed 30%. It is assumed that the final product will be compact light and transportable through the air. The car will be able to overcome water obstacles and carry up to 8 people in the landing. As weapons it is planned to use long-range anti-tank missiles. The new BMP will be designed to replace more than 2000 infantry combat vehicles of Soviet and Russian production that are in service with this country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzcmFlbGRlZmVuc2UuY28uaWwvZW4vbm9kZS81MDI1MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In latest contract with US Army Rafael to supply 30mm cannons for three Stryker brigades,"Oshkosh Defense announced on Friday that it was awarded a $942.9 million contract by the U.S. Army to integrate a 30mm Medium Caliber Weapon System (MCWS) onto the Stryker Double V Hull Infantry Carrier Vehicle.

In its statement Oshkosh said that the company has teamed with Pratt Miller and Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems to deliver an MCWS that provides increased lethality accuracy and range while maintaining the mobility and survivability of the Stryker vehicle. Oshkosh will integrate onto the vehicle's chassis a 30mm weapon system based on Rafael's proven ""Samson"" family of turrets. The contract calls for the integration of the MCWS onto three Stryker Brigade Combat Teams as well as a full spectrum of system technical support interim contractor logistics support and integrated product support Oshkosh said.

According to Army officials the first delivery order covers 91 vehicles valued at roughly $130 million. The Army could build up to six Stryker brigades with the MCWS version so the potential contract value is roughly $942 million over six years. The first unit to receive the MCWS Strykers will be the I-2 Stryker Brigade Combat Team out of Joint Base Lewis McChord in Washington State with fielding by the unit expected to be completed by December 2023.

The Defense News website reported that Oshkosh beat out two other teams adding that while the Army would not name competitors sources familiar with the process identified them as a General Dynamics Land Systems and Kongsberg Defense team and a Leonardo DRS and Moog team.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdWtkZWZlbmNlam91cm5hbC5vcmcudWsvYWpheC1hcm1vdXJlZC12ZWhpY2xlLXN1ZmZlcmluZy1zZXJpb3VzLWlzc3Vlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ajax armoured vehicle suffering 'serious issues',"General Dynamics UK told Defense News here that it is working with the Army on the issues.

“Recent trials have confirmed many of the required capabilities across the AJAX Family of Vehicles including operations across the full range of speed and reverse step obstacle climb. A small number of remaining issues are being reviewed and closed out in partnership with the British Army and Ministry of Defence ahead of Initial Operating Capability.”

In a recent report by the Defence Committee titled ‘Obsolescent and outgunned: the British Army’s armoured vehicle capability’ defence expert Francis Tusa explained that the lack of domestic investment in armoured vehicle programmes and upgrades resulted in the “design capability in the UK being run down” which had resulted in some of the technical problems seen on the Ajax and Warrior programmes.

This assertion was supported by evidence from General Dynamic UK who said:

“AJAX is the first major armoured vehicles programme to be delivered in the UK since Challenger 2 in the early 1990s and consequently it has taken time for both the MoD and industry to rebuild skills in armoured vehicles procurement design development and delivery.”"

The standard warranty lasts for 36 months or 36000 miles (whichever occurs first) for all Chevy and GMC vehicles and for Buick models from the 2020 model year onwards. For 2017-2019 model-year Buicks and all Cadillacs it lasts for 48 months or 50000 miles. The extended limited warranty lasts for 60 months or 60000 miles in the former case and 72 months or 70000 miles in the latter.

GM Extended Limited Warranty Pricing Brand Contract Term Vehicles MSRP Chevrolet 60 months/60000 miles Spark Sonic Cruze $1030 Chevrolet 60 months/60000 miles Colorado 2WD Silverado 1500/2500HD 2WD Malibu Volt Bolt EV City Express $1334 Chevrolet 60 months/60000 miles Colorado 4WD Silverado 1500/2500HD 4WD Camaro Equinox Impala Tahoe Traverse Trailblazer Trax Blazer Express $1416 Chevrolet 60 months/60000 miles Suburban Silverado 3500HD Low Cab Forward Medium Duty Silverado 4500HD-6500HD $1712 Chevrolet 60 months/60000 miles Corvette $2238 GMC 60 months/60000 miles Canyon 2WD Sierra 1500/2500HD 2WD $1334 GMC 60 months/60000 miles Canyon 4WD Sierra 1500/2500HD 4WD Yukon Terrain Acadia Savana $1416 GMC 60 months/60000 miles Yukon XL Sierra 3500HD $1712 Buick 2017-2019 MY 72 months/70000 miles All Buick Vehicles $1670 Buick 2020+ MY 60 months/60000 miles All Buick Vehicles $1670 Cadillac 72 months/70000 miles All Cadillac Vehicles $2800

As might be expected the MSRP of the General Motors extended limited warranty varies considerably according to the vehicle it applies to. For the low-budget Chevy Spark (the lowest priced car currently on sale in the United States) and remaining examples of the Chevy Sonic and the Chevy Cruze it costs $1030. At the other end of the scale the cost is more than double that at $2238 for any version of the Chevy Corvette and $2800 in the case of all Cadillac luxury models. It should be noted that dealers are at liberty to set their own prices.

There are of course conditions. The extended limited warranty applies only to first deliveries of vehicles in the 2017 model year or later and not to daily rental or scrap/stolen vehicles.

It does not apply in California Florida Maine or Minnesota but this refers only to the location of the dealer and not to the residence of the buyer. A customer who travels from Truckee California to a General Motors dealership in Reno Nevada (quite likely) or from Key West Florida to Wasilla Alaska (less likely) can take advantage of the offer.

But what’s inside this massive facility? It’s going to become a state-of-the-art development center for just about all things racing Motorsport.com reports. There will be three driver simulators for local drivers to get track experience without actually needing to be on track. It’ll contain its own aerodynamic development center along with a suite of advanced virtual tools and modeling technology that will improve data analysis and as a result deliver an even more impressive on-track product.

Rick Hendrick owner of Hendrick Motorsports noted that “ I’ve never seen [GM] more committed to our sport and to the performance of their partner teams than they are today.

“The investment General Motors is making right here in the Charlotte area sends a clear message about the importance of auto racing to their brand and their passion for competing and winning at the highest levels.”

Richard Childress added “ Having a central hub for vehicle simulation aero development and engineering support in the heart of NASCAR is going to make us even stronger.”

The Charlotte Technical Center doesn’t yet have an official address but it’s slated to be fully functional sometime in early 2022 to coincide with the introduction of NASCAR’s Next-Gen racers. With such a high-end facility it'll be interesting to see if the Chevrolet teams see a significant jump in performance during the upcoming NASCAR season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRyaXZpbmdsaW5lLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92b3J0ZWMtNDIwMC1nbXMtcG93ZXJmdWwtZG9oYy1pbmxpbmUtc2l4LXdhcy1hbG1vc3QtYW1lcmljYXMtMmp6L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vortec 4200: GM's Powerful DOHC Inline Six Was Almost America's 2JZ,"Vortec 4200: GM's Powerful DOHC Inline Six Was Almost America's 2JZ

June 5 2021

Story By Mike Garrett

When one thinks of inline six engines particularly inline six engines from American automakers you'll probably find yourself imagining the I6s that powered countless entry level American cars and trucks up through the 1970s.

But during the 2000s there was another American-made inline six on the scene and it's often considered one of the greatest and most under-appreciated engines in recent memory—the General Motors Atlas.

The Atlas Inline Engine Family

The Atlas family also included inline-four and and inline-five engines but it was the six-cylinder version that was the true sweetheart of the bunch widely praised when new but also nearly forgotten today. Development of the engines began in the mid 1990s as GM looked for newer engines that delivered increased power and lower emissions suitable for its upcoming midsize trucks and SUVs.

The four and five-cylinder versions would be used in the Chevy Colorado pickup (along) with its corporate cousins. The six-cylinder version though was designed for the new GMT360 platform SUVs; Chevy Trailblazer GMC Envoy Oldsmobile Bravada etc.

Vortec 4200

Dubbed the LL8 or Vortec 4200 the naturally aspirated engine displaced 4.2 liters used a double overhead cams with four-valves per cylinder and had variable valve timing on the exhaust side. It made its production debut for the 2002 model year.

The engine made 270hp and 275 pound feet of torque with later engine updates bumping these numbers to 275hp and 277 pound feet of torque.

But more than just the specs the engines made their power in the smooth and linear way that modern inline sixes are known for and the engine earned a ton of praise. All in all it was both more refined and more powerful than the V6s of the time and made the power of a small V8.

Interestingly though for such an ambitious and well-received engine program the Atlas era was short-lived. GMT360 production ended in 2009 and GM never really replaced the platform nor found another home for the Atlas I6. There's no doubt the fuel price spike economic downturn and corporate restructuring were reasons for this.

Atlas I6 in Racing

It would have been awesome to see the engine kept around and to see its potential as a performance engine realized. And you don't have to look far to see that potential. because as part of the promotion for the engine GM built a few race trucks powered by the Atlas inline six.

These special engines were punched up to five liters in displacement and made 600hp naturally aspirated in Baja racers that competed against V8s of similar displacement.

A similar engine was also used in a 4WD GMC Envoy-bodied race machine that won its class at the 2000 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. This is no doubt one of most interesting race vehicles GM has ever built.

Had GM decided to continue the Atlas program or to drop the engine into a proper performance car there's no telling what could have been but it doesn't take much imagination to think this could have been the American answer to Toyota's legendary 2JZ inline six.

There have been a few enterprising hot-rodders who have used the 4.2 as a swap choice both naturally aspirated and with aftermarket forced induction but that's always been and will likely remain a niche movement.

Since last July a little-known automaker in China’s southwest has dominated the world’s largest electric car market outselling bigger players and even Tesla Inc. almost every month with a tiny bare-bones EV that starts at just $4500.

The Hong Guang Mini is the brainchild of SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co. a joint venture between SAIC Motor Corp. and Guangxi Automobile Group Co. two state-backed automakers and U.S. giant General Motors Co.

Based in the city of Liuzhou known for its limestone mountains and river-snail soup the company – which has sold some 270000 of the cars within nine months making it the best-selling EV in China – has even bigger ambitions for the future. It’s aiming for annual sales of 1.2 million vehicles next year almost equal to the number of EVs churned out by China’s carmakers in 2020 combined.

It’s an eyebrow-raising target but even before the Hong Guang Mini Wuling had a track record for producing winners in a market that’s defining the new era of driving. Set up in 2002 the Chinese-American JV built its business selling microvans: dependable sliding-door workhorses that earned the nickname the bread box car’ in Mandarin and were China’s top-selling passenger vehicle in 2017. Millions of them ply the country’s roads used by contractors and delivery drivers alike.

The buyers of those gas-guzzling gray vans are almost exclusively male which makes Wuling’s pivot to the Hong Guang Mini – which has a top speed of 62 miles an hour and 12-inch wheels – all the more extraordinary. Shortly after its debut last July the automaker realized the vehicle was gaining a following among young women a phenomenon it leaned into with an approach that bends conventional wisdom about how cars are sold.

“Our company’s mentality is to produce whatever people need” Wuling’s head of branding and marketing Zhang Yiqin said in an interview. “We keep close tabs on our users. The hurdles to electric car adoption can only be cleared when consumers find using them a comfortable thing.”

To that end Zhang has staffed his team with employees who understand the Hong Guang Mini’s customer base which is now around two-thirds female. At 35 he jokes he’s the elder statesman of the group whose age averages around 27. Slogans like Young and Eager’ are splashed across the walls of Wuling’s headquarters in Liuzhou a city that’s embraced EVs alongside the company with 30% of all car sales electric last year the highest rate in China according to WAYS Information Technology.

Wuling’s success with the Hong Guang Mini was driven by a targeted marketing campaign conducted almost entirely online according to Zhang. His team often communicate with consumers directly via various social media platforms and it was a customer’s request for more hues that saw the company come up with Hongguang Mini’s latest iteration – the Macaron. It comes in avocado green lemon yellow and white peach pink with an optional solid-color roof for contrast to mimic the vanilla butter cream that sandwiches the French meringue confections of the same name.

It’s also how they landed on one of the car’s key selling points – besides its rock-bottom price point: Hong Guang Mini drivers are able to customize their vehicles in a way that’s not possible elsewhere.

Using “stickers” the car’s panels and body can be transformed. Some sport the Nike swoosh some have galaxy-like outer space scenes and others cartoon characters from Hello Kitty and Doraemon. The original Hong Guang Mini comes in around 20 different base colors which can be switched up and buyers can customize the interior as well.

Zorah Zhang (no relation) is a typical client. The 23-year-old is a fan of Hayao Miyazaki the Japanese animator who directed My Neighbor Totoro a fantasy film featuring a character called The Catbus a grinning feline whose seats are covered in fur.

She’s pimped her Hong Guang Mini to resemble it spending around $2300 to cover the car’s interior with brown velveteen and studding the roof with lights that sparkle at night.

“A lot of my friends have the Mini you see them everywhere in Liuzhou” said Zhang who lives with her parents (they drive a BMW sedan). “I love things that reflect my character. I may change the look of the car again if there’s other stuff I fancy.”

As frivolous as turning a set of wheels into a fashion accessory may seem there’s a very real market up for grabs.

Outside of Liuzhou EV penetration in China is still only around 6% and competition is fierce. Tesla may be the name that resonates loudest particularly in larger cities like Beijing and Shanghai where its first Gigafactory is located but a host of newer local entrants from Nio Inc. to Xpeng Inc. Li Auto Inc. and WM Motor are crowding in.

At the same time other home-grown players like BYD Co. a carmaker long backed by Warren Buffett are upping their EV game and international behemoths such as Volkswagen AG are plowing billions of dollars into new electric lineups.

With consumers in China overwhelmed by choice when fossil-fuel cars are added to the mix automakers need to give motorists what they want to survive said Jochen Siebert managing director of consultancy JSC Automotive in Singapore.

“SAIC-GM-Wuling has to come up with new ideas all the time to attract consumers” Siebert said. The Hong Guang Mini is “a kind of accessory which means it’s a fashion item that might go out of fashion sooner or later.”

For now it’s a strategy that’s paying dividends for Wuling. The company owned 50.1% by Shanghai-based SAIC 44% by GM’s China unit and 5.9% by Guangxi Automobile sold 1.6 million vehicles in total last year. While that was down about 4% from 2019 amid the pandemic Wuling’s new-energy vehicle sales almost tripled to 174000 units.

For GM – which is doubling down on electrification and autonomous driving under Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra – the Hong Guang Mini appears to have been a boon. The carmaker saw revenue of $9.9 billion from its China auto joint ventures in first-quarter results out last month up from $4.3 billion for the first three months of 2020. GM which has several other partnerships in China doesn’t break out Wuling’s revenue in its financial results.

While customer engagement has distinguished the Hong Guang Mini cost has been main driver of its blockbuster sales in a country where many find the sticker price of a Tesla Model 3 which sells for the equivalent of $39300 beyond reach. The basic Hongguang Mini starts at $4500 and even the new Macaron sells for under $6000.

Wuling has been able to churn out cheap cars thanks in part to its good supply-chain management honed with the super-popular microvans. Many of Wuling’s suppliers have also set up manufacturing bases in Liuzhou which has helped cap costs further. It’s a model that’s being replicated by car companies in other cities and provinces across China flattering for Wuling but challenging too as the price of rivals’ cars come down.

The global shortage of semiconductors is also weighing on Wuling with the Hong Guang Mini despite being a basic EV still requiring over 100 chips. Hongguang Mini production has been impacted by the shortfall with output of the Macaron expected to be down around 15% in May according to Zhang.

The hefty sales target for 2022 is the cornerstone of Wuling’s plan to maintain its market-leading momentum. After debuting a convertible Hong Guang Mini at the Shanghai Auto Show in April it’s aiming to release a mid-cycle enhancement of the vehicle later this year and is working on a two-seater EV targeted at younger men Zhang said.

At a Wuling dealership in downtown Liuzhou user-experience manager Li Zhengguang says there’s a four-person team focused solely on new media. They communicate with would-be customers using Douyin as TikTok is known in China and Little Red Book a trusted social shopping platform popular with young women sharing photos and videos. Li who used to sell diamond engagement rings says there’s not a lot of difference between jewelry and cars. Create desire for a cool product and buyers will come he says.

Pitching the Hong Guang Mini not as a cheap car but a coveted accessory in brand-conscious China is brilliant JSC Automotive’s Siebert said.

“It’s become a hallmark of SAIC-GM-Wuling over the past 20 years to always surprise the market and themselves” he said. “They’ve done extremely well because they focus on the right things. On quality when they were mainly making microvans and now on marketing.”"

(Published 2021),"Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen made the case on Monday for a global minimum tax kicking off the Biden administration’s effort to help raise revenue in the United States and prevent companies from shifting profits overseas to evade taxes.

Ms. Yellen in a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs called for global coordination on an international tax rate that would apply to multinational corporations regardless of where they locate their headquarters. Such a global tax could help prevent the type of “race to the bottom” that has been underway Ms. Yellen said referring to countries trying to outdo one another by lowering tax rates in order to attract business.

Her remarks came as the White House and Democrats in Congress begin looking for ways to pay for President Biden’s sweeping infrastructure plan to rebuild America's roads bridges water systems and electric grid.

“Competitiveness is about more than how U.S.-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids” Ms. Yellen said. “It is about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises and that all citizens fairly share the burden of financing government.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMDUvZy03LW5hdGlvbnMtcmVhY2gtaGlzdG9yaWMtZGVhbC1vbi1nbG9iYWwtdGF4LXJlZm9ybS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,G-7 nations reach historic deal on global tax reform,"LONDON — The finance ministers of the most advanced economies known as the Group of Seven have backed a U.S. proposal that calls for corporations around the world to pay at least a 15% tax on earnings.

""G-7 finance ministers today after years of discussions have reached a historic agreement to reform the global tax system to make it fit for the global digital age — and crucially to make sure that it's fair so that the right companies pay the right tax in the right places"" U.K. Finance Minister Rishi Sunak announced in a video statement on Saturday.

If finalized it would represent a significant development in global taxation. Leaders of the G-7 which include Canada France Germany Italy Japan the U.K. and the U.S. will convene for a summit in Cornwall U.K. next week.

An agreement among this group would provide needed momentum for upcoming talks planned with 135 countries in Paris. Finance ministers from the Group of 20 are also expected to meet in Venice in July.

""We commit to reaching an equitable solution on the allocation of taxing rights with market countries awarded taxing rights on at least 20% of profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises"" according to a statement from the G-7 finance ministers.

""We will provide for appropriate coordination between the application of the new international tax rules and the removal of all Digital Services Taxes and other relevant similar measures on all companies"" it said.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen who is in London for the face-to-face meeting hailed the move as significant and unprecedented.

""That global minimum tax would end the race-to-the-bottom in corporate taxation and ensure fairness for the middle class and working people in the U.S. and around the world"" she tweeted.

The historic agreement sheds light on the ambitions of President Joe Biden to step up taxes in the aftermath of the pandemic. His team had previously suggested a minimum global tax rate of 21% on the income earned by foreign affiliates of U.S. companies from intangible assets such as patents trademarks and copyrights known as GILTI.

Saturday's announcement represents an attempt to prevent countries luring international businesses with low or zero taxes.

A global deal in this field would be good news for cash-strapped nations who are trying to rebuild their economies after the coronavirus crisis.

But Biden's idea had not been received with the same level of excitement across the world. The U.K. for example did not immediately voice its support for the proposal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIxMDYwNTAwNTA0NS9lbi9TdHJpa2UtRHJpdmVzLUJpdGNvaW4tRm9yd2FyZC1hcy1FbC1TYWx2YWRvci1CZWNvbWVzLVdvcmxkJUUyJTgwJTk5cy1GaXJzdC1Db3VudHJ5LXRvLUFkb3B0LUJpdGNvaW4tYXMtTGVnYWwtVGVuZGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Strike Drives Bitcoin Forward as El Salvador Becomes World's First Country to Adopt Bitcoin as Legal Tender,"MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Strike the world’s leading digital wallet built on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network welcomes legislation announced today to make El Salvador the world’s first sovereign nation to adopt bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. This move will help unleash the power and potential of Bitcoin for everyday use cases on an open network that benefits individuals businesses and public sector services.

Strike founder and CEO Jack Mallers one of the earliest Lightning Network developers has been providing market insights to help make El Salvador’s world-changing effort successful and build the country’s modern financial infrastructure using Bitcoin technology. This technology delivers powerful advantages over legacy financial rails and incumbent payment systems.

Speaking from Bitcoin 2021 in Miami Mallers said “This is the shot heard 'round the world for Bitcoin. What's transformative here is that bitcoin is both the greatest reserve asset ever created and a superior monetary network. Holding bitcoin provides a way to protect developing economies from potential shocks of fiat currency inflation. Additionally adopting a natively digital currency as legal tender provides El Salvador the most secure efficient and globally integrated open payments network in the world.”

President Bukele announced El Salvador’s intention to make bitcoin legal tender in a video broadcast to Bitcoin 2021.

Making bitcoin legal tender is a leapfrog moment that can help countries like El Salvador shift from a largely cash economy to an innovative inclusive and transparent digital economy where your bank account is your phone. That is especially meaningful in El Salvador where about 70% of people do not have bank accounts or credit cards. In addition remittances account for more than 20% of El Salvador’s GDP and incumbent services can charge 10% or more in fees for international transfers that take days to arrive and must be collected from a physical location. That amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars a year that people could save or spend with local businesses in their communities – demonstrating the powerful use cases and addressable market opportunities from scaling Bitcoin and the Lightning Network for everyday uses.

El Salvador has assembled Bitcoin leaders across the world to help build a new financial ecosystem with Bitcoin as the base layer. ""It was an inevitability but here already: the first country on track to make bitcoin legal tender. Another milestone for Bitcoin and El Salvador. We're pleased to help El Salvador on its journey towards adoption of the Bitcoin Standard” stated Adam Back CEO of Blockstream who plans to contribute technologies like Liquid and satellite infrastructure to make El Salvador a model for the world.

Strike’s mobile payments app launched in El Salvador in March and quickly became the number one downloaded app in the country. Strike's vision is to build a more connected financial world by making the Bitcoin network easily accessible and useful. Strike expects to enter several more markets in coming months. Once governments see the benefits of Bitcoin technologies like Strike on financial efficiency and inclusion it becomes obvious that they will seek to follow in the footsteps of El Salvador.

Rookie Taylor Walls connected for the big hit in between.

Walls followed the Diaz walk with a tiebreaking two-run double in the eighth inning among a season-high three hits and the Rays beat the Texas Rangers 7-1 on Sunday.

The AL-leading Rays trailed 1-0 before scoring three runs in the eighth and four in the ninth to get the series victory in their return to the stadium that hosted their neutral-site World Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers last fall.

Two errors by Texas shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa led to each rally as five of the seven runs were unearned.

Tampa Bay hasn't lost by more than two runs in the past 26 games the longest run in the AL this season and found another way to win to get to 3-3 in June after 22 victories in May the most for any month in franchise history.

""Probably some of the experience from the past being a little more seasoned in that high intensity anxiety moment they've got a knack for putting pressure and coming through"" Rays manager Kevin Cash said. ""It certainly feels like we are in every ballgame and we can elevate our game a little bit when it gets later in the game.""

Tampa Bay loaded the bases with nobody out against Texas reliever John King in the eighth when Brandon Lowe reached on Kiner-Falefa's throwing error Randy Arozarena singled and pinch-hitter Mike Brosseau walked.

After King (5-4) got fellow lefty Austin Meadows to pop out on a 2-0 pitch right-hander Josh Sborz came in and walked Yandy Diaz to force home the tying run.

Walls followed with a liner to center that was ruled a double because he took second base with nobody covering. The 24-year-old doubled twice and had a single.

""I really trust my approach"" said Walls who has a hit in four of the past five games coming off a 1-for-12 skid. ""I feel like I do my homework and I have the right read on guys.""

The Tampa Bay ninth started with Kiner-Falefa's fielding miscue before Meadows had a two-run single and Diaz connected for a two-run shot off left-hander Brett Martin. The Rays avoided their first series loss since dropping two of three to the New York Yankees at home May 11-13.

J.P. Feyereisen (2-2) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings in a bullpen game after the Rays decided to give Tyler Glasnow extra rest.

The right-hander got 28-year-old rookie slugger Adolis Garcia as a pinch-hitter on a flyout to the warning track with two on to end the Texas eighth with the Rays leading 3-1.

Ryan Sherriff Andrew Kittredge and Jeffrey Springs Feyereisen and former Ranger Pete Fairbanks combined to finish with 7 1/3 scoreless innings.

Nate Lowe brought in the only Texas run against his former team with a double-play grounder in the first inning as the Rangers lost their seventh series in the past eight.

""I feel like so many at-bats early in the game we gave away"" Texas manager Chris Woodward said. ""I can point to some of their at-bats in critical moments where they fouled off a certain pitch fought with two strikes and we didn't. We have the personnel to do it. We have to get better.""

Center fielder Kevin Kiermaier kept the Tampa Bay deficit at 1-0 immediately after entering the game in the seventh ending the inning with a sliding catch on a looping liner from Kiner-Falefa with Jason Martin on third.

""The best version of us is using our entire roster"" Cash said. ""You're not going to have a bullpen day every day. When it's drawn up it couldn't have gone any better. Everybody on the bench played a role. We've used our bench and more times than not they've found a way to get it done.""

NO-DECISION STARTERS

Dane Dunning pitched five scoreless innings with six strikeouts for the Rangers his third scoreless outing of at least five innings without a decision this season.

Michael Wacha went 1 2/3 innings as Tampa Bay's fill-in starter allowing two hits and his first two walks since April 21 against Kansas City a span of 17 2/3 innings and 74 batters.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Rangers: DH Khris Davis was scratched because of an illness with second baseman Nick Solak moving into Davis' spot and Charlie Culberson starting at Solak's primary position.

UP NEXT

Rays: Glasnow (4-2 2.69 ERA) is scheduled for Tuesday's opener of a two-game interleague series at home against Washington. Glasnow had a 7.53 ERA in five appearances against the Nationals including two starts while with Pittsburgh.

Rangers: RHP Jordan Lyles (2-4 5.75) pitches Tuesday's opener of a two-game interleague series at home against San Francisco. Lyles took the loss in the Giants' 4-2 win at home May 11 allowing two runs in five innings.

Home is where the heart is. Home sweet home.

Whichever cliché you want to use the Texas Rangers are happy to finally be back in Arlington. More importantly they're happy to be back in the win column.

""It was awesome to see the fans"" said Rangers manager Chris Woodward. ""Obviously the fans have been great all year but I think that gave us a lot of momentum.

""But the fight [from] our guys you would have never known we had lost nine in a row. That speaks to the character of the team.""

The Rangers defeated the red hot Tampa Bay Rays by a score of 5-4 which effectively ended their nine-game losing streak. The Rays didn't go down with a fight clawing back from a 5-0 deficit with a two-run homer by Brandon Lowe in the eighth inning and a two-run single by Brett Phillips off closer Ian Kennedy in the ninth inning.

The Rangers did a little bit of everything to manufacture runs. The first run of the game came by groundout. In the fourth inning Texas led off with three straight hits that scored a run then Charlie Culberson knocked in another with a safety squeeze. Willie Calhoun followed immediately with another RBI single then in the fifth inning Joey Gallo mashed a solo homer to straight away center field to build a 5-0 lead.

On the hole the Rangers looked far more comfortable at the plate. Maybe it was just the comfort of being in their own ballpark again. However the dialogue between the players and coaching staff prior to the game centered around committing when deciding to swing and it's something the players were able to carry into the game.

""These are things these young hitters are going to have to go through"" Woodward said. ""They're trying to have perfect at-bats. A lot of times in that you end up getting stuck in between. You're not on any pitch at all and it kind of spirals.""

Having Kyle Gibson back from the Injured List was another huge lift for the Rangers. Despite being limited to preserve health Gibson threw 5 1/3 scoreless innings. It unfortunately snapped the run of nine straight quality starts (at least 6 innings with three runs or less) but there was no question that the Rangers were glad to have their ace back on the mound.

""It's good to be on the winning side of things"" Gibson said. ""My body felt great. My groin felt great. My arm felt great. I was really fortunate for that.""

The game was not without its shortcomings. As previously mentioned the Rangers nearly blew the five-run lead in the final innings. However Ian Kennedy was able to slam the door shut with a strikeout of Brandon Lowe on three pitches.

""Obviously this is just a small step winning a game"" Woodward said. ""Hopefully it just kind of relieves a little bit of the black cloud or tension in the clubhouse.""

The Rangers now at 23-36 on the season will try to build off the win in the second game of the series on Saturday afternoon. Kolby Allard (1-1 3.38 ERA) will take the ball for Texas and square off with veteran starter Rich Hill (4-2 3.32 ERA).

A website operating as 'Marcus by Goldman Sachs' popped up in recent weeks virtually indistinguishable from the genuine site which launched in the UK less than three years ago.

The bogus site is run by fraudsters. Only close inspection reveals it does not have the same address as the legitimate Marcus.co.uk account.

Scam: A website operating as 'Marcus by Goldman Sachs' popped up in recent weeks virtually indistinguishable from the genuine site

'Clone' websites such as these are becoming increasingly common.

Even Wall Street titans such as Goldman cannot keep their names out of fraudsters' reach. The Daily Mail which is running a Stamp Out Investment Fraud campaign wants financial scams to be included in the Government's Online Safety Bill.

This paper wants tech giants who run adverts from fraudsters and web hosting providers who sell space for scam sites to be put under a legal duty to check their customers are legitimate.

Mark Taber who reported the fake Marcus site to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said: 'I am not seeing evidence Google is even vetting advertisers before their ads are displayed and I am regularly finding ads for sites which I have long since reported and the FCA has already issued warnings over.'

The fake Marcus site which has been taken down after being reported to the FCA was pulling in customers through a phoney investment comparison site being advertised on Google.

When savers searched for where to invest their money the comparison site was one of the top results. It is not known how many people fell victim to the con.

Goldman Sachs told the Mail that in 2020 it received 130 reports in the UK of fraudsters using its brand.

It is now spending millions of pounds on attempting to protect customers using software and external companies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtaGlyZXMtYW5kLWV4aXRzLWNodWNrLWFkYW1zLWFybWFuZG8tcnViaW8tYWx2YXJlei1rYXJlbi13b25nLTIwMjEtNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street Hires and Exits: Chuck Adams Armando Rubio-Alvarez Karen Wong,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='businessinsider.mx', port=443): Read timed out.

Launched in March the initiative will allocate “$10 billion to advance racial equity and economic opportunity by investing in Black women.”

“This initiative is transformational” Melanie Campbell of the “One Million Black Women” initiative said.

“What Goldman Sachs is doing has the potential to materially impact the lives of Black women their families and communities across the country.”

During a recent interview with NBC‘s Alexi McCammond Curry explained that she will focus her attention on the food industry. As a cookbook author and Food Network host Curry is passionate about getting more Black women in positions of power within the food industry.

Studies have shown that Black workers make up 12.5% of all restaurant employees but only 9.5% of all chefs. In comparison a 2017 study from the National Restaurant Association found that Latinos made up 25% of all restaurant workers and 25% of chefs.

Through her work and activism Curry has worked to improve this reality and she believes that she has found the best partner to make that happen. Unprecedent in the company’s history the “One Million Black Women” initiative positions Goldman Sachs in a way that it has never been before.

“It’s something that I hadn’t seen before on such a large scale”

Curry is not the only star to join the board of the initiative. She works alongside the likes of Issa Rae Valeries Jarrett and Condoleeza Rice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXkueWFob28uY29tL21vcmdhbi1zdGFubGV5LWhpcmVzLWV4LWJvZmEtMDg0NzU0NzQ3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morgan Stanley hires ex BofA banker Rizzo to drive European client push - sources,"FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed on the Morgan Stanley building in New York

By Pamela Barbaglia

LONDON (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley has hired former Bank of America banker Luigi Rizzo for a new client-facing role overseeing a drive to win business from a wide spectrum of companies across Europe the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) sources familiar with the move told Reuters.

Rizzo who was at the helm of Bank of America's European corporate and investment banking and quit in late 2019 will become Morgan Stanley's vice chairman of investment banking for EMEA the sources said speaking on condition of anonymity.

Morgan Stanley was not immediately available for comment.

A seasoned dealmaker who started his career at Goldman Sachs in 1993 Rizzo rose through the ranks becoming a partner in 2008 and working closely with some of Europe's most prominent dealmakers including Diego De Giorgi now co-CEO at Pegasus Europe.

In 2013 he joined Bank of America to take on top jobs in both M&A and investment banking for the EMEA region and moved to Paris after the Brexit referendum to oversee the bank's rollout across the EU.

In his new role he will advise clients including consumer and retail companies financial institutions and TMT (telecoms media and technology) conglomerates in their efforts to pursue strategic combinations that could speed up their post-COVID recovery.

The 50-year old Italian who is also a lecturer at various business schools including Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management where he graduated will be based in London and report to Morgan Stanley's head of investment banking Simon Smith.

His appointment comes as Morgan Stanley - which ranked second after Goldman Sachs in Refinitiv's global M&A league table last year - aims to take advantage of a rebounding M&A market with an overall $2.4 trillion worth of M&A deals announced globally during the first five months of 2021.

In May alone global dealmaking volumes hit a monthly record of $532.9 billion.

HAL,Halliburton,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXJ0c2Rlc2suY29tL3RoZWF0cmUvZGVhdGgtYmxhY2stbWFuLWhhbXBzdGVhZC10aGVhdHJlLXJldmlldy1ibGlzdGVyaW5nLXRoZWF0cmUtdW5mbGluY2hpbmctdmlzaW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Death of a Black Man Hampstead Theatre review - blistering theatre with an unflinching vision | - reviews news ...,"It’s just one remarkable aspect of The Death of a Black Man that it was written 46 years ago and another that such a radical work was first staged not at the Royal Court but at the Hampstead Theatre  to which it now makes its return.

The playwright Alfred Fagon is currently best known for the award for black writers which bears his name: past winners include Roy Williams and Michaela Coel. Fagon died tragically on the street from a heart attack in 1986 at the age of 49 returning from a jog. Despite the police searching his flat which contained among other things his passport they declared they couldn’t identify him and had him cremated in a pauper’s ceremony. In the ensuing outrage Oberon Books published three of his plays and the award was established.

That question of the once barely concealed contempt of the white establishment for black people no matter what their achievements burns through The Death of a Black Man. Dawn Walton’s slick stylish production opens with a monologue from Nickcolia King-N’da as Shakie. He is standing in front of a cricket scoreboard dressed in military gear and holding a cricket bat like a machine gun. The West Indian cricket team has just smashed the England team in that year’s Test Matches with Gary Sobers scoring more than three centuries and Shakie is high on exhilaration and champagne.

The curtain goes up to reveal his swanky Chelsea flat which Shakie can afford because he trades African artefacts on the King’s Road. Yet the evening becomes disturbing very quickly as the witty coolly confident Jackie (played with extraordinary dignity and self-possession by Natalie Simpson) enters and teases him for his pretensions ""Little boy blue you sure talk a lot of shit!"" Their conversation is sexually charged from the get-go – as Shakie observes that ""You look as sexy as ever."" Quickly she hits back ""You are getting ready to rape me! Like you have always done in the past.""

This is not delivered as victim-speak but with the swagger of someone who feels compelled to swim in shark-infested waters. Who is abused and who the abuser is as yet unclear. Jackie is 13 years older yet quickly we find out that Shakie has fathered her baby. It’s only when she sued him for maintenance that she discovered that when they first met he was 15 and not 21 as he claimed. Beneath the poisoned patter of their exchanges flares the question of how limited opportunities once were in this country for two black people with their fizz and attitude. Although we never see him Shakie’s father constantly haunts the conversation; a brilliant and acclaimed West Indian musician who because of his skin colour has been forced to seek out his living playing in pubs. Shakie has decided to deal with this by playing his own cynical games to fit in with white society; sourcing furniture made in Yorkshire and passing it off as exotic homeware to the gullible rich. It’s only when Shakie’s friend Stumpie (Toyin Omari-Kinch pictured above) a party boy with a pan-African vision turns up that a discussion emerges about how they should really forge both their identities and their fortunes.

Nobody covers themselves with glory as Shakie and Stumpie are sucked into a vortex of champagne-swilling drug-taking and debate which is often both misogynistic and anti-Semitic. Simon Kenny’s vibrant design and the punchy performances evoke the sass and attitude of Steve McQueen’s wonderful Small Axe television series but as the action continues we enter Greek tragedy territory. When the news comes that Shakie’s father has died it raises profound questions about how Shakie should deal not only with his death but the way he was treated when he was alive. His solution is as damaged as it is disturbing.

This is intelligent theatre with an unflinching vision; it’s part of its power that it will not leave you sitting comfortably. All the characters take actions that you condemn as an onlooker. Yet you are forced too to think about what has been done to them by white society’s sexualisation of black culture and the fetishisation of its more ""exotic"" aspects at the same time as it has consigned black people to the lowest rungs of employment and social status.

The standout performance of the evening is from Natalie Simpson’s Jackie. As a woman her character is – as with so many plays from this time – not fully realised yet she executes the role with style wit and gravitas. It’s in no small part down to her that this is theatre with fire in its belly. The increasingly free-wheeling script may have flaws but Fagon still rises up as an urgent and troubling voice from the past.

By Tracey Wilson

Following the celebration of Memorial Day 2021 it is good for us to remember Gordon H. Sterling Jr. (1919-1941) killed in action nearly 80 years ago by the Japanese the day they bombed Pearl Harbor. A Second Lieutenant in the Army Air Corps 46th Pursuit Squad Sterling engaged six Japanese planes. He shot down one Japanese plane before he was attacked from the rear and his plane fell into the Pacific Ocean engulfed in flames.

Lt. Sterling was the first person from West Hartford to die in World War II.

Sterling lived on Argyle Avenue right near Fernridge Park. He graduated in 1937 from Hall High School and enrolled at Trinity College. He enlisted in the service in September 1940 the year after Germany invaded Poland to begin the European war but 15 months before the US entrance in the war.

He was stationed at Wheeler Field Hawaii. A year after his death Wheeler Field’s VFW post was named in his memory. Sterling received a Purple Heart and a Distinguished Flying Cross for his service on that fateful day.

His parents and friends had to wait 25 days to find out what happened to Sterling. His First Lieutenant recounted that Sterling was still shooting at the Japanese planes as his plane plunged into the ocean. Two other planes went down as well.

While 140 people from West Hartford died in service in World War II which raged from 1941 to 1945 only two died in 1941 and six in 1942.

In 1943 the Town Council voted to name the new athletic fields west of Charter Oak School after Sterling. They were just being completed at that time. It is not clear today where the bronze plaque is that was donated by the Exchange Club installed in 1948.

It will do us well to remember Gordon Sterling’s name and his actions. He enlisted before there was a draft. His flying skills helped to shoot down at least one of the enemy planes. His sacrifice for the war effort symbolize a man who was willing to fight for something bigger than himself. In a Hartford Courant editorial Sterling was eulogized as a man who justified the cost of his religious training the government services that paid for schooling and sports leagues. The writer argued that “the democratic system under which he grew is worth all that we give to it.” (3/6/1942 Hartford Courant)

“Billy Smith and I wrote this song in the early aughts up at my old rental house in Madison Tennessee” recalls Hartford colleague and fiddle tune book editor Matt Combs “just down the road from John Hartford’s place on you guessed it the Cumberland river shore. You could sit in the living room and watch the boats and the tempo of the river.”

“Matt had John's hat hanging on the wall along with a song scripted by John — it seemed like Hartford's spirit was all around us that day” adds Smith — writer too it should be noted of one of the Lonesome River Band’s most enduring hits “Hobo Blues.” “Matt and I had the song demoed before lunch and went out and had sushi something John and I did quite a few times together.”

“Billy sent me this song a couple of years ago” says the Lonesome River Band’s award-winning banjoist and leader Sammy Shelor. “It was a tribute to John’s days on the Mississippi River. Having gotten to know John myself in the later years of his life and really valuing that experience I really wanted to do this song as a tribute from the band and myself. John was one of my favorite musicians and entertainers and I regret not getting to know him years before. Long live John Hartford’s music!”

Shelor and his bandmates — Jesse Smathers (mandolin) bassist Barry Reed guitarist Brandon Rickman and Mike Hartgrove on fiddle — know exactly how to pay tribute to Hartford. The track starts with just fiddle and banjo before Jesse Smathers begins the song’s story of a man who roams far from his childhood home and sweetheart only to pay the price upon his return. Yet even when the band’s entrance jumpstarts the rest of the song’s bluegrass feel Shelor’s distinctive style keeps the old-time flavor front and center a reminder not just of Hartford’s influence but of Shelor’s own family connection to earlier generations of stringband musicians.

“There’s a lot of music inspired by the river and I’m glad this song is one of them” concludes Combs. “I love LRB’s treatment — great job guys!”

By Dylan Balde |

This article is more than 2 years old

Lucasfilm made its views about Gina Carano crystal clear: there’s no Force in the galaxy compelling enough bring Cara Dune back whether fans like it or not. The studio severed ties with the Mandalorian star a while back for what some perceived as transphobia and antisemitism leading industry pros to believe Season 2 is the last time we’ll be seeing Carano in Star Wars. But that’s not quite the case where Disney merchandising is concerned.

LEGO is still offering minifigures of Gina Carano’s Cara Dune evidenced by an upcoming bumper pack marketed in a recent Japanese catalog. The images are fuzzy but one of the figures’ stocky build and wavy dark hair is unmistakably Dune’s. The minifigure is part of a LEGO Star Wars set scheduled for release this summer. Set number 75315 — which features Moff Gideon’s gun-toting Light Cruiser front and center — includes an enticing lineup of The Mandalorian minifigures. Cara Dune is accompanied by Pedro Pascal’s Din Djarin Grogu Giancarlo Esposito’s Moff Gideon Ming-Na Wen’s Fennec Shand and a Darktrooper.

Here are the images…

Lucasfilm is one of Disney’s many subsidiaries so it makes sense for the company to double back and hit the off switch on any prospective Cara Dune action figures to keep its stance against the actress consistent. Gina Carano merch seemed down for a while; Hasbro reportedly cancelled any future Black Series Cara Dunes the same week of Carano’s firing. The action figure was a huge sellout when it hit shelves in 2020 motivating Hasbro to rubber-stamp another production run. BigBadToyStore told The Hollywood Reporter it was accepting preorders for the action figure when Hasbro aborted the whole line.

Fortunately for brick owners LEGO wasn’t deterred by Carano’s firing in any way and continues to manufacture minifigures related to the character. The Cara Dune offered in LEGO Star Wars’s newest lineup is the same Cara Dune included in 2019’s 75254 AT-ST Raider also inspired by The Mandalorian. The set costs $49.99 from The LEGO Store.

In addition to Gina Carano’s Cara Dune the rest of the summer consumer catalog are all Mandalorian exclusives. 75312 Slave I has minifigures of Din Djarin and an updated version of Temuera Morrison’s Boba Fett. The ship is equipped with a functional cockpit and forward-facing artillery for fans to relive fond Mandalorian memories with. 75316 Mandalorian Fighter has minifigures of fellow Mandalorians Bo Katan and Gar Saxon voiced by Katee Sackhoff and Ray Stevenson in The Clone Wars respectively. 75311 Imperial Troop Transport highlights Greef Karga’s (Carl Weathers) escape from an Imperial base on the volcanic planet of Nevarro. Two Stormtroopers and a Mortar Stormtrooper also feature. 75299 The Mandalorian Trouble in Tatooine is set on Luke Skywalker’s home planet and includes minifigures of Din Djarin Grogu and a Tusken Raider. 75310 The Mandalore Throne and Vault recreates Ahsoka’s duel against Darth Maul in The Clone Wars.

The remaining offerings are 75314 The Bad Batch Attack Shuttle (includes Bad Batch clones Tech Echo Hunter Wrecker and Crosshair and a Gonk Droid) and 75296 Darth Vader Meditation Chamber (includes Darth Vader and General Veers). The whole catalog including Gina Carano’s figure should be available online and in toy stores this August.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYWlwdGNvbWljcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8wNi9tYXJ2ZWwtbGVnZW5kcy13b2x2ZXJpbmUtYm94LXNldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marvel Legends: New 'Wolverine vs. Villains' box set revealed,"Over the last week Marvel Legends revealed single figures to various toy websites of what appeared to be a new Wolverine wave. On Friday however it was revealed they were actually part of a new Amazon exclusive box set.

After last week’s Age of Apocalypse wave reveal it’s clear that Hasbro isn’t afraid to dig deep into X-Men lore to create new figures. Let’s take a look at each one in this set and see if it’s worth worth purchasing.

Shirtless Wolverine

The undisputed star of the group although I must admit that the way the ab crunch looks with this paint scheme really diminishes things.

On the plus side the figure does come with two excellent head sculpts.

Omega Red

This one doesn’t look too different from the Marvel Legends Omega Red we got a couple years ago. In fact I like the paint job on that one much better. This version comes with two superior head sculpts though so it’s definitely worth picking up if you want the character and don’t have him yet.

Fair warning from this point on: Things are going to get pretty obscure even for a big time Marvel fan like me.

Cyber

I know next to nothing about this character but I absolutely love his color scheme. It’s also a pretty safe bet this will be the only time Cyber ever gets a Marvel Legends figure.

Callisto

Callisto is a member of the Morlocks although she must not have made an impression on me as a teenager in ’90s because I don’t remember her at all. That being said I do really like the blue streaked hair.

Jason Wyngarde (aka Mastermind)

Mastermind is supposedly a pretty big deal in the X-Men’s mythology but I am once again drawing a blank. You gotta love that outfit and alternated/bearded head though.

So yeah…I’m pretty sure Hasbro made this boxset for X-Obsessed folks like our very own Chris Hassan. Luckily for them that’s likely to be a big enough market to still make sure this one sells.

If you happen to count yourself as part of the dedicated X-Men fandom the set will retail for $120.99 and is available for preorder now with an expected arrival in December.

Called Project Nightingale and carried out in secret the tech giant teamed up with St. Louis-based Ascension one of the largest private health-care companies in the country. Google was granted complete access to 50 million patients’ names lab results diagnoses and hospitalization records as well as their home addresses and places of employment. Even more worryingly at no time did Ascension or Google make an attempt to inform the patients or ask for their consent.

Despite patient privacy concerns this partnership has only grown with Google boosting its electronic health-record search tool likely resulting in the accumulation of even more patient data.

Now hungry for even more medical data Google has signed a multiyear deal with HCA an American for-profit operator of medical facilities with 2000 health-care sites across 21 different states. The agreement will give Google access to millions more patient records. Is there anything to stop Google from trying to monetize this data the way it has monetized so much other user data? Armed with sensitive medical information advertisers could even specifically target victims of sexual abuse as well as those struggling with severe eating disorders.

Considering Google earns more than 80 percent of its revenue from targeted ads the monetization of medical records could be just another step in its inexorable march toward data domination.

Google has said HCA will use the tech giant’s tools to develop health-care algorithms. “We want to push the boundaries of what the clinician can do in real time with data” Chris Sakalosky managing director of healthcare and life sciences at Google Cloud told The Wall Street Journal.

But the recent HCA deal appears similar to the one struck with Ascension — except it’s even bigger. While Ascension has 165000 employees and 151 hospitals HCA boasts 280000 staff and 186 hospitals. Yet again one of the wealthiest companies in the world has gained access to highly personal medical data without even notifying patients. Executives at Google claim to care about your privacy but the reality paints a very different picture. (After this piece went to press Google told The Post: “This is a deal between HCA Healthcare and Google Cloud and follows Google Cloud’s Enterprise Privacy Commitments. We do not process customer data to create ads profiles or improve Google Ads products. We do not sell customer data or service data to third parties.”)

According to a Consumer Watchdog report Google collects information without people’s knowledge or consent. And the company currently faces a suit in California which claims it collects and breaks data into categories like sexuality ethnicity religion health conditions etc. which are then “broadcast to hundreds of bidders” with the highest bidder “winning the auction.”

The accumulation of data pays handsomely: Google’s profits more than doubled last quarter.

Experts are now sounding alarm bells about the new HCA venture. The idea of Google selling patients’ data is not beyond the realm of possibility argues Arthur Kaplan professor of ethics at NYU’s Grossman School of Medicine. After all this is the very same company that just a few years ago removed the “don’t be evil” clause from its code of conduct.

Also if Google is going to use highly sensitive data to generate profits shouldn’t the affected people at least receive proper compensation?

Last year researchers at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management asked Americans if they were willing to share their health data with Big Tech companies. Unsurprisingly 90 percent of respondents said no.

How much they asked was the average person willing to accept in exchange for their data? The answer was $100000. Multiply that figure by 50 million (the number of peoples’ records accessed in 2019) and you get $5 trillion. Enough to end the $1-trillion-worth Google as we know it five times over.

Sadly the idea of each patient being compensated doesn’t seem likely. So what if anything can be done?

According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) patients have a say in how their health information is handled. If a patient requests that their information not be shared with third parties without their consent then according to HIPAA guidelines this request under law must be respected.

If you happen to be a HCA patient and are concerned by what you have read the company’s ethics line number is 1-800-455-1996. Why not give a call and make sure that your data is not being abused? You might not receive any compensation but you most certainly deserve to have your questions answered.

It was in 1936 that Mr. Hershey requested “a nice garden of roses” be created for the community. By 1937 Hershey Rose Garden opened. What began as a 3 ½-acre rose garden expanded to 23 acres by 1944. To this day the original 3 ½-acre rose garden now called the Historic Rose Garden has remained virtually identical since its opening in 1937.

The colors the fragrance the breathtaking backdrop that surrounds the Historic Rose Garden are just a few reasons to visit Hershey Gardens while the roses are blooming. And if the timing is right guests will get to see one very special rose in bloom: the M.S. Hershey Rose.

The American Rose Society honored Mr. Hershey in 1940 with the M.S. Hershey Rose as a way to recognize the chocolate magnate for his love of horticulture. Visitors to Hershey Gardens can enjoy the M.S. Hershey rose in a special part of the garden called the M.S. Hershey Tribute Garden which showcases 75 M.S.

The candy aisle at your local gas station is lined with dozens of colorful bags and boxes of delicious treats — which one do you choose when your sweet tooth starts calling? If it's the amalgamation of Reese's peanut butter and Hershey's chocolate that gets your mouth salivating you are not alone. As it turns out Reese's reigns supreme as one of the best candy bars available though this should come as no surprise. The mixture of salty and sweet flavors is scientifically proven to be a winning combination after all.

So now you have landed on Reese's but in what form? There are the classic peanut butter cups or a newer version of the candy that brings a delightful crunch with the addition of pretzels but the issue that remains with both of these treats is that you only get one or two at a time. Luckily there's another way to indulge in your craving that will last more than 30 seconds — Reese's Pieces which as it turns out are widely considered to be the best Reese's product out there. And why wouldn't they be? Bite-sized pieces of creamy peanut butter covered in a crunchy coating that's either orange yellow or brown. What's not to love? Well a lot if you're not a huge fan of the color orange as Delish reveals that there are actually way more candies in this shade than the other two in every package of Reese's Pieces.

The present situation appears unworkable the path forward uncertain. It is not however the first time St. Croix has stood at such a precipice. This historical six-part series explores three moments in the past century – VI Corp Harvey Aluminum and Hess Oil – where frustration with the given situation boiled over into radical change. Breaking with the past a better future for St. Croix was declared a new foundation laid. These decreed Crucian futures sometimes aligned with the people and sometimes overrode the people. Today Limetree comes into view at just such a crossroads and once more the future of St. Croix is up for grabs.

Crude Prosperity: Hess Oil on St. Croix (Part Five)

“Give me the quota and I’ll break ground for a petrochemical plant in a helluva hurry” Leon Hess told island officials and federal regulators in 1967. It was a promise he intended to keep and by 1970 Hess was well on his way to building a refinery with a rocket-like ascent.

Hess set up shop in the Virgin Islands at a most opportune time. As American production of crude oil started fading in the late 1960s domestic consumption skyrocketed. The resulting embrace of imports meant supertankers became more important than pipelines in meeting the U.S. energy needs. As Leon Hess never tired of pointing out it was far cheaper to ship petroleum to NYC from St. Croix than from Houston. And the territorial status of St. Croix provided advantages that Houston could never match.

Within a decade Hess was operating the largest refinery and petrochemical plant in the world on the south shore of St. Croix. The sprawling scale of this mega-refinery is matched only by its relative neglect in popular and scholarly understandings of the Virgin Islands.

The U.S. Virgin Islands based solely on the scale of this mega-refinery was routinely listed as one of the top 10 sources of oil imported to the United States. For most of the past 50 years “America’s Paradise” in the Lesser Antilles operated as a major axis of the energy network of the Atlantic Seaboard. The difficulties imagining St. Croix as the gas station to the East Coast was part of its advantage. The Hess operation in Krause Lagoon provided millions of Americans with cheap fuel without ever having to think too much about the costs.

Gov. Ralph M. Paiewonsky welcomed Harvey Aluminum and Hess Oil to St. Croix with open arms in the 1960s believing only the wages of industry could emancipate the island from the “plantation economy” of its past. However the arrival of aluminum processing and oil refining did not so much break with colonialism as deepen the islands reliance on – and relative distance from – the mainland. The secondary status of the Virgin Islands itself became one the most enticing features to recruit and retain industry.

“Word has gotten around Wall Street that corporations can get a businessman’s deal in the Virgin Islands” wrote the Virgin Islands Industrial Incentive Board in 1966. Industry was granted an autonomy unavailable in the U.S. proper the Industrial Incentive Board explained as the Virgin Islands offered few restrictions and even less “peeking over the shoulder” at a company’s operations. Tax law worker’s rights and environmental protections all proved more pliable in these Caribbean waters than on the mainland a fact that Hess Oil and Government House both came to count on.

Industry’s early years on St. Croix were turbulent. Beyond beating back the protests of farmers both Harvey and Hess skirted promises made to their workers. It was a lapse that soon sparked a resurgence of that great Crucian pastime: organizing a strike. Again and again operations at Harvey Aluminum and Hess Oil were brought to a standstill by worker demands in the late 1960s. “Labor Unrest Plagues St. Croix South Shore” ran a 1968 headline of the Daily News. Forgoing promises to hire locally both Harvey and Hess sought to circumvent labor militancy by hiring workers from elsewhere. By 1968 a guest worker program accounted for over half of all workers on island (a figure that rose to 95% of workers in the construction boom that built the refinery). Arriving from Antigua Barbados and Trinidad and housed in guarded barracks Hess trained these “bonded aliens” in the ease with which they could be deported if they caused any trouble.

But the wages were sterling. And the down islanders and men from the mainland who found steady work at the refinery soon prospered into a new middle class on St. Croix. By 1972 payroll at the Hess refinery edged out the wages of the tourism sector. With handsome paychecks refinery workers encouraged new shops new restaurants and new houses on St. Croix to fit their tastes. Amid complaints of overcrowded public schools Hess bankrolled the St Croix Country Day School purchase of Estate Good Hope. Such benevolence was not disinterested: refinery workers wanted private educational opportunities for their children.

Even as it grew to record-breaking size Hess Oil never employed more than a sliver of residents in the Virgin Islands. In fact Leon Hess bragged of his ability to run the plant with fewer men than would be required elsewhere. The refinery however redefined the nature of work in the territory. On paper the petro-fueled economy of the USVI flourished into one of the richest in the entire Caribbean. Yet GDP is a poor measure of shared prosperity and in the 1970s St. Croix faced spiking unemployment among Crucians as agriculture collapsed and heavy industry preferred guest workers.

Flush with revenue the territorial government started hiring. During the late 1970s one report found 75% of new jobs on St. Croix were in government and by 1980 roughly half of the native population of St. Croix found gainful employment in proliferating public agencies. These government salaries provided another route into the middle class for many Crucians yet it introduced an uncomfortable divide within modest Black prosperity on St. Croix: while industry preferred down-island workers government preferred native Crucians.

As is so often the case such fiscal wealth came at tremendous ecological cost. Concerns over pollution accompanied Hess Oil from the moment it arrived in Krause Lagoon. In 1972 the New York Times reported on frustration over “air and water pollution” and “spiraling food costs” that locals associated with the arrival of the refinery. By the early 1980s so much oil had leaked from the refinery that an oil slick some 10 feet thick floated on top of the island’s only aquifer. At one point construction workers on the south shore stood back in surprise as a geyser of crude oil shot out of the hole they were digging. A local newspaper reported that they thought they’d hit it big until the dismal reality of the situation became clear: they had tapped into a shockingly large plume of petrochemicals flowing from the refinery.

Over the years Hess Oil routinely offered up public health as a reasonable price to ensure operational ease and corporate returns. Retired workers told me stories of venting carcinogenic petrochemicals under the cover of night during the 1980s. This on an island where residents still get their drinking water from cisterns. Hess was decades late in setting up a basic emissions reporting system but when it finally did in 1989 the results were appalling. Hess Oil disclosed it had released 700000 pounds of toxic benzene the previous year. (The company later revised that figure to just under half a million pounds). In so many ways contamination was built into the very design of the plant.

In government accounting Hess Oil became the economy of the Virgin Islands. The astronomical wealth that passed through its enclave operations in Krause Lagoon dwarfed the revenue streams from every other sector in the Virgin Islands. This fundamental economic fact tilted the political center of gravity on St. Croix away from the feud of farmers (country) and merchants (city) and towards the new fault-lines of an emerging middle class. It also installed suburban consumption at the heart of St. Croix and swelled the territorial government into a modern civic bureaucracy and Crucian employment agency. But dependency on one firm meant this uplift of the Virgin Islands economy could only proceed in cultivated ignorance of its narrow corporate base and broad ecological cost.

As the Virgin Islands became a more fulsome democracy with a government that finally looked like the people governed the territory’s economy became markedly less diverse. This contradiction conjured the very past believed to be overcome for not since the days of the plantation had these islands rested so much on the promissory note of a single commodity. And just as the spectacular wealth of sugar came at the price of enslaved bodies sacrificed to ease European consumption the spectacular wealth of oil came at the price of colonized landscapes sacrificed to ease America’s addiction to fossil fuels.

Unfortunately the Virgin Islands were far from unique in this complicated embrace of oil refining. Although Leon Hess may have done it on a far grander scale here the story of oil refining in St. Croix is also the story of the contemporary Caribbean.

Oil in the Caribbean

During the 20th century the Caribbean became a global hub of oil refining. This cardinal economic realignment remains underappreciated in scholarly and popular understandings of the region. As the Panama Canal brought new shipping lanes to the region and as European navies and trading concerns retrofitted their fleets to run on petroleum oil refineries were built across the Caribbean in 1930s and 1940s. Unlike their European and American counterparts designed to serve adjacent urban markets these Caribbean refineries were sized to the oceanic merchant and military networks they supported.

During World War II the Royal Dutch Shell refinery on Curaçao became the largest refinery in the world followed closely by Standard Oil of New Jersey’s refinery on Aruba. These two massive Caribbean refineries provided over 70 percent of the Allies’ aviation and naval fuel and attracted concerted attacks from German U-boats. Many of these early Caribbean refineries were designed to process Latin American crude oil within colonies controlled by Europe. As European influence waned in the Caribbean the United States stepped in.

Oil production in the United States peaked in 1970 (until fracking reversed the downward trend around 2010). A hemispheric event peak oil in the U.S. helped transform Caribbean refineries into an imperial circuit of the United States energy grid. After World War II abundant reserves of oil in California and Texas underwrote a new American Dream of cheap food big cars and suburban ease. As the domestic flow of crude started sputtering in the 1960s and 70s the nation faced a dilemma: either recognize natural limits or compel oil from elsewhere.

In the 1970s the United States debated whether to redesign American life around alternative sources of energy efficiencies achieved through public investments in building design and transportation and drastically curtailed military expenditures of fuel (all of which were key platforms of the first Earth Day in 1970). Or in the other direction whether to throw the weight of the federal government into a more imperial pursuit of foreign oil. President Richard Nixon opting for the latter helped deepen the American addiction to fossil fuels far beyond what the country itself could provide.

In 1955 roughly 90% of the petroleum consumed in the United States came from domestic sources. By 1977 nearly half of the gasoline jet fuel and heating oil consumed in the US came from foreign oil. This rising American dependence on foreign oil transformed the Caribbean into the premier refining hub of the eastern United States. From 1970 onward half of the crude oil imported to the US arrived on supertankers that passed through the Caribbean. With domestic refineries hedged in by urban sprawl and new emission limits American oil companies realized the exceptional advantage of the Caribbean. And soon Tesoro Sun Oil Gulf Oil Union Carbide Philips Petroleum Hess Oil and others were fast at work building new enclave refineries in the Caribbean.

Between 1950 and 1990 oil refineries became the largest site of capital investment in the Caribbean a leading source of state revenue and one of the region’s largest employers especially during the construction boom of new refineries in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This petro-boom renovated older refineries in Aruba Curaçao and Trinidad and built new entrepot refineries in Antigua the Bahamas Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Accepting delivery of oil from the Middle East Africa and Latin America these refineries only processed crude in one direction: north to US markets. By some estimates in the 1980s one out of every six gallons of gasoline sold in the United States had been refined in the Caribbean.

As one book noted of these trends in 1984 “The Caribbean has been highly regarded as a refining center because of its political stability its deep harbors its lack of environmental regulations and its proximity to major shipping lanes.” But we might sharpen the point. In the 1970s the Caribbean found itself recast as an imperial outpost of American energy: close enough for the U.S. to monopolize the gain but far enough away to avoid any real responsibility for the problems.

The World Bank and other international organizations actively encouraged Caribbean states to welcome this new “enclave-type” processing of petroleum products for export to the United States as a crucial step in modernizing Caribbean economies. Sidney Chernick the World Bank’s Chief of Mission to the Caribbean authored a plan for regional development that pivoted on entrepot refineries remaking the Caribbean. While Chernick acknowledged that “little value” might accrue locally he argued that the most lucrative payoff might be the discipline such industry imposed upon Caribbean societies. “To encourage enclave exports is not inconsistent with taking longer-term steps to transform the structure of the economy by developing stronger internal behavior.”

It was a point previewed a decade earlier by Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall when celebrating the opening of a new entrepot refinery in Puerto Rico in 1967. Perhaps the greatest export of this plant Udall said was not the cheap petroleum it provided for the mainland but the inspiring economic model it provided to the Caribbean. Such is the ideology of empire. It is now well understood how the immense profits of Caribbean sugar underwrote the rise of European empires four centuries ago. Perhaps a similar story might now be told about the role of Caribbean refining in fueling the contemporary empire of oil in the United States.

CANYON — Picky college palates are no problem for West Texas A&M University’s new executive chef.

Chef Julio Rubio a longtime resident of New York arrived on campus in the spring to lead the team of Aramark employees who provide daily meals in the University Dining Hall. Rubio also is responsible for catering and food innovation on campus.

Rubio 49 was born in El Salvador but emigrated at age 6 to the United States where his family settled in Yonkers N.Y. After working in the kitchen with his father who also worked as a chef Rubio apprenticed under Chef Willie Nuenlist and trained in classical French techniques rising through the ranks in the Hilton Hotels International Corp.

“After 30 years of cooking I have found a way of making people happy” Rubio said. “The reward of a chef is to cook something good that you’re appreciated for. There’s not a paycheck that can compare to that.”

Rubio is the author of the 2017 release “Cooking with His Love” and the forthcoming “Victory.”

“Julio brings with him a wealth of culinary talent that he has picked up over 30 years of experience” said Michael Ives Aramark food service director for WT. “Although this is his first experience working in higher education his background has made him well versed in every aspect of culinary from the simple barbeque to the finest dining experience.”

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic Rubio was the food service director and executive chef for Camp of the Woods in the Adirondacks in upstate New York but when the pandemic upended his career he and wife Emily decided to try their fortunes in a new state.

“I didn’t even know where Amarillo or Canyon were on a map to be honest with you” Rubio said.

But he quickly found a home.

“I love the town I love the students here and I love the school” Rubio said.

Even when they offer constructive criticism.

“What I love about them is they’re honest” Rubio said. “If they don’t really care for something they’ll come to you. That’s the feedback I love to hear.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVybWlkZGxlZWFzdC5jb20vcGVvcGxlLzEyNzY1OC1jbHVzdGVyLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtZGlyZWN0b3ItbmFtZWQtZm9yLWhpbHRvbi1ob3RlbHMtaW4tcmFr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cluster commercial director named for Hilton hotels in RAK,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/people/127658-cluster-commercial-director-named-for-hilton-hotels-in-rak on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVybWlkZGxlZWFzdC5jb20vcGVvcGxlLzEyNzY1OC1jbHVzdGVyLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtZGlyZWN0b3ItbmFtZWQtZm9yLWhpbHRvbi1ob3RlbHMtaW4tcmFr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

As more and more of our time is spent online and transacting through digital methods instead of cash corporations are having a harder time preventing financial fraud. One of the best ways companies can combat fraud is by employing identity solutions software which verifies customers are actually who they say they are.

The identity verification market is expected to grow at a 13.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and reach $17.8 billion in global spending by 2026 making it one of the world's fastest-growing industries. Two small-cap stocks Intellicheck (IDN 0.30%) and Mitek Systems (MITK 1.34%) are riding this identity solutions wave and could be strong investments over the next decade. Here's why.

Intellicheck

Intellicheck went public over 20 years ago but after a few years turned into a broken IPO. Shares are still down over 90% from when they first started trading. The company has a long-running relationship with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) which runs all the departments of motor vehicles in Canada the United States and Mexico to verify new driver's license types are legitimate and follow the proper format before being distributed. This relationship gives Intellicheck an advantage over competitors because it can truly authenticate an ID card with a 99.9% success rate. Other companies without this exclusive AAMVA relationship are forced to make educated guesses based on historical data bringing their success rates down.

With the AAMVA data Intellicheck built a software solution that it sells to all types of retailers that are at risk of accepting fake or stolen identities. When a customer signs up for a membership program or is making a big purchase with a retailer the cashier scans the customer's driver's license and then Intellicheck routes the relevant information to its database to determine whether the ID is fake or stolen. This is a huge value added to retailers that are at risk of getting duped by fraudulent purchases especially for expensive items like cars or jewelry.

The problem is while Intellicheck has arguably the best identity solution it has historically been atrocious at marketing and managing the product. This all changed when CEO Bryan Lewis joined the company around three years ago. Lewis started marketing Intellicheck's software through major financial institutions that would then pitch the fraud detection product to the companies that bank with them (financial institutions are typically the ones on the hook when fraudulent activity occurs so they have a major incentive to stop it from happening).

This marketing switch has led trailing-12-month revenue to grow from only $4 million in the second quarter of 2018 to $10.5 million at the end of last quarter. Intellicheck also has a best-in-class gross margin that consistently sits above 90%. It is not yet profitable as it is spending lots of money to build out its salesforce. Last quarter it hired three additional salespeople bringing the total on staff to nine. This sales team is landing large clients. On the conference call last quarter Lewis said the team was beginning to roll out its software to the ""largest home improvement retailer in the United States."" Though it didn't identify the company by name it appears Home Depot is now using Intellicheck's software in its stores.

At a market cap of $143 million Intellicheck trades at a trailing price-to-sales ratio of 13.6 and does not yet have an earnings multiple since it isn't profitable. While expensive relative to its historical financials if you are going to invest in Intellicheck you're betting that the company can continue growing sales at a high rate over the next few years as it tries to win new customers in the identity solutions market.

Mitek Systems

While Intellicheck is mainly focused on in-person transactions and verifications Mitek Systems focuses on stopping identity fraud online. Its legacy business is powering mobile check deposits for banks. This is a fairly stagnant market as checks have become less popular forms of payment over the last decade. However due to the increasing adoption of mobile deposits among people who still use checks and Mitek's pricing power with banks mobile deposits grew revenue 16% last quarter to $17.2 million.

Mobile deposits are a steady but low-growth business for Mitek but its digital identity products are where it should get the most growth over the next few years. Last quarter this segment which helps businesses confirm identities on online platforms grew revenue 35% year over year to $11.6 million. Mitek's customers for digital identity include fast-growing platforms like Airbnb Instacart and DocuSign. It doesn't have as high a success rate as Intellicheck which potentially could pose a threat to Mitek if it starts meaningfully growing its online solution but the lock-in it has with these large digital platforms should give Mitek steady growth over the next few years and beyond.

Mitek's market cap is currently around $720 million. It has a high gross margin like Intellicheck but is actually profitable and trades at a reasonable multiple of 23 times its trailing-12-month operating cash flow. There are some risks to part of the business with the decline in check usage and the fact it may have gotten a one-time boost for online verification in 2020 due to the side effects of pandemic lockdowns. But if you believe businesses are going to spend more money fighting online fraud Mitek Systems is one of the market leaders and trades at a reasonable valuation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2FtYXpvbi1saWdodGRpbXMtYmxhY2stb3V0LXZpbnlsLXN0aWNrZXJzLXJldmlldy0zNjgxNzQ3NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon LightDims Black Out Vinyl Stickers Review,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/amazon-lightdims-black-out-vinyl-stickers-review-36817476 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2FtYXpvbi1saWdodGRpbXMtYmxhY2stb3V0LXZpbnlsLXN0aWNrZXJzLXJldmlldy0zNjgxNzQ3NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbWlkamlwaW9uZWVyLmNvbS9jb21tdW5pdHkvYXMtbm9ydGh3ZXN0LXNpZGUtZGV2ZWxvcGVkLWJlbWlkamktYmVjYW1lLW1vcmUtb2YtYS1yZWdpb25hbC1jZW50ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As northwest side developed Bemidji became more of a regional center,"Editor's Note: This is the fourth chapter of five that chronicle the city of Bemidji's development since it was incorporated as a village on May 20 1896. Each chapter covers a span of 25 years and was originally published in the Pioneer's Annual Report on May 22. Here you can find our printed section and here you can find the other four chapters.

Expansion was the theme for Bemidji’s fourth quarter century starting in 1971. For 75 years the town had grown and developed a personality of its own but much of that was centered around downtown Bemidji.

And while it had long been a destination for tourists and outdoor enthusiasts Bemidji’s reach also expanded in the 1970s and ’80s as development moved from the city’s core.

The Paul Bunyan Mall opened in 1977 along what was then U.S. Highway 2 on the city’s northwest side taking JCPenney out of downtown. The Bemidji Community Hospital and Bemidji Clinic built new facilities leaving downtown for the northwest. Car dealerships moved out of downtown. Banks expanded to that part of town. Other new businesses sprung up on what had been the wooded outskirts. In the mid 1980s the Highway 2/71 bypass was built paving the way for Paul Bunyan Drive through the expanded northwest side.

Then the big box stores arrived starting in 1996 with Target. Walmart opened in 2002. Home Depot Menards Hobby Lobby and Kohl’s followed. Chain restaurants also set up shop on Paul Bunyan Drive.

Sid Sletten who grew up in Bemidji and still calls it home after retiring as finance director at Beltrami Electric Cooperative remembers quite a different scene on that stretch of road.

“From where the mall was built it was basically country going out to the Highway Host (now Super Buffet)” Sletten said. “There was no four-lane highway. The grain trucks came right through town. And it seemed like it took forever to get to Wilton.”

Larry Young former city planner and retired economic development director said the expansion added to Bemidji’s diverse economy.

“Bemidji has been blessed over the years with a fairly diversified economic base which continues today” Young wrote in a chapter for the Beltrami County Historical Society’s upcoming book on the city’s 125 years. “It includes retail sales manufacturing timber processing medical services education tourism and advanced telecommunications -- economic drivers that will continue to build a bright future for the Bemidji area.”

But after the Paul Bunyan Mall was built while Young was still with the city concerned downtown business owners paid him a visit.

“Literally the day the mall opened the downtown merchants came to my office in the city and said ‘OK Mr. City Planner what are you going to do for us?’” he recalled. “That was the beginning of the downtown project.”

Spearheaded by the late Pat Campbell owner of The Melody Shop on Third Street a plan was developed to revitalize the downtown area.

“We got a group together and decided maybe it’s not just the merchants’ responsibility to make something happen” Young said. “So we started looking at the city staff the merchants and consultants that we worked with. It took awhile to get our ducks in a row get money lined up. Once that happened it really changed the whole relationship between the downtown and the rest of the community I think.”

The Downtown Development Authority (now Bemidji Downtown Alliance) was formed.

“Pat Campbell was the mother hen of the DDA” Young said. “She had a lot of respect from the downtown merchants and the bankers. I give her a lot of credit. Also we were very fortunate that a young landscape architect had moved into town a couple years before the project happened and that was (the late) Dick Rose. He aligned himself with Stewart Walker Engineering and between Dick and Stewart Walker we had some really good engineers and landscape architects. The image of what you see downtown with the trees and planters that was primarily Dick Rose’s vision.”

The vision began to become a reality in May of 1984 when a large crowd of townsfolk gathered for a groundbreaking ceremony.

“At the time we started that project there were 17 vacant storefronts downtown” Young said. “The hospital and clinic had moved out of downtown. The bypass was under construction. They were really scared to death that downtown was going to go. When we got the project done it really turned things around for the downtown area. It put them in a much stronger position when the big boxes started coming in.”

In May 1984 dozens of people gathered for the groundbreaking ceremony of Bemidji's downtown revitalization project. This photo was taken at Second Street and Beltrami Avenue. The Paul Bunyan Sub Shop was located at the site of what is now Frizzell Furniture Gallery. (Submitted photo)

Between the spruced-up downtown and the expanding northwest corridor Bemidji became even more of a regional center.

“There’s no question that the downtown project brought a lot more people in from farther away” Young said “but the same thing happened as the mall opened up too. The mall brought more people into the mall but it also brought more people into the downtown area.”

Sletten agrees adding “I’ve always called Bemidji the northern hub of central Minnesota. People from Grand Forks are coming over Brainerd St. Cloud Baudette International Falls. It’s become even more of a hub because of the medical services.”

Ground was broken for the new Bemidji Community Hospital on Aug. 29 1977 and it opened for business on Oct. 29 1979. The new hospital had a medical staff of 25 and more than 350 employees. In December 1981 a new corporation North Country Health Services was formed operating North Country Regional Hospital North Country Nursing & Rehabilitation Center North Country Housing and the North Country Health Services Foundation. It remained that way until 2011 when NCHS merged with Sanford Health.

Meanwhile the 1970s saw a period of real growth for the Bemidji Clinic. The number of physicians grew from 10 to 16 and the downtown building at Sixth and Beltrami became too small. If all of the physicians showed up for work on the same day someone had to be sent home; there was not enough space for them. In December of 1979 16 physicians moved into the new and present clinic building next to the new hospital. In 1988 it merged with the Fargo Clinic and in 1998 its name changed to MeritCare which eventually merged with Sanford.

“Up until the 1990s there were probably 15 places just in the surrounding area that carried live music” Sletten said. “And people went to every place. It was amazing how many places had music. The Blue Ox that’s where the Markham Hotel was they ran music seven nights a week. The Holiday Inn ran music five nights a week. The Elks Moose and Legion all had music on Fridays and Saturdays. It was just a matter of what you wanted to hear.”

Also during this time Bemidji High School won its third state boys basketball championship (1974) the new Bemidji Middle School was built (1986) and Bemidji State was winning most of its 13 national championships in men’s hockey.

Angle had his brother’s help in matches first starting at Survivor Series in 2000. While facing The Undertaker Kurt Angle sought refuge from the Deadman under the ring. The Undertaker gave chase and dragged Angle out before delivering the Last Ride and attempting a pinfall. The referee in the bout counted to two before realising that the man Undertaker was pinning was not Kurt Angle. The real Kurt Angle then rolled up ‘Taker amidst the confusion for the cheap win. It then transpired the man Undertaker had dragged from under the ring was Kurt’s brother Eric.

Eric Angle was signed to WWE’s then developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling from 2000 to 2003. Speaking on an episode of The Kurt Angle Show the Olympic gold medallist gave some insight into why Eric’s time in professional wrestling didn’t take off in the same way Kurt’s did.

Kurt Angle explained:

“My brother was getting it he just wasn’t getting it as quickly as I did. I think the company was comparing him to me but he was getting it he was learning he was improving dramatically. The unfortunate incident of him tearing his tricep [he] tore the tendon right off the bone from his arm and he had to have surgery. When he had the surgery the doctor performed surgery the next day and my brother was in excruciating pain.” “He went back to the hospital and said ‘There’s something going on in my arm I need to take this cast off’. [The doctor] said ‘Don’t worry it’s just from the surgery the pain will go away’ so the next day [my brother] went back to the hospital and said the same thing. They told him to go home don’t worry about it go rest. The third day [my brother] didn’t have a saw and he wanted to saw off the cast himself so he went to the Home Depot and sawed off the cast.”

Angle goes on to explain that when the cast came off Eric’s arm there was a nasty surprise awaiting:

“What he did he looked at the incision and there was a huge infection. He pushed on the incision and all this yellow and red puss came out. He went directly to the hospital after the Home Depot and he said ‘Look I told you there was an infection.’ The hospital to protect their ass and for liability said in the report that my brother sawed off his cast and got the infection by sawing off his cast. You don’t get an infection in 10 minutes he was at the Home Depot 10 minutes prior to when he went to the hospital and they did that to cover their ass and it ended my brother’s career. He couldn’t sue the doctor or the hospital WWE let him go and thank god they paid for his surgery before they let him go which was pretty cool.”

Kurt Angle then discussed what the plans were from him and Eric before the injury that ultimately put paid to Eric’s in-ring career. Angle explained that the duo could have joined the Hardy Boyz The Young Bucks and Harlem Heat as a brother tag-team combination.

Angle said:

“That was the plan. They wanted Eric and I to tag together they thought if Eric improved enough he’d be a great tag team partner for me we could have a good run as a tag team for a while. Unfortunately he got hurt and it never transpired.”

Kurt Angle was recently the topic of conversation for AEW star and former Olympic boxer Anthony Ogogo. ‘The Guv’nor’ explained how Angle helped when Ogogo’s boxing career came to a sudden end due to injury.

Ryan Thomas Ambrose 92. Naples FL Born May 16 1929 in Marshall MN to Maude (Nee Regnier) Ryan and Matthew Ryan. Died May 30 2021 in Naples FL. ""Tommy"" grew up in Marshall Minnesota. As a teenager he contracted rheumatic fever spending several months in bed with last rites being administered. He enjoyed hunting ducks and pheasants with his brother Clair and with their father Matt manager of the Marshall airport (now Ryan Field). Tom had a life-long love of aviation being a sponsor of the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame. He played trumpet in swing bands around southwestern Minnesota before attending St. Thomas College and the University of Minnesota playing in the marching band. He served in the Army National Guard. During college he met his future wife Patricia Fazendin whom he married in 1951. Tom's Guard unit was assigned to Camp Rucker in Alabama where his first of seven children was born. Upon discharge Tom and Patt returned to Minneapolis where he entered job training at Honeywell. Tom eventually worked in the Minneapolis branch of Kewanee Boilers. In 1962 the Ryans built an A&W drive-in restaurant in Wayzata operating the business ""on the side"" for ten years. In 1970 Tom founded Ryan Company. He continued developing companies related to commercial HVAC. In the 1970's the couple enjoyed their weekends at their cabin at Breezy Point on Pelican Lake. Tom developed an aptitude for real estate investment. While raising his family Tom moved from Hopkins to Wayzata to Spring Lake Park to Lyndale to Orono then to retiring in Excelsior. Tom and Patt enjoyed wintering in Florida eventually establishing a residence in Naples. Upon retirement Tom enjoyed flying his WWII-era airplane driving his antique cars boating golfing at Lafayette Club Minnetonka and Moorings Country Club Naples.

Turbotech a French company based at Toussus-Le-Noble not far from Paris is offering range extenders based on a regenerative turbine solution. The company has two product lines: the TP-R90 turboprop and TG-R55/TG-R90 turbogenerator.

I spoke to Turbotech founder and CEO Damien Fauvet and sales director Marie-Claire Camin about their engines and how they see turbogenerators shaping the eVTOL space in the coming years.

Alex Scerri: Damien can you give me a brief background on yourself and the founding of Turbotech?

Damien Fauvet: Aviation was always my passion as it is for the other co-founders of the company. I worked at Safran group for 20 years mainly on large commercial aircraft turbine engines such as the CFM56 in the after-sales department. I started by building and flying RC aircraft and I also assembled small homebuilt turbine engines.

When I had my first aerobatic aircraft I wanted to retrofit it with a turbine engine but the problem was fuel consumption because when you reduce the size from a 1000-horsepower to a 100-hp turbine engine scaling leads to very poor fuel efficiency. Several attempts to install surplus military APUs [auxiliary power units] on light aircraft have been made. These units are relatively light reliable and have good performance but the fuel consumption was about 60 liters per hour.

I knew that a more efficient engine could be commercialized as there is a lot of interest and demand so I started working in my free time mainly on weekends and evenings to develop a regenerative turbine. The principle is the use of a heat exchanger to recover heat that would otherwise be lost in the exhaust. This greatly improves fuel consumption so I decided to invest more time and personal funds into a prototype.

While discussing the project around the coffee machine at work we formed a team of four guys with the same passion and vision. We continued working together on weekends to improve the engine and when we thought we had something that was working well we decided to go for external funding. Three years ago we came to speak to our employer Safran and some equity fund companies. Safran provided part of the funds and that is how Turbotech started.

Alex Scerri: How does your engine differentiate itself from other similar regenerative turbine concepts?

Damien Fauvet: We did not invent the regenerative turbine as it has been around for about 50 years. They are already quite common in industry such as in power generation plants. Even the M1 Abrams battle tank uses a regenerative turbine engine as well as some large ships.

However although there were many attempts to make regenerative turbines for aircraft and helicopters they were never deployed mainly because the heat exchanger made up of thousands of microtubes was technically very challenging and costly to produce. At Turbotech we managed to develop a patented heat exchanger which can be manufactured at a reasonable cost and [has] a practical service life. We are not aware that there are any other comparably advanced projects.

Alex Scerri: Under which certification specification will your product be certified?

Damien Fauvet: It’s a good question. We analyzed the market and since we come from the world of large turbines we are very familiar with certification process and the associated costs of engine development. Our market analysis suggested that we should start with a non-certified engine because there is an order of magnitude greater need for engines for experimental and ultralight aircraft in the 100- to 200-hp range than for certified engines.

In the process we will be developing and maturing the technology in the next three years but in parallel we are preparing the certification under CS-E. We are doing preparatory work with EASA [European Union Aviation Safety Agency] so that in the future we can produce a 260- to 300-hp fully certified engine. Our strategy is to prepare our organization with all the necessary certification steps such as the Part 21 Design Organization Approval etc. which takes time and that will be partly funded by the revenue from the non-certified engines. We also believe that in the initial stages most eVTOLs will be operated under a Permit to Fly because the certification process is still evolving.

Marie-Claire Camin: In fact we are developing two different types of engines the turboprop and the turbogenerator. As Damien said we have the option of certifying the first under CS-E while the turbogenerator has other possible pathways. This could be certified under CS-APU or even through the recently released EASA SC E-19 that could allow us to install our non-certified engines to be incorporated with the global aircraft certification. This would be an ideal solution for us as we can gather more in-service data to help the transition from non-certified to certified engines even more so because both our turboprops and turbogenerators share the same core components.

Alex Scerri: Being in Europe your main certification authority is EASA. What is your action plan with the FAA [U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]?

Damien Fauvet: In general the FAA recognizes EASA certification and vice versa. Of course we will work with the U.S. aviation authorities wherever necessary because for sure Turbotech is a worldwide project.

Alex Scerri: One of the advantages that you state is that your engines have is multi-fuel capability including Jet-A1 diesel avgas and biofuel. Will hydrogen be also one of the possible sources of energy?

Damien Fauvet: We want to use cryogenic hydrogen rather than high-pressure hydrogen. You can store four to five times more energy with cryogenic hydrogen when you factor in the weight of the storage system. Our two engine types share a common yet quite innovative spray fuel injection system so practically any liquid fuel can be used without power loss. Naturally there will be a change in the rate of fuel consumption linked to the calorific value of the specific source. Our main work in this subject is to fine-tune the fuel injection system to make it compatible with hydrogen and [we] are targeting to have a working demonstrator by the end of next year.

Alex Scerri: A hybrid system could give you the flexibility of using a less energy dense [battery] cell but which then could have other advantages such as a safer chemistry better cycle life and a longer service history that would be helpful in certification. What are your thoughts?

Damien Fauvet: In aviation we always need to balance several factors. If you only focus on a single parameter you will not be successful. For aviation-standard batteries we have several parameters. The main one is of course safety. Secondly it must be cost-effective. It is easy to spend a million euros in a prototype battery pack but you will not be able to commercialize this.

Besides energy density you must also look at power density as even a four- to five-seater eVTOL aircraft will need 400 to 500 kW during take-off and landing where the battery will be at the end of its discharge cycle. In a pure electric VTOL you will be demanding a lot of power from a large heavy battery and possibly having deep discharge cycles which are detrimental to battery life. A hybrid system would mitigate this and allow a much longer life. There are some overly optimistic energy density predictions that are being published but we know that market leaders forecast that we are decades away from a significant technology step at the battery level.

Alex Scerri: What are the latest fuel consumption figures you are seeing in your development for Jet A1?

Damien Fauvet: Efficiency is slightly better than expected. For the TG-R55 model at cruise power we expect a 15- to 22-liter per hour consumption of Jet A1 comparable to a mainstream reciprocating engine. For the TG-R90 also at cruise power i.e. between 60 and 70 kW produced we will have 20- to 22-l/hr consumption of Jet A1 for one-third of the weight of a reciprocating engine.

Alex Scerri: What is the estimated cost of the TG-R55 and the TG-R90 range extenders?

Marie-Claire Camin: The price for a TG-R55 will be will be around 80000 euros and the TG-R90 will be in the region of 140000 euros. This includes the engine the generator the generator controller and the FADEC [full authority digital engine control].

For the first integration there is a one-time 60000-euro fee. Each hybrid architecture is unique and we need to provide an extensive integration support study. Some of the new eVTOL manufacturers are new to the aviation business and we will be there to provide the necessary support for all the ancillary systems related to the hybrid unit.Our total cost will be comparable to reciprocating engines powering a generator.

Damien Fauvet: While the cost will be about the same our solution is more than 60% lighter and does not need the complex cooling system of the reciprocating engine so that is where we see our advantage.

Alex Scerri: Do you have orders or letters of intent already?

Damien Fauvet: We are working with about 10 companies at different stages of collaboration. With some we are still in the study phase while with others we have firm delivery dates with the aircraft flying next year.

Marie-Claire Camin: What we are seeing today is that many eVTOL companies are starting out as pure electric projects. However when they start flying the prototype or a demonstrator they start to see the range and endurance that they achieve in a real-world application. This is the point where some of them are coming to us as a second step in their development process as they need to show a commercially feasible range.

Damien Fauvet: The full electric architecture is simpler and many components are found as COTS [commercial-off-the-shelf]. But we believe that few are achieving usable flight times with a practical payload with this approach. Another big factor on cost will be the battery life as operators cannot afford to change battery packs every few hundred flights. Although many eVTOL projects are still publicly stating that they are committed to a full electric solution we are sure that there is a lot of work in the background where we will see a wider user of hybrid solutions.

Alex Scerri: If I order an engine now when can I have it delivered?

Marie-Claire Camin: At the moment we can provide you a pre-series engine within about eight months which you can use for prototype testing and system integration. Of course when the first series engines come off the line we would exchange your pre-series engine with one of these. Once we are in full production we expect a lead time of around six months from order to delivery and this should be starting sometime next year.

Alex Scerri: How do you see the market for turbogenerators developing in relation to eVTOLs?

Damien Fauvet: I think initially we will have a stronger demand for the turboprop version for conventional aircraft. As for the turbogenerators destined for the eVTOL market the next two to three years will see a gradual ramp up as airframers continue to develop their aircraft. However we anticipate an uptick in demand in about five years for this type of hybrid solution. At that point we can see a requirement of about 200 to 300 turbogenerators per year which would be in line with our expectations. As the market develops further towards the end of the decade we can potentially see a surge in the required number of units.

Marie-Claire Camin: As of today our facility has the potential to produce 500 engines per year so we will be well positioned to meet this demand. If we need to do more than that we have the flexibility to increase this and we also have a lot of support from Region Île-de-France.

Alex Scerri: Hybrid applications will need batteries and other ancillary components. Will you supply this integrated solution by yourself or a preferred partner?

Damien Fauvet: We are speaking with several partners. Turbotech will not be a battery manufacturer and our core business will remain as engine manufacturers. However we will still be able to offer a complete hybrid solution to eVTOL airframers with partners that are specialized in this field.

Alex Scerri: You describe the engine as ultraquiet. Can you give us some quantitative description of this?

Damien Fauvet: Our engine is quieter than most piston engines. We measured a noise level of 68 dB at 10 meters from a bare engine without any cover/nacelle etc. so the engine will be very low-noise.

Alex Scerri: Marie-Claire and Damien thank you for your time and we will be looking forward to following the progress of these engines in the eVTOL space.

A bowl of saimin — a dish of noodles broth and spam — warms him up after wading in the cool waters. Sometimes it’s sugary malasada known as Portueguese donuts that comfort him and other times it’s a local soup of stew. Care simplicity and warmth bring comfort to the chef’s life but like many in his Hawaii’an community it’s not only about the food.

“All of this [food] is all comfort to me but the biggest comfort is when you’re sharing it surrounded by your family and your loved ones” Simeon told me this spring.

Simeon became a household name as he competed on Season 10 of Bravo’s “Top Chef.” A fan favorite and competition finalist Simeon has gone on to open award-winning restaurants LINEAGE and Tin Roof. His new cookbook “Cook Real Hawai’i” tells a myriad of stories about history family and community through Hawai’ian food.

“We wanted to put the word ‘real’ in it to really capture people’s attention about the depth of our culture” Simeon said. “We’re much more than pineapples on pizza or shredded pig in the cooked underground oven at a luau. We are this culture that is based in diversity.”

Born and raised in Hilo Hawai’i the third-generation Filipino-American uses “Cook Real Hawai’i” as a vivid opportunity to share the diversity and rich history of Hawai’ian cuisine. An immigrant-heavy tropical oasis Filipino Japanese and Portuguese culinary traditions heavily influence Hawai’ian culture and food which is also deeply rooted in indigenous Hawai’ian ingredients and cooking practices.

Sheldon who is of Filipino heritage communicates this incredible diversity through recipes like spam musubi garden poke loco moco gravy rice and chicken liver mousse. These dishes — and so many others in the book — help tell the story of a state that’s often been showcased through aimless travelogues stereotypical movies and the stories of non-Hawaiian tourists.

“What I hope that we did with this cookbook is that we’ll make people dive in deeper and see that we’re a lot more than just what you can experience at a resort” Simeon said. “Talk to the workers and talk to the people from the community who are at these resorts and you’ll find that it’s amazing and you can go into real depth and almost a grittiness of our history of Hawai’i through its food.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

What's Next for Host Hotels?

While Host Hotels has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for Host Hotels was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.19 on $867.21 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.45 on $2.73 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Additional detail on the Company’s results including data for 22 domestic markets is available in the First Quarter 2024 Supplemental Financial Information on the Company’s website at www.hosthotels.com.



James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

The Company maintains a robust balance sheet and completed several transactions in March and April of 2024. These transactions include:

Net draws of $215 million on the revolving credit facility (including a $300 million draw in March as well as a $65 million draw and $150 million repayment subsequent to quarter end).

The aforementioned $530 million acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown.

The following are the results for transient group and contract business in comparison to 2023 performance for the Company's current portfolio:

Quarter ended March 31 2024 Transient Group Contract Room nights (in thousands) 1314 1103 172 Percent change in room nights vs. same period in 2023 (1.9 %) 4.1 % 7.5 % Rooms revenues (in millions) $ 456 $ 324 $ 35 Percent change in revenues vs. same period in 2023 (4.7 %) 5.3 % 18.2 %

This spend is separate from payments for capital expenditures which are considered investing activities.



Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

_______________

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

(1) See ""Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and Diluted Earnings per Common Share to NAREIT and Adjusted Funds From Operations per Diluted Share for Full Year 2024 Forecasts"" for other forecast assumptions. Forecast comparable hotel results include 75 hotels (of our 77 hotels owned at March 31 2024) that we have assumed will be classified as comparable as of December 31 2024. As noted in the forecast assumptions above forecast results for the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024 are not yet included but are expected to be part of our comparable hotel results for full year.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

HP Inc Salesforce and VMware are using partner programs in different ways to drive sustainability messaging to channel partners.

Sustainability is a collective effort and partnerships are vital for the circular economy

Sustainability awareness continues to grow worldwide amid strong media advocacy and pressure from governments and businesses. And major technology vendors are taking on a more active role in sustainability efforts as part of their global corporate citizenship and leadership efforts. Many have set ambitious sustainability targets for 2030 which often put significant pressure on suppliers and employees to make positive changes across their global supply chains including the use sustainable raw materials or renewable energy incorporating sustainability into product and building designs early and participating in the circular economy to reduce electronic waste. Some vendors have gone further to help channel partners achieve their sustainability goals. As vendors step up sustainability efforts this report looks at how three vendors – HP Inc Salesforce and VMware – are using partner programs to raise awareness and collaborate with channel partners to drive sustainability.

Benefits of participating in sustainability

Vendors and channel partners have much to gain by practicing sustainability. As the younger generation becomes more socially conscious and seeks jobs with purpose being sustainable makes companies more appealing. As governments corporations and consumers prioritize sustainability and put pressure on businesses to disclose climate-related standards and statements those that prioritize sustainability will find more commercial opportunities available to them. Accenture and Wipro for example have seen opportunities in sustainability and set up dedicated practices to capture the growth opportunities. UK partner Stone Group just announced a partnership with Ingram Micro to offer IT asset disposal services in France Germany Holland and Spain. When assessing businesses for mergers and acquisitions investors also consider sustainability as a factor taking account of climate risk and operational financial and manpower issues among other things when evaluating long-term prospects.

Technology is a wonderful enabler and data analytics artificial intelligence and machine learning are helping local communities track pollution levels reduce carbon emissions and increase recycling for example. While technology is empowering we need to address the increased use of electricity plastics and metals needed for the ever-growing number of data centers devices and networks and reduce the use of natural resources that power our daily lives. Organizations must ensure they go beyond paying lip service and make genuine efforts to find more efficient ways to use energy and cut natural resource use be involved in circular economies and find other means to foster sustainable growth.

A closer look: HP Inc Salesforce and VMware

HP Inc Salesforce and VMware are three vendors using partner programs to raise awareness and grow sustainability efforts with channel partners for the long term. This shows that sustainability practices are applicable to organizations regardless of partner type. While HP Inc and Salesforce have taken more

altruistic approaches VMware is currently more sales opportunity-driven recognizing sustainability-focused partners as a competitive differentiator. With its HP Amplify Impact program HP Inc offers the most comprehensive packaged program around sustainability currently available to channel partners.

HP’s Amplify Impact Partner Program was rolled out in early 2021 across a small number of countries but HP Inc plans to roll it to at least half of its HP Amplify partners by 2025. The program consists of many resources that partners can benefit from to improve their sustainability practices. For example training in sustainability fundamentals and sales is available to everyone (with digital badges). Partners can also access sales and marketing resources via its HP Sustainability and Compliance Center and HP Inc also directly links partners to its HP Life and HP Planet Partner Programs which are a free online upskilling program for individuals and a return and recycling program for end-of-life HP products respectively. Program participation is voluntary but more than a thousand partners have got on board. Besides the ""Planet"" pillar of the program HP Amplify Impact also aims to drive accountability across its channel ecosystem in its “People” (diverse and inclusive workforces) and “Community” (bridging the digital divide in communities) pillars as well. For partners’ participation in Amplify Impact they are also awarded annual awards and certifications. HP Amplify Impact is offered at two partner levels and both require partners to commit to an HP Amplify Impact Pledge: Catalyst is for partners more advanced in sustainability practices. HP Inc offers personalized sustainability assessments for partners to identify technical aspects and requirements around sustainability. In return partners must report sales opportunities influenced by sustainability for HP Inc’s measurement. Changemaker is for partners starting out on building sustainability plans. Besides training for its workforce and receiving benefits at the Catalyst level HP Inc also works with partners to create a plan and implement at least two initiatives around sustainability

For partners’ participation in Amplify Impact they are also awarded annual awards and certifications. HP Amplify Impact is offered at two partner levels and both require partners to commit to an HP Amplify Impact Pledge: Salesforce has purposefully added “Lead” (consisting of “Equality” and “Sustainable Development”) as the fourth pillar in both its global Consulting and AppExchange partner programs in fiscal 2022. It has taken a wider interpretation of “sustainability” by adopting the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals. While all 17 goals are important and interconnected Salesforce is currently most focused on eight of them for its strategy: Quality Education Gender Equality Affordable and Clean Energy Decent Work and Economic Growth Reduced Inequalities Climate Actions Life on Land and Partnerships for the Goals. For partners’ participation in “Sustainable Development” they earn up to 50 points that go toward annual partner program renewal when they are involved in two of three ways

– monetary donation voluntary time and corporate policy (such as environmental action commitment and supplier code of conduct). “Equality” focuses on diversity and inclusion in partners’ workforces and has a maximum achievable score of 125 points. By introducing the “Lead” pillar Salesforce can better understand the impact its partners are having and grow together as a community.

By introducing the “Lead” pillar Salesforce can better understand the impact its partners are having and grow together as a community. With the VMware Zero Carbon Committed Initiative VMware is the latest vendor to announce a sustainability play involving cloud provider partners. It is part of a longer-term plan in which the vendor hopes to educate cloud providers and their customers about the importance of sustainable

cloud operations as well as develop programs to help cloud providers launch renewable energy initiatives. Currently the Zero Carbon Committed Initiative is built around helping customers identify

those cloud providers that have aligned sustainability and decarbonization goals. To participate in the initiative cloud providers must achieve the “Cloud Verified” status with at least one Cloud Verified data center and they must have made a public commitment on their websites to use 100% renewable energy or have a net-zero carbon goal by 2030 (or over 50% renewable energy by 2025) that covers data center operations including VMware cloud data centers. Cloud providers must also achieve at least 15% of these goals by the end of 2021. This percentage will rise linearly each year to 100% by 2030. To date five partners are part of this initiative – Atea Equinix IBM Microsoft and OVHcloud.

Other vendors are also starting to develop sustainability messaging for channel partners as well. For example Cisco has recently invited partners to submit sustainability ideas while HPE recently achieved TCO certification (global certification body for sustainable IT products) for its HPE ProLiant XL 170r Gen 10 and XL225n Gen10 Plus servers. Together the partner ecosystem is a remarkable community that can make a significant contribution to global sustainability. In this spirit HPE Microsoft and Facebook have pledged to make freely available to anyone patents related to technologies around low-carbon innovations including the generation storage and distribution of low-carbon energy (www.lowcarbonpatentpledge.org). Others such as Fujitsu Google Cloud and Microsoft are collaborating with partners such as Siemens Digital and NTT to conduct research and development of sustainability technologies with special highlights on their websites for sustainability partners and solutions.

Sustainability is a collective effort

Vendors that are looking to drive sustainability through their channel partners are encouraged to do so. Partner programs offer vendors a way to drive consistent messaging worldwide demonstrate global commitment integrate sustainability practices into existing channel activities and centralize an understanding of partners’ impact while recognizing them for their contributions. Education is vital for growing sustainability awareness and capabilities while sales and marketing materials products and processes certified around sustainability support partners’ businesses that are specifically built for those opportunities. Recycling and refurbishing partners are becoming more important in the wake of circular economies. HP Inc Salesforce and VMware have each approached sustainability with partners differently using partner programs but their participation in the discourse has allowed them to show leadership within their communities. Sustainability requires a collective effort and such efforts should be viewed as a collaboration rather than a competition. The channel ecosystem can collectively help to faster achieve global goals around carbon neutrality 100% renewable energy and more. While vendors can offer the education and support channel partners need to enable sustainable practices the onus is on organizations and individuals themselves to adopt green practices.

HP Envy 13 (Intel 11th-Gen),"Apple MacBook Air (M1) Vs. HP Envy 13 (Intel 11th-Gen) The CRN Test Center compares Apple’s M1-powered MacBook Air with the latest version of HP’s Envy 13 offering 11th-gen Intel Core processors and a 4K display option.

MacBook Air Vs HP Envy 13 When it comes to finding a laptop that offers top specs for a relatively affordable price two come immediately to mind: Apple’s new MacBook Air with the M1 chip and HP’s latest Envy 13. Both laptops offer speedy performance vivid display quality long battery life and an overall eye-pleasing design. But there are also some big differences between the M1 MacBook Air and the Envy 13. While HP’s use of Intel Core processors in the Envy 13 provides strong performance Apple’s new M1 processor does offer a speed advantage for the latest MacBook Air—both for CPU and GPU/graphics performance. On the other hand the HP Envy 13 has some features you won’t find with the M1 MacBook Air including additional display options such as a touch screen and a 4K display. (And for some buyers getting a Windows 10 laptop over a notebook running the macOS operating system might be an advantage on its own.) If your laptop buying decision has come down to a MacBook Air vs Envy 13 comparison which of the two laptops is a better fit for you? What follows is our comparison of Apple’s MacBook Air (M1) vs HP’s Envy 13 on specs and price. Display When it comes to the display the MacBook Air and Envy 13 have an identical amount of screen space to offer at 13.3 inches. Apple’s use of its vibrant Retina display technology on the new MacBook Air means that you aren’t likely to have many complaints about image quality. But as mentioned HP’s Envy 13 has some display options that aren’t available on Apple’s MacBook Air with M1. The Envy 13 offers three different display variations that come with FHD (1920 x 1080) resolution. Those consist of a non-touch display; a touch screen option; and a non-touch display with an integrated Sure View privacy screen (to prevent snooping). There’s also a fourth top-of-the-line display option which offers stunning 4K resolution (3840 x 2160) as well as a touch screen. The M1 MacBook Air does not go nearly that high on resolution—it features resolution of 2560 x 1600. And like all other Macs to date the notebook does not have a touch screen option.

Portability and Design Speaking of the display HP does have one other display-related advantage. The laptop has been designed to have very slim bezels around the screen—resulting in a screen-to-body ratio of 88 percent according to HP. Along with aesthetics that design choice also helps to enable a compact size all-around for the latest Envy 13. HP has said the laptop is actually closer to the size of an 11-inch laptop rather than a 13-inch laptop. The MacBook Air continues to feature thicker bezels around the display and the screen-to-body ratio for the notebook has been reported at 69.5 percent. Still even with the small overall size of the HP Envy 13 the MacBook Air is thinner and lighter—though not by a very noticeable amount. The MacBook Air measures 0.63 of an inch thick and weighs 2.8 pounds while the Envy 13 measures 0.67 of an inch thick and weighs 2.88 pounds. In terms of materials both notebooks are made from aluminum. The MacBook Air is available in three colors—gold silver or space gray—while the Envy 13 is available in silver or gold.

Processor and RAM The latest MacBook Air is one of the first Macs to feature Apple’s high-performance Arm-based M1 processor. For the MacBook Air there are two options for the M1—a version that has a seven-core GPU or a variant with an eight-core GPU. Both versions have an eight-core CPU with four cores focused on demanding tasks and four cores that enable battery efficiency for less-intensive tasks. HP’s latest Envy 13 comes equipped with 11th-gen Intel Core processors. Choices include the 11th-gen Core i5 and i7 both of which have four cores. The top-level configuration comes with the Core i7-1165G7. Benchmark scores point to a performance advantage for the MacBook Air with M1 even when it’s facing off with the top-tier Envy 13. Geekbench 5 scores for Intel’s Core i7-1165G7 and Apple’s M1 show the M1 coming out ahead in both single-core and multi-core tests. The M1’s speed advantage should be most obvious on more-demanding multi-core tasks according to the Geekbench 5 results. On GPU while the Envy 13 does have an option for discrete graphics the M1 still has a GPU speed advantage across reported benchmark tests. Standard configurations of the Envy 13 come with Intel Iris Xe graphics but HP also offers configurations featuring the Nvidia GeForce MX450 with 2 GB of graphics memory. Benchmarks from GFXBench 4.0 show the M1 still beats the GeForce MX450 across a number of different tests of graphics performance. On RAM both notebooks offer options for 8 GB or 16 GB of RAM.

Battery Life Storage and Ports Thanks to the high-efficiency cores on the M1 chip the MacBook Air does promise an advantage on battery life. Apple promises 18 hours of battery life on the M1-powered MacBook Air—the longest battery life ever offered for a MacBook Air model. And notably the M1-powered MacBook Air does not have a fan. HP promises five hours less of battery life up to 13 hours for the latest Envy 13. On storage the MacBook Air with M1 and Envy 13 both offer options for 256 GB 512 GB or 1 TB of storage. However the MacBook Air also offers one additional storage configuration for a massive 2 TB of storage. One area where the Envy 13 stands out is on ports options. The notebook offers one Thunderbolt / USB-C port and two USB-A ports (which feature a drop-jaw design due to the thin form factor of the laptop). The laptop’s USB-A ports also offer a speedy 5Gbps signaling rate while the Envy 13 comes with a microSD card reader as well. The M1 MacBook Air on the other hand only includes two ports—and both are USB-C / Thunderbolt.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy90d2luLXR1cmJvLWxhbWJvcmdoaW5pLWF2ZW50YWRvci1zdmotaXMtYS0yMDAwLWhwLWV4b3RpYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Twin-Turbo Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Is A 2000-HP Exotic,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy90d2luLXR1cmJvLWxhbWJvcmdoaW5pLWF2ZW50YWRvci1zdmotaXMtYS0yMDAwLWhwLWV4b3RpYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Ranked ninth in the world Vergé-Dépré and Heidrich were in control for much of the match in the Czech Republic surrendering the lead for only a brief period in each set for their first win in five attempts against the Canadian duo.

They will play for a gold medal at the 4-star event on Sunday against the winner of the other semifinal between Sarah Sponcil and Kelly Claes of the United States and Brazil's Barbara Seixas de Freitas and Carolina Solbert Salgado. The loser faces world No. 1 Pavan and Humana-Paredes in the bronze match.

Earlier Saturday the Canadians defeated Netherlands duo Katja Stam and Raïsa Schoon in a thrilling three-set quarter-final (21-16 20-22 15-13).

But it was Vergé-Dépré and Heidrich coming off a 2-0 default victory over world No. 2 April Ross and Alix Klinemen to reach the quarter-finals who did a better job of building on momentum in the semis.

The Swiss tandem built a 3-0 advantage in the opening set against Pavan and Humana-Paredes who battled back to tie the game twice at 7-7 and 9-9 before taking the lead 10-9 on a Pavan kill.

HII,Huntington Ingalls Industries,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvY29taW5nLTIwMjgtdXMtbmF2eXMtbW9zdC1wb3dlci1haXJjcmFmdC1jYXJyaWVyLWV2ZXItMTg2OTE10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coming in 2028: The U.S. Navy's Most Power Aircraft Carrier (Ever),"Here's What You Need to Know: The Enterprise is part of a Navy “two-carrier” buy plan designed by the Navy to lower production costs and streamline technological integration.

Progressing quietly beneath the ongoing discussion about just what the future may hold for America’s aircraft carriers the Navy’s third Ford-class carrier is powering along toward being ready for duty.

While there is naturally much focus upon the first-in-class USS Ford which is nearing its first deployment as well as the second-in-class USS Kennedy the new USS Enterprise (CVN 80) is slated for delivery by as soon as 2028. Construction on the ship began in 2017 and builders are now performing early manufacturing and structural fabrication Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) Vice President of New Construction Aircraft Carriers Lucas Hicks told The National Interest in a written statement.

Most of the technologies are expected to be quite similar to the first two Ford-class carriers yet they will likely integrate more quickly given that the Navy has had practice with the Kennedy and Ford. There are also new shipbuilding methods which have been progressing throughout the trajectory of Ford-class development according to Hicks who said HII is incorporating a number of lessons learned from building the Ford and Kennedy. The “build strategy” improvements he said including more outfitted superlifts described at larger and more complete than on prior carriers.

“It will be the first aircraft carrier built completely using digital drawings and procedures rather than traditional paper work packages and products. The use of digital data and digital tools is more user-friendly and intuitive making the execution of shipbuilders’ work more efficient” Hicks explained.

Some of these construction innovations have already been underway with the USS Kennedy the second Ford carrier slated to hit the ocean in the next few years. It involves a process Newport News Shipbuilders a division of HII describe as “modular construction” wherein ship compartments are assembled together before moving them to the dock to expedite the building process. Smaller segments of the ship are welded together into a structural “superlift” as Hicks described with the Enterprise to advance construction before the ship is lifted up into drydock.

Construction begins with the bottom of the ship and works up with inner-bottoms and side shells before moving to box units. The bottom third of the ship gets built first. Also some of the design methods now used for the Kennedy include efforts to fabricate or forge some parts of the ship—instead of casting them because it makes the process less expensive builders explained.

HII is working to take some of these newer methods to a new level with the Enterprise a process which is in large measure being assisted or improved through the use of digital modeling. The Enterprise’s keel is slated to be laid in 2022 HII reports.

The Enterprise is part of a Navy “two-carrier” buy plan designed by the Navy to lower production costs and streamline technological integration. The fourth Ford-class carrier called CVN 81 is already progressing through several key planning and preparation phases.

Capt. David Hart is assigned as the Major Program Manager and Katherine Connelly as the Deputy Program Manager. DDG(X) leadership is tasked with developing an acquisition strategy a design/technical data package and ship construction testing fleet introduction and sustainment plans.

“The Guided Missile Destroyer will provide the flexibility and margins necessary to succeed the DDG-51 class as the Navy’s next enduring large surface combatant combining the DDG 51 FLT III combat systems elements with a new hull form an efficient Integrated Power System and greater endurance reducing the fleet logistics burden” the navy said in a release.

The establishment of the program office is the latest in a series of attempts over the last years to establish a path forward for the replacement of the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruisers and Arleigh Burke guided-missile destroyers.

As announced by the service DDG(X) is expected to pair the Aegis combat system with the integrated electric propulsion system first introduced for the Zumwalt-class destroyers.

The service is already undertaking conceptual designs in cooperation with Huntington Ingalls Industries and General Dynamics Bath Iron Works the two yards building the Arleigh Burke- and Zumwalt-class destroyers.

This collaboration will continue into fiscal year 2022 with the start of Preliminary Design. A Detail Design is scheduled for fiscal year 2026 while the start of construction is expected in fiscal year 2028.",,,,,,,,,

While millions of users love to watch or post videos of themselves dancing and singing many have been turning to the platform for career advice. The pandemic-disrupted job market has made landing employment more difficult for recent college graduates who are getting leads and information wherever they can get it.

And what better place than the platform that's taken the social media world by storm?

“COVID took away our graduation” TikTok career content creator Julian Parra told Yahoo Finance in an interview. With some companies going as far as rescinding job offers made to members of the class of 2020 Parra noted that “the pandemic affected a lot of my friends’ jobs.”

The 22-year old was fortunate enough to have a job lined up while he was still a senior at Babson College last year. His position as an offering manager for IBM’s enterprise performance management team would officially start about two months after graduation.

But with plenty of free time on his hands Parra took to TikTok to start sharing with his peers what he knew about landing a job.

Parra had spent three years working at Babson’s Center for Career Development as a student so the subject matter came naturally to him. He found creative ways to present that information to TikTok users in a matter of seconds by for instance playing both the role of the interviewer and the interviewee in the interview process in TikTok videos he posted.

“I always approach my piece of content in the same way” Parra explained.

“So in the first few seconds I’ll tell viewers exactly what they’re going to learn…and then in the rest of the video I’ll highlight the most important most relevant most valuable key takeaways tips and tricks that have helped me personally as well as people I’ve mentored land jobs and interviews and things of that nature” he added.

According to TikTok Gen Z users are liking Parra’s career content. His account “@youknowitjulian” has garnered at least 204.8K followers and 2.6M likes.

'TikTok is their lifeblood'

TikTok user Christina Busa 21 watches career tip videos on the platform. She enjoys the medium because she finds “a lot of information on financial advice and finance careers because that’s the field I’m going into after college hopefully” Busa told Yahoo Finance.

“I would say that for the most part the videos come from I think millennials or very ‘old’ GenZers who have gone through the process of recruiting or also have tips on how to succeed from their personal experience” she added.

Story continues

Busa recently completed an internship at Influence Central an influencer marketing agency based in Boston MA. She cites TikToks by Parra as well as “SelfMadeMillenial” and “TheFemaleLead” as among her favorites.

Stacy DeBroff founder and CEO of Influence Central and Busa’s ex-boss gladly relies on TikTok expertise for clients’ brand campaigns on the platform.

“We have a number of amazing Gen Z interns but TikTok is their lifeblood. They are obsessed about the platform” she told Yahoo Finance.

“They keep up to speed with what’s happening and they spend hours a day absorbing information” said DeBroff. “So anytime we have a TikTok related campaign they are all over it. They love it. So they’re the resident experts on TikTok. Seriously they advise us.”

Still the platform can be “a double edged sword” according to Busa which comes with plenty of downsides along with useful information.

“Like everything else in life nothing is going to be/work the same for two people. So I usually take TikTok advice and always try to do my own research” she said while warning about disappointment and loss of motivation.

“I think that’s one downside of the app it makes all information readily available but it oversimplifies it and that can be disappointing dangerous and even demotivating” Busa added.

Yet Parra said he’s not concerned that oversimplified career advice on the platform in general might have a negative impact. He says younger users find it “easier to relate” to others in their age group who have similar ambitions.

Gen Z “may be better suited to speak to utilizing emerging technologies or updated resources that have helped them in their careers” Parra added.

In Kristina LeBlanc’s insightful Atos blog post When will quantum computing become a mainstream reality? she lays bare her employer’s attitude towards quantum technology and where it’s heading. And though the post is mainly sobering and a disappointment for those who think we’ll have quantum laptops by 2025 her visions of collaborations involving the major players and startups — as well as organizations spread over various sectors that “will jumpstart their quantum development efforts” — is cause for celebration.

Because for quantum technologies to really develop and benefit society we need more than just the Googles and IBMs of this world to build the hardware and the hundreds of startups that feed off them by developing software or ancillary services (that includes TDQ) to complete the ecosystems.

We need multinationals in banking energy and countless other sectors to join the club too. For it will be then that quantum will have surely arrived.

As usual with these posts we will now go through some of the big players dipping their toes in the icy waters of quantum computing (QC) and general quantum tech. Not exhaustive as always there are some unfamiliar names next to those who are in fact household ones.

Enjoy!

1. Airbus

Airbus SE is a European company that provides aerospace products services and solutions internationally. Airbus’s registered headquarters is in Leiden Netherlands but its main civil aeroplane business is conducted through the French company Airbus S.A.S. based in Blagnac a suburb of Toulouse France.

As far as its venture into quantum technology goes Airbus realizes that complicated computational needs in the areas of fluid dynamics finite-element simulations aerodynamics flight mechanics etc will require technologies like QC.

Additionally research into quantum sensors — effective at measuring physical quantities such as frequency acceleration rotation rates electric and magnetic fields and temperature with the highest relative and absolute accuracy — will surely come in useful to the company in the future to improve upon already existing technologies.

Its Quantum Technology Application Centre — in collaboration with Endeavr — was established to explore space aerospace and defence applications with external partners. The Airbus Quantum Computing Challenge too — an initiative that is “building bridges to academia and start-ups by enabling participants to work on real industrial cases across a variety of aerospace challenges” — has to be an indicator the company is serious about quantum technologies’ future trajectory.

As far as academic partnerships go Airbus has an ongoing relationship with the University of Bristol in regard to the joint Quantum Technology Innovation Centre they both have an interest in.

2. AT&T

AT&T Inc. provides telecommunication media and technology services worldwide. A US-based concern AT&T giant is researching technology in the QC space though well aware its influence won’t change the world tomorrow but rather in the long term.

Working through a partnership called Intelligent Quantum Networks and Technologies (INQNET) the initiative involves researchers from the California Institute of Technology Stanford University national laboratories startups the military and other institutions bringing about advances in quantum networking that could benefit all parties on board.

3. Atos

Atos provides hi-tech transactional services unified communications cloud big data and cybersecurity services. Based in France the company welcomed the French government’s National Strategy on Quantum Technologies earlier this year and is one of the leading participants in it.

Working in close collaboration with national players such as CSC — IT Center for Science IQM GENCI (Grand Equipement National de Calcul) and the CEA (Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique) along with smaller players like QC startup Pasqal Atos is at the forefront of research in the space in France and the wider world.

Atos’ QLM as well — arguably the world’s most powerful quantum simulator — proves how far the company has come.

4. AXA

Another French company Axa provides global insurance investment management and other financial services. Back in 2015 AXA Research Fund awarded to ICFO-The Institute of Photonic Sciences EUR 1.7 million to launch its Chair on Quantum Cryptography bringing AXA’s support to science in Spain to approximately EUR 10 million

ICFO-The Institute of Photonic Sciences’ aim is to conduct research on developing and implementing encryption systems based on quantum devices. The ultimate goal is to attain one-hundred percent secure data communications

5. Singapore Central Bank

Back in April 2020 London-based Tradeteq received funding from the Singapore Central Bank on a project to develop quantum computing-based credit scoring methods for companies.

The initial research was conducted in collaboration with Singapore Management University (SMU) supported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore under the Financial Sector Technology & Innovation (FSTI) — Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Grant Scheme.

6. BASF

BASF SE is a multinational chemical company founded in Germany and the largest chemical producer in the world.

Through its venture capital wing BASF Venture Capital BASF took part in a Series A investment round in the Boston-based QC startup Zapata Computing back in 2019. The round was led by Comcast Ventures Pitango and Prelude Ventures. The investment was according to Markus Solibieda Managing Director of BASF Venture Capital “to allow real quantum computing applications and build capabilities to help us compete in the quantum era.”

7. BBVA

Spain’s BBVA is a multinational financial services company that is now investigating with six lines of research the pros of using QC in the financial sector. Beginning in the summer of 2020 and in cooperation with Spain’s Senior Council for Scientific Research (CSIC) Accenture Fujitsu Zapata Computing and Multiverse BBVA hopes to explore whether or not quantum technologies can somehow create an advantage over more traditional technology in various financial use cases.

Carlos Kuchkovky BBVA’s global head of research and patents put the collaboration this way:

“Although this technology is still in an early stage of development its potential to impact the sector is already a reality. Our research is helping us identify the areas where quantum computing could represent a greater competitive advantage once the tools have sufficiently matured. We believe this will be for certain concrete tasks in the next two to five years.”

8. BT

BT Group plc is a British multinational telecommunications holding company. In 2020 BT began a collaboration with several UK-based quantum tech start-ups including Nu-Quantum Duality Quantum Photonics and Arqit to trial the world’s most secure fixed-mobile network infrastructure for 5G and connected cars.

The AIRQKD trial — which will run for 36 months and funded with £7.7 million by the Quantum Technologies Challenge led by UK Research and Innovation — is a combination of BT’s global expertise in building quantum-secure networks using QKD (Quantum Key Distribution with novel techniques for applying quantum security to mobile devices that the startups mentioned are currently doing.

9. DEWA

The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) is a public service infrastructure company based in the oil-rich UAE and began in early 2020 organizing training sessions on quantum computing in partnership with Canada’s D-Wave Systems.

“We are keen on benefiting from the huge potential of quantum computing in improving energy efficiency reducing consumption and enhancing Dubai’s infrastructure” said Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer MD and CEO of DEWA.

“Through Digital DEWA the digital arm of DEWA we redefine the concept of utilities to create a new digital future for Dubai. DEWA will disrupt the entire business of public utilities by becoming the world’s first digital utility to use autonomous systems for renewable energy and storage and expand the use of AI and providing digital services. This is part of the Dubai 10X initiative which propels Dubai into the future and makes it 10 years ahead of other cities. DEWA organizes workshops for its employees to learn about the latest quantum computing technologies and gain knowledge and skills in this field. It also enables them to develop instant solutions using quantum computing in improving energy efficiency and reducing consumption amongst other challenges that cannot be resolved with ordinary computers.”

10. Ericsson

Once a powerhouse of mobile phones Sweden’s Ericsson is a multinational networking and telecommunications company. Its R&D wing Ericsson Research has identified several potential use cases QC could have in the telecommunications industry:

Physical layer processing of the user data plane in the RAN (quantum Fourier transform and quantum linear solver)

Clustering for automatic anomaly detection in network design optimization project (quantum K-means algorithm)

Prediction of the quality of user experience for video streaming based on device and network-level metrics (quantum support vector machine)

Database search at the data management layer (Grover’s algorithm)

To date however little is known of any active collaborations ongoing with startups or larger stakeholders in the QC sector.

11. European Space Agency (ESA)

With headquarters in France the European Space Agency is an intergovernmental organization of 22 member states dedicated to the exploration of space. Whilst the Agency realizes that quantum computers are still in their infancy it has launched a “call for ideas” seeking applications of this novel technology to the space sector.

“Quantum computing technology shows a lot of promise and industry and academia are developing it further” said ESA’s Hamish Beck a Young Graduate Trainee for Quantum Algorithms at the ESA. “But we are lacking concrete concepts for applying quantum computing to real-world problems.”

Along with this initiative the ESA’s Partnership Project with Eutelsat Airbus and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd — set up to its Quantum mission to prepare “the way for the next generation of telecommunications satellites. With a planned launch date of 2021 the lifetime of the satellite is a projected 15 years.

12. Goldman Sachs

The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company. Having assembled a “full team dedicated to quantum computing” its venture into quantum has so far meant research work with IBM on Monte Carlo modelling and simulation along with a collaboration with startup QC Ware.

William Zeng head of quantum research at Goldman Sachs said on the Palo Alto startup partnership: “Quantum computing could have a significant impact on financial services and our new work with QC Ware brings that future closer.”

13. GSK

GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) is a British multinational pharmaceutical company. Last year it announced the opening of a Ph.D. studentship in partnership with Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQC) and the University of Strathclyde to design and implement quantum algorithms for drug design and discovery.

Part of the joint venture will see CQC provide access to both their EUMEN and t|ket⟩™ toolkits and to state-of-the-art quantum computing platforms — enabling the explicit treatment of electronic structures observed in transition states reaction pathways and potential energy surfaces.

14. Hitachi Ltd

Hitachi Ltd. is a Japanese multinational conglomerate company. Hitachi Europe’s research wing at the Hitachi Cambridge Laboratory focuses on both experimental and theoretical studies of spin qubits using surface states of topological insulators as well as corner states in silicon nano-FETs.

In 2019 the Hitachi Cambridge Laboratory — along with academic partners at the University of Cambridge University College London and CEA-LETI — developed and demonstrated “a hybrid electronic circuit to address a barrier to realizing a practical large-scale quantum computer known as the “I/O problem.”

15. Mastercard

Mastercard Inc is a multinational financial services corporation from the US. Earlier in the year it announced that it was applying state-of-the-art quantum-resistant technologies to develop the next generation of contactless payments.

The technology called Enhanced Contactless (Ecos) is an industry-first and has been designed to “ensure that […] its dynamic digital landscape evolves and new technologies like quantum computing are introduced contactless technology is future-proofed to ensure consumers will continue to enjoy the same high levels of security and convenience they do today in the decades to come.”

Mastercard is also a partner in the €11.1 million Quantum Computing in Ireland (QCoir) a software platform integrating multiple quantum bit technologies being developed in Ireland.

16. Merck

Merck & Co. Inc. was founded in the US and is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. In the spring of 2020 M Ventures the corporate venture arm of Merck was part of a round in QC startup Seeqc Inc. which raised more than $11 million in venture capital funding for the Elmsford NY startup. This must be a clear indicator that Merck believes quantum has potential.

“We think this technology will change the world of simulations for us if it proves to be scalable” said Philipp Harbach head of in silico research at Merck.

17. Mitsubishi Motors

Mitsubishi Motors Corporation is a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer. In 2019 scientists from IBM and Mitsubishi Chemical simulated on a quantum computer the reaction mechanism between lithium and oxygen in lithium-air (Li-air) batteries.

Before this Mitsubishi Chemical was already working on the problem using classical computing. Then they contacted IBM well aware the problem created by large chemical system required many more qubits (quantum bits) than there is room for in any of IBM’s quantum computers.

“We needed to figure out a way to actually reduce the number of qubits down to some level where we could actually use a quantum computer or quantum simulators to study the problem” said Dr. Gavin Jones an IBM Q Ambassador and a research staff member in the Quantum Applications in Chemistry and Science group at IBM Research — Almaden.

Whether something is achieved from this in the future could lead to more efficient batteries for a host of industries.

18. Novo Nordisk

The only Danish company on the list Novo Nordisk A/S is a multinational pharmaceutical company. In 2020 its Novo Nordisk Foundation awards handed over DKK 108.6 million to two new research centres developing and using quantum simulators to advance our understanding of complex biological processes and biomolecules and helping us predict how they behave.

“Quantum technologies have enormous potential in the life sciences. However realizing this potential requires an interdisciplinary approach at the highest level both in physics and mathematics and in chemistry and biology. Denmark has a historical leadership position in both quantum technologies and the life sciences so it is logical to integrate the expertise in both fields to tackle this challenge. The two projects are very ambitious and we hope that they will produce results that can be the new gold standard for knowledge that can be elucidated using quantum technologies within biology chemistry and medicine” says Lene Oddershede Senior Vice President Natural & Technical Sciences Novo Nordisk Foundation.

19. Rabobank

Rabobank is a Dutch multinational banking and financial services company and a global leader in food and agriculture financing and sustainability-oriented banking. Last year the bank announced — along with ABN Amro and ING — to jointly explore the exciting world of quantum technology.

Although it’s in its early days the bank sees an opportunity that quantum tech can offer the banking and financial sectors

20. Royal Dutch Shell

Royal Dutch Shell commonly known as Shell is a British-Dutch multinational oil and gas company. Last year the company began a collaboration with theoretical physicists and chemists of Leiden University to research how quantum computer algorithms can help simulate complex molecules.

“This is not a purely academic study we have to keep track of the potential business value of using quantum computers and how to realize it’ said Detlef Hohl Shell’s Chief Scientist for Computational and Data Science. “Today this is zero because no relevant calculation can be executed better faster or cheaper on a quantum computer than on a regular one. But this may change dramatically with time. Shell is conducting Research & Development which is preparing our business for the future. This includes developing technology that will enable Shell to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 or sooner. Shell has supported research in the Netherlands for many decades and this collaboration is another demonstration of our deep involvement in the Dutch Research and Development ecosystem.”

21. SK Telecom

When South Korean company SK Telecom Co. Ltd. a wireless telecommunications operator announced the First Smart Power Plant Secured by 5G Quantum Cryptography in partnership with ID Quantique (IDQ) last summer it was a statement that SK Telecom believes quantum technologies by way of utilizing quantum random number generation (QRNG) and quantum key distribution (QKD) will future-proof their network security and offer innovative solutions to their customers a win for all parties.

On the collaboration Grégoire Ribordy CEO and co-founder of ID Quantique said: “We are very proud of this partnership with KHNP and SK Telecom. Besides government and finance we see critical infrastructure as a key area of attacks. With our solutions we focus on providing long-term security solutions for our customers’ IT infrastructures and we are dedicated to accompanying companies who wish to prepare for the quantum decade.”

22. Telecom Italia (TIM)

Gruppo TIM is a telecommunications company that provides telephony services mobile services and DSL data services and just happens to be the first operator in Europe to use quantum computing live on its mobile networks (4.5G and 5G).

In 2020 using D-Wave’s 2000Q™ quantum computer TIM optimized planning of radio cells framing the problem within a QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) algorithmic model.

Aware computing speed is expected to improve further as QC technology evolves TIM knows how important it will be to configure the network in real-time in order to provide its customers with better mobile service.

23. Total SE

Total SE is a French multinational integrated oil and gas company. Last year it signed a multi-year partnership with UK startup Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQC) to research into Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technologies.

Ilyas Khan CEO of CQC said:

“We are very excited to be working with Total a demonstrated thought-leader in CCUS technology. Carbon neutrality is one of the most significant topics of our time and incredibly important to the future of the planet. Total has a proven long-term commitment to CCUS solutions. We are hopeful that our work will lead to meaningful contributions and an acceleration on the path to carbon neutrality.”

The two’s ultimate goal is to develop novel quantum algorithms to improve materials for CO2 capture. With ambitions to become a key player in CCUS Total invests up to 10% of its annual R&D effort in this area a serious amount of bank.

24. Willis Towers Watson

And finally we have Willis Towers Watson a UK-based global multinational risk management insurance brokerage and advisory company. In 2019 the company announced an exclusive deal with Microsoft to develop the potential of quantum computing for its risk management and insurance clients within the financial services insurance and investment space.

With a long-standing partnership with Microsoft already in place on the development of cutting-edge technology and bringing advanced modelling tools to insurers across the globe Willis Towers Watson’s venture into quantum seems like in the words of the company “a natural extension of that partnership and offers the potential to transform risk quantification and make the insurance value chain more efficient.”

John Haley Willis Towers Watson’s CEO said “Willis Towers Watson provides advanced analytics tools to over 1000 insurers around the world allowing them to quantify risk and allocate capital efficiently. Current modelling techniques to quantify risk require a huge amount of computing power using thousands of computers over many hours. The better the models the more efficiently our clients can use their capital to manage risk. Quantum computing offers us the chance to look at our clients’ problems in a different way. By focusing on how we would model the problems on quantum computers when they become available at scale we are able to redefine the problems and speed up our solutions on existing hardware today.”

Parting Words

Still in the very early days of quantum it may be some time before we see more of the bigger players from the traditional sectors adopting it to their long-term strategy. When it happens that is when quantum technology will really start to show its potential. Until then it will be up to the likes of Amazon AWS Microsoft IBM Google etc to show them how it’s done.

All patients provided written consent after a detailed explanation of the content of the study. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Participants

Patients (n = 34) diagnosed with a major unipolar depressive episode (based on International Classification of Diseases version 10 ICD-10) older than 18 years and assigned to ECT treatment were recruited at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Central Institute of Mental Health (CIMH) in Mannheim Germany between 2014 and 2016. Criteria for assignment to ECT were treatment-resistant depression (i.e. failure of two adequate dose-duration antidepressants from different classes or psychotherapy in the current episode) positive experience of ECT from a previous episode or severe depression with (a) psychotic symptoms (b) severe suicidality or (c) the refusal of food or fluid intake. Patients were excluded if they had any substance-use-related disorders (other than tobacco and alcohol use disorders) or a lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia. All participants were of Caucasian descent. The patients kept the same medication regimens throughout ECT treatment. This sample is a subset of a sample reported in a previous genetic study in ECT patients11. Descriptive and clinical characteristics of the participants are described in Table 1.

Table 1 Patient demographics. Full size table

Depression and DNA methylation assessment

The 21-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was administered and blood was collected from patients prior to the first (T1) and after the last (T2) session of ECT (average sessions: 10.82 range: 5–25 sessions). T2 was between 1 and 7 days after the last ECT session. Time of collection was kept constant between 8:30 and 9:30 a.m. at both timepoints to keep it close to the clinical interview conducted around the same time as well as preclude any potential confounding effects arising from ward routines and circadian fluctuations2324. Standard procedures for extraction and processing were followed. DNA extraction was performed using the Chemagic Magnetic Separation Module 1 (Chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie AG; Baesweiler Germany). All genomic DNA samples were stored at −20 °C prior to analysis. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC array (>850000 CpG sites). The arrays were processed at the Genome Analysis Center at the HelmholtzZentrum München and Max-Planck-Institute for Psychiatry in Munich Germany.

ECT treatment

ECT was conducted with a Thymatron IV device (Somatics LLC. Lake Bluff IL USA). Anesthetic drugs used were: s-ketamine (~1.0 mg/kg)2526 and succinylcholine for muscle relaxation (~1.0 mg/kg). Seizure thresholds were titrated at the initial session; dosing in subsequent sessions was given at >2.5 above this threshold. If patients did not show a clinical improvement or seizures were insufficient energy used was increased. Patients received 2–3 ECT sessions per week. All patients started with unilateral stimulation with the possibility to change to bilateral stimulation at the discretion of the ECT supervisor.

Statistical analysis

Data processing quality control (QC) and other statistical analyses were performed using R (versions 3.4.4 and 3.6.3) analysis software (https://cran.r-project.org/).

Data preprocessing QC and filtering

Methylation values were extracted using an updated version of the pipeline indicated in27 adapted in-house for use with the Illumina Infinium EPIC array. Illumina background correction was applied to all intensity values. A detection p-value threshold of p < 10−16 was used and intensity values with detection p ≥ 10−16 were designated as missing data. The proportion of missing data points was determined allowing the calculation of sample and CpG site-specific call rates. Samples with insufficient DNA quality as denoted by a call rate of <95% were excluded. Intensity values were quantile normalized for each of the six probe types present on the array separately. Intensity values were converted to methylation beta values according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. White blood cell fractions were estimated according to28. Five of the six resulting estimates were subsequently included as covariates in downstream analyses to control for influences of cell type distribution on DNA methylation. The estimate for granulocytes showed the highest variance inflation factor (VIF) and was omitted to avoid collinearity issues. CpG sites were filtered by removing cross-hybridizing probes probes with high missing rate (>0.02) and probes linked to X- and Y-chromosomes. Correction for batch effects and other technical parameters was done by performing a principal component analysis on internal control probe intensity values and including the first 10 extracted principal components (PCs) as covariates in the downstream analyses. Prior to analysis all methylation beta values were logit transformed (base 2) to M-values which were used in downstream analysis as recommended in29.

Differentially methylated single CpG sites

Association testing of methylation M-values for each CpG site was done using a mixed linear model approach as implemented in the Limma R package. Participant ID was used as a blocking factor and estimated cell fractions 10 control probe PCs age sex and smoking status were included as additional covariates to adjust for confounding factors. It was observed that sex was highly correlated with the 5th control probe PC thus this PC was not included in the statistical models to avoid collinearity issues.

The main effects of interest specified included: (1) response (responders vs. non-responders) (2) timepoint (change after intervention) and (3) the interaction between timepoint and response (the difference in change between response groups). Models were calculated with response specified both as a binary (>50% decrease in HDRS score) and continuous variable (i.e. change in HDRS score ΔHDRS).

In addition we examined the relationship between baseline (T1) methylation and response (both binary and continuous) in additional models.

Significance was defined as false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05. Results at a suggestive threshold of p < 10−5 were also reported.

Differentially methylated regions

Differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis was performed on the results of the above analyses using the comb-p package30. Comb-p parameters were specified as: seed p-value = 0.001 and a maximum distance between probes of 500 base pairs. These parameters follow those used in previous studies in the field3132 and results from simulation experiments33.

Pathway analysis

A Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed on the results of the different models using the missMethyl (v1.12.0) R package. We examined CpG sites at the suggestive threshold of 1 × 10−5.

Targeted examination of methylation change in candidate CpG sites

Change in methylation of candidate genes from the literature was examined in an exploratory search. First we selected: (1) candidates implicated in reviews of DNA methylation and antidepressant medication i.e. BDNF MAOA SLC6A2 SLC6A4 HTR1A HTR1B IL6 IL117; SLC6A4 NR3C1 FKBP5 and OXTR8; and (2) candidates specific to ECT i.e. S100A10 (p11)12 RNF175 RNF213 TBC1D14 TMC5 WSCD1 AC018685.2 AC098617.1 CLCN3P1 AQP10 and TRERF122.

Autosomal CpG sites which were annotated to these candidate genes in the UCSC Genome Browser NCBI curated RefSeq (retrieved: August 10 2018) were extracted from the results of the single site analyses above (for each variable of interest in both binary and continuous models). Furthermore to examine their predictive value in our sample association between baseline methylation and response was also examined. A secondary FDR correction was applied to the list of all candidate CpG sites to control for false positives.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Chip foundries are critically dependent on water and Arizona is one of the driest states in the nation. Arizona gets only 13.6 inches of annual rainfall (compared with 50-60 inches in most of the Deep South or 30.3 inches average for the USA as a whole). But as Forrester research director Glenn O'Donnell told CNBC chip-fabrication plants are similar to indoor swimming pools—""you need a lot to fill it but you don't have to add much to keep it going.""

Counterintuitively the famously thirsty industry can even improve the local water supply due to a focus on reclamation and purification—Intel has funded 15 water restoration projects in the Grand Canyon State with a goal of restoring 937 million gallons per year and it expects to reach net positive water use once the projects are completed.

What Arizona lacks in water it makes up for with overall stability—the state is very seismically stable and does not suffer from hurricanes with low risks of other natural disasters such as tornadoes to boot. Building chip fabs without such guarantees is possible—for example Intel has a large presence in Oregon—but chip fabricators on the West Coast must take extreme isolation measures which Arizona plants don't require.

Arizona's lack of rainfall comes with another benefit—plentiful sunshine which former Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano once said gives the state the potential to be ""the Persian Gulf of solar energy."" As of 2018 the state's utility companies generated roughly 5.2 GW—nearly 5 percent of its entire power budget—via solar generation. Distributed (nonutility-scale) generation in Arizona provided another 2.3 GW in the same year.

The human factor however may add up to more than the state's natural advantages do. Intel established its presence in Arizona more than 40 years ago and currently employs more than 12000 people in the state. Arizona local universities responded by establishing ""a strong reputation for semiconductor design courses and research"" according to Gartner analyst Alan Priestley. And as Forrester director O'Donnell points out ""the political machinery in Arizona is determined to make the state business friendly... the recent announcements by Intel and TSMC come via a lot of help from federal state and local government entities.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vYXJjaGl2ZS5lc3BvcnRzb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tL2pkZy10d28teWVhci1uYW1pbmctcmlnaHRzLWludGVsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JDG Gaming Signs Two Year Naming Rights Deal With Intel,"Chinese esports organization JDG Gaming (also known as JingDong Gaming) announced Sunday that it has signed a naming rights deal with Intel Corporation.

JDG Gaming is the esports division of Chinese e-commerce company Jing Dong and competes in China’s League of Legends Pro League (LPL).

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but the two-year deal will see JDG gaming renamed to “JDG Intel Esports Club.”

In May JDG Intel Esports Club announced that it had rebranded and was making plans to relocate its headquarters and its home venue to Beijing the same city where parent company Jing Dong is situated. The organization currently has 15 sponsors including Tencent-owned steaming platform DouYu peripherals company Razer and Korean electronics company Samsung among others.

JDG Intel Esports Club joins Dignitas and TSM who both announced naming rights deals last week; TSM signed a 10-year $210M USD deal with cryptocurrency exchange company FTX to become TSM FTX; and Dignitas signed a four-year deal with online banking company QNTMPAY to rename its LCS team to Dignitas QNTMPA.

The artificial intelligence (AI) platform aims to prevent financial crime and enable secure collaboration among financial institutions while helping to protect privacy and secure data.

Why it Matters

According to the United Nations between 2-5% of gross domestic product (GDP) is laundered globally every year which amounts to $800 billion – $2 trillion. Recognizing the need to move beyond a manual and fragmented monitoring system Consilient built an intelligent collaborative and always-on solution that leverages federated learning and Intel SGX to detect financial fraud.

By automating this process through federated learning access to multiple data sets databases and jurisdictions are encrypted without ever revealing the data or sensitive customer information to the different parties involved. Government and financial institutions can use this new platform to more accurately and efficiently detect illicit activity with lower false positive rates helping to combat financial crime thwart higher-value money laundering and enable legitimate individuals and businesses to manage risk more effectively.

“When banks try to detect illicit and fraudulent activity the system is highly inefficient and ineffective with over 95% of transaction monitoring rendering false positives and institutions unable to see risk beyond their own walls. With Consilient’s federated machine learning technology backed by Intel SGX we are redesigning the way financial institutions and authorities discover and prevent financial crime risk dynamically and securely. This new approach allows organizations to save costs redeploy personnel and manage and prioritize more serious illicit finance risks efficiently and effectively.“

— Juan Zarate global co-managing partner and chief strategy officer at K2 Integrity and first-ever assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes

How it Works

Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) technique and confidential computing model that enables AI training without centralizing data. Consilient has created a behavioral-based ML-driven platform that runs on its DOZER™ technology. ML models can be trained across multiple data sets to detect and analyze “normal” and “abnormal” patterns that humans and most current technologies cannot. This allows participating institutions authorities and regulators to collaborate while uncovering and managing systemic risks more effectively efficiently and sustainably without putting private data at risk.

This computing model is made possible through Intel SGX which uses a hardware-based trusted execution environment (TEE) to help isolate and protect specific application code and data in memory. The technology helps ensure the root of trust is limited to a small portion of the central processing unit’s hardware and the ML application itself reducing the attack surface for potential threats and better protecting the confidentiality and integrity of code and data.

“The application of the Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) technology in the financial space is incredibly exciting said Anil Rao Intel vice president and general manager Data Platforms Security and Systems Architecture. “Finance as we’ve seen in many industries is often limited by secure information sharing and initial trial results between Intel and Consilient hold tremendous promise for the future of collaborative finance.”

More information on using federated learning in the financial services industry is available in the white paper titled Federated Learning through Revolutionary Technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0aW1lcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjYxMTM4LzIwMjEwNjA2L2ludGVsLXRzbWMtYnVpbGRpbmctZmFjdG9yaWVzLWFyaXpvbmEtZGVzZXJ0LXdoeS5odG3SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlcy8yNjExMzgvMjAyMTA2MDYvaW50ZWwtdHNtYy1idWlsZGluZy1mYWN0b3JpZXMtYXJpem9uYS1kZXNlcnQtd2h5Lmh0bQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel and TSMC Are Building Factories in the Arizona Desert but Why?,"Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TSMC) two of the world's largest and most influential chipmakers are deep in their efforts of trying to alleviate the global chip shortage. And they're doing most of that weirdly in the middle of the desert.

According to a report by ArsTechnica Intel and TSMC are currently building new manufacturing plants in Arizona. The former is planning to spend a massive $20 billion to build two more chip foundries there according to CNBC. This may sound awesome until you realize that Arizona is one of the hottest and driest places on Earth.

TSMC is not far behind too. With their local fabs in Taiwan being held back by record-breaking drought they're looking elsewhere to build their factories. Arizona seems like a place where they want to do business as they plan to spend a cool $3.5 billion to build their own facility in the state according to AllAboutCircuits. They plan to have the facility operational and productive by 2024.

But why are two of the largest semiconductor makers in the world setting up shop in one of the driest places on the planet? The answer might be a little surprising.

Intel and TSMC's Weird But Logical Reasons

For those who are unaware of the connection between water and tech here's something you should know: chip manufacturing is extremely dependent on a steady water supply. This then makes Arizona the most counterintuitive place out there in terms of setting up chip factories right?

The state itself only gets about 13.6 inches of rainfall every year less than half the U.S. average. This is supposed to be bad for chip foundries on paper. But researchers say this about these factories: they're like indoor swimming pools. You need a lot of water to fill them up but you don't need a lot to keep them running.

What this means is that a typical chip foundry like that of Intel or TSMC may actually not need that much water to keep itself operational in the long run. In fact they may even help conserve water because these companies tend to focus a lot on purification and reclamation. Intel alone is one of the leading companies to fund water restoration projects throughout Arizona paying for a total of 15 projects in the area.

As for TSMC a U.S. expansion has actually been in the works for a while. They cited Phoenix AZ as their top candidate location for a foundry where they will make a host of 5nm chips for partners such as AMD Apple and Qualcomm. Aside from that they also bared plans to erect a much larger $25-billion factory in the area to produce 3nm chips.

Not the First Time Doing This

Intel is no stranger to building chip fabs in some of the most water-starved places people can think of. Earlier this year they were reported to spend $3.5 billion on a New Mexico factory upgrade. New Mexico is basically dryer than Arizona as it receives an annual average rainfall of 13 inches.

But with the global chip shortage hampering a world getting more dependent on tech any news on new semiconductor factories being put up is surely a welcome sight.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

Paper waste exporters worldwide now have to shift their supply chains: China a global key processor of imported waste banned solid waste imports in 2021. Countries with insufficient domestic paper processing capacity will now be forced to develop these facilities against the current global trend towards the circular economy.

Key Trends and Insights

Paper recycling worldwide is increasing robustly. According to the European Paper Recycling Council paper recycling in the EU reached 72% in 2019. The U.S. attained a record recycling performance indicator of 68.2% in 2018; this figure then started to drop to 65.7% in 2020 following a decline in the volume of American waste paper being processed abroad. Despite the rise in paper recycling facilities in the U.S. the country has not yet overcome its shortage of reprocessing plants.

In 2020 global imports of waste and scrap of paper and paperboard declined by 15% against the previous year (IndexBox estimates). This decline was largely a result of China’s systematic curb of paper waste imports an initiative aimed at improving the country’s environmental situation.

Since 1 January 2021 a full ban has been in force in China regarding solid waste imports which were to be sent for recycling inside the country. This ban also includes all paper waste. Indonesia has also announced similar plans to curb waste imports. The EU and the U.S. now face the emerged issue of rearranging supply chains in paper recycling.

With approx. $1.7B of imported paper waste China accounted for approx. 29% of the recycling of global waste and scrap paper and paperboard before 2021. Now this market share is to be captured by other actors. India Vietnam and Malaysia among others have started to increase the volume of imported paper waste thereby partially sustaining the global recycling balance.

The recycling of paper and cardboard is set to increase worldwide in line with the global shift to a circular economy. A decline in the global export and import of waste paper products is therefore equally forecast against increasingly stringent environmental standards in particular countries. The key exporters of paper waste such as the U.S. the UK and Japan will now be forced to develop their own paper and cardboard recycling capacity.

Recovered Paper Imports by Country

In 2020 global recovered paper imports decreased by -10.5% to 38M tonnes falling for the fourth year in a row. In value terms they contracted by -15% to approx. $6B.

In value terms China ($27.7B) led the market alone. The second position in the ranking was occupied by the U.S. ($5.4B). It was followed by Japan.

In 2020 China (9M tonnes) distantly followed by Germany (4.3M tonnes) Indonesia (2.8M tonnes) the Netherlands (2.7M tonnes) and India (2M tonnes) were the main importers of recovered paper together committing 54% of total imports. Mexico (1.6M tonnes) Taiwan (Chinese) (1.4M tonnes) Austria (1.3M tonnes) Thailand (1.2M tonnes) Turkey (1.2M tonnes) South Korea (1.2M tonnes) Canada (0.8M tonnes) and France (0.8M tonnes) occupied a minor share of total imports.

In 2020 the average recovered paper import price amounted to $156 per tonne which is down by -5% against the previous year. Prices varied noticeably by the country of destination; the country with the highest price was India ($201 per tonne) while the Netherlands ($106 per tonne) was amongst the lowest.

New Business

Oren International started as an entrepreneurial venture more than 25 years ago in Pensacola native Alan NeSmith's house.

Now the company is a leader in the custom packaging industry providing solutions for restaurants retailers medical and industrial partners alike. International and national brands such as Disney Macy's and Johnson & Johnson have all turned to Oren International for their custom paper needs.

But as the demand for paper increases so does the output of energy and carbon emissions. Oren International and the concept of paper packaging are far from new but to move forward in an ever-changing world it became evident that innovation was needed.

As a result Oren International recently set forth on a journey to become a more sustainable operation looking into implementing clean energy solutions as a way to increase efficiency and decrease its carbon footprint.

A ribbon-cutting ceremony Wednesday lifted the curtain on the company's 524-kilowatt rooftop solar system with Pensacola District 7 Councilman Delarian Wiggins and Pensacola Mayor Grover Robinson in attendance.

""More than anything it’s exciting to see homegrown companies in Pensacola becoming environmental stewards"" Robinson said.

The new system is said to provide approximately 708000 kilowatt hours of clean energy per year.

""The decision to install a rooftop solar system at our headquarters aligned perfectly with Oren's commitment to sustainability and renewable energy"" said NeSmith Oren International's president. ""With government incentives and strong project economics going solar was a sound investment in addition to being the environmentally responsible choice. The system will provide electricity quietly and cleanly for the next 25 to 30 years.""

It took three years to install the 1366 individual solar panels that now line the roof of Oren International and the system provides the facility 95% of power. In addition to the clean energy benefits and lower production costs the new rooftop solar panels will allow Oren International to save nearly 44000 gallons of gasoline a year as well as decrease its annual carbon emissions by 856350 pounds the equivalent to saving 9000 trees per year.

The project wouldn’t have been possible without partnering with EnterSolar a national provider of solar energy and solar plus storage systems to the commercial marketplace. The company worked with Oren International from start to finish.

""We were excited to partner with Oren International to make its business operations even more sustainable"" EnterSolar Business Development Director Christina Hatzistratis said. ""This rooftop solar system helps Oren achieve its important sustainability goals through utilizing renewable energy and they are a shining example of a company doing its part to mitigate its environmental impact.""

Oren International is located at 675 South Pace Blvd. in Pensacola. For more information visit oren-intl.com or call 850-433-9080.

From the start the IEA’s mission has been to help member nations deal with major oil supply disruptions.

Over the years the group’s purview has broadened to include more than just oil security and in its most recent report the IEA sounds the warning bell on the global supply of key minerals—particularly copper.

“Today’s supply and investment plans for many critical minerals fall well short of what is needed to support an accelerated deployment of solar panels wind turbines and electric vehicles” IEA Executive Directive Faith Birol writes.

Many of these minerals are produced by a very small number of companies in a small number of jurisdictions. Take rare earth metals used in everything from semiconductors to smartphone batteries. China controls between 80% and 95% of the world market depending on the mineral.

Or look at copper. Chile and Peru are responsible for a combined 40% of global output. The largest copper mine in the world Chile’s Escondida is believed to have reached peak production. Meanwhile the Chilean government has threatened to shut down the mine—57.5% of which is owned by BHP—for its water usage. Oh and did I mention there’s a strike at Escondida?

These are only near-term risks to global supply. Looking more long-term the risks increase and could be more severe.

Copper Supply Constraints as Demand Surges

Like gold fewer and fewer large copper deposits are being discovered and the time between discovery and production has lengthened over the years as costs rise. S&P Global Kevin Murphy called last decade “dismal” in terms of new discoveries. Of the 224 copper deposits that were discovered between 1990 and 2019 only 16 were found in the past 10 years. Although the earth’s surface still has an abundance of the red metal most new deposits are of low grade.

This could be a problem going forward. As I’ve written about before the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and battery storage technology—both of which rely heavily on copper—is set to accelerate rapidly over the coming decades. Last year EV sales were around 3 million. By 2040 they could be as high as 70 million.

According to the IEA copper will remain the most widely used metal in renewable energy technologies. Compared to aluminum nickel and zinc its importance is rated high for most new energy-related projects. That’s mainly because its electrical conductivity is the second best after silver and 60% higher than aluminum. Goldman Sachs predicts that by 2030 copper demand will grow nearly 600% to 5.4 million tons.

Commercial Production Begins at Ivanhoe’s Kamoa-Kakula

Although large copper discoveries are becoming fewer and farther between there are notable exceptions. The IEA mentions Peru’s Quellaveco majority-owned by Anglo American and Ivanhoe’s Kamoa-Kakula in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

I’ve written about the developing Kakula project several times before. Last week Ivanhoe announced that copper concentrate production officially began at the world-class discovery several months ahead of schedule.

“Discovering and delivering a copper province of this scale grade and outstanding ESG credentials ahead of schedule and on budget is a unicorn in the copper mining business” commented Ivanhoe founder and co-chair Robert Friedland who added that Kakula was discovered only five years ago. This represents “remarkable progress by the mining industry’s glacial standards from first drill hole to a new major mining operation.”

Kakula Robert says is now on path to become the world’s second largest copper mining complex and perhaps even the largest. Further the project is estimated to be the world’s highest grade major copper mine. Further still Ivanhoe pledges that Kakula will be a net-zero greenhouse gas generator making the company an attractive ESG play.

Record Copper Price by Year-End?

Last week analysts at CIBC announced that they adjusted their end-of-year copper price forecast to $5.25 a pound Kitco reports. The estimates are now 22% and 32% above 2021 and 2022 consensus estimates.

The supporting factors include “positive economic data USD weakness continued Chinese demand and tight global inventory levels” CIBC wrote.

If true this should be supportive of copper miners such as Ivanhoe going forward.

They increasingly understand that these factors affect the prospects of their investments while at the same time contribute to a sustainable world.

The theme was initially driven by institutional investors but is gaining traction amongst retail investors too. There are about 10 funds to choose from in India based on factors such as active or passive funds invested in Indian equities or global ones.

ESG funds are mutual funds calibrated using environmental social and governance propositions. “ESG funds invest in companies that aim to have a sustainable and societal impact in the world such as those with a small carbon footprint or diverse leadership boards. An ideal fund would be the one that invests in companies that ace these propositions while ensuring that an investor is not compromising on their returns"" said Priti Rathi Gupta founder LXME a financial platform for women.

This World Environment Day we tell you why this theme has picked up and its prospects in the Indian context.

Why ESG funds have picked up

Private investors have realized that investing in companies with a robust and convincing ESG strategy positively affects return on investment reduces lending and revenue risks.

Moreover ESG principles guide corporates towards better and more efficient use of resources both natural and man-made. This facilitates businesses to sustain for longer with the same limited pool of resources.

“ESG funds are playing an important role of creating a push for corporates to be aware of these aspects by avoiding investments in those companies or sectors where underlying risks in businesses due to disregard of E S or G factors is high and by engaging with corporates increasing the awareness levels"" said Amit Nigam fund manager Invesco Mutual Fund.

The covid-led crisis has further accelerated the demand for sustainable investing. While still early days in India from an ESG funds perspective the launch of ESG funds has increased investor awareness.

“Many domestic asset managers are already incorporating ESG principles in their overall investing framework. Corporate India is also increasingly acknowledging the need to effectively manage the ESG factors as means to effectively manage business risks as well as attract long-term capital from investors who are increasingly considering ESG factors to make investment decisions"" said Kaustubh Belapurkar director – manager Research Morningstar India.

Low environmental score

There have been concerns that in India many top companies score low on the environmental aspect which is then compensated by good social and governance scores. Some of the large companies scoring low on the environment is a factor of the industries in which they operate.

“The industries’ usage of natural resources and subsequent emissions are the main reason of these poor scores. In our scoring methodology we weave in these aspects and try to differentiate between companies that are making efforts to mitigate this risk by improving on their processes making more efficient use of natural resources reduce emissions etc"" said Nigam.

On the other hand there are examples of companies which had a good score on the environment aspect yet they damaged shareholder returns due to poor governance practices.

“Our experience of ESG principles suggests that one should have a holistic approach when evaluating the ESG risk profile of a company"" Nigam added.

Are ESG funds a good fit for you?

According to experts with the risk lowered investors in such funds stand to benefit from better risk-adjusted returns in their portfolios over the medium to long term.

A strong ESG proposition can help create business value across the enterprise. “E-sustainable practices attract more customers allows better access to resources lowers energy and water consumption and therefore also can reduce operational costs. S-sustainable practices lead to greater social credibility attract talent boost employee morale and build stronger community relations. While G-sustainable practices may lead to government support subsidies overcoming increasing regulatory pressure and better investor relations e.g. in form of better loan conditions or lower capital costs"" said Gupta.

According to Nigam investors in a company stand to benefit from this extended life as the equity compounding journey in the company can continue for longer.

Top-rated funds

ESG funds in India are still at a nascent stage but those that have been around for more than a year have shown impressive returns. According to Morningstar India top-rated ESG funds are Aditya BSL ESG Axis ESG Equity ICICI Prudential ESG Invesco India ESG Equity and Kotak ESG Opportunities.

In terms of the environmental aspect information technology and financial services sectors tend to attract a better score as these businesses have a limited direct physical interaction with the environment.

And she’ll have her eyes on another prize Saturday. After that she’ll move on to more conquests yet this track season.

That pattern will be repeated for the next two years on the track and along the cross country course.

Berkshire a sophomore at Gaylord High School is already a long-distance record-holder and a regular feature at the Lower Peninsula Division 2 Final. Today she is throwing out the welcome mat to her opponents as Gaylord hosts its annual Blue Devil Classic.

She is welcoming this weekend’s competition because she knows fast races help her get better every day. Winning although it happens often is not her top priority. Putting in the work and getting better is what matters most according to Gaylord girls track & field and cross country coach Lindsey Yates.

“She’s more than just a fast runner” acknowledged Yates. “She knows she has to put the work in to get good results and she’s always wanting more.

“The proof is in the pudding in what she does” Yates continued. “She is a special — very special — athlete and young woman.”

Berkshire started this season by breaking the school record in the 3200 at Gaylord’s first meet. She’s hoping to break the school’s 1600 record yet this spring. And she’s hoping to add to her collection of Regional and conference titles this month.

Higher finishes at the Division 2 Final on June 2 also are on the mind of the running sensation who had a strong showing as a freshman finishing third in the 3200 and 10th in the 1600.

Track is known as an individual sport but Berkshire looks at it more as a team sport with friendly competition.

Running which started in Gaylord Elementary’s “Mileage Club” for Berkshire wouldn’t be the same without teammates.

“Cross country and track are individual sports but the team is a huge part – without the team it wouldn’t be the same at all” Berkshire said. “We have all put in so much effort and we deserve to go out and race and show what we can do.”

“She’s a gift to the team” Yates added. “It is an individual sport but she has the whole team with her and she rallies for the team and the team rallies for her – it’s a family.”

Gaylord has had its share of individual Finals champions in the past under boys coach Matthew Warren who Yates notes has played an integral part in Berkshire’s training. But Berkshire is a one-of-a-kind runner for Yates who has served as both the girls track and girls and boys cross country head coach the past two years at Gaylord.

“I have not seen anything as fine-tuned as Katie Berkshire and it’s a breath of fresh air” said Yates who assisted both Blue Devils programs a few years before taking over. “The intrinsic desire for her is amazing.”

Running cross country and track brings endless challenges for Berkshire to conquer. The results she notes come from the training.

“Running shows me any challenge that comes my way I can just overcome” Berkshire said. “It shows me if I have a goal in my mind I can accomplish it if I work hard and put in the effort.”

During the fall Berkshire won eight of her 12 cross country races including the Big North Conference meet and Regional. She’s already qualified for three Division 2 Finals across the two sports and is likely going to add a fourth Finals next month at Hamilton High School.

Before that Berkshire is going after another Big North title and a Regional championship. Competitions like those ahead always bring out her best; the conference includes Division 1 opponents.

“I enjoy running against even girls that are faster than me because they always push me to be better and they are there obviously to race and try their best” Berkshire said. “They are an influence to me that I can get there one day and I can maybe even beat them the next season.”

This year she has hopes of running a sub-5-minute 1600 to capture the school record; her best in the race is 5:11. She takes on both distance races regularly and also is a regular in relays. In Wednesday’s dual meet at Alpena she set two personal bests running a 2:25.60 in the 800 and 1:05.71 in the 400.

Berkshire’s favorite event by far is the 3200 as she likes finding the right pace and rhythm to handle eight laps.

“Most people would think I am crazy for that” she said of her pick for favorite. “It’s the longest race on the track and it feels the best for me.”

Yates says Berkshire has yet to run her best 3200 of the season. The conference Regional and Final should bring out the best in Berkshire she noted.

“She’s amazing and setting the record isn’t good enough for her. She wants to do it again” Yates said. “She also wants the mile record and she’s hungry for it.”

Over the next seven weeks the Bighorn Fire consumed almost 120000 acres the largest blaze ever recorded in the Catalina Mountains or anywhere else in Pima County.

It took more than 1000 wildland firefighters to contain the windblown flames in a landscape baked by record heat and crushing drought. Hundreds of residents were chased from their homes on and around the mountain but not a single building burned.

A year later the air tankers and Hotshot crews have been replaced by researchers who have fanned out across the Catalinas to see how the landscape is recovering and how much more punishment it can take.

University of Arizona research scientist Jim Malusa spent three days last week hiking through some of the hardest hit areas.

His 15-mile trek to see what he called “the worst of the burn” took him 4300 vertical feet down the northside of Mount Lemmon to the headwaters of the Cañada del Oro and back up again along Red Ridge. The same area was also severely burned during the Aspen Fire in 2003.

Along the way Malusa sought out “photo points” where he could match old pictures of the forest — one of his maybe or something from the internet — to what the landscape looks like now one year to the day that the Bighorn Fire began.

The trails he walked remain closed to the general public due to the risk of flash floods and falling debris. “This is easily the most burned up part of the mountain and also the hardest to get to — only trail access and it’s a long way down” he said. “It takes effort to get down there.”

The vegetation ecologist with the UA School of Natural Resources and the Environment made the trip on behalf of the Coronado National Forest and the Pima County Regional Flood Control District which wanted to know what the burn scar looked like one year later.

The answer depends on what was growing there before the fire and how badly it burned Malusa said.

In one of his before-and-after pictures looking down toward Romero Canyon you can see a transition in progress: the remnants of pine trees destroyed by the Aspen Fire opening the ground to a thorny fire-adapted shrub called Fendler’s ceanothus and eventually oak.

“Now the oaks are scorched but they are very quickly resprouting” Malusa said. “Even with last year’s miserable monsoon they still have the resources to come back.”

Another photo shows a different patch of silverleaf oak that burned last year but now sports 3 to 4 feet of new growth.

“You’re looking at pictures here that are examples of quick recovery and resilience in an ecosystem” he said. “You can’t believe how quickly it goes back to looking like it was before.”

But that isn’t true of all plants or places.

Near one photo point along the trail to Shovel Springs Malusa snapped a picture of a Douglas fir that burned at the roots and toppled over last year. The tree was 4 feet across and more than 100 feet tall and it had lived on the mountain above Tucson for several hundred years.

“Fire is very capricious. Sometimes it picks out all the small things … but sometimes it picks the grandpas and grandmas” he said. “That’s what happens with these Doug firs a lot. These magnificent old trees they look like they’re armored but they’re not.”

Fire then flood

Some of the worst damage and biggest surprises Malusa saw came along the west fork of the Cañada del Oro.

The creek runs year-round there giving rise to an unusual stand of trees. Douglas fir don’t usually grow so low on the mountain but the combination of permanent water and a north-facing slope allowed them to take hold.

“It was a very diverse and lovely place” Malusa said right up until June 17 when a wall of flame roared up the canyon. “It all went in that one day. It was like a volcano on the mountain” he said.

Even there though life goes on.

“This is poison ivy which is really not what I expected” Malusa said pointing at a picture of leafy green plants erupting from the rocky bottom of the canyon. He also saw geraniums another deep forest plant not common to a canyon like that particularly after a high-severity fire.

“That’s what keeps scientists going: Always being reminded with every trip that you don’t know nothing” he said.

At first Malusa was encouraged by the amount of new growth he saw in CDO canyon. Where there used to be “just sticks” roughly 25% percent of the ground is now covered mostly by silverleaf oak.

Then he spoke to a hydrologist who told him that the chances of a serious slope failure are still high despite the addition of those young sprouts. There’s only so much a few oaks can do for a canyon raked by intense fire twice in 20 years.

Braced for impacts

The Pima County Regional Flood Control District wanted Malusa up on the mountain to help predict what might come down.

The verdict: There hasn’t been enough rain since the fire to move much of the debris up there or spur enough growth to heal the watershed.

Officials believe there is still a huge risk of flash floods and landslides from the hardest hit areas.

“It’s almost like that year hasn’t passed” said Brian Jones who heads up the district’s floodplain management division. “We’re definitely in the mode of preparing for significant impacts.”

Later this month the district will send out informational postcards to the owners of almost 1000 homes and businesses considered at risk of flooding from the Bighorn Fire.

The Cañada del Oro Pima Wash Finger Rock Wash and Ventana Wash seem to pose the greatest threats Jones said.

The agency will soon start work on improvements to the culverts that carry Pima Wash underneath Ina Road. The roughly $80000 project was launched after computer models showed how increased runoff from the burn scar could overwhelm the current structure sending water over the road and down into neighborhoods and businesses to the southwest.

A contractor has been hired for the job but the work can’t start until the district gets approval for a federal grant to pay for it. “We’re pushing it a little close” Jones said but they hope to have the project finished before the heaviest rains arrive.

In anticipation of trouble on the CDO district crews have been cleaning out and shoring up the channel wherever possible. “We want to give it as much room as we can give it so it doesn’t come out of its banks” Jones said.

The district has also tried to get a jump on work elsewhere in the county so it will have plenty of resources available this summer in the event of an active storm season over the Catalinas.

That was one good thing about last year’s disappointing monsoon Jones said: “It gave us a chance to get ahead of the game.”

Rating resilience

Malusa’s work is part of a larger scientific collaboration aimed at predicting the future of Southern Arizona’s most visited mountain and other sky islands like it.

“We are interested in whether forests will be resilient to things like wildfires and climate change” said Don Falk a fire ecologist and UA professor of natural resources.

Those things are connected because climate change is making winters warmer and drier and extending the length of fire seasons he said. Meanwhile the same hot dry conditions that make fires more likely to start can also reduce the success rate of seedlings slowing post-fire recovery.

To chart changes to the landscape Falk and his team are revisiting scientific plots set up all over the mountain by other researchers dating back as far as the 1980s. There are 80 plots in all across a range of different plant communities. Some are in areas that also burned in 2003 2002 or both.

Field work just got underway on the project which is being led by UA graduate student Emily Fulé and researcher Rebecca Beers.

“We’re looking at the ecological impacts of the Bighorn Fire and the impact of reburns” Fulé said on Wednesday during an informational webinar hosted by the university’s Arizona Institutes for Resilience.

Understanding how our mountain ecosystems respond to fire and other stresses should help in the development of management strategies to make them more resilient she said.

People assume all 119978 acres within the Bighorn burn area were reduced to ash Falk said but large swaths of forest were unburned or saw only low intensity fire activity.

“Much of the mountain is already starting to recover” he said.

Transition zone

According to estimates by the U.S. Forest Service less than one-third of the land within in the fire perimeter sustained even moderate burn damage while just 4% burned hot enough and long enough to consume almost all plants and litter char roots and fuse the soil into a water resistant shell.

Recovery time in such high severity burn areas can be significant especially in conifer forests where trees sprout from seeds.

Falk said it’s impossible to say how long it will take for the Catalinas to heal because the landscape and the damage are both so variable. A patch of forest with moderate damage might show few scars from the fire a decade from now. A high severity burn area might not recover for 100 years or more.

And some areas won’t come back at all. They will be “reorganized” instead Falk said. What was there before will be replaced by something else — a shrubland where a forest used to be — in a process known as type conversion.

“The whole place will look different but it will still be an ecosystem. It will still be habitat for wildlife” he said. “The birds will still be singing even if they’re singing in a different forest.”

In some circles this qualifies Falk as an optimist. He said several of his colleagues have a bleaker view of where the Catalinas are headed but he believes “there is a future for these mountains.”

All that’s required is some additional forest management and a serious global campaign to curb the human causes of climate change Falk said. “I think we should be clear-eyed about what needs to be done and get down to the business of doing it.”

An ITWeb survey on the state of POPIA readiness being conducted in partnership with Iron Mountain has gone live on ITWeb. The objective of the survey is to find out the current state of South African businesses’ POPIA compliance readiness.

Kevin Akaloo South Africa’s national head of sales – private and public sector – for Iron Mountain says “With just over a month before POPIA becomes effective there is a sense that many companies are yet to be compliant from a technological governance and processing of information perspective.”

The survey aims to examine and gain insights into how South African companies approach Records and Information Management (RIM) and Information Governance in light of POPIA. He continues “We will be able to use this data to help companies and/or organisations gauge their readiness ahead of the end of the grace period.”

The survey asks how well prepared organisations are for POPIA compliance as well as how familiar decision-makers and staff are with POPIA requirements.

In this survey we examine among other things:

What are your concerns regarding data management aligned to POPIA? Which department in your organisation has overall responsibility for complying with the POPIA? Is your organisation embracing the POPI regulations in order to build customer trust?

We hope you’ll be able set aside a few minutes of your time to participate in the POPIA Readiness Survey and stand a chance to win a lucky draw prize a Takealot voucher for the amount of R4 000. Participants can opt in to receive a copy of a record retention guide which will assist with POPIA compliance.

The detailed results of the survey and the prize winner will be published on ITWeb.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""

From thousands of stocks 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5 Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

He said (as transcribed by BLABBERMOUTH.NET) : ""We've played with them a couple of times — always at a festival though; there's never been a METALLICA/ATREYU tour.

""They're the kings of metal — of rock and metal — they're just the biggest thing there is. So getting to experience that and see how they roll it's really inspiring for any band especially in the rock world. I mean you watch what they do and you're just like 'Holy crap man.'

""When you're that big you just have the best show; your show is so ridiculous"" he continued. ""It's so over the top in the most awesome epic way. They still sound just as good [as] if not better than they ever have. I mean those dudes are just ripping at what they do. James Hetfield is an animal. It's a great experience. There's a reason why they're as big as they are and they have been as successful as they have. They're the real deal. You will not go to a METALLICA show and be let down.""

Asked how he first discovered METALLICA's music Dan said: ""The first METALLICA I ever heard was 'Enter Sandman' back in the '90s. It was kind of around the time that I was just getting introduced to… I guess kind of really paying attention to music more than I ever have. I started watching MTV. Before music was something in passing I'd hear on the radio. I sought it out a little bit. But this was the age when I was like 12 or 13 years old and I was really pursuing music and really just obsessed with it at that point. So I remember watching MTV or VH1 and METALLICA's 'Enter Sandman' would come on every once in a while. I liked it — it wasn't something that I super fell in love with but I knew it was a great song [and it had] a huge sound with the drums and the guitars and everything. It wasn't exactly in line with what I was listening to at the time; I was kind of a little bit more drawn to the punk world… As far as the mainstream — THE OFFSPRING and GREEN DAY and RANCID which kind of led me down way more into the punk world which then led me into the hardcore bands which then led me into metal which was kind of around high school time. That's when I kind of came back around and started listening to METALLICA a little bit more especially a song like 'Battery'.

ATREYU has just dropped a new album ""Baptize"" via Spinefarm Records. The effort marks ATREYU's first release since the departure of vocalist Alex Varkatzas last September. The LP showcases ATREYU's current lineup consisting of Brandon Saller focusing completely on singing after previously sharing lead vocals with Varkatzas for most of the band's two-decade-plus existence. Sitting behind the kit is Saller's HELL OR HIGHWATER bandmate Kyle Rosa who had filled in for Saller on drums in 2019 after Varkatzas bowed out of the band's European tour while dealing with serious back and hernia issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzYW5kc2VudGluZWwuY29tL25ld3MvY29tbXVuaXR5LW5ld3MvMjAyMS8wNi90ZWVuLW9mLXRoZS13ZWVrLXdpbGxpYW1zdG93bi1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1ncmFkdWF0ZS1qYWNvYi1odWdnaW5zLXJlY2VpdmVzLWhpZ2gtaG9ub3Itb24td2F5LXRvLXd2dS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teen of the Week: Williamstown High School graduate Jacob Huggins receives high honor on way to WVU,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/community-news/2021/06/teen-of-the-week-williamstown-high-school-graduate-jacob-huggins-receives-high-honor-on-way-to-wvu/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzYW5kc2VudGluZWwuY29tL25ld3MvY29tbXVuaXR5LW5ld3MvMjAyMS8wNi90ZWVuLW9mLXRoZS13ZWVrLXdpbGxpYW1zdG93bi1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1ncmFkdWF0ZS1qYWNvYi1odWdnaW5zLXJlY2VpdmVzLWhpZ2gtaG9ub3Itb24td2F5LXRvLXd2dS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvZHVjay1keW5hc3R5LWJlbGxhLXJvYmVydHNvbi1tYXJyaWVzLWphY29iLW1heW_SAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2R1Y2stZHluYXN0eS1iZWxsYS1yb2JlcnRzb24tbWFycmllcy1qYWNvYi1tYXlvLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Duck Dynasty’ star Bella Robertson marries Jacob Mayo,"""Ducky Dynasty"" star Bella Robertson is a married woman.

The two confirmed their engagement on the day after Thanksgiving in 2020. Robertson spoke to Fox News about how faith has played a crucial role in their relationship and whether they plan to start a family anytime soon

""[Faith] played the biggest role in our relationship. I mean a hundred percent"" the former reality star said. ""I don’t think there’s any way we would be together without it. In the beginning we were friends for a long time who played tennis together. We had such a good time hanging out. But we ended up dating right when we started talking about real things.""

She continued: ""We started talking about our faith and that really started to connect us on a deeper level a different level than we ever had before. I grew up in a Christian household so it was meaningful to connect with someone through faith.""

JNJ,Johnson & Johnson,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvd2hhdC1tdGctd2FudHMtZnJvbS1taWtlLWpvaG5zb24tMDAxNTY0NTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What MTG wants from Mike Johnson - POLITICO,"No further aid for Ukraine;

A return to the “Hastert Rule ” meaning no legislation is brought to a vote without support from a majority of the House majority;

” meaning no legislation is brought to a vote without support from a majority of the House majority; Defunding the special counsel probes into former President Donald Trump in upcoming appropriations; and

into former President Donald Trump in upcoming appropriations; and Enforcement of the “Massie Rule” whereby government funding is automatically cut across the board if no superseding agreement is reached before a set deadline.

They’ll meet again today at 12:30 p.m. in hopes of finding a detente. Spokespeople for Greene and Johnson declined to comment on their discussions but the speaker struck a conciliatory note after yesterday’s meeting sympathizing with Greene and pledging to “keep this team together.”

Make no mistake though the pressure for Republican party unity in an election year is weighing on Greene who is battling exasperated GOP colleagues and skepticism from the party’s unquestioned leader Trump.

Johnson could be in a position to grant at least some of Greene’s asks. Since this Congress has effectively finished passing controversial must-do items such as funding the government raising the debt ceiling and extending surveillance authorities Johnson can probably stick to the Hastert Rule (named for former now-disgraced speaker Dennis Hastert).

Democrats agreed to a version of the Massie Rule during last year’s spending talks with then-speaker Kevin McCarthy — so Johnson could probably go there as well.

On Ukraine Congress just sent Kyiv $60 billion in aid — enough to last through the year by most estimates though Greene might also want to strike an expected nine-figure aid authorization in the annual Pentagon policy bill that’s expected to move later this year.

But defunding special counsel Jack Smith’s Trump investigations could be much trickier. Front-line Republicans in the past have balked at such demands to say nothing of Democrats. If Greene is expecting Johnson to put up a fight on a much-anticipated September continuing resolution that would be a recipe for a federal shutdown just weeks before the election.

The two sides don’t have a deal yet — and might never get one — but it’s clear temperatures are dropping. A handshake solution after all is in the interest of both parties: It would spare Johnson a risky vote where he’d be relying on the generosity of Democrats to save his gavel.

And for Greene her relationship with Trump and his inner circle is on the line we’re told. The former president “could not have been clearer” one person close to him said last night in signaling that he isn’t interested in any more intraparty drama this election season.

Why it matters: Johnson told donors Sunday night in D.C. that the House GOP should consider rules changes next Congress to ensure a majority of the GOP gets its way.

Johnson's comments to donors were first reported by Punchbowl News.

Zoom in: Restoring rules that reflect the majority of the majority would affect the speakership in two primary ways.

1) It would fix the crippled House Rules Committee.

Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's appointment of hardliners like Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Chip Roy (R-Texas) has effectively lost the GOP's majority on the committee that controls what legislation reaches the House floor.

On must-pass legislation the speaker has to skip the committee and instead work with Democrats to pass votes with a 2/3 majority.

Democrats ""effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority"" Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday.

2) It would protect the speakership by not letting a motion to vacate be called by a single member.

Just eight House Republicans were able to secure the historic ouster of McCarthy.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's campaign to oust Johnson has even fewer public backers but would succeed if Democrats weren't prepared to save the speaker.

Between the lines: Conservatives are furious about talks of changes to the rules arguing they are in place to keep leaders accountable.

But one senior lawmaker noted that McCarthy's decision to change the rules left Johnson with little leverage — such as ""chairmanships and gavels and fancy offices"" to placate his critics after he took over the gavel.

Another senior lawmaker who is in favor of changing the rules particularly the motion to vacate threshold noted the difficulties of doing so mid-Congress with a razor-thin majority.

The GOP lawmaker said the rules changes at the start of the Congress under McCarthy were a mistake. ""Because you can't undo all that if they turn out to be problems for the whole conference. You cannot undo them.""

The bottom line: The crippled speakership has forced Johnson to violate the same majority of the majority principle he told donors about restoring which used to be known as the Hastert Rule.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvaG91c2UvNDY0NzQ5MC1ncmVlbmUtam9obnNvbi1vdXN0ZXItdm90ZS1vZmYtcmFtcC_SAVNodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL2hvdXNlLzQ2NDc0OTAtZ3JlZW5lLWpvaG5zb24tb3VzdGVyLXZvdGUtb2ZmLXJhbXAvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greene signals possible offramp for Johnson ouster vote,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4647490-greene-johnson-ouster-vote-off-ramp/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvaG91c2UvNDY0NzQ5MC1ncmVlbmUtam9obnNvbi1vdXN0ZXItdm90ZS1vZmYtcmFtcC_SAVNodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL2hvdXNlLzQ2NDc0OTAtZ3JlZW5lLWpvaG5zb24tb3VzdGVyLXZvdGUtb2ZmLXJhbXAvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFyam9yaWUtdGF5bG9yLWdyZWVuZS1taWtlLWpvaG5zb24tY29tbWl0dGVlcy1tb3Rpb24tdmFjYXRlLTIwMjQtNdIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFyam9yaWUtdGF5bG9yLWdyZWVuZS1taWtlLWpvaG5zb24tY29tbWl0dGVlcy1tb3Rpb24tdmFjYXRlLTIwMjQtNT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MTG dares Johnson to kick her off committees again: 'Badge of honor',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='businessinsider.mx', port=443): Read timed out.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. is vowing call up a vote this week to oust Speaker Mike Johnson R-La.

While her move is expected to fail with House Democrats already vowing to save Johnson and stave off another extended speakership vacancy there are still concerns among members about the chaos that could follow another ousting.

And a potential successor to Johnson remains unclear.

Greene has yet to name her favorite but said last Wednesday she thinks ""we have people that are capable."" Contenders could include the same lawmakers who sought the job after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. was removed in October.

Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide

Steve Scalise

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise R-La. was his party's first nominee to replace McCarthy last fall. But the Louisiana Republican withdrew from the race a day later following skepticism that he would be able to garner enough support to win the gavel.

The No. 2 ranking House Republican Scalise was diagnosed with a treatable form of blood cancer in August.

Jim Jordan

Following Scalise's short-lived span as speaker nominee in October House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan R-Ohio was next up for the job. But after three rounds in which Jordan failed each time to earn enough votes the GOP ultimately decided to drop him.

Jordan has helped lead Republicans' impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden alongside House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer R-Ky.

Tom Emmer

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer R-Minn. put his name in the speakership race soon after Jordan's exit.

The No. 3 House Republican had an endorsement from McCarthy who has since left Congress. But just hours after becoming the GOP's third nominee Emmer withdrew in the face of criticism from House conservatives – and former President Donald Trump.

Emmer's step back cleared the way for Johnson's nomination and successful election.

Wildcards

If the speakership were to be rendered vacant again the floodgates could open again and other GOP lawmakers could throw their hat in the ring alongside the three major previous speaker candidates.

Alongside Scalise Jordan and Emmer a handful of other GOP lawmakers sought the speakership last year as well. Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. chair of the Republican Study Committee the largest caucus of House Republicans ran thrice for speaker last year.

Rep. Byron Donalds R-Fla. a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus and a rising star in the Republican party could also run again for speaker after previously making a bid last year.

Other lawmakers who ran for speaker last year include Reps. Austin Scott R-Ga. who launched a protest bid against Jordan and Gary Palmer R-Ala. chair of the House Republican Policy Committee.

Some previously floated members who ultimately did not run last year could jump in this time around. Some Republicans raised the chair of the House Budget Committee Jodey Arrington R-Texas as a potential consensus candidate last year but the Texas Republican declined to run.

Chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee Tom Cole R-Okla. considered an institutionalist on Capitol Hill and respected on both sides of the aisle was also brought up as a candidate but the long-serving lawmaker stayed out of the race.

But it's unclear if any of these candidates considering how they all either failed to win last year or didn't run could turn things around and unite a deeply fractured House Republican conference that controls the lower chamber with just a one-vote margin.

The secret to his potential success as new chief executive of the Carr's Group? A strong focus and a steely business mind. Three months into Hugh’s appointment earlier this year the Carlisle-headquartered agricultural and engineering group reported bumper interim results despite “a “challenging operational environment”. The Group reported a £10.9m adjusted operating profit in the 26 weeks to February 27 – a 5.3 per cent increase over the same period last year. Its engineering order books stand at £44m an increase of £7m.

Hugh said at the time of the announcement that the Group had delivered and improved performance compared to the previous year despite working through the challenges of Covid-19.

Hugh presents a picture of fitness for a man on the wrong side of 50 thanks to a life of sturdy exercise. This has been underpinned by a competitive streak which shone through when he was Oxford bow in the famed boat race against Cambridge in 1987.

He made something of a name for himself when he bowed Oxford in the race which saw Oxford’s crew rebel after four Americans refused to row in a dispute over the make-up of the crew. The tale is outlined in the book True Blue: The Oxford Boat Race Mutiny in which Pelham gets a mention.

So Hugh who is married with two daughters is used to being at the helm whether that be heading up a business or part of a successful rowing crew. His life on the rugby pitch – his second sport - was somewhat short-lived.

He says: “I played a little at school but rowing has always been my sport. Even now I do the occasional veteran race.”

Hugh 54 who holds a BA in Engineering Economics and Management from Oxford and an MBA from the Cranfield School of Management says: “I believe very much in achievements. I am a competitive person and see certain parallels with business and rowing. A disciplined clear mental programme is essential together with a focused mind of steel if you want to succeed. This is an attitude I have brought to Carr's.”

Hugh succeeds Yorkshireman Tim Davies who as previous CEO helped steer the company through tough times in the world of grain and agriculture for more than 30 years.

With more than three decades of experience under his belt developing and growing businesses Hugh came to Carlisle from Australia-based multinational corporation Orica - one of the world's largest providers of commercial explosives and blasting systems to the mining quarrying oil gas and construction markets.

After studying engineering at Oxford Hugh went into the construction industry with John Mowlem and Co which was heavily involved in the building of London City Airport the NatWest Tower and a number of motorways across the UK.

Never one to give up on a job it is ironic Hugh was in charge of such jobs as “painting the Forth Bridge” when he headed up a major painting and scaffolding business. The well-known phrase describes “a never-ending job.” Apt for a man determined to get the job done properly.

After that Hugh worked for American company Johnson Controls which made seat-belts before being approached to become managing director of the Pyeroy Group a provider of specialist coatings and fabric maintenance services to the oil gas chemical marine and rail industries which was later sold to the Wood Group.

Having personally invested in the business with its founder Pyeroy Group Limited was sold to Wood Group in 2013 with Hugh remaining as managing director of Wood Group Industrial Services Limited. Over a 15-year period the business grew from sales of £34m to £140m.

After six months off in the south of France where he has a house Hugh was again headhunted - this time by global giant Australia-based Orica. Then towards the end of 2020 the CEO role came available at Carr's Group.

""It sounded really interesting; an opportunity to become CEO of a listed company with a long history and a sound business sense” says Hugh.

The move was a good one both professionally and domestically; living in the Scottish Borders the family can reap the benefits of rural life.

“My wife Sally is a solicitor by qualification. She is also a governor at Northumbria University and is involved in educational charities such as Seven Stories the National Centre for Children's Books in Newcastle Upon Tyne so it is good geographically for her” he explains.

“One of my daughters Josie is commercial manager with the Deliveroo food delivery company while my other daughter Tessa is finishing a degree in English at York.

“We have a good life where I can indulge my love of dog walking rowing and quiet downtime while facing the challenges of working for a Cumbrian business with a global outlook. It is the best of both worlds; a good work-life balance.

“One of the advantages of leading Carr's Group is getting to relocate to this beautiful region where a third of our employees are also located.”

But despite being an adoptive Scot there is one tradition which he can’t get to grips with.

He says: “I may live north of the border but I wouldn’t thank you for a wee dram. I like a pint of real ale or a good wine but I am not a spirits fan.”

One difference from his former life is that Hugh doesn’t expect to do as much travelling as he did in his globe-trotting days – his office walls are adorned with world maps in particular South America.

“There was a lot of travel before I came to Carr's particularly with Orica. With Carr's there won’t be as much travel involved but we do have business interests in America and Germany so there will be a certain amount of business travel” he says.

Hugh is looking forward to moving on through the next phase of his career with Carr's which he says is on a “good trajectory” through its various sectors despite the challenges of lockdown.

“The group has a solid heritage and a good future ahead and I have very much enjoyed what I have seen from visiting its operational sites.”

For man with a strong track record of generating value through the achievement of both long-term profitable growth and successful business Hugh has his feet firmly on the ground recognising the task he has in hand of caretaking such an historic company with deep roots in the Cumbrian landscape and further afield.

When he began work at the beginning of the year Hugh clearly recognised the job ahead.

He said at the time: “Whilst the pandemic means that my first few months will be somewhat different from what I had envisaged I will of course be familiarising myself with the business as intensely as possible and meeting albeit virtually with all of the teams.

“I will not however be forgetting that at heart this is a Cumbrian business but with a global outlook.”

Announcing the interim results in April Hugh acknowledged the challenges facing the business. He said at the time: “Despite a challenging operational environment with significant headwinds experienced in engineering we have delivered an improved performance compared to the same period last year.

""Our Speciality Agriculture and Agricultural Supplies divisions have performed particularly strongly. The outlook for engineering is for an improved performance in the second half of the financial year.

The American investment bank and financial services firm is partnering with Airport Dimensions to develop the Chase Sapphire Lounge by The Club brand “with locations to be announced in select markets over time”.

Details on lounge facilities and access eligibility have yet to be announced but the “Sapphire” part of the brand name suggests that they will be aimed at the group’s Sapphire credit card holders.

In a press release JPMorgan Chase said:

“For more than a decade Chase Sapphire has activated lounges across the country at marquee events serving as hubs for unique access at culinary entertainment and cultural experiences. That same inspiration will come to life in airports providing access to exceptional authentic and regionally inspired food drink art entertainment and wellness.”

Over time the lounges are likely to go head to head with American Express’ network of Centurion lounges developed for the firm’s premium card holders. Credit card specialist Capital One also recently announced plans to launch its own airport lounges starting with locations at Dallas Fort Worth and Washington Dulles.

Collinson-owned Airport Dimensions operates a network of airport lounges worldwide under The Club and Club Aspire brands with forthcoming locations including Cleveland Hopkins International Charlotte Douglas International and San Francisco International.

Commenting on the new venture Mignon Buckingham CEO of Airport Dimensions said:

“This partnership further strengthens Airport Dimensions’ position as the innovative force in improving the airport experience and driving non-aeronautical revenues for airports.

“Our unrivalled insights into what specific passengers are looking for and our understanding of both the physical and digital environment allows us to build an offer that is tailored to customer’s needs.

“This coupled with JPMorgan Chase’s reputation for providing customers with unique and exceptional value notably through the popular Chase Sapphire brand will result in a unique and elevated experience.”

The country’s largest lender was among many corporations that paused political giving following the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riots when supporters of former president Donald Trump tried to stop Congress from certifying the election.

Just hours later 147 Republicans the vast majority of them in the House of Representatives voted to overturn the Electoral College results which Trump falsely claimed were tainted by fraud.

Following a review JPMorgan will this month resume giving through its Political Action Committee (PAC) but will continue its freeze on donations to a “handful” of the 147 lawmakers whom it had previously supported the bank said.

The pause will last through the 2021-2022 election cycle which includes November’s midterm elections after which JPMorgan will review whether to resume contributions to the lawmakers concerned on an individual basis it said.

“This was a unique and historic moment when we believe the country needed our elected officials to put aside strongly held differences and demonstrate unity” the bank wrote of the Jan. 6 vote to certify Biden’s win.

Also on Friday Citigroup said it was resuming PAC contributions but did not specify how it would treat the lawmakers who tried to block Biden taking office.

Citigroup said it would evaluate whether to give to all lawmakers case-by-case based on a new set of criteria which includes “character and integrity” and “a commitment to bipartisanship and democratic institutions.”

JPMorgan noted that its PAC is an important tool for engaging in the political process in the United States. PACs are political committees organized for the purpose of raising cash to support or in some cases oppose election candidates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpdHN0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvaW52ZXN0L2ZpcmVkLXRoZW4tYm91bmNlZC1iYWNrLXRvLWJlLWJhbmtpbmctZ2lhbnQtanBtb3JnYW4tY2hhc2VzLWNmb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fired then bounced back to be banking giant JPMorgan Chase's CFO,"(BLOOMBERG) - The curriculum vitae isn't quite what you would expect for someone who's about to handle the finances of the mighty JPMorgan Chase. Long before Mr Jeremy Barnum was promoted to chief financial officer (CFO) he was fired over a trading mishap - by JPMorgan. He later parted ways with hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management over another market blunder.

But then began his second act. JPMorgan lured him back in 2007 with a vague mandate to help with its credit-trading operations - shifting from free-wheeling big-money-wagering roles to the nuts and bolts of the operation. Soon after Mr Daniel Pinto now chief executive Jamie Dimon's top lieutenant took a liking to Mr Barnum helping his ascent.

Lots of people bounce back but Mr Barnum's rise to CFO of the banking giant is an unlikely Wall Street tale. He helped pioneer credit derivatives got tossed out of trading roles at sell-side and buy-side firms refocused on tackling risks and won benefactors in JPMorgan's top rungs.

""Most people on Wall Street have some form of career setback in their life and recovering from it is what makes them better in their job"" said JPMorgan's head of global markets Troy Rohrbaugh.

Parts of Mr Barnum's resume read like those of many others in Wall Street's corridors of power: Born in New York attended the elite Groton boarding school in Massachusetts then Harvard.

But before going to Groton Mr Barnum 48 spent his youth in a bohemian neighbourhood of Barcelona with his pianist mother picking up Spanish and Catalan and listening to a spectrum of economic debate that included anarcho-syndicalism.

""You get to know him a little bit and he's just different than all the other Groton and Harvard people"" said Mr Gus Christensen a former banker who left Wall Street for politics. They've been friends since joining the bank together in 1994 when Mr Barnum armed with a chemistry degree showed up in a second-hand Brooks Brothers suit.

Mr Christensen and others noted that Mr Barnum's time overseas had left him talking differently from his peers. ""He speaks like a movie actor in the 1930s - he has a little bit of a lockjaw. It's not a way of speaking in English that I had heard from anyone else in my generation.""

After a half-decade on desks handling foreign exchange options and emerging markets derivatives Mr Barnum landed in 1999 on the credit derivatives team where he could put his prowess with maths and structuring to work. That placed him at the nexus of rapid change in the market - and within JPMorgan itself.

The firm was pioneering credit default swaps contracts that work like insurance to reimburse investors if a borrower fails to pay up. It was also in the midst of mergers and acquisitions that would culminate in 2004 with its combination with Mr Dimon's Bank One Corp.

That year JPMorgan's results in fixed income faltered. When Mr Barnum's team lost a bundle his name was added to a list of dismissals as the bank set out to restructure the unit. He sent his co-workers a tongue-in-cheek farewell e-mail recommending that they closely study the career of Josef Stalin's henchman Lavrentiy Beria and get really good at PowerPoint.

Mr Barnum was soon snapped up by BlueMountain which named him head of its London office in 2005. The next year the fund took a bath on wrong-way credit bets linked to Liberty Global's Cablecom prompting another ouster for him. In a statement at the time a senior BlueMountain executive said his exit was ""mutually agreed"".

Then came the uncanny turnaround. JPMorgan gave him a second chance and a new mission: Instead of making wagers himself he would use his trading experience and the lessons he learnt to help oversee businesses spot risks and head off trouble. In 2007 he rejoined JPMorgan right as two of Bear Stearns' hedge funds were blowing up.

By 2010 he was indispensable to his bosses and on the rise having helped the firm dodge bullets from the financial crisis. Two years later he became CFO of the global markets division and the following year was elevated to finance chief of the entire corporate and investment bank.

He also helped clean up one of Mr Dimon's biggest headaches - the so-called London Whale trading scandal in which a group that was supposed to oversee the bank's excess cash lost billions on botched credit default swap bets. JPMorgan's antagonist in the debacle happened to be BlueMountain Mr Barnum's former employer. The lender ended up relying on the hedge fund to help resolve the positions and put the issue to rest.

Mr Pinto who oversees the firm's investment bank was named to become the sole president and chief operating officer at the end of the year. And in the same announcement Mr Dimon elevated Mr Barnum to CFO.

Some are keen to see how Mr Barnum interacts with analysts and investors. He's known to love a good debate and is rarely at a loss for words.

""He's the kind of guy you would be sitting at a dinner table and talking about Russian politics in 1913 and he would still know more about it than you"" said Mr Shahraab Ahmad who worked for him during his first stint at JPMorgan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmZXJsLm9yZy9hL3J1c3NpYW4tb3Bwb3NpdGlvbi1wb2xpdGljaWFuLWd1ZGtvdi1sZWZ0LXJ1c3NpYS8zMTI5MzI1Ny5odG1s0gFYaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmZlcmwub3JnL2FtcC9ydXNzaWFuLW9wcG9zaXRpb24tcG9saXRpY2lhbi1ndWRrb3YtbGVmdC1ydXNzaWEvMzEyOTMyNTcuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russian Opposition Politician Gudkov Says He Has Left Country Amid Fear Of Arrest,"Russian opposition politician and former lawmaker Dmitry Gudkov said he has fled the country amid concern he could be arrested on what he called trumped up charges.

Gudkov was detained in Moscow on June 1 over an allegedly unpaid debt on a rented property dating from several years ago. He was released on June 3 without being formally charged.

""I am approaching Kyiv"" he said on Facebook in a June 6 post he confirmed to AFP as genuine. “Several sources close to the presidential administration said that if I do not leave the country the fake criminal case will continue until my arrest.”

Aleksei Navalny the most prominent Russian opposition leader was detained in January as he arrived from Germany on charges of violating his parole and sentenced to serve 2 1/2 years in prison.

He said he believed the case was launched to force him out of the country at least until parliamentary elections in September. Gudkov is a former member of parliament.

“I hope that with my departure the zeal of the gendarmes will decrease. My decision was supported by my family and friends who also received serious information about threats and risks” he said in the Facebook post.

Russian authorities opened a criminal case against his father Gennady Gudkov a former State Duma deputy and Kremlin critic who lives in Bulgaria on June 3 over ammunition allegedly found at his apartment in Russia local media reported.

According to media reports the ammunition was found during a search conducted in the case involving his son.

There was no official confirmation of the criminal case against Gennady Gudkov from officials.

A North Carolina county banned Coca-Cola vending machines in the wake of the Georgia voting law.

Surry County officials voted to remove them after Coca-Cola's negative comments NBC News reported.

The Georgia law ""is unacceptable it is a step backward"" Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey told CNBC.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Officials in a North Carolina county removed Coca-Cola vending machines from their offices after the soda-maker's chief executive spoke out against a voting law in Georgia

In a letter sent to Coca-Cola executives a Surry County official said Coca-Cola's comments on Georgia's controversial voting law were a ""disappointment"" NBC News reported.

""Our Board hopes that other organizations across the country are taking similar stances against Coca-Cola and sincerely wishes that future marketing efforts and comments emanating from your company are more considerate of all your customers' viewpoints"" Eddie Harris Surry County commissioner wrote in a letter viewed by NBC's ""Today.""

Critics said the Georgia law SB 202 ""The Election Integrity Act of 2021"" added restrictions to the voting process that amounted to voter suppression. President Joe Biden in a statement in March said the law was ""a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience.""

Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey joined a handful of high-profile company executives in denouncing the law earlier this year with many saying it restricted the right to vote. Coca-Cola is headquartered in Georgia.

""Let me be crystal clear and unequivocal this legislation is unacceptable it is a step backward"" Quincey told CNBC in late March.

Apple CEO Tim Cook also commented on the law saying it ""ought to be easier than ever for every eligible citizen to exercise their right to vote.""

The move by North Carolina officials followed a call from former President Donald Trump in April to boycott ""woke"" companies opposing the law.

Trump's comments came after Major League Baseball relocated its All-Star game out of Georgia. He urged conservatives to ""fight back"" by boycotting Coca-Cola Delta JPMorgan Chase and other companies that opposed the law.

NBC News reported on Friday that Surry County officials said Coca-Cola supported the ""out-of-control cancel culture and bigoted leftist mob"" that fought back against the law.

""We decided we wanted to push back against this woke cancel culture push back against Coca-Cola because they were one of the ones out front"" Harris told Fox News on Friday.

He said he'd received hundreds of emails in support of the ban which he said could lead to a boycott of the company. He said local citizens supported the removal.







""They're absolutely sick and tired of this outrageous left-wing mob that is attacking freedom of speech attacking people's jobs that is completely out of control in this country"" Harris told Fox News.

In statements to Fox News and NBC News Coca-Cola said its local staffers had reached out to county commissioners about the ban."

Money for the five state-funded diaper banks now in operation – in Los Angeles Orange San Diego Fresno and San Francisco counties – and three new ones would extend over a three-year period with each diaper bank receiving a total of $3.75 million under the spending plan proposed by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez D-San Diego and supported by a host of Southern California legislators.

Job loss and other economic hardships imposed on families by the coronavirus pandemic along with spikes in the cost of disposable diapers is sending more parents with young children to the diaper banks and other social service organizations looking for help.

Just as COVID-19 sparked food insecurity on a scale not seen before by local food banks demand for diaper assistance rose exponentially over the past year say operators of the five state-subsidized diaper banks which are part of the National Diaper Bank Network.

Community Action Partnership of Orange County operates one of the county’s two food banks and its only community-based diaper bank which is part of the National Diaper Bank Network. Since it launched the service has distributed 10.7 million diapers – in allotments of 50 diapers a month per child. That adds up to diapering an average of 37000 baby bottoms a month.

“The need for diapers is a crisis” said Gregory Scott president and chief executive officer of the nonprofit.

“Just as food and hunger is a crisis.”

Strong support

In a letter authored by Gonzalez and addressed to leaders in the state legislature who are working on budget negotiations under a June 15 deadline more than two dozen Southern California state legislators from both sides of the aisle signed their support for extending and expanding the state’s Diaper Bank Program.

The initial round of funding for the diaper program pushed for by Gonzalez and established in 2018 is set to expire this year. The diaper banks rely as well on contributions of cash and donations of diapers mainly through diaper drives such as HomeAid Orange County’s annual Essentials Diaper Drive that takes place during May and June.

Orange County is the most recent of the five state-subsidized diaper banks approved in 2019 and awarded $1.7 million in funding for two years. It launched on March 18 2020 right at the start of the statewide COVID-19 shutdown. The diapers are provided free to eligible families served by 70 partner agencies in a collaborative network.

The $30 million request would boost the annual allotment to each diaper bank by $250000. And besides creating a new diaper bank in the Inland Empire to be run by Community Action Partnership of San Bernardino County which also oversees a food bank the proposed new funding would expand the state program to Sacramento and Sonoma counties.

Community Action Partnership in San Bernardino works with more than 250 organizations to distribute food hygiene products and other items. “Diapers are always at the top of the list of needed items” said Patricia L. Nickles-Butler president and chief executive officer.

Requests for diapers are made on a daily basis and in a recently completed community needs assessment 58% of responses identified diapers as a “high need” Nickles-Butler said.

The pandemic has only worsened the need especially among single parents diaper bank supporters say.

“Long before the pandemic one in three families across the country struggled to afford enough diapers and Latina and Black mothers were significantly more likely to report diaper need” the letter authored by Assemblywoman Gonzalez states citing findings from a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2013.

“Now more than 2.1 million Californians remain unemployed” and face tough choices the letter continues.

“Many families must decide between buying diapers or groceries or paying their rent.”

Cost increases

The families served by the Community Action Partnership organizations in Orange and San Bernardino counties have tended to be people with jobs in the service industry that was hit hard by the economic shutdown during the pandemic. But there are new faces among them – folks with once-comfortable middle-class lifestyles Scott said.

“Sometimes we take for granted something so basic as diapers for our babies. But for some families that’s a big expense.”

Companies that make disposable diapers including Kimberly-Clark and its Huggies and Pull-Ups brands have already started raising prices or announced hikes in the near future – part of increased costs of household goods as the economy improves. Under the headline “Millions of Americans about to get hit with diaper sticker shock” CNN reported in April that both Kimberly-Clark and Procter & Gamble (Pampers Luvs and All Good diapers) planned mid-to-high single-digit percentage increases.

That news came on top of an 8.7% hike in disposable diaper prices during the year that ended April 10 according to CNN’s reporting on NielsenIQ’s tracking of retail sales data.

At a Target in Santa Ana on Friday June 4 a 124-count package of Huggies “Snug & Dry” Size 1 disposable diapers (for babies 8 to 14 pounds) was priced at $24.99; a 168-count package of Size 3 for children 16 to 28 pounds cost $37.99. Online at Walmart.com a 256-count of the same Size 1 diapers cost $48.47; a 210-count of Size 3 sold for $83.28 – both described as a one-month supply.

The expense is only compounded if more than one child is still in diapers. And baby wipes go along with that.

At best diaper banks – either through free or low-cost fees – supplement what parents buy on their own. According to research by the National Diaper Bank Network parents tend to end up about a dozen diapers short by the end of every week.

The monthly 50 diapers per baby from the Orange County Diaper Bank Scott said “is meant to fill that gap.”

Diaper drive

Because of the economic impact of COVID-19 and diaper price increases the Orange County Diaper Bank coronavirus relief from the state has allowed distribution of an additional monthly box of diapers – with anywhere from 64 to 104 diapers depending on diaper size – per child said diaper bank manager Natalie Anderson.

Through the end of 2020 the diaper bank provided surplus diapers to 15 to 20 additional local organizations outside of its regular collaborative network of 40 agencies. But in just the past six months that number climbed to 30 Anderson said.

Even with the subsidy from the state donations from the community have been and will remain vital to keep up with demand diaper bank operators say.

Last year a mostly digital HomeAid Essentials Diaper Drive the single largest such effort in Orange County collected 960000 diapers for families experiencing homelessness. Businesses service groups and others host sites for diaper collection over several weeks.

About 20 sites open to the public for this year’s drive are listed online at homeaidoc.org/events/2021-essentials-diaper-drive/; donations also can be made through HomeAid Orange County’s Amazon.com registry at buff.ly/38EaZJJ.

The drive ends on Friday June 11 when the collected diapers will be dropped off from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the parking lot off Lewis Street at Christ Cathedral 13280 Chapman Ave Garden Grove. Individual donors can also drop off packaged diapers and baby wipes that day. And as is tradition people who make a living building homes will compete in creating mini-structures using packaged diapers.

“We will still have diaper structures from local homebuilding teams all showcasing something iconic from California” said Gina Scott executive director of HomeAid Orange County.

Meenakshi (she/her/hers) is the policing & criminalization campaigner at Pivot Legal Society. In 2019 she compiled feedback on proposed accessibility legislation in BC Report Back from Independent Community Consultations based on feedback from five community consultations in the DTES.

Introduction

Since February 2021 Q has been facilitating disability education at Pivot first through a series of workshops entitled Ableism 101 Accessibility 101 and Disability Culture & History 101. It is currently working with Pivot to complete a Radical Access Mapping Project (“RAMP”) accessibility audit of our physical space.

Q’s work at Pivot has taken us beyond the liberal frames of “access” and “inclusion” and instead challenges us to make essential connections between our campaign areas and the legacy of disability justice organizing.

LISTEN: DTES suite / burials underfoot - a furious journey with Q Lawrence

These connections are essential to addressing access and inclusion of disabled folks and communities within our work. This blog serves as an introduction to the work we are doing for Pivot’s followers and supporters and we invite you to begin thinking about what accessibility means to you. We’ve also highlighted and put together some resources that may be useful.

Ableism is a systemic oppression that allows society systems and individuals to assign value to people based on their appearance and their ability to re/produce excel and behave. Ableism evaluates people on their divergence (whether actual or perceived) from constructed ideas of normality intelligence excellence and productivity. In the united states [and canada] these constructions are necessarily rooted as is the country itself in anti-Blackness anti-Indigeneity misogyny eugenics colonialism and capitalism.

~ TL Lewis Disability Justice Is an Essential Part of Abolishing Police and Prisons (October 6 2020)

Disability Rights

When folks first consider disability through a social justice lens the Disability Rights framework begins to surface. The Disability Rights framework attempts to improve disabled lives through fighting for civil rights and protections. Disability Rights activists have worked hard to change the fate of innumerable disabled people across so-called Canada and globally.

Disability organizers and leaders continue to fight against ableist violence such as institutionalization

Here disability organizers and leaders especially those with intellectual disabilities fought and continue to fight against ableist violence such as institutionalization and for equal and equitable access to transportation education housing and a great many more things disabled people are frequently barred from.

Activists demanded self-determination self-respect and equality and did so by supplanting the medical and charity models of disability with the social model that distinguishes between impairment and disability...A hard fought outcome of disability rights activism in the 1970s was the Canadian Human Rights Act passed in 1977. This statute included disability as a prohibited ground of discrimination and was a significant step forward in granting disabled Canadians legal equality.

~ Joshua St. Pierre Disability Rights (April 28 2014)

Advocates and activists have made immense strides in changing the fabric of disability politics and life. Ableist violence however remains. Most recently this was evident in support for eugenicist Bill C-7. Non-disabled people in Canada rely on the propaganda of “niceness” “universal healthcare” and pointing to the USA to defend a wall of non-disabled inaction and dismissal. These defenses deliberately ignore the intersections of settler-colonialism white supremacy and other intersections that shape the lives of disabled people.

Leftists and progressives have upheld these problematic beliefs and systems and fail to understand “solutions” like institutionalization coercive medical practices deemed consent and other dehumanizing interventions as extensions of the prison-industrial-complex though they very clearly are. On many occasions the institutional “Left” in Canada has supported eugenics including the aforementioned Bill C-7. Through the work of disabled activists in the early spring these connections became apparent culminating in the broadcast of the Disability Filibuster

[The Canadian left did not] consider the way disabled people are disproportionately represented in prisons where they may select the ‘choice’ between a lengthy sentence without the proper care and supports they need for their condition or a doctor giving them a lethal injection to be anything other than progressive freedom.

They did not think of another creation of the Canadian carceral state the horrors of which were long known and spoken about by disabled people but were only now hitting the news enough to register with non-disabled people – long term care nursing homes and other congregate care settings.

The Canadian left progressives and social justice movements fail to demonstrate even the most minuscule of solidarity with disabled people’s struggle actively exclude us from their own activism and advocate against our interests far too often.

~ Gabrielle Peters Disability Filibuster and What Access Is and Is Not. (May 30 2021)

In the above quote Gabrielle Peters challenges the left progressives and social justice movements to understand solidarity beyond awareness and anti-discrimination. Peters recounts the ways disabled people are left behind which is reflected in among other things disabled people facing homelessness at disproportionate rates a lack of adequate (or any) mental health supports food insecurity and increasingly insurmountable barriers to things such as medications and treatment many of which are not included in so-called Canada’s so-called “universal” healthcare.

Being left behind is a product of intersecting oppressions and these experiences demand that we must go beyond the single-issue lens of Disability Rights to consider what equity safety and ending ableist violence would entail. We know people are routinely left behind when they do not fit into a “single-box.” We know that people who are poor racialized and whose survival activities are criminalized are pushed even further to the margins. We even know that this creates a culture where police can target people with disabilities.

Disability Justice

A Second Wave of political disability thought has been growing: the Disability Justice Movement. Originally Disability Justice was developed in large part by disabled activists of colour Mia Mingus Patty Berne and Stacey Milbern (may her memory be a blessing) who were soon joined by Leroy Moore Eli Clare and Sebastian Margaret. Disability Justice is considered by many to be the beginning of the reckoning required in disability organizing globally.

The use of strategic litigation as the foremost mode of resistance is...deeply suspect for radical disability activists. From this perspective disability rights are inseparable from the struggle over the definitional boundaries of normalcy. Radical disability activists seek to unsettle ‘normalcy’ as a natural and stable concept thereby making space for non-normative modes of embodied existence within society.

~ Joshua St. Pierre Disability Rights (April 28 2014)

In fighting for civil rights Disability Rights movements around the world have long neglected the effects race class gender sexuality citizenship status incarceration and other compounding identities and experiences have on the ways one navigates and is impacted by disability. This has contributed to queer trans disabled people and disabled people of colour in particular being left behind to continue to experience and hold their own against ableist violence.

The Principles of Disability Justice are an attempt at articulating these rifts and differences and building a framework of meaningfully and actionably organizing with them at the forefront of all demands and progress as opposed to in spite of them in a single-issue manner.

It must be said that both Disability Justice and Disability Rights frameworks include an understanding that calls for “access awareness” fall short in addressing systemic harms. Rather than awareness leftist and progressive education on ableism and inaccessibility must be rooted in answering calls to action and demands for improved solidarity including greater attention to access and accessibility of professional and grassroots organizing across movements. To be aware of ableism and do nothing is to be complicit; to understand the importance and urgency of access and neglect it is to deny disabled freedom.

Disability & Criminalization

Although the violence of criminalization is apparent across Pivot’s campaign areas the intersections with disability are often invisibilized due to ableism. Over the last year police and prison abolition has gained traction in mainstream conversations evident in the enduring calls to defund the police across so-called Canada. Disability justice organizers however have challenged abolitionists to expand their vision of a world without police and prisons to include a world free of institutionalization. We know that people with mental illness continue to be criminalized rather than receive care-based interventions. Care-based interventions however still rely on coercive practices embedded in the Mental Health Act

Beyond Alternatives: Disability Madness and Prison Abolition

We also recognize that racism persists in all institutions - including the BC healthcare system evidenced by Dr. Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond’s 2020 report In Plain Sight; we know that disabled Indigenous people are at constant risk of racist violence. As the BC Aboriginal Network on Disability Society notes “the Indigenous population of Canada experiences a disability rate much higher than that of the general population at approximately 30% to 35%. Additionally many Indigenous communities are affected by minimal economical and employment opportunities remoteness accessibility barriers transportation issues limited access to necessary disability health and social services and their associated professionals limited community amenities and so forth all of which impact their memberships ability to reach their full social and economic inclusion.”

If we are looking to address police violence then we have to address how disabled people of colour particularly Indigenous & Black disabled people are overrepresented in police-involved killings - at a rate of approximately 68% according to CBC feature Deadly Force. Unfortunately there are no databases or reliable analysis for disability statistics of disabled & Mad people killed or injured during police encounters as the Canadian government does not even explicitly or implicitly include disabled people in the census. The call to defund and dismantle policing therefore must take up the work of disability justice.

Making Connections to Pivot’s Work

Through Pivot’s work with Q we are working to develop a responsive approach to access rooted in the principles of Disability Justice. We witness barriers that people face - particularly when we consider the experiences of people who rely on public space people who use (il)licit substances people working in informal and criminalized economies and people who are institutionalized by carceral systems such as prisons and psychiatric facilities.

Singular and one-off practices do not constitute disability justice.

We must however turn our awareness into collective and community-based work and shift from the “checklist” approach to access. Singular and one-off practices do not constitute disability justice.

At Pivot we’ve been primed to think about access and inclusion in tandem with stigma and discrimination we are also acutely aware of stigma and discrimination including anti-drug user and anti-homeless stigma as detailed in Project Inclusion. When we #SayYesToAccess we must investigate whose liberation is prioritized which in turn informs who is able to attend and participate in meaningful ways.

Pivot is still in the nascent stages of overhauling our work which will include addressing inaccessibility in digital and online communications as well as fostering a culture of disability justice throughout our campaigns operations development and administrative work. In our past work this has included ethical substance use navigators as well as facilitating access to transportation food and ASL interpretation. Increasingly we are adding alt-text to our social media and invite all organizations to undertake this practice.

If I don’t feel fully human and especially if I am made to feel less human then the place or space or thing or policy or system or attitude is not accessible to me. At a very core and fundamental level it means I fall outside your definition of human.

Accessibility is about the ability to be. Without explanation.

Accessibility is about belonging without earning. You belong because you are.

Accessibility is about connection to others to life and to our own selves.

Accessibility is acceptance.

Pivot is immensely grateful to Q for sharing their expertise in this blog and through its inclusion workshops and auditing of our work.

Photo: Thiago Prudencio / SOPA Images/Sipa USA (SIPA USA/PA Images)

Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) giant Klarna's boss has said that the company's IPO location is not a clear cut decision as the UK plans to overhaul both listing rules and regulations on the sector.

Billionaire co-founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in an interview with the Sunday Times that at the moment his company would likely look to list in the US as the UK's financial watchdog looks to tighten the rules around BNPL lending.

""It’s more likely that Klarna would list in the US but are we going to consider London? Are there elements of how you guys are thinking about changing the rules around listings that could make it more attractive for us? Absolutely"" said Siemiatkowski.

The recent UK listing review spearheaded by chancellor Rishi Sunak has proposed changes to listing rules and the prospectus regime. This was seen as a positive step in bringing the UK equity market in line with more attractive non-UK financial centres particularly the US.

One of the key recommendations was to relax rules for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) so that trading is not suspended once a potential acquisition is announced.

The revelation about Klarna's potential future follows an admission by the founder of health startup Babylon health in an interview with Yahoo Finance UK last week that the company chose to list in New York instead of London because capital markets in the US are ""more innovative"" and American investors are more receptive to fast-growing tech companies.

Dr Ali Parsa Babylon's founder told Yahoo Finance UK: ""In UK there is more of an appetite for cash generative slow-growing businesses and in the US there is more of an appetite for backing the next generation of world leaders.

""There’s no surprise that basically seven out of the 10 world’s largest companies are in the US or China and they were not there 20 years ago.""

Klarna is used by more than 13500 retailers in the UK including e-commerce heavyweight Asos (ASC.L) H&M and JD Sports.

The latest funding round valued the company at $51bn (£36bn) so it would be a coup for whichever exchange it chooses to list on.

Over the course of 2020 the UK's BNPL sector nearly quadrupled in size. An estimated 5 million people in ht eUK have used BNPL services since the beginning of the pandemic.

Providers aren't required to do the same checks you might be subject to through a bank because the sector is not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority although clear regulation and guidelines are on the horizon.

Voicing concerns on regulation in the UK Siemiatkowski said he hopes to avoid a situations where it is easier to sign people up to credit cards than BNPL services.

""I’m not that worried — I feel like I am on the right side of things. It would be worse if I was on the wrong side trying to protect something.”

The billionaire co-founder of Klarna — the wildly successful online buy now pay later service — tells the story of a recent visit to a petrol station where he stopped off to buy his five-year-old son a treat as a reward for his stellar performance on the football pitch. Siemiatkowski 39 walked around the store chatting to his son before approaching the checkout where he received an unexpected compliment.

“The guy said ‘You’re an amazing father’ ” Siemiatkowski recounts. “He said all the other dads come in look at their phones and don’t interact with their children. I was so proud and happy — but also sad because it’s so important",,,,,,,,,

The manufacturer said it would pump £140 million into its Wigan plant Kitt Green which is already the largest food manufacturing site in Europe.

The factory will be modernised over the next four years installing new machinery and bring back the production of Heinz tomato ketchup mayonnaise and salad cream.

The move is expected to create about 50 full-time jobs and would be the biggest investment in an existing manufacturing site outside the US by Kraft Heinz in more than two decades.

“This is a very exciting time for Kitt Green and I am proud that the potential for the site to grow and modernise is being recognized” said Kitt Green site director Luis Spinardi.

“Not only are we excited to be expanding our product mix by bringing sauces back to the UK but also look forward to a more efficient facility with a sustainable future.”

The investment was also welcomed by Joe Clarke a national official for food drink and agriculture at Unite the Union.

He said that after “Brexit and near the end of a global pandemic this is tremendous news for the hardworking members at Kraft Heinz and reflects the exceptional cooperative working that has been built upon over many years especially over the past 12 months with everybody pulling together through Covid keeping the nation fed throughout the global pandemic.

“Here’s just rewards for everybody’s hard work and effort.”

Kraft Heinz said that its new machinery would help minimise the use of non-renewable products allowing its packaging to be fully recyclable which much of it not recyclable at present.

Staff will need extra training to be able to operate the machines alongside the dozens of additional jobs that will be created.",,,,,,,,,

GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $38.61 per share and the market cap of $29.2 billion The Kroger Co stock shows every sign of being modestly overvalued. GF Value for The Kroger Co is shown in the chart below.





The Kroger Co Stock Shows Every Sign Of Being Modestly Overvalued

Because The Kroger Co is relatively overvalued the long-term return of its stock is likely to be lower than its business growth which averaged 7.6% over the past three years and is estimated to grow 1.31% annually over the next three to five years.

Since investing in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss investors must carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. The Kroger Co has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.14 which ranks worse than 76% of the companies in the industry of Retail - Defensive. Based on this GuruFocus ranks The Kroger Co's financial strength as 5 out of 10 suggesting fair balance sheet. This is the debt and cash of The Kroger Co over the past years:

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of The Kroger Co is 7.6% which ranks better than 71% of the companies in the industry of Retail - Defensive. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 23.1% which ranks better than 73% of the companies in the industry of Retail - Defensive.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months The Kroger Co's return on invested capital is 5.08 and its cost of capital is 2.41. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of The Kroger Co is shown below:

The Kroger Co Stock Shows Every Sign Of Being Modestly Overvalued

To conclude The stock of The Kroger Co (NYSE:KR 30-year Financials) appears to be modestly overvalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong.

Housed in the former county court building 400 Imperial Plaza next to Kroger in Bellaire the offices offer much more space for employees to assist veterans seeking help with Veterans Administration claims and financial help.

The former office was located on Belmont Street in the downtown business district.

A new large picnic shelter has also been constructed on site and was used during the event.

Veterans got to tour the new facility and received gift bags containing T-shirts and other items. They also received a buffet-style lunch provided for free by John Ayers owner of Hanover Fuel Stop in Martins Ferry.

St. Clairsville resident and veteran Donald Hindman and his wife Marleen attended the open house to see the new place.

Hindman said he retired from the Army as a 1st sergeant. He did three tours of duty — one each in Vietnam Korea and Germany. Hindman said he usually gets a physical once a year at the VA medical clinic now located inside the Ohio Valley Mall.

Hindman said if a veteran needs help with VA services and claims the Belmont County Veterans Service Office is the place to start.

He noted when he retired 30 years ago there was not much help in the form of benefits for veterans. Now there is much more assistance especially for younger veterans. Help finding a good job after exiting the military is critical he said.

In addition to veterans and staff members several dignitaries were in attendance for the event including Bellaire Councilman and veteran Donny Maupin whose wife Cindy Maupin is the center’s director and Bellaire Councilwoman Elizabeth Dugmore.

“It’s top-notch” Maupin said of the new office. “This is going to be really nice down here in Bellaire.”

Belmont County Commissioners Jerry Echemann and J.P. Dutton also attended.

“We had offers for this building but we wanted to hold it for the veterans. It was the right thing to do” Echemann said.

The county courts are now located in the former headquarters of The Health Plan in St. Clairsville that was renovated by the county.

Dutton said he was proud to be a part of the grand opening.

“I’m excited for the future of Belmont County veterans and the services they will receive here” Dutton said.

The Belmont County Service Commission board members also were there including Robert Wallace Tom Young John “Dixie” Purtiman Kevin West and John Zingo.

Wallace said the staff members who help the veterans do an excellent job at obtaining services for people which includes VA claims and transportation to the VA hospital in Pittsburgh twice a week.

The DJ for the event was Robert “Moose” Dodril who also sang the national anthem.

The group had help cutting the ceremonial ribbon from Bellaire resident and veteran Paul Dunfee.

The Blame My Roots Festival also provided 150 tickets to give to veterans in attendance so they can attend the event for free.

The country music festival is July 16-17 at Valley View Campgrounds in Belmont."
LHX,L3Harris,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMDUvc2lyaXVzeG0tdG8tcmVwbGVuaXNoLXJhZGlvLWJyb2FkY2FzdC1mbGVldC13aXRoLWxhdW5jaC1lYXJseS1zdW5kYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SiriusXM to replenish radio broadcast fleet with launch early Sunday – Spaceflight Now,"SiriusXM will get a new radio broadcasting satellite with a launch scheduled early Sunday from Cape Canaveral aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket following the failure of an identical spacecraft after a launch last December.

The high-power SXM 8 broadcast satellite built by Maxar in Palo Alto California is tucked inside the nose cone of the Falcon 9 rocket on pad 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Liftoff is set for a one-hour 59-minute launch window opening at 12:26 a.m. EDT (0426 GMT) Sunday.

SXM 8 is the second spacecraft in a two-satellite order placed by SiriusXM in 2016. The first satellite SXM 7 successfully launched last December on a Falcon 9 rocket but suffered a payload failure before entering service.

SiriusXM confirmed the failure of “certain SXM 7 payload units” in January following orbit-raising maneuvers to reach a circular geosynchronous orbit more than 22000 miles (nearly 36000 kilometers) over the equator.

In a quarterly earnings report in April SiriusXM said it recorded a $220 million impairment charge from the failure of the SXM 7 mission after declaring the satellite a total loss. SiriusXM said it has a $225 million insurance covering the launch and first year of in-orbit operations of the SXM 7 satellite and the company said it expects to file a claim under the policy.

Sean Sullivan executive vice president and chief financial officer at SiriusXM said the company has issued a request for proposals to satellite manufacturers to build a replacement for SXM 7.

Maxar said in May that the SXM 7 failure registered a $28 million impact on its financial statement including $25 million from lost payments from SiriusXM that were due if the spacecraft successfully commenced operations. Maxar spent another $3 million attempting to repair and recover the satellite.

SiriusXM said it does not expect its satellite radio service to be affected by the SXM 7 failure.

SXM 7 was expected to replace the XM 3 radio broadcasting satellite at 85 degrees west longitude officials said last year. The Boeing-built XM 3 satellite launched in 2005 aboard a Sea Launch Zenit 3SL rocket.

SiriusXM said its XM 3 and XM 4 satellites remain operational in geosynchronous orbit and can continue providing radio broadcast services for several years. Another satellite XM 5 is available as an in-orbit spare.

SXM 8 was originally supposed to replace XM 4 but SiriusXM has not confirmed whether it changed the satellite’s deployment plan after the failure of SXM 7. Officials have also not said what if any modifications Maxar made to SXM 8 to eliminate the risk of a similar failure as the one that struck SXM 7.

Based on Maxar’s 1300-series spacecraft design the SXM 7 and SXM 8 satellites have large deployable S-band antennas made by L3Harris to broadcast radio signals to SiriusXM’s customers. The S-band reflector is required for the satellite to beam high-power signals to users with small terminals on the ground such as satellite radio receivers on cars.

“Maxar and SiriusXM have a decades-long relationship and we’re thrilled to deliver the ninth satellite we’ve built for them since 2000” said Paul Estey Maxar’s executive vice president for space programs delivery. “SXM-8 built on Maxar’s proven 1300-class bus is more than twice as big and powerful as the first-generation SiriusXM constellation built by Maxar.”

The SXM 8 spacecraft weighs about 7.5 tons (nearly 7 metric tons) and stands about 27 feet (8 meters) tall inside the Falcon 9 rocket’s payload shroud.

SpaceX completed a test-firing of the Falcon 9 rocket for the SXM 8 mission early Thursday then rolled the launcher back into a hangar where ground teams mounted the SXM 8 spacecraft and its payload fairing to the Falcon 9 upper stage.

SpaceX rolled the Falcon 9 back to pad 40 and raised the 229-foot-tall (70-meter) rocket vertical early Saturday. The weather outlook now shows a 70% chance of favorable weather for launch just after midnight Sunday.

The primary weather concerns are associated with the possibility that debris clouds and anvil clouds from inland thunderstorms could blow back over Florida’s Space Coast and violate launch criteria.

“Ongoing showers and storms are expected to be well inland of the spaceport before sunset with mid and upper level winds bringing back convective debris clouds and anvil remnants back to the coast for the primary launch late night window” forecasters wrote. “A few Atlantic showers and cumulus in the vicinity cannot be ruled out but this no longer looks like the main concern.”

During the launch window the weather team from the U.S. Space Force predicts scattered clouds at 2500 feet an overcast deck of clouds at 18000 feet winds from the south-southeast at 12 to 17 mph and a temperature of about 77 degrees Fahrenheit.

If the launch is delayed to the backup window early Monday forecasters predict an 80% chance of good weather for liftoff.

The mission will be the 18th Falcon 9 flight by SpaceX so far this year and the eighth Falcon 9 launch in the last 44 days. The busy stretch of SpaceX missions has been dominated by launches deploying the company’s own Starlink internet satellites.

SpaceX is on pace to break the record for the most orbital launches by any U.S. rocket company but the SXM 8 mission is just SpaceX’s third flight since Jan. 1 primarily dedicated to external commercial customers.

After liftoff from pad 40 the Falcon 9 will head east over the Atlantic Ocean to place the SXM 8 spacecraft into an elongated geosynchronous transfer orbit with an apogee or high point about 12000 miles (20000 kilometers) above Earth.

The rocket’s first stage a veteran of two prior missions carrying Crew Dragon spaceships with astronauts will shut down about two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff and return to a landing on SpaceX’s drone ship “Just Read the Instructions” in the Atlantic.

The Falcon 9’s upper stage will fire its engine two times to inject the SXM 8 spacecraft into its targeted orbit. Spacecraft separation is scheduled for T+plus 31 minutes 42 seconds.

SXM 8 will unfurl its solar panels and fire its on-board thrusters to maneuver into a circular geosynchronous orbit over the equator where the satellite will undergo testing before commencing commercial service for SiriusXM.

BREVARD COUNTY FLORIDA – The annual “Dancing for the Space Coast” charity event returned to action this year as more than $300000 was raised Saturday night in Melbourne which will go to benefit thr Habitat for Humanity of Brevard Family Promise of Brevard the Women’s Center of Brevard and the U.S. Law Enforcement Eternal Flame.

The grand champion of this year’s event was Marcus Ingeldsen Director of Construction for MH Williams Construction Group Inc. and his instructor Heidi Arnold from Dancin’ Dance Studio in Indialantic.

This year the event helped raise over $300000 for charity.

Leading up to the event the local celebrities dancing in the event helped raise money months prior to the event while preparing for their complex dance routine in front of a massive crowd.

The charity event was hosted by the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office and emceed by Sheriff Wayne Ivey who helped facilitate a live auction and live dance performances by dance professionals and local celebrities who competed to raise money for Brevard County non-profit organizations.

“Dancing For the Space Coast” is a unique competition and fundraising event that benefits worthy organizations on the Space Coast and was held at the former Stein Mart department store located at 4100 N. Wickham Road in Melbourne.

This exciting event showcased featured dancers Susan Belcher Wendy Fine Irving Frier Christina Granger Marcus Ingeldsen Jeanette Jarnes George Panton Cordell Rolle Lori Shepherd and Kristine Zonka.

“The true stars of the event are the dancers who work diligently to raise money for these worthy causes” said Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey.

BRAGGING RIGHTS ON THE LINE

Each celebrity dancer was matched up with a professional dancer as they compete in a ballroom dance – and for bragging rights as the best dancer in Brevard.

On the evening of the competition each dance pair competed in a choreographed ballroom dance that will be scored by a panel of judges. During the show couples earned scores based on several technical skill factors but the judges’ scores alone don’t decide the dancer’s final score.

Leading up to the actual performance the dancers already scored 60 percent of their points through their fundraising endeavors to benefit needy charities.

Posted on: June 6 2021 07:55h.

Last updated on: June 7 2021 09:49h.

Commercial and tribal gaming professionals from across the globe will once again converge on Las Vegas this October for the 2021 installment of the Global Gaming Expo (G2E).

Attendees tour exhibits during the 2019 Global Gaming Expo at the Sands Expo & Convention Center in Las Vegas in 2019. After going virtual-only last year because of COVID-19 organizers announced this past week that the gaming trade show would return to Las Vegas in October. (Image: Global Gaming Expo)

Officials with the American Gaming Association and Reed Exhibitions made the announcement this past week. The event will take place at the Sands Expo & Convention Center. Education sessions will start on Oct. 4 with the show floor opening the following day.

The show will conclude on Oct. 7.

“For over 20 years G2E has been the leader in uniting the global gaming community and we are beyond thrilled to come together this October for the industry’s hallmark event” said Korbi Carrison G2E event director.

COVID-19 forced organizers to hold G2E in a virtual format last year. This year’s event will include some virtual components as well.

Gaming Professionals Wanted G2E

The announcement came on the same day as Nevada officially reopened to full capacity including the resort casinos in Las Vegas.

Clark County officials also lifted capacity restrictions for large gatherings such as conventions.

We can’t wait to bring the industry back together in Las Vegas for G2E 2021” said Meredith Pallante AGA vice president of global events. “The industry has shown tremendous resilience throughout the pandemic and being able to gather together again will be another great milestone in our strong recovery.”

In April G2E organizers said the goal was to hold an in-person event. However that was dependent on them getting assurances attendee safety would not be compromised.

Last month organizers surveyed industry stakeholders regarding their plans to attend the expo. More than 80 percent said they were at least somewhat likely to attend the show if it took place in Vegas and 93 percent said an in-person convention was critical for the company’s business.

More than 80 percent also said they would definitely or probably make acquisitions based on attending the show.

First Major Vegas Expo Opens This Week

The week ahead features the first major convention returning to Las Vegas.

The World of Concrete one of the first major trade shows to return to Las Vegas since the pandemic started. But it also serves as the first expo inside the recently completed expansion at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Nearly $1 billion was invested to create the 1.4 million-square-foot west wing.

Other major events planned for the months ahead include the International Security Conference – ISC West 2021. That show starts July 19 at the Sands Expo. On Aug. 9 the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS21) Annual Conference & Exhibition begins at the Sands.

In September the Las Vegas Convention Center will serve as host to the Society for Human Resources Annual Conference and Expo.

The return of conventions will provide yet another spark for Las Vegas and its recovery. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority trade shows and other large gatherings support more than 40000 jobs. Conventions also helped generate nearly $6 billion in economic output in 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Existen fondos específicos pero también hay vehículos de inversión que mediante la interlocución directa con empresas tratan de propiciar cambios significativos.

Gases industriales

En Columbia Threadneedle han dialogado con la compañía de producción de gases industriales Linde Plc uno de los mayores emisores de carbono en su universo de inversión para evaluar sus planes de reducción de contaminación. El equipo se reunió con el vicepresidente de sostenibilidad y constataron que la empresa tiene previsto duplicar el nivel de energía procedente de fuentes renovables. Seguirán en contacto “para conocer la evolución de sus esfuerzos por cuantificar el impacto climático positivo de sus productos” afirman.

Sin carbón

Arabella Turner especialista en ASG de Pictet AM relata cómo a principios de 2019 instaron a una compañía alemana a que vendiera sus activos de carbón y lignito. La empresa empezó a analizar la disparidad entre sus objetivos de reducción de emisiones de carbono y el Acuerdo de París y se comprometió a mejorar la armonización de su método con las recomendaciones del Grupo de Trabajo sobre Divulgación de Información Financiera relacionada con el Clima (del G20). Además “comenzó a considerar la posibilidad de vincular la retribución de sus directivos al cumplimiento de los objetivos climáticos” añade.

Desde el consejo

En mayo de 2020 la gestora holandesa Robeco contribuyó al nombramiento de un importante exejecutivo procedente del sector de la energía eólica como nuevo miembro del consejo de administración de la multinacional energética italiana Enel. De este modo ayudó a que la compañía redujera su exposición a los combustibles fósiles y a dirigirla hacia las energías renovables como parte de los esfuerzos por lograr que Enel alcance niveles neutrales de carbono para 2050. “Es la primera vez que se utilizaba la capacidad de proponer consejeros con esta intención y sin duda se trata de un enfoque innovador para influir sobre el gobierno corporativo de una empresa” aseguran Carola van Lamoen y Cristina Zedillo especialistas en titularidad activa de Robeco.

Residuos plásticos

Axa IM decidió invertir en PackBenefit que fabrica recipientes para alimentos utilizando pulpa de madera virgen de origen sostenible. Los productos de la empresa son una alternativa reciclable biodegradable y compostable industrialmente a las bandejas de plástico de un solo uso derivadas de los combustibles fósiles. La inversión permitirá a PackBenefit aumentar su capacidad de producción y se espera que esta sustituya a toneladas de plástico de un solo uso en 2024.

Molinos en el mar

Para garantizar que las compañías sean capaces de medir los impactos en los ecosistemas que rodean los molinos de viento en alta mar en DNB AM se reunieron con Vestas Wind Systems A/S fabricante de aerogeneradores. La empresa admitió tener lagunas respecto a las mejores prácticas y que carece de un marco adecuado para gestionar los retos y las oportunidades referidas a los océanos sostenibles. “Pero les presionamos para que pusieran estos temas en un lugar más alto de la agenda” resalta Mikko Ripatti su responsable de ventas para España.

Química verde

El equipo del fondo Global Sustain de Morgan Stanley IM interactúa con una empresa británica de salud higiene y nutrición en la que están analizando cómo la química verde ayuda a desarrollar productos con menor huella medioambiental. Por ejemplo desarrollando envases más respetuosos y utilizando nuevas formulaciones y diseños que pueden recortar el consumo de energía ayudar a reducir el impacto y el desperdicio de los recursos naturales y permitir un mayor reciclaje.

Reciclaje

John William Olsen gestor del fondo M&G (Lux) Positive Impact pone como ejemplo la reunión con el consejero delegado de Republic Services uno de los principales proveedores de servicios de reciclaje de EE UU para hablar sobre las actividades del grupo tras el rechazo de China a las importaciones de sus residuos debido a su baja calidad. “Animamos al grupo a hacer de la sostenibilidad uno de sus pilares y en los dos últimos años la empresa ha centrado sus inversiones en la mejora de los procesos de reciclaje al tiempo que ha revelado unos objetivos de sostenibilidad líderes en el mercado”.

Buques y pesca

James Gifford responsable de asesoramiento de inversiones de impacto en Credit Suisse repasa cómo el fondo Ocean Engagement interactúa “con empresas en materia de contaminación oceánica y en concreto ha trabajado con ellas para fomentar la adopción de las mejores prácticas en el reciclaje de buques”. El fondo ha animado a las empresas a suscribir el Convenio de Hong Kong relativo a esta materia lo que ha dado lugar a un compromiso claro.

Cruceros con GNL

Carmignac se ha comprometido con la compañía de cruceros Carnival en sus esfuerzos por controlar la gestión de residuos. Ha implementado la eliminación de los plásticos de un solo uso e instituido el reciclaje a bordo. Además sus compromisos apuntan a una reducción de CO 2 del 40% y han sido pioneros en el uso de gas natural licuado (GNL). Ya tienen cuatro barcos que funcionan 100% con GNL.

Trenes verdes

“Un ejemplo de inversión en nuestras carteras sería la industria ferroviaria en compañías como Alstom CAF o Talgo donde se estaría generando un impacto positivo y medible” apunta David Manso director de equity de CaixaBank Asset Management. En su opinión la denominada movilidad verde es una tendencia estructural que refuerza el crecimiento del sector de ferrocarriles a escala mundial y “para los próximos años se esperan crecimientos en trenes urbanos superiores al 5% en Europa e incluso por encima en países emergentes”.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The uber diva has parted ways with Jay-Z and his management company Roc Nation after a “blazing row” with the rapper during a meeting about the future of her career according to The Sun.

Carey signed with Jay-Z in 2017 years after firing former manager Stella Bulochnikov prompting lawsuits on both sides.

“Mariah and Jay had an explosive meeting which did not go well at all” a source close to the situation told the Sun. “She has made it clear she wants nothing more to do with him and has called it quits with Roc Nation. She will formally depart in the next few weeks.

“It is a shame because they had done some great work in the last few years” the source added. “But this meeting couldn’t have gone much worse. Mariah has been talking to other managers and thinks she has found someone who she feels has full belief in her as she takes her next steps.”

Carey is said to be working on “a heavily R&B-influenced album” and another world tour set for 2021.

This year marks an impressive milestone for Freddie Mercury Brian May Roger Taylor and John Deacon’s Queen. It’s been 50 years since the latter joined the other three in completing the iconic rock band’s final line-up. However with Freddie’s passing 30 years ago and John having retired from the music industry the anniversary is somewhat bittersweet for Brian and Roger who are still going strong with Adam Lambert to this day.

Trending

In an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk we asked Roger Taylor what Freddie would have thought of such a milestone and if he would still be performing with Queen in 2021 had he lived. The Queen drummer said he likes to think that the singer would still be with the band and have an attitude of “if it’s still working keep going!” Roger said: “It would have been fascinating to see had he lived what we’d have been up to. “Whether we’d still be together…I like to think that we would be. We were pretty close as a unit and we never did break up.”

While Brian Roger and John released 1995’s Made in Heaven with posthumous recordings of Freddie. Reflecting on other rock groups from their era the Queen drummer told us: “I can’t understand these bands who do break up.”

Roger Taylor likes to think Freddie Mercury would still be with Queen today had he lived

Freddie Mercury timeline

Roger who was promoting his new solo album Outsider continued: “They get to a certain point where egos take over or something and individuals become too big for the band. And that didn’t happen to us.” Looking back at the classic rock era the 71-year-old feels Queen were so lucky to have come from “that glorious period with all the best bands.” He added: “It all came from that fairly short period from Britain when he had the best bands in the world. “We had Led Zeppelin and The Who. Jimi Hendrix was essentially from here although he was American. These were the best bands in my opinion. We seem to be good at that the UK.” DON'T MISS

SBIRS is part of the Defense Department’s missile warning network that detects ballistic missile launches. It includes a combination of two infrared sensors in highly elliptical orbit and five satellites in geosynchronous Earth orbit.

Lockheed Martin has been the SBIRS primary contractor since the mid-1990s. The fifth satellite launched May 18. The sixth and final SBIRS is in production and projected to launch in 2022.

The five-year sole-source contract is for operations and maintenance of the SBIRS mission control center at Buckley Space Force Base Colorado and other operations centers at Peterson Air Force Base and Greeley Air National Guard Station.

Rob Walker Lockheed Martin’s director of overhead persistent infrared operations and sustainment said the contract covers logistics support of existing ground systems and upgrades needed to operate the last two satellites of the SBIRS geosynchronous constellation SBIRS GEO-5 and SBIRS GEO-6.

The Space Force plans to transition to a new network of missile warning satellites called Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared and a new ground system called Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE). Lockheed Martin is under contract to produce three Next-Gen OPIR geosynchronous satellites the first of which is projected to launch in 2025.

Walker said this new contract funds work to maintain and sustain infrastructure for the next generation Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution ground control system and ensure the SBIRS GEO-5 and GEO-6 satellites are incorporated into the operational constellation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4tc3RvY2stYmVsaWV2ZWQtZmFpcmx5LTAyMDAxMDIzMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin Stock Is Believed To Be Fairly Valued,"- By GF Value

One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Lockheed Martin is 10.6% which ranks better than 75% of the companies in Aerospace & Defense industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 13.8% which ranks better than 68% of the companies in Aerospace & Defense industry.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months Lockheed Martin's return on invested capital is 16.74 and its cost of capital is 7.15. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Lockheed Martin is shown below:

The missions will mark a return to U.S. exploration of Venus after many years. Two new robotic spacecraft are to be designed and built to study the planet with the highest temperatures in our solar system.

NASA chose American company Lockheed Martin to create and operate both spacecraft. The company will receive $500 million for each mission through NASA’s Discovery Program. The spacecraft are expected to launch between 2028 and 2030.

One mission called DAVINCI+ is designed to measure the planet’s dense cloudy atmosphere to understand how it formed and developed a NASA statement said. It also aims to capture the first high-quality pictures of geological structures on Venus. Some are similar to ones on Earth.

After arriving at Venus the DAVINCI+ spacecraft will send a probe into the planet’s atmosphere. It will then use its instruments to measure levels of gases and other elements temperature and pressure Lockheed Martin said.

The other mission VERITAS will map the surface of Venus to learn about “the planet’s geologic history and understand why it developed so differently than Earth” NASA said. When the VERITAS orbiter arrives at Venus it will use a method called “aerobraking” to place itself “into an optimal science position in the planet’s orbit” Lockheed Martin said. It will then use imaging equipment to capture data about the planet’s geology.

Venus is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor and the second closest planet to the sun. It is similar in structure to Earth but a little smaller. Venus rotates in the opposite direction as Earth and most other planets. Also its rotation is very slow.

The air on Venus is so dense and pressurized that it behaves more like a fluid than a gas near the surface. The planet has extremely high winds that push clouds completely around the planet every five days.

Such extreme conditions make it difficult for spacecraft to survive in Venus’ atmosphere or on its surface. But scientists are very interested in learning more. Some believe Venus may have had ancient seas that could have made it habitable before unknown forces destroyed them.

“It is astounding how little we know about Venus"" NASA scientist Tom Wagner said in a statement. He added that the new missions can provide fresh data on the planet's thick atmosphere which is made up mostly of carbon dioxide. “It will be as if we have rediscovered the planet” Wagner said.

James Garvin is the chief scientist for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. He said in a statement he considers Venus important to understanding “climate change the evolution of habitability and what happens when a planet loses a long period of surface oceans.""

The first spacecraft to explore Venus was NASA’s Mariner 2 in 1962. It passed within about 34000 kilometers of the planet. NASA says Mariner 2 successfully recorded the planet’s temperature for the first time. It measured the Venus surface temperature to be about 465 degrees Celsius.

The United States and the former Soviet Union sent several spacecraft to Venus from the 1960s to the 1980s. The former Soviet Union is the first and only country to successfully land a spacecraft on the surface of Venus. The first landing was the Soviet explorer Venera 7 in 1970. The Soviet spacecraft lasted less than two hours in the extreme environment.

In 1989 NASA used a space shuttle to send its Magellan spacecraft into orbit around Venus. The European Space Agency also put a spacecraft into orbit around Venus in 2006. And a Japanese spacecraft called Akatsuki was launched in 2010 and is currently orbiting Venus.

(AP) — The Navy will christen a ship made in Alabama on Saturday naming it after Australia’s capital city.

The littoral combat ship will be the second ship named the USS Canberra according to a Navy news release sent Friday.

Australian Ambassador Arthur Sinodinos will give the main speech and his wife Elizabeth Anne Sinodinos will break a bottle of sparkling wine across the bow.

Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs Marise Payne is the ship’s sponsor but cannot attend the Navy said.

Austal USA shipyard in Mobile is building one of two variants of what was designed as an affordable fast ship to operate in shallow coastal waters also called littoral waters. Lockheed Martin is building the other in Marinette Wisconsin.

The first USS Canberra built in 1941 was the first Navy cruiser named after a foreign capital. Its original name was the USS Pittsburgh. It was renamed Canberra on Oct. 15 1942 in honor of the Australian heavy cruiser HMAS Canberra which sank during the Battle of Savo Island.

The USS Canberra received seven battle stars in World War II and in 1958 was the ceremonial flagship for the selection of the Unknown Serviceman of World War II and Korea.

After it was decommissioned in 1970 one of its propellers was given to the Los Angeles Maritime Museum. In 2001 its bell was donated to the Australian National Maritime Museum."

A Washington County prosecutor in an unusual acknowledgement referenced the botched searches during a recent hearing in an unrelated case.

But now his office is in the uncomfortable position of defending the searches as it pursues murder charges against Danielle Ann Morin an escort accused in the fatal shooting of a man at the Embassy Suites hotel near Washington Square last year.

The case most likely hinges on whether a judge allows evidence seized in the searches to be introduced at trial.

Prosecutors have offered a novel argument about what constitutes a search warrant and Morin’s defense lawyers have urged the court to suppress the evidence as the product of a serious police lapse.

Prosecutors allege Morin 47 killed 60-year-old Brian Patrick Lowes of Nehalem shortly after he had scheduled a date with her and checked into the hotel on March 6 2020.

Lowes was found dead on the floor of Room 921 after a bullet traveled through a wall into the neighboring room and landed on a couch cushion prompting staff to check on him according to court documents.

Lowes was shot five times with Hornady Critical Duty .357 or 9 mm ammunition from a revolver according to prosecutors. He appeared to have been killed while sitting on the couch in his room they said.

Text messages from his cellphone revealed he had planned to meet a woman at the hotel at 11 a.m. and had sent his room number to her.

Video surveillance about that time captured a woman in a white puffy coat enter the hotel about 11 a.m. It showed her carrying a medium-sized purse putting on dark sunglasses and walking straight to the elevators that led up to the rooms according to court records. She was seen leaving the hotel just nine minutes later the records indicate.

Morin was arrested about three weeks later in Mountlake Terrace just north of Seattle on an Oregon arrest warrant charging her with second-degree murder first-degree robbery and unlawful use of a weapon.

Investigators made a critical error moments after her arrest defense lawyers said.

‘I JUST DID AS THEY ASKED’

Detectives had tracked down Morin by tracing a number on the dead man’s cellphone and speaking to another of her customers to get her name according to court records.

One investigator then posed as a customer and called Morin who used the name Victoria Von Helkin to advertise her services online prosecutors said.

He arranged to meet her for a 90-minute date for $600 at an apartment in Mountlake Terrace according to court records.

As Morin arrived at the apartment complex on the afternoon of April 1 officers from the Snohomish County Violent Offender Task Force drove up and boxed in her Chevy Venture minivan in the parking lot. They arrested her about 2 p.m.

About five minutes later two officers from the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office knocked on the nearby apartment door of Andrea Fischer and told her that her friend Morin had just been arrested.

“We need to talk to you about your roommate” she said the officers told her.

They told Fischer they had a search warrant for the apartment and that she needed to leave Fischer said in an interview with The Oregonian/OregonLive. They’d call her when they were done she said.

Detectives from Oregon soon arrived at the apartment she said.

She told the investigators that Morin never lived at the apartment though sometimes Fischer offered to do her laundry for her. She thought Morin was living out of her van.

The only possession of Morin’s in the apartment she told officers was a white puffy Michael Kors jacket that Morin had asked her to wash.

The officers asked whether there had been blood on the coat. Fischer told them no she said.

Investigators didn’t show her any search warrant Fischer said.

Stunned and frightened she grabbed her keys and left. She didn’t hear back from police until about 7:30 p.m. she said.

When she returned home the officers handed her some paperwork.

One sheet indicated a Snohomish County detective had submitted an affidavit to a judge at 5 p.m. that day Fischer said.

Then she noticed a judge’s signature and a time stamp of 7 p.m. on the documents.

That was “five hours after the police forced their way into my home and told me to leave telling me that they had an official warrant” she said.

“It was shocking to me. I just did as they asked” she said. “I didn’t know I should have asked to see the warrant.”

A Snohomish County judge sent an email to a detective at 7 p.m. on April 1 saying he'd approve a search warrant in the Danielle A. Morin case but no formal search warrant was ever drafted.

NOTHING AUTHORIZED THE SEARCHES

Tigard police seized the puffy white jacket that belonged to Morin and Fischer’s HP laptop and a ZBook workstation from the apartment.

They also searched Morin’s gold minivan that same day according to court records.

From it they seized six cellphones seven rounds of Hornady Critical Duty .357 Magnum ammunition a purse a pair of size 7 brown boots a black backpack containing six sizes of ammunition gloves a flashlight a lighter and an expandable baton.

Morin’s lawyers have asked a judge to suppress the evidence seized in the “illegal and warrantless search and seizure” of both the minivan and the apartment.

In their motion they cited a report written two days after the searches by Snohomish County Detective Timothy Leo.

Leo explained in the report “his mistaken belief” that a judge had signed a search warrant before investigators initiated the searches of the apartment and van one of Morin’s lawyers Deborah Burdzik wrote in a motion to suppress the evidence.

Burdzik quoted from the detective’s report but it’s not part of the court file.

A few days later on April 7 Snohomish County Judge George F.B. Appel signed a statement saying he had reviewed three documents attached to an email sent to him from Leo regarding the Oregon murder case after Leo had called him at 6:16 p.m. on April 1.

Though he wrote that he believed he had seen an actual search warrant application none had been presented to him Appel’s statement said.

“In fact nothing in the documents I reviewed commanded or authorized the searches described in them” he wrote according to court records.

However the judge also described what he reviewed as the “functional equivalent of a search warrant.”

The attachments spelled out probable cause that a crime had been committed descriptions of locations to be searched and evidence sought prosecutors argued in their court filing. Appel also emailed the Snohomish County detective an authorization they said.

Prosecutors are relying on the judge’s statement to press forward.

But Burdzik said that’s not good enough.

“There simply is no warrant” she wrote in her motion. “An actual search warrant is required under the facts of this case. … Nor is there a proposed warrant document that was presented to a Judge.”

‘BUNGLING AN ACTIVE MURDER INVESTIGATION’

A detective tapped the rear bumper of Danielle Ann Morin's minivan when he said she attempted to put the van in reverse once surrounded by officers in Mountlake Terrace Washington on April 1 2020.

The questionable search warrant came to light in the unrelated case of a Washington County sheriff’s deputy accused of assaulting a jail inmate.

The deputy Rian Alden has asked a judge to dismiss the charges against him contending prosecutorial misconduct by Chief Deputy District Attorney Bracken McKey.

The deputy’s lawyer said McKey had drawn a complaint from Tigard police for allegedly berating the detectives in the Embassy Suites murder case after learning they searched Morin’s minivan and the apartment without a proper warrant.

Alden’s prosecutor Washington County Deputy District Attorney Jeff Lesowski argued that the Tigard murder case wasn’t relevant to the deputy’s claim.

Even if it was Lesowski told a judge McKey had every right to respond as he did to “Tigard police and an outside agency completely bungling an active murder investigation.”

“Mr. McKey’s response while maybe not the most professional in the world was completely justified” Lesowski said. “He had a right to be upset.”

Yet now the Washington County District Attorney’s Office is working to defend the searches in the murder case.

It’s relying in part on an Oregon exception to a warrant requirement.

The law allows the search of a car without a warrant when police have probable cause to believe it contains evidence of a crime “and the vehicle is mobile” when police first encounter it.

Once Morin’s minivan was surrounded by task force members she placed it in reverse prosecutors said. The van required “a bump” to the rear from a detective’s truck to come to a complete stop according to the prosecution’s argument in court filings.

Morin’s lawyer counters that once her van was “blocked in secured” and Morin was arrested there was no urgency for a warrantless search.

The District Attorney’s Office further argues that a Snohomish County detective submitted documents to the judge that suffice even if a formal warrant wasn’t drafted.

“While the form was unusual the documents submitted and sworn to by Detective Leo taken together with the written approval of Judge Appel contain all of the necessary components of a warrant” McKey wrote. “The search of Defendant’s apartment and vehicle was authorized by documents that meet the requirements of a search warrant.”

A hearing on the motion to suppress the evidence is set for June 17.

Jeff 56 and Lowe 30 were booked around 4 a.m. on Saturday both for DUIs. Jeff was additionally charged with changing lanes improperly.

According to a copy of the incident report obtained by PEOPLE officers spotted a white Range Rover pulling out of a parking lot driving over a curb and then stopping abruptly. At this point police say Lauren got out of the driver's seat and switched places with Jeff who then took over driving.

When police pursued the car they claim Jeff made an illegal lane change before pulling over. According to the report both Jeff and Lauren were exhibiting slurred speech and ""a strong odor commonly associated with the consumption of an alcoholic beverage"" on their breaths.

The arresting officer conducted a field sobriety test on Jeff but terminated it shortly after due to his ""unsteadiness on his feet and his inability to follow the directions."" Once taken to the police headquarters a breathalyzer test found that his blood alcohol level was 0.18 more than double the legal limit.

Per online jail records Lauren and Jeff appear to still be in custody in an Oklahoma detention center. A lawyer for Lowe did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.

The DUI arrests come about two weeks after the couple was accused of violating the Endangered Species Act (ESA) after an investigation found instances of animal mistreatment at their Tiger King Park in Thackerville Oklahoma the U.S. Department of Justice said in a press release last month.

According to prosecutors ""68 protected lions tigers lion-tiger hybrids and a jaguar"" were seized in the raid.

Officials have conducted three inspections on the zoo since December 2020 during which the Lowes ""received citations for failing to provide the animals with adequate or timely veterinary care appropriate nutrition and shelter that protects them from inclement weather and is of sufficient size to allow them to engage in normal behavior"" the Justice Department said.

The pair also failed to comply with a court order mandating they employ a veterinarian and provide adequate care that meets the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act according to prosecutors.

In June Jeff was ordered by a judge to hand over ownership of The G.W. Exotic Animal Memorial Park in Wynnewood Oklahoma — the zoo featured in Tiger King — to Carole Baskin who was also featured in the Netflix docu-series.

Nearly two months later Jeff announced in a since-deleted Facebook post that The G.W. Exotic Animal Memorial Park was closed ""effective immediately"" and that the animals there would be re-homed to the park in Thackerville.

Jeff Lowe was one of the central characters in the Netflix series ""Tiger King: Murder Mayhem and Madness"" which became a pop culture phenomenon last year.

The series focused on the life and murder-for-hire trial of big cat breeder Joe Exotic who started the zoo in Wynnewood.

Jeff Lowe took over in 2016 and he and Joe Exotic became enemies.

Joe Exotic — whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage — is serving a 22-year sentence in federal prison for trying to have his chief critic Baskin killed and for other crimes. He claims he is innocent and that Jeff Lowe set him up.

Just last month Lowe’s wildlife park – formerly owned by Joe Exotic – was raided by feds as also reported by TMZ. Approximately four dozen agents swarmed the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park and seized 68 animals including lions tigers jaguars and hybrids according to Oklahoma’s local news station ABC 13 KNTV.

The report claims that the park received several citations regarding the welfare of its animal residents but after three inspections found that the Lowes did nothing to improve the condition of the park for said animals. The citations included failure to provide ""adequate or timely"" veterinary care appropriate nutrition and shelter to protect the animals from any inclement weather.

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's stock.

Lululemon Athletica Inc.

One of Burnaby’s biggest retailers is seeing a resurgence in business.

Lululemon Athletica Inc. which operates at Metropolis at Metrotown saw its revenue soar by 88 per cent in its latest quarter fuelled by an ongoing e-commerce expansion and a rebound in brick-and-mortar store sales the company said Thursday.

The maker of athletic and yoga wear said its revenue amounted to $1.2 billion in its first quarter up from $652 million the year prior.

The retailer's strong performance came as it continued to navigate operating challenges related to the pandemic CEO Calvin McDonald told analysts during a conference call to discuss results.

""While challenges of all types will no doubt remain going forward I'm confident that we will continue to manage them effectively and deliver outstanding results"" he said. ""We are well positioned for the post-pandemic world and the opportunities ahead of us are significant and continue to expand.""

Many of Lululemon's stores were closed for a significant portion of its first quarter last year. It shuttered all its stores in China in February 2020 followed by all stores in North America Europe and some Asia Pacific countries in March to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

The widespread store closures dragged down the retailer's revenue and profit in its first quarter of 2020 making the most recent quarter's revenues particularly impressive in comparison.

Even still the company's revenue in its most recent quarter was more than 56 per cent higher than the $782 million the company reported in 2019 suggesting the strong results are about more than just a rebound as the economy recovers from the pandemic.

Meanwhile the retailer recorded a net income of almost $145 million for the period ended May 2 up from $28.6 million in 2020 and $96.6 million in 2019.",,,,,,,,,

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Thompson Center is in full swing after the building’s developers on Monday officially kicked off the redevelopment project saying that it will have an “unbelievable impact” on the Loop and strengthen Chicago’s reputation as a technology hub.

Once complete the building at 100 W. Randolph St. will become Google’s Chicago headquarters and house 2000 employees. The project is expected to be move-in ready by 2026.

The renovation of the center comes at a time of wider transformation for the Loop. Mayor Brandon Johnson announced in April that he’s seeking $150 million in tax increment financing for four La Salle Street adaptive reuse projects. The conversions would create more than 1000 new apartments in the city’s Central Business District bringing new use to largely vacant office buildings.

Prime/Capri Interests (PCI) a joint-venture between developers Michael Reschke and Quintin Primo III is completing the $280 million build-to-suit redevelopment under an agreement with Google which intends to purchase the building once renovations are complete. Prime/Capri said the makeover is akin to a rebuild.

“When this project is complete this one single building will help lift up the surrounding area” Reschke said. “Not only will it lift up the buildings but it also will lift up ... all the people who work live and visit this area every single day.”

Reschke and Primo were joined by Gov. J.B. Pritzker Johnson and Google’s head of its Chicago operations Karen Sauder along with other Google executives and city and state officials.

Pritzker said to Google’s leaders that it’s “an incredible investment both in your future and in ours.”

PCI will restore and modernize the Thompson Center with a new triple-pane glass wrap on the exterior a heightened colonnade three levels of covered terraces and access to green spaces.

The center’s CTA stop at Clark and Lake streets where six lines converge will remain open throughout construction. Google previously said passengers on those lines can expect a “new and improved CTA experience” though it hasn’t been made clear what that will look like.

Related Google takes a step forward with new renderings of Thompson Center makeover plan

Carbon-free energy

In 2022 Pritzker announced that the center traded hands inking a deal with Google in “a sale that has eluded State government for decades” according to a news release at the time. The state working out terms with developer Reschke sold it to Google for $105 million and then paid $75 million for 115 S. LaSalle St. formerly the BMO Harris Bank building and where the state moved its offices from the Thompson Center.

Construction at the 1.2 million-square-foot center started a month ago when Clark Construction placed equipment on the site and protective fencing was put up around the building’s perimeter and outdoor plaza. On Thursday construction crews could be seen tearing off the lower exterior of the building and a portion of the atrium.

The 38-year-old state government building has long garnered mixed reactions. Over the course of its existence three governors wanted the center demolished because of its age and high maintenance costs. State officials have said it costs $17 million a year to operate the building.

But pricey maintenance costs are expected to change through PCI’s redevelopment efforts. The developer is pursuing LEED Platinum status — the highest level of LEED certification — and transitioning the building to all electric. The Thompson Center’s internal systems will be replaced along with its heating and cooling systems to better handle Chicago’s climate. The new glass facade which will bring a modern touch and higher visibility will also double as a way to improve the building’s thermal performance.

Efforts to make the center a green building is in line with Google’s goal to use 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

“With the Thompson Center we saw a chance to revitalize the Loop but also take this iconic building that some thought of tearing down and instead make the renovations necessary to respectfully steward it into the 21st century” Sauder said.

Designed by Chicago architect Helmut Jahn the building opened in 1985 as the State of Illinois Center. It’s become recognizable for its 17-story atrium and the 29-foot tall “Monument with Standing Beast” sculpture. The sculpture nicknamed “Snoopy in a Blender” was removed last week and will be kept at a state facility until it’s moved to the Art Institute of Chicago.

Jahn’s namesake architecture firm is leading the redesign.

Johnson said Google’s investment proves Chicago is globally connected and a world class hub for innovation. From 2022 to 2023 Chicago saw 32 new office openings.

“Chicago is the place to be” Johnson said.

After missing the past two-plus seasons with a knee injury Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball has exercised the $21.4 million option on his contract for the 2024-25 season sources told ESPN on Saturday.

Ball has undergone three surgeries on his left knee the most recent a cartilage transplant in 2023. There remains some guarded hope that he could return next season but there are no assurances that the damaged knee will allow for him to play again.

Ball 26 signed an original four-year $80 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with New Orleans in the summer of 2021. After a fantastic start that had the Bulls leading the Eastern Conference in 2021-22 Ball averaged 13.0 points 5.4 rebounds 5.1 assists and 1.8 steals before a knee injury 35 games into the season.

His inactivity has caused his contract to become a blight on the Bulls' salary cap.

Ball was the No. 2 overall pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2017 NBA draft and eventually was traded to the Pelicans as part of the Anthony Davis blockbuster deal."

Jasmine Hartin partner of Lord Michael Ashcroft's son has been charged in the death of a Belize police official and moved to a new jail.

BELIZE CITY -- The Supreme Court of Belize has denied bail for the longtime partner of a British billionaire's son who's been charged in the fatal shooting of a top police officer in the Central American country.

A judge decided Wednesday to reject a bail application for Jasmine Hartin and adjourn the matter until next week after Belize's head prosecutor submitted an objection to the court on the grounds that she presented a ""serious flight risk."" The judge has requested that prosecutors submit a formal objection with full arguments by Friday while the defense team has until Monday to respond.

The next bail hearing is scheduled for June 9. Hartin a Canadian citizen who lives in Belize with her family will remain in custody at least until then at Belize Central Prison in the village of Hattieville west of the capital Belize City.

Hartin's attorney Godfrey Smith told reporters outside the courthouse on Wednesday that the judge also expressed ""disapproval of the kind of media publicity"" that the case is receiving and said he has ""no intention of contributing to that.""

Hartin had been denied bail by a lower court in the resort town of San Pedro on Monday after she was charged with manslaughter by negligence. Her lawyer then appealed the decision to the supreme court in Belize City.

The charge stems from the death of Henry Jemmott superintendent of the Belize Police Department whose body was discovered early Friday in the water off a San Pedro pier with one apparent gunshot wound behind his right ear according to Chester Williams commissioner of the Belize Police Department.

""The injury is not consistent with suicide and the manner of death is homicide"" Williams told reporters on Monday.

Hartin ""was somewhat in an emotional state walking herself on the pier"" when police found her near Jemmott's body with ""what appeared to be blood on her arms and on her clothing"" Williams said during a press conference on Friday.

""We believe that she is to some extent affected by it"" Williams told reporters.

Police recovered Jemmott's service weapon from the scene. The incident ""seems rather personal and not an attack on law enforcement"" Williams said. Investigators believe the pair were friends and had been drinking. They were alone together on the pier and were both found fully clothed according to Williams.

""We owe it to him to ensure that we investigate properly"" he said.

Hartin is the director of lifestyle and experience at Alaia Belize a boutique resort in San Pedro run by her husband real estate developer Andrew Ashcroft in partnership with hotel giant Marriott International according to Hartin's biography on the resort's website and her LinkedIn profile. Andrew Ashcroft also referred to Hartin as his wife during the resort's grand opening last month but it was unclear whether they are legally married. The couple have two children.

Andrew Ashcroft is the youngest son of Lord Michael Ashcroft a major financial backer of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom and its former deputy chairman. Lord Michael Ashcroft who holds dual U.K. and Belizean citizenship has an estimated net worth of $2.1 billion according to Forbes.

Belize's police commissioner said the Canadian socialite will receive ""no special treatment.""

""Her social stature should not affect how she is to be treated or should not allow her to be treated different than any ordinary person who has committed a crime"" Williams told local media on Tuesday.

Jemmott's family said they are desperate for answers. He leaves behind five children and a fiancee.

""What happened? We don't know I don't know"" Jemmott's sister Marie Jemmott Tzul told reporters on Monday. ""So we are depending on the police investigation to set the record straight for us.""

The Aegon Mykonos just keeps digging itself a deeper hole. If it digs any deeper maybe it can just bury those power lines that it photoshops out of pictures?

My Aegon Mykonos TripAdvisor review

Yesterday I decided to write a TripAdvisor review about my four-hour stay at the Aegon Mykonos. Here’s what I wrote for context which I think is fairly measured (given the ridiculousness of this all):

Where do I begin? First of all the hotel isn’t quite what it looks like in pictures. The power lines above the pool are photoshopped out on the hotel’s website there’s no beach club (instead the hotel seems to use pictures of the nearby Lohan Beach Club) the “beach front access” suites don’t have beach front access and the hotel faces a dirt road with five dumpsters and there was a general sewage scent throughout the exterior of the property. Unfortunately the physical aspects of the property are still better than the service from senior management here. The GM Pavlos was unhelpful to be polite — the hotel refused to honor the suite that was confirmed for me and kept blaming Marriott for the problem. And he was the more professional of the two employees I interacted with — another unhinged hotel employee (who may have been one of the owners) confronted me about writing negative things about the hotel online suggesting I had bad energy. I ended up checking out the same day I checked in because I felt so unwelcome. For what it’s worth I heard that other staff at the hotel are well intentioned but not very polished. Sadly I didn’t have a chance to interact with them.

And here are the pictures I included:

What the hotel’s pool really looks like

A better sense of the location & view

A beach club but not the hotel’s

Let me clarify upfront that this is the only review I wrote on TripAdvisor. Some people have written other TripAdvisor reviews pointing to my story while others have tried to impersonate me and Ford but those aren’t us. Since you can only write a TripAdvisor review if you’ve actually had an experience at a hotel I’d encourage those who left negative reviews without staying there to withdraw them.

The Aegon Mykonos’ response to my stay

I figured at some point the hotel would try to deescalate the situation but nope that doesn’t seem to be in the cards. The hotel responded to my TripAdvisor review and it’s full of outright lies.

Here’s the hotel’s response:

Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. It is regrettable that we were unable to accommodate your request upon arrival. The day prior to your arrival during your online communication with our guest experience team they mentioned to you that for your first reservation there was no availability for the specific suite and we could either upgrade you to an Aqua Suite Revive or to a Horizon room Revive with a sea view and for your second reservation we did confirm the upgrade to the Infinity Suite Revive. These are 2 different upgrade options both of which you refused. We also proposed to return your SNA include breakfast which was not in your reservation and give you points. Your partner’s reply to our suggestions was that they were “ridiculous” and used sarcasm to verbally abuse our associates. Upon your check-in we showed you all the available rooms however you chose not to accept any option we proposed and when we asked what we could do to make your stay better your reply was that in case we do not grant your first reservation as complimentary as well as offer you more points as compensation you would write a bad review. Regarding the powerlines we have to point out that Mykonos has a fast pace construction development that is why you may see those differences – we are working with the municipality for their subterranean deployment. As far as the hotel beach club is concerned it will be opening in a couple of weeks as all beach usage permits were delayed due to COVID restrictions. We would also like to clarify we do not use others beach clubs pictures as our own and that this comment of yours is false and has no basis. The mentioned trash bins and the dirt road are part of a public area and are located on the side of the road as placed by the municipality way before the hotel was built. The hotel guests have no direct view of those which you could also realize if you had used our pool restaurant and lounge area which you did not since you unfortunately never actually stayed with us. We remain at your disposal.

Before I address these points one-by-one let me note that management at this hotel isn’t just incompetent but they’re outright liars. Not just like slightly stretching the truth but shamelessly dishonest. For example I pointed out to the GM that perhaps the hotel was having some issues with inventory management based on the property selling lots of suites in a portion of the hotel that isn’t even open (suggesting that perhaps this was part of the problem rather than just “Marriott”).

I pointed out the Aegon Suite was for sale the night before and he vehemently denied it and said that was impossible. Guess what the hotel is once again selling for tonight? The Aegon Suite in a wing that isn’t even open and won’t be open for months. I thought it was impossible for that to happen no?

I’ve had several people who work in operations at Marriott properties reach out to me regarding this and across the board they’ve said that the revenue management of a hotel (or their regional revenue management) control inventory and that once a suite night award is confirmed it’s confirmed. They’ve all claimed that this likely wasn’t Marriott’s fault. Of course I’m also reaching out to Marriott corporate to clarify.

Responding to the Aegon Mykonos’ points

TripAdvisor lets hotels respond to guests but doesn’t let guests respond back to hotels (which is fair enough) so I’ll take the opportunity to do that here. Let’s go through the hotel’s response line-by-line.

The day prior to your arrival during your online communication with our guest experience team they mentioned to you that for your first reservation there was no availability for the specific suite and we could either upgrade you to an Aqua Suite Revive or to a Horizon room Revive with a sea view and for your second reservation we did confirm the upgrade to the Infinity Suite Revive. These are 2 different upgrade options both of which you refused.

The first part we can more or less agree on. Well except for the fact that I wasn’t offered my pick of two upgrades I was offered my pick of two downgrades compared to my confirmed reservation.

We also proposed to return your SNA include breakfast which was not in your reservation and give you points.

Yeah not quite:

Of course I’d get my suite night awards back if I didn’t get what I had confirmed

I am certain that breakfast was never discussed

I could be wrong but it’s my understanding that rates here include breakfast (Marriott’s website is unclear in some cases but online travel agencies show breakfast included with all rates); even if it weren’t included as an elite member I could select breakfast as my elite welcome gift so that’s not much of an offer as well

I was offered 750 points for each of the first two nights (which I value at ~$5 per night) which simply isn’t a reasonable offer especially when there wasn’t even a real apology or acknowledgement of this being a problem to go along with it

Your partner’s reply to our suggestions was that they were “ridiculous” and used sarcasm to verbally abuse our associates.

That is partially correct. When their best and final offer was 750 Bonvoy points no apology and blaming Marriott Ford did say the offer was “ridiculous.” They’re really grasping at straws if that’s what they’re trying to point out.

At the end of our interaction we explained that we were very unsatisfied and the GM responded “we strive for customer satisfaction.” At that point Ford did call him incompetent because well… he was. Using “sarcasm to verbally abuse our associates?” Yeah no.

Upon your check-in we showed you all the available rooms however you chose not to accept any option we proposed and when we asked what we could do to make your stay better your reply was that in case we do not grant your first reservation as complimentary as well as offer you more points as compensation you would write a bad review.

No no no no. This hotel is straight up lying it’s unbelievable:

The absolute most I would have ever expected the hotel to do would be to refund the points for the first two nights I never in any way suggested the first reservation should be “complimentary” and that I should get points as compensation on top of that that’s ridiculous; and at the end of the day my record reflects that as I haven’t requested any compensation from any Marriott property in a very long time

Or maybe this is the GM again talking about how points stays are “complimentary” to him?

I never have and never will tell a hotel that I would write a bad review if they don’t do what I want and it’s just not in my nature; I swear on my life I never said that

The hotel suggesting that I wanted all my points back and more compensation on top of that all while suggesting that I blackmailed the staff with a negative review has no basis in reality. In the posts prior to arriving at the hotel I didn’t even mention the hotel by name so that I wouldn’t get on their radar and clearly throughout my initial interaction they had no clue I was a blogger (which is my goal when I travel). Clearly the hotel is grasping at straws to defend itself here. The staff only caught on after I checked in which was the point at which the person we believe to be the owner aggressively approached us.

Regarding the powerlines we have to point out that Mykonos has a fast pace construction development that is why you may see those differences – we are working with the municipality for their subterranean deployment.

To be clear this portion of the hotel is brand new and opened for the first time two weeks ago. But the hotel is claiming that these power lines suddenly appeared due to the “fast pace construction development” in Mykonos?

A reader pointed out that the power lines have been there since at least 2011. Seriously how much more shameless could a hotel be with blatantly lying? Does management at the hotel really think “okay we’re in a bad situation maybe if we lie about the power lines we’ll make it all better?”

the power lines were 100% there before the hotel. As early as 2011 according to google. pic.twitter.com/eKhBO09Juc — Matt Kawashima (@mattkawashima) June 4 2021

I keep thinking “well they can’t possibly be this dumb” but unfortunately it seems they are. For example someone at the hotel left a negative comment on my blog telling me to get a life while I was on property without using a VPN. As I’ve investigated this more I have reason to believe that the person even left the comments with their real initials.

As far as the hotel beach club is concerned it will be opening in a couple of weeks as all beach usage permits were delayed due to COVID restrictions. We would also like to clarify we do not use others beach clubs pictures as our own and that this comment of yours is false and has no basis.

So I’m sure people can appreciate my confusion here and perhaps this is an area where I was somewhat wrong. Check out the picture on Marriott’s website of the hotel’s alleged beach club which is described as “a cosmopolitan beach experience offering a range of bespoke VIP services.” Meanwhile below is what the beach actually looks like.

A fairly nice beach but there’s no club

I suppose a beach club may be coming in the future though I’m curious about the two week timeline and that doesn’t seem like great managing of expectations.

The mentioned trash bins and the dirt road are part of a public area and are located on the side of the road as placed by the municipality way before the hotel was built. The hotel guests have no direct view of those which you could also realize if you had used our pool restaurant and lounge area which you did not since you unfortunately never actually stayed with us.

I’ll give it to the hotel for the well played sass in this part at least. For that matter this level of smugness is exactly what I would expect from the management here.

What’s missing from the hotel’s response

Other than the truth there are a couple of things missing from the hotel’s response.

First of all I love how the hotel addresses most of my points except the unhinged owner (or whoever she is) who lashed out at us in front of the hotel. Minor detail to overlook no?

Equally interesting and sadly not at all surprising is that there’s not a single “sorry” or “we realize you had a bad experience” or “this is a learning moment for us.” It’s nothing but lying and blame shifting which exactly matches my experience on-property.

The hotel acknowledges that it is “regrettable” that they weren’t able to accommodate my “request” (which wasn’t a request but a guarantee). The hotel also states that they remain at my “disposal” other than to you know actually resolve issues.

How about just saying sorry? Sorry for the initial mistake (regardless of whether it’s the fault of Marriott the hotel or an outright lie on the hotel’s part which I’m increasingly starting to think is the case) and sorry for the abysmal response?

Nope instead the hotel is just doubling down and justifying everything. And I suppose that’s not surprising when you consider that the owner’s response (or whoever she was) to finding out I was writing negative things online about the hotel was to confront me tell me I have bad energy and tell me I was doing illegal things.

This hotel thinks it can bully guests into submission and I’m here to say that’s not going to happen. I want to be clear — I don’t want anything tangible from Marriott or the hotel. I just want to know what’s going to change so that other people don’t have to deal with this.

I literally feel like I’m on the “Amy’s Baking Company” episode of “Kitchen Nightmares” (like I’m having flashbacks 15 seconds into this video).

I know some people have said “well what do you expect in Greece?” Greece gets a bad rep for service but I don’t find that to consistently be the case. I’ve had some of my best service ever in Greece and some of my worst service ever in Greece. The hotels we stayed at before and after the Aegon Mykonos were both exceptional and offered flawless service.

Bottom line

The Aegon Mykonos is continuing to double down and at this point is just making stuff up. Apparently I wanted the entire stay comped and points on top of that or else I threatened blackmail with a bad review apparently the power lines have appeared in the past few weeks (even though Google Images shows them as far back as 2011) and apparently Ford “verbally assaulted” staff by calling their offer “ridiculous” when their best offer was 750 points in compensation.

Yet the hotel continues to take zero accountability. Oh and you know what the kicker is? Looking at FlyerTalk the hotel did something very similar to someone else over the same dates and of course also blamed Marriott. I look forward to hearing about her stay because she claims she has been “scooped” by me and is “warming up [her] typing fingers.” VickiSoCal we’re ready to hear your story!

I understand it’s the general manager’s first job as a general manager but perhaps he needs a bit more training and/or should work at a hotel that doesn’t have anything to do with a loyalty program or perhaps work in a position where he doesn’t have to provide customer service?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWZyb21hbG91bmdlLmNvbS9jb3VydHlhcmQtYnktbWFycmlvdHQtbXVtYmFpLWFpcnBvcnQtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My stay at the Courtyard by Marriott Mumbai International Airport: 5-star service at a 4-star property!,"This past week I spent most of my time at the Courtyard by Marriott Mumbai International Airport hotel while spending time between an apartment reshuffle. My original toss-up for this stay was between the JW Marriott Sahar (Review) and the Grand Hyatt Mumbai hotel (Review) and then last minute I headed to the Courtyard for a one-night stay I realised I had no bed or mattress at home to sleep on.

The Courtyard by Marriott Mumbai International Airport is one I had seen a lot of from the outside when I passed the road frequently but it never occurred to me to stay there. This hotel has been around since 2010. It was one of the closest branded hotels from the earlier Sahar terminal of the Mumbai airport until Terminal 2 opened up. Along with it came the slew of new launches such as JW Marriott Sahar.

Booking the Courtyard by Marriott Mumbai International Airport

On this particular night I’d booked a one-night stay for the Sunday night at the hotel for INR 2970 (USD 38) for the night with breakfast for two people (INR 2744 without breakfast) which is one of the lowest rates I’ve seen for a prime hotel in Mumbai over the past months (I’ve also seen the Renaissance Mumbai at INR 3300). As is usual to access my perks as a Marriott Titanium Elite I booked the room via marriott.com.

The room rates for June 2021 also look pretty attractive.

Check-in experience

While I was booked in the Deluxe Room on the day of arrival I saw on the Marriott Bonvoy app that I was upgraded to the Courtyard Suite which indicated that this was an elite friendly hotel. However by the evening this had dropped to a Junior Suite. I arrived at the hotel at about 7:30 pm in a desolate lobby.

I was informed that the hotel had seen a sudden surge of occupancy at about 70% plus and hence the Courtyard Suite became unavailable at the last minute. Bad news for me but good news for the hotel that they managed to get such a high occupancy for a change. As I discovered during my stay the hotel had a large corporate customer base which was using the hotel to quarantine their associates or create bio-bubbles for them with meals being served in the room. Not just that the hotel also had small wedding groups where up to 25 people were allowed.

The hotel followed the standard hygiene theatre which all hotels are following for now. Temperature checks and hand sanitisation on arrival plexiglass for the reception area and sanitisation of keycards and pens and other high touch items in the lobby area.

The check-in process took a while with the reception only being staffed with two people and a slew of papers to be signed including health declarations and so on. Shipra and I were escorted to our room a pool view Junior Suite at the hotel.

Courtyard by Marriott Mumbai International Airport Hotel Pool View Junior Suite

I found the Suite to be large enough for a one-night stay. The 646 square feet suite had an L-shaped structure with no divisions between the seating and the sleeping areas of the suite.

As you can see above the Junior Suite had a queen bed and a day bed along the corner of the room. One television adorned the room with a DTH connection which beamed select channels. On the other side of the room there was a study table and a very comfortable couch. The whole suite was done up very well and to 5-star standards. However in the next remodelling I wish they would add power ports to both sides of the bed rather than just one side of the bed.

In the alley there was an empty minibar as was the case with the entire hotel. There was enough stock of water bottles in the room something I guess has been put on my Marriott Bonvoy profile now because I don’t have to ask any hotel for extra water bottles on arrival anymore for a while now. There was also the coffee and tea kettle and a big luggage rack as well.

There was also a half bathroom at the entry to the suite.

The shower area was as big as the room itself. There was a jacuzzi hot tub a shower chamber and a lavatory and an ample wardrobe on the other side.

The shower had a rain shower fitted in and much in line with a mid-scale brand from the Marriott collection there were wall outfitted large bottles of bath amenities from Ignis. However I struggled with the bottle to get anything out of it so I had to call in for the small tubes to lager up eventually.

The suite was sanitised and left out for a few hours before being handed over to us. All the paper items from the room were removed and the room had alcohol wet wipes for our use and touch-free digital menus.

Looking at this suite and hoping I could hold on to it Shipra and I decided that for the rest of my stay by the time till we did not have a bed of our own we could extend our stay at this property itself. We needed a bigger space because more luggage was yet to arrive which we had initially planned to take to the other hotel where we were originally supposed to stay. With the liberal cancellation policy for booking directly (2359 hours the night before arrival) I proceeded to secure a room here for the rest of the duration and cancel my other hotel reservation simultaneously.

Courtyard by Marriott Mumbai International Airport Hotel City View Courtyard Suite

After seeing a more extended stay the next day I got talking with the hotel management who explained the vast load the hotel saw the night before and their inability to offer the best eligible suite as they should have. The Director of Rooms informed me about the suite opening up for half my stay and asked if they’d want us to move there when it was ready. We took him up on this offer and we were moved to the new Suite when it was ready. The suite was of interest because it had a physical separation to divide the seating and sleeping areas and also had a dining table for what was turning out to be an extended stay.

The bedroom was no less comfortable with a bed a second TV and a workstation merged with the entertainment area.

The view from the window was towards the back-side of the hotel and we kept the blackout curtains closed for most of our stay.

The shower area was differently organised but had a tub a rain shower and a more extensive walk-in wardrobe.

Courtyard by Marriott Mumbai International Airport Hotel Dining

The hotel still operating under the CoVid-19 protocols of Mumbai could not offer a dining experience to guests while we were there. Consequently only the MoMoCafe was open during our time at the hotel but only for breakfast between 7 to 11 AM. For the rest of the day the hotel offered dine-in options. They have a fabulous Indian restaurant in Ummrao which I could not try out this time around.

The breakfast was offered as a sit-down experience. On the first day of my stay when there were many people staying at the hotel a small buffet opened up. However on the rest of the days an unlimited a-la-carte from the Breakfast menu was offered. The seating arrangements were all organised to be physically distant as per the current CoVid-19 advisory. On the day of the buffet we had to inform the staff about what we wanted from the buffet on display and they would serve it to us from the hotplates.

The hotel was using a smaller pool of resources during the breakfast. As perhaps there were fewer people on the job for now. This used to be okay if you arrived before 9:30 AM but in the final hour just like other times the number of guests arriving for breakfast grew manifold and this would mean service got slower. We met the restaurant manager Abhijeet and he was fully hands-on supporting the rest of the staff every day.

There was an assortment of options right from the fresh masala chai to a special dosa that we were recommended and so on. There was also an assortment of eggs on offer pastries and paranthas and so on.

On the first day I paid for a breakfast inclusive rate. However from the second day onwards I realised that I had breakfast included as a Titanium Elite amenity so I only paid for the basic rate at the hotel.

The hotel had a limited Indian and pan-Asian menu being sent through room service for the rest of the meals. However if one had to eat in the room many people were ordering in from outlets outside and collecting their orders at the lobby. This is how we got a meal in from Foo Mumbai when Shipra craved a Sushi lunch and a couple of other meals.

The hotel also had shut down their Executive Lounge and the night before arrival I would get a note from the hotel that high-tea was not going to be available as a consequence.

I do wish the hotel had their grab-n-go counters which would have meant a quick lunch or a bag of chips and so on could be bought from the counter or the vending machine rather than for us having to call for it from outside.

Courtyard by Marriott Mumbai International Airport Hotel Elite perks

The hotel knew its chops while dealing with Marriott Bonvoy elites. I felt however they did mess up once. The first night when I checked in I called back to ask about my Welcome Gift which choice was not enquired upon check-in. As per Marriott Bonvoy the following needs to be offered in Asia Australia Pacific Islands Caribbean Mexico Central America South America the Middle East and Africa for Courtyard Hotels:

Properties without lounge – 500 Points per Stay or F&B amenity per Stay or USD 10 F&B credit per night of Stay for Member +1

Properties with lounge – 500 Points per Stay and breakfast in the lounge – if the lounge is closed breakfast in a restaurant per night of Stay for Member +1

However when I called I was told that loyalty privileges were not being offered due to the pandemic at the moment a stance that Marriott reversed on January 11 2021. Anyhow while extending my stay I did not bother paying for breakfast as I could claim breakfast for free.

The hotel had a lovely gentleman Umesh who was the Concierge and responsible for elite guests at the hotel and he made sure that after this they did not drop the ball at all with elite privileges. He was extra nice to us and one day even sent us some complimentary refreshments to make up for the first night’s experience. Who can say no to a good cup of masala chai after all at 4 pm?

Bottomline

I found the Courtyard by Marriott Mumbai International Airport to be an excellent hotel for a short stay. Not just that I found their overall approach towards guest handling significantly evolved and in many cases even better than some of the high-end Marriott hotels in India. At the average price of INR 3000 per night I paid to stay here I found it extremely value-for-money. I know these prices will vanish the minute travel resumes but I would still consider them for a stay if I needed one in the future. For all of these reasons I think this was a 5-star hotel stay at a 4-star hotel prices for now.

Interview

Chadi Farhat

Chief Operating Officer sbe Lifestyle Hospitality

Tell us more about the SLS brand’s most unique points.

SLS’s primary unique point ultimately lies in the brand’s ability to combine the following ingredients: flawless service exceptional cuisine transcendent design and enthralling environment and wit. Through those capabilities SLS Dubai brings the best culinary mixology spa residential and nightlife experiences via its portfolio of branded venues and concepts.

SLS likes to flip tradition on its head and a key example of that is placing the lobby on the 71st floor aptly calling it the Sky Lobby. There you’ll find two distinctive concepts S Bar and 12 Chairs a Caviar Bar.

The opening of Fi’lia Dubai marks the fourth location worldwide and the very first in the Middle East for the concept. The restaurant is helmed by Chef Sara Aqel and the only restaurant in the region led exclusively by a team of talented women.

On the 75th floor lies Privilege a lounge and nightlife venue featuring the region’s highest two infinity pools offering coveted and unobstructed views of Dubai. Privilege is also home to the iconic SLS brand duck an emblem found in every SLS property around the globe.

Most notably the launch of Carna the renowned contemporary steakhouse Carna by Dario Cecchini on the 74th floor marks the dining concept’s initial presence in the region. As an industry pioneer we have profound respect for Dario Cecchini’s craft along with Tuscany’s culinary traditions.

And finally the presence of Ciel Spa a leading spa brand within the Accor group offers world-class services and customised treatments carried out by a team of expert aestheticians and therapists.

As a destination SLS Dubai’s unique points all cohesively work together in creating a community one that invites like-minded individuals to feel inspired.

Where does SLS fall on the luxury spectrum and how does the brand appeal to millennials (the most targeted consumer/guest category in times of pandemic) as well?

We’re living in a post-luxury world. Luxury has evolved beyond the material. To experience true luxury today is to enter a curated universe; a universe that intuitively understands one’s smallest needs that allows one to experience the joy of small surprises the poetry in a special moment and the humour in the irreverent. Luxury today is slowing down by simplifying life providing opportunities to share meaningful exchanges mingle with the like-minded and ultimately to inspire enrich and entertain us. SLS is the home of post-luxury…

In terms of the hotel and hospitality industry the lifestyle movement is trending exponentially. The brand of SLS straddles the line of ‘classical high luxury’ while also taking into consideration the lifestyle aspect. How can our services be improved to cater to different clientele’s needs? What is impressive is the blurring of boundaries between luxury and lifestyle and that they now seem to coexist. Luxury used to be defined as specific guest amenities room sizes service levels and product quality; now it is determined by the varied experiences offered to our guests.

Luxury and lifestyle both play a role within the ‘experience economy’ in order to appeal to customer’s expectations – which in turn are rapidly changing as well. SLS aims to be more creative in the offerings communicate on different platforms with our unique witty and playful tone of voice.

SLS does not appeal to only one demographic. Overall SLS caters to travellers and locals looking for the best culinary mixology spa residential and hotel experiences. Our customers come from different backgrounds inclusive of the millennials who are the prime targets of experiential luxury.

What does the SLS Dubai bring to the emirate?

The emirate is one of the most relevant global destinations. SLS is a natural fit for the Dubai market. The Middle East is a critical market for our lifestyle platform as we’re looking to open more properties in the region particularly in the GCC.

SLS Dubai presents to the Emirates an overall luxury lifestyle destination for the local and international traveler bringing the best culinary mixology spa residential and nightlife experiences.

SLS is all about luxury with a twist – the property itself is becoming an iconic pillar of architecture in the skyline of Dubai where guests can enjoy the urban lifestyle with an elevated bespoke experience and unparalleled views of the city.

What can SLS Dubai guests expect to see in the coming months?

In the coming months guests can continuously expect SLS Dubai’s unwavering focus on quality and an immaculate environment where the focus will always be squarely on them. SLS Dubai’s team will always connect with the local community engaging with partners in crafting something special and out-of-the-ordinary with the aim of delivering the type of cultural connection and experience so many of luxury guests seek.

Plus for the next few months SLS Dubai will be focusing on wellness going beyond the ideas of physical activity and relaxation though they are still important. Wellness is a state of mind; an attitude that for some guests they seek while at a hotel. Wellness must be integrated into all aspects of the guests stay providing them with not only a great experience but also access and insights on how to sustain a healthy lifestyle and mindset in their every day lives. And thanks to Ciel Spa a leading spa brand within the Accor group we’re presenting guests with an intimate wellness haven to communicate and highlight SLS Dubai’s high regard of wellness.

We will continue reinventing the experience at SLS Dubai from events to activations we will always be delivering new experiences to keep our guests engaged and our brand relevant."

Food is essential for our survival a fundamental requirement of life and the provider of strength vitality and energy. It is also the keeper of our cultural traditions and indispensable to our social lives — think of any celebration and it will involve food.

However our relationship with food is dangerously imbalanced. We produce enough food but nearly one in 10 people still don’t have sufficient to eat and three billion cannot afford a healthy diet. At the same time we waste one-third of all food produced along with the natural resources that went into its production.

Our food and agricultural systems stretch planetary boundaries beyond their limits. By valuing quantity over quality and driving farmers to produce monocrops for low prices we use the natural resources needed for sustained production and degrade the land leading to climate change and extreme weather events.

As the coronavirus crisis unfolded we started to understand how fragile our food systems are. We saw news stories of food destroyed milk dumped and crops rotting in the fields while consumers faced empty shelves. Our complicated global supply chains couldn’t adapt fast enough to our changing realities.

To mend our damaged relationship with food there are critical questions we need to answer: How do we produce sufficient food that’s healthy for both the people who produce it and the people who eat it? How do we ensure our food systems are fair resilient and equitable? How can we feed our growing global population and protect our planet for generations to come?

We have a choice: We can continue to grow our food systems in a linear exploitative and extractive way; or we can move to a system that promotes biodiversity regeneration nutritious food equity and healthy people.

We believe the decision is clear. We must choose to work with the planet — not against it — for the benefit of people and the planet by following these principles:

Harness the Regenerative Power of Our Earth

This is critical to overcoming the biggest challenges of our time: a degrading environment loss of biodiversity and climate change. Regenerative agriculture leads to healthy soil capable of producing high quality nutrient-dense food. It also improves rather than degrades the land and supports productive farms and healthy communities and economies. This helps safeguard farmers’ livelihoods so they can grow the food we need now and in the future.

Build Stronger Local and Circular Food Systems

Related Reading Up to 850000 Animal Viruses Could Be Caught by Humans Unless We Protect Nature Using the Natural World to Remove Carbon Climate Change Is a Health Crisis. How Can Health Care and Life Sciences Respond?

Building stronger local and circular food systems helps to keep valuable natural resources minerals and nutrients in the loop. Circular agribusinesses not only provide excellent environmental solutions they also create jobs and reduce countries’ dependency on imports.

Wastewater for example can be treated to extract important finite minerals like phosphates. Food loss and waste can be composted so valuable nutrients return to the soil instead of being thrown away. And organic farm waste can be used for bioenergy to power homes and agribusinesses. New nature-based technologies such as the use of black soldier flies to compost waste can generate multiple useful products including compost fertilizer and animal feed.

Give Farmers a Voice and Support Their Planet-Positive Choices

As the world’s population continues to grow people will depend upon farmers for food — more than ever before. We must empower farmers to drive solutions and be at the forefront of a global regenerative revolution by making them an integral part of policy discussions. They can help build the system of products and services that are locally relevant and reduce dependency on patented and/or chemical inputs.

Move From Low Cost to True Cost

Paradoxically cheap food is expensive for people and the planet. It keeps us locked into an unsustainable food system that costs the global economy significant amounts of money. The current price of food does not factor in the health bill generated by unhealthy diets or the cost of land degradation and biodiversity loss.

Furthermore low wages for farmers make agriculture an unpredictable and often unsafe sector. To get back on track we need greater consumer awareness and public policies that value nutritious diets a healthy environment and farmers who practice regenerative agriculture.

Foster Radical Collaboration

Though we’re hopeful for the future we are quickly running out of time. We urgently need to remove the barriers that prevent us from transforming the way we produce and consume food. This involves changing mindsets trying new things and learning fast.

We don’t yet know all the answers but we do know that business-as-usual is the problem. We must change course and do it now. This is only possible through collaboration between farmers consumers funders governments businesses and NGOs.

Together we can work toward a food system that not only feeds us but also celebrates life — one that nurtures people adds color and flavor to our plates and palates and most importantly ensures a future for ourselves on this planet.

What are you doing to make a difference this World Environment Day?

Johannesburg South Africa (05 June 2021) – Today people are rethinking their relationship with nature. As the effects of climate change ravage many parts of the world and we experience some of the most extreme weather events on record we must urgently think of innovative ways to inspire collective action to address climate change.

The latest sustainability research commissioned by Mastercard has shown a marked increase in consumer passion for the environment as personal attitudes toward the environment evolve.

The study revealed that 98% of adults in South Africa are willing to take personal action on sustainability issues.

In light of this and ahead of World Environmental Day on 5 June Mark Elliott Division President of Mastercard South Africa and Peter Ndunda Kenya Country Lead at Global Restoration Initiative joined Brent Lindeque on Good Things Guy to discuss the Mastercard Priceless Coalition and sustainability efforts in being a force for good.

Now it’s the time to re-evaluate this card and see if it’s still the best cash back card in Canada.

Our no-fee Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card Review takes a detailed look at the ins and outs of this highly praised and much-awarded no-fee cashback credit card. Flexibility is the name of the game for Tangerine’s credit cards as both cards offer users a unique opportunity to choose the categories that receive bonus rewards. Is the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card a good fit for you? Let’s take a closer look:





Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card Review: The Numbers

Annual Fee: $0. The Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card like the Tangerine World Mastercard has no annual fee.

Minimum Income: The Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card has a low annual income requirement of $12000. This plus the lack of annual fees makes it an excellent starter card for students or people who are just starting out and may not qualify for the higher income limits of many other cards.

Interest Rate: 19.95% on purchases balance transfers and cash advances.

Tangerine Mastercard Welcome Bonus

Tangerine have a new promotional offer for new clients who sign up for either the Money-Back Credit Card or the World Mastercard. If you apply before March 5th 2024 you’ll be able to earn an extra 10% cashback on all purchases. This promo applies when you spend at least $1000 on your first 2 months – for a total of $100 in value.

Earn Rate and Rewards

Tangerine boasts the only cards on the market today which allow you to choose your bonus earning categories. Cardholders can tailor the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card to their own needs and habits by choosing two categories out of the following to receive 2% Money-Back Rewards:

Grocery

Furniture

Restaurants

Hotel/Motel

Gas

Recurring Bill Payments

Drug Store

Home Improvement

Entertainment

Public Transportation and Parking

Cardholders who elect to have their Money-Back Rewards deposited monthly into a Tangerine savings account can select a third 2% earning category. Check out our Tangerine Bank review for more information about banking with Tangerine.

There is no spending cap on the rewards – you’ll earn 2% cash back on your chosen categories no matter how much you use your card. All other categories earn Money-Back rewards at a rate of 0.5%.

If you realize after opening the card that your choice of categories isn’t working for you you can make one change at any time. However if you need to change more than one category you will need to wait for 90 days after the previous change has been implemented to make the next change and so on.

Insurance Coverage

Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card cardholders receive the following coverage up to a $60000 lifetime maximum:

Purchase Assurance automatically covers purchases against loss theft or damage for up to 90 days from the date of purchase.

Extended warranty coverage may double the period of repair services up to one year.

The Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card does not provide any travel insurance or rental car coverage.

Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card vs. The Competition

If you’re in the market for a no-fee cash-back credit card there are plenty of excellent choices. In the end as always it’s going to come down to personal preferences. During our Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card review process our editorial team assessed the various offerings on the market to see how they compare:

The Amex Simplycash card is a no-fee flat-rate card that offers 1.25% cash back on all purchases period with no earning limit. It currently has a welcome bonus of 2.5% cashback on all purchases made in the first 3 months (up to $6000 in spending which equals $150 cash back).



Verdict: The generous welcome bonus and flat earning rate make this card appealing. However keep in mind that Amex is not as widely accepted as other credit cards.

The BMO Cashback Mastercard is a no-fee flexible category cashback card that offers 3% cashback on groceries 1% on recurring bills and 0.5% on all other purchases. However it does have spending caps for the rewards: up to $500/month on groceries $500/month on bills and up to $1500/month on everything else.



Verdict: The BMO Cashback Mastercard does have a welcome bonus: 5% cashback on all purchases in the first month which we appreciate. However the spending limits also apply to the welcome bonus period which seriously limits the benefits.

The Rogers World Elite Mastercard is a no-fee Mastercard which offers unlimited 1.5% cash-back on all eligible purchases. It currently offers a welcome bonus of $25 in cash back rewards if you make your first purchase within 3 months of opening your card and it includes emergency medical travel insurance as well as trip cancellation and interruption insurance.



Verdict: We love a card with travel insurance not to mention unlimited cash-back potential. However the downside (for some) of the Rogers World Elite Mastercard is that it has a minimum required income of $80000 as well as a minimum annual spend of $15000 to maintain eligibility.

These are just a few of the options—for more information check out our review of the top cash-back credit cards.

When compared against the rest of the field of no-fee cashback cards the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card holds up extremely well. The 2% bonus category earning is generous compared to some of the other offerings especially when paired with unlimited earning potential (unlike the BMO Cashback Mastercard which caps eligible spending).

We appreciate the unparalleled flexibility of the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card plus the relatively low minimum income requirement means that it remains an option when other cards may be financially out of reach (for now).

Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card vs. Tangerine World Mastercard

When Tangerine released their second no-fee card the Tangerine World Mastercard three years after the Money-Back Credit Card it’s clear that they knew they were already onto a good thing.

When you break it down the World Mastercard is identical to the Money-Back Credit Card in terms of:

earn rates

interest rates

reward structure

zero annual fees

The first notable difference is the required minimum income ($60000 personal/$100000 household income for the Tangerine World Mastercard vs. $12000 for the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card).

The Tangerine World Mastercard also offers additional perks associated with Mastercard (airport lounge access international WIFI hotspots and rental car insurance). If you have the required income it doesn’t hurt to apply for the World Mastercard but really if the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card is more within your reach financially you’re not losing out on much.

You can read our full Tangerine World Mastercard review for more detailed information about the card.

The Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card Review: Things to consider

When you’re looking for a good no-fee cashback card you need to consider a number of factors:

What do you use the card for?

How much are you likely to spend?

Do you want any kind of extra insurance coverage?

Depending on your specific circumstances one card may come out on top that wouldn’t for another shopper.

That being said the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card stands up well to the competition and is well worth considering. And its $0 annual fee and lower annual income requirement make it a good bet for just about anyone.

One strategy for maximizing cash-back possibilities would be to use the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card for purchases in your three bonus categories only and to use another card with a higher base rate for other purchases. A card like the Amex SimplyCash card would give you twice the cash back on purchases outside the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card’s bonus categories.

Tangerine No Fee Mastercard Review: FAQ

Does the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card have a credit score requirement? Tangerine recently lowered the credit score cut offs from 700 down to 600. This means it no longer requires applicants to have a good to excellent credit score to be approved for the Money-Back card. Does the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card have a maximum limit? The Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card gives you the same cashback rewards regardless of how much you spend but obviously in terms of a baseline spending limit that amount will be personalized like it is on any credit card. Which is the best Tangerine credit card for students? The best Tangerine credit card for students is the Money-Back Credit Card which has a lower required minimum income ($12000). Does the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card have any Costco-specific perks? The Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card does not have any Costco-specific perks. Like all Mastercards it is accepted for purchases at Costco but please be aware that Costco does not count in any of the categories that can earn 2% cash back. Purchases at Costco will earn 0.5% cash back.

Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card Review: Final Verdict

In a world where most bonus category cashback credit cards dictate which categories can earn you more money the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card (and the Tangerine World Mastercard with it) stands out as the card with the most flexibility. You can design the card to save you money exactly where you spend the most.

The Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card is praised by industry experts and appreciated by consumers for its flexibility and lack of both fees and caps on earning.

The base rate of 0.5% cashback is relatively low and the lack of a significant welcome bonus is unfortunate but this card is still a strong contender in the ranks of no-fee cashback cards.

In addition your earning potential could be increased by using the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card in tandem with another card that has a higher base rate for purchases outside the Money-Back card’s bonus categories.

Korea trounce Turkmenistan 5-0 in World Cup qualifying match,"By Yoo Jee-ho

SEOUL June 5 (Yonhap) -- Forward Hwang Ui-jo grabbed a brace and three different players chipped in a goal each as South Korea handily beat Turkmenistan 5-0 in a World Cup qualifying match on Saturday.

South Korea stayed at the top of Group H in the second round of the Asian qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup following their dominant victory at Goyang Stadium in Goyang just northwest of Seoul.

South Korea have 10 points with two wins and two draws. Lebanon also have 10 points but trail South Korea in goal difference plus-15 to plus-5.

South Korea have scored 15 goals and have not yet conceded any. They will next play Sri Lanka at 8 p.m. on Wednesday followed by Lebanon at 3 p.m. on June 13 both at Goyang.

Ranked 39th South Korea predictably dominated the run of play against the 130th-ranked Turkmenistan. South Korean players practically lived in the Turkmenistan zone in the first half peppering the beleaguered goalkeeper Rasul Charyyev with shot after quality shot.

It only took nine minutes for South Korea to break the ice as Hwang headed home a perfectly placed cross from Hong Chul.

Only heroic efforts by Charyyev kept the score respectable in the first half. In the 19th Son Heung-min set up winger Lee Jae-sung for a chance that Charyyev turned aside. Seven minutes later Kwon Chang-hoon's header rang off the right post.

Son himself was denied in the 31st minute. On the ensuing sequence Nam Tae-hee tried to complete a tic-tac-toe play but couldn't convert from point-blank range. Hwang's shot off a rebound was deflected out of play.

In the 39th Hong's curling free kick from outside the box was punched out by the diving Charyyev.

South Korea kept pushing for the second goal. In the 44th Kwon had a one-on-one opportunity after a Turkmen turnover but Charyyev once again was up to the task.

The Turkmen goalkeeper finally broke in injury time with Nam pouncing on a rebound for a 2-0 lead after Charyyev made the initial save on Kwon.

South Korea kept the pedal to the metal in the second half. Hwang had a couple of glorious opportunities in the opening moments first getting turned aside by Charyyev and then airmailing a shot on a fast break.

Kwon tried to join the party in the 51st minute when his volley set up by Nam went off a defender's leg and over the crossbar.

Defender Kim Young-gwon got South Korea's third goal about a dozen minutes into the second half. After Jung Woo-young headed down a corner kick Kim made no mistake from the goalmouth.

Kwon made it 4-0 when he scored off a juicy rebound following a Son Heung-min free kick in the 62nd minute.

Kwon then played the role of a setup man in the 72nd minute crossing for Hwang for a backheel goal that put South Korea ahead 5-0.

The second round play had been on hold since November 2019. It was scheduled to resume in March 2020 but all matches for that year were wiped out because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To reduce traveling and minimize infection risks South Korea will serve as the centralized venue for all remaining Group H matches. North Korea who had played five matches in the group withdrew from the competition last month citing COVID-19 concerns. All of North Korea's previous matches have been voided.

From the second round the eight group winners and the four-best runners-up will reach the third round.

South Korea have played at every World Cup since 1986.

To understand why most of the spectators at Headingley enjoyed today's cricket in all its gourmet and gourmandising glory you probably need to have paid close attention to Yorkshire's batting performances this season. They have often been bloody awful. Before this match Steve Patterson's side had been bowled out for 230 or fewer in five of their seven first innings and the skipper acknowledged that last week's defeat had been on its way for a while. The fact that it was inflicted by Lancashire merely gave the gladius an extra twist. A side rarely prospers if the average score at which its third wicket falls is 85. Watching roobish like that on the live stream may have prompted a few domestic traumas.

Now it is three o'clock on this warm Saturday in early June. It is an afternoon out of J L Carr an afternoon of long moments and great stillness an afternoon for which to be newly grateful. And Yorkshire are 465 for 6. This is abundance without recent precedent. Having taken nine batting bonus points from their previous seven games - the lowest in the land - the home side have collected a maximum five from this innings. Their effort has been held together by Dawid Malan  who has filled his boots wellies and slippers with runs. Ten of his 22 fours have been cut or worked backward of square on the off side.

Not since Harry Lime had his clogs popped by Holly Martins in a Vienna sewer has the absence of a third man been so noticeable. The only severe disappointment of the day was suffered ten minutes ago: Malan was bowled by Jack Carson for 199 when his attempted angled deflection merely allowed a fine ball bowled from over the wicket to turn past the blade and hit the left-hander's off stump. He needed that single to become the first batsman to score double hundreds in consecutive innings for Yorkshire.

Malan's innings was a triumph of technique a near-perfect example of a batsman with discriminating knowledge of his particular game and in perfect command of its wristy cuts and gentle glides. Few people this dream-laden hour will recall that he was dropped on only 27 yesterday afternoon when Travis Head spilled a slip catch off Henry Crocombe.

Dawid Malan - In his own words On being more fearless in first-class cricket since his last Test in 2018:

""In international stuff it was slightly different when you're playing against good bowlers and your place is under threat all of the time. But I've tried to learn from my failures at Test cricket and put that into practice in four-day cricket. Since 2019 I think my record speaks for itself just having that fearless approach in four-day cricket and backing my technique and way of playing.

On a possible Test return:

""I wouldn't be here playing four-day cricket if I didn't want to play Test cricket again. I still feel like I've got a hell of a lot to give. Whether I'm good enough that's not my decision. I just have to keep scoring runs. Hopefully if I keep getting big scores like this I can put pressure on the people who make decisions.""

On previous Ashes (2017-18):

""I think I played well in that Ashes series. I now know my game better. Being back in the T20s and the odd ODI I've learnt what I need to do to perform at that level. But Test cricket is a different mentality and there's more scrutiny. In my last five Tests I probably didn't handle that as well as I could have. Hopefully I'd be in a better position now.""

Carson deserved his wicket though. Four overs before his dismissal Malan had produced his most atypical shot against the spinner a gorgeous extra-cover drive for six but the Ulsterman was the pick of Ben Brown's attack throughout the innings. Very few young spinners have his ability to adjust their length when they see a batsman advancing down the pitch and there have been times in this innings when Carson has been the only bowler Brown could trust to throttle the run rate. His extra bounce accounted for Gary Ballance  who was caught behind for 77 in the fourth over of the day. Malan received a standing ovation of course. It was the loudest applause heard here since 12.08 when news reached Leeds probably at lightning speed that Lancashire had lost at Cardiff. That was more like it.

For yes there is certainly evidence that folk in these parts are getting worried. At the junction of North Lane and Bennett Road just a couple of good hits from the cricket ground the simple graffito ""Gooch!"" is daubed on a white wall. It is not known whether the exclamation mark was added after Yorkshire's defeat in last week's Roses Match; whether in other words a polite suggestion had turned into a frantic demand that Martyn Moxon signs a 67-year-old former England opener who last played a County Championship match in 1997. But then losing to that lot across the way can do alarming things to people round this way; they fear a run on their building societies.

Malan calmed such worries and Harry Duke 's accomplished fifty reinforced his reputation as a fine player. Yorkshire were bowled out for 558 seven overs after tea; it is their highest score since 2016. Having had Harry Brook strangled for 49 in the morning Jamie Atkins picked up three quick wickets and finished with 5 for 98 the first five-wicket haul of his three-match career. They are nice figures if you can get 'em. Carson caught and bowled Patterson who was probably disoriented by having to bat when the scoreboard didn't read something like130 for 7.

Rather suddenly though there was fresh tension in our cricket as Tom Haines and Ali Orr began Sussex's task of batting most of eight hours to secure the draw. Yet to the surprise of many at Headingley and to the disappointment of even more the openers batted so coolly for 23 overs that a wicket did not look like falling. Patterson used his five main bowlers but Orr played as diligently as he had when facing the new ball on Thursday morning. This is his first-class debut and he looks a proper batsman."

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvZGF2ZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stZmFybS1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This G.O.P. Senate Candidate Says He Grew Up on a Family Farm. Not Exactly.,"David McCormick’s origin story goes something like this: He grew up in rural Pennsylvania southwest of Scranton. He baled hay trimmed Christmas trees and otherwise worked on his family’s farm. And from those humble beginnings he rose to achieve the American dream.

“I spent most of my life in Pennsylvania growing up in Bloomsburg on my family’s farm” Mr. McCormick now a Republican candidate for Senate told Pittsburgh Quarterly in 2022.

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

“I grew up on a family farm from the time I was a kid” he said at the Pennsylvania farm show in January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RydW1wLWJpZGVuLW1jY29ybWljay1jYXNleS1zZW5hdGUtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXByaW1hcnktMTI0ODRlNjVhNjhmNDM2NGZlYzUxZWM1ZDQ2MGU1MzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey and McCormick to face each other as nominees in Pennsylvania's high-stakes US Senate contest,"HARRISBURG Pa. (AP) — Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger David McCormick will face each other in Pennsylvania’s high-stakes U.S. Senate contest this fall as Tuesday’s primary election put the men on track for a race that is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and help decide control of the Senate next year.

Casey and McCormick won their respective party primary contests after they were uncontested and now enter what is likely to be a grueling expensive and hard-fought 2024 general election campaign that culminates in the Nov. 5 vote.

Casey seeking his fourth term is perhaps Pennsylvania’s best-known politician and a stalwart of the presidential swing state’s Democratic Party — the son of a former two-term governor and Pennsylvania’s longest-ever serving Democrat in the Senate.

McCormick is a two-time Senate challenger a former hedge fund CEO and a Pennsylvania native who spent $14 million of his own money only to lose narrowly to celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022’s seven-way GOP primary. Oz then lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman in a pivotal Senate contest.

This time around McCormick has consolidated the party around his candidacy and is backed by a super PAC that’s already reported raising more than $20 million much of it from securities-trading billionaires.

What to know about the 2024 Election

Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020. More challenges lie ahead in 2024.

The Associated Press is the most trusted source of information on election night with a history of accuracy dating to 1848. Read the latest: Follow AP’s complete coverage of this year’s election.

McCormick’s candidacy is shaping up as the strongest challenge to Casey in his three reelection bids. McCormick has worked to shore up support in the GOP base and on Tuesday night hammered his message at his election night gathering in Pittsburgh that Casey is a do-nothing senator.

“We’re now turning to the general election and here’s the truth: Pennsylvania deserves better than Bob Casey You deserve better” McCormick said. “Bob Casey’s defining achievement in his political life 30 years in political office has been to be the son of Bob Casey Sr. That is what defines his political career.”

Casey in Washington on Tuesday to cast votes in favor of $95 billion in war aid to Ukraine Israel and Taiwan said on social media that “there are 196 days until the general election and we’re going to win.” Meanwhile the state Democratic Party unveiled a minute-long digital ad slamming McCormick as a “millionaire hedge fund executive who is lying to Pennsylvanians.”

The Senate candidates will share a ticket with candidates for president in a state that is critical to whether Democrats can maintain control of the White House and the Senate.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump won their party nominations easily after all major rivals dropped out. Both men made campaign trips to swing-state Pennsylvania in recent days and voters can expect to see plenty of them their TV ads and their surrogates campaigning over the next six months in a state that swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020.

Of note however could be the number of “ uncommitted ” write-in votes cast in the Democratic primary to protest Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

In the Senate contest Democrats have attacked McCormick’s opposition to abortion rights his frequent trips to Connecticut’s ritzy “Gold Coast ” where he keeps a family home and the focus on investing in China during his dozen years as an executive at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates including as CEO.

Casey has been a key player for Democrats trying to reframe the election-year narrative about the economy by attacking “greedflation” — a blunt term for corporations that jack up prices and rip off shoppers to maximize profits — as fast-rising prices over the past three years have opened a big soft spot in 2024 for Democrats. Indications that the U.S. economy avoided a recession amid efforts to manage inflation have yet to translate into voter enthusiasm for Biden.

McCormick meanwhile has accused Casey of rubber-stamping harmful immigration economic energy and national security policies of Biden and made a bid for Jewish voters by traveling to the Israel-Gaza border and arguing that Biden hasn’t backed Israel strongly enough in the Israel-Hamas war.

Casey is one of Biden’s strongest allies in Congress. McCormick and Trump have endorsed each other but are an awkward duo atop the GOP’s ticket after Trump savaged McCormick in 2022’s primary in a successful bid to lift Oz to his primary win.

Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins but face a difficult 2024 Senate map that requires them to defend incumbents in the red states of Montana and Ohio and fight for open seats with new candidates in Michigan and West Virginia.

A Casey loss could guarantee Republican control of the Senate.

Elsewhere on the ballot Tuesday Pennsylvanians decided nominees for an open attorney general’s office and two other statewide offices — treasurer and auditor general — plus all 17 of the state’s U.S. House seats.

For attorney general Republicans nominated Dave Sunday York County’s district attorney in a two-way race while Democrats nominated former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale of Pittsburgh in a five-person primary field.

Democrats also nominated Erin McClelland a two-time congressional candidate in suburban Pittsburgh who has helped run various human services organizations to challenge Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity and they nominated state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia to challenge Republican state Auditor General Tim DeFoor. McClelland prevailed despite being heavily outspent by her party-endorsed rival.

For Congress 44 candidates were on ballots including all 17 incumbents. All three incumbents facing primary challengers — Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in suburban Philadelphia and Democratic Reps. Dwight Evans in Philadelphia and Summer Lee in a Pittsburgh-based district — won their races.

Lee’s primary against challenger Bhavini Patel has shaped up as an early test of whether Israel’s war with Gaza poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how it has been handled.

Republicans nominated state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie in a three-way race to challenge Democratic Rep. Susan Wild whose Allentown-based district is closely politically divided while Democrats nominated former TV news personality Janelle Stelson from among six candidates to challenge Republican Rep. Scott Perry in a Republican-leaning district in southern Pennsylvania.

Perry has become a national figure for heading up the ultra-right House Freedom Caucus during a speakership battle and his efforts to help Trump stay in power after losing the 2020 presidential election.

""We're excited to bring customers even closer to their beloved band in a way only McDonald's can – through our delicious food – when we introduce the BTS signature order on our menu next month"" Morgan Flatley the chief marketing officer of McDonald's US said in a statement when the promotion was announced.

McDonald's has partnered with celebrities on signature order campaigns before to huge success. The Travis Scott meal last fall was so popular that some locations ran out of Quarter Pounder ingredients. It was also enriching for Scott personally as he netted at least $20 million from the deal according to Forbes. The BTS meal has the potential to be even more successful for McDonald's – it is outpacing the gains from the first week of the Travis Scott Meal which bumped traffic 9% in the first week it was offered.

Collaborating with young artists and creators became huge for fast-food chains in 2020 and is continuing strong in 2021. The deals helped brands connect with Gen Z customers and often ended up on social media and as TikTok trends.

Like the two other celebrity collaborations the BTS meal is made up of existing menu items to draw in customers (though the sauces are a new addition in the US) a move that analysts have praised. With a celebrity endorsement brands can harness the energy and excitement of a new product without actually adding menu items.

The era of fast-food and celebrity partnerships isn't likely to end anytime soon. Brands continue to look for strategies to reach younger customers and they've found something that works.

""They look to recommendations much more than any other generation has. They're very reliant on social media. They're very reliant on their friends"" Flatley told Business Insider.

The BTS meal isn't yet available in every country McDonald's has planned. By June 25 residents of all 49 included countries will be able to try it out.

Despite the meal's success so far it hasn't moved the needle as much as McDonald's chicken sandwich did. The crispy chicken sandwich launched in February bumped traffic 16% in the first week according to Gordon Haskett. Placer.ai found that foot traffic increased more than 20% week-over-week in the days following the release helping the chain get closer to pre-pandemic numbers.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. GlycoMimetics said its experimental drug for acute myeloid leukemia failed to achieve the primary goal of a Phase 3 study.

said its experimental drug for acute myeloid leukemia failed to achieve the primary goal of a Phase 3 study. Krystal Biotech reported Vyjuvek sales of $45.3 million in the first quarter. Vyjuvek is a topical gene therapy for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa an inherited disorder causes painful blisters and persistent wounds.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

Roblox an online gaming and game-creating platform has blossomed into a fascinating online community collective virtual shared space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality.

The Metaverse’s allure lies in its limitlessness familiar and well-organised structure and the exciting way in which it allows young people to interact both with each other the brands and characters that populate it as well as the narratives that unfold within it.

Vitally children and teenagers are moulding the Roblox metaverse in real-time defining it as the community grows and interconnects in a collaborative and interactive way.

The Metaverse has been designed to specifically integrate key values shared by generations Z and Alpha.

This includes the ability to showcase your unique identity to make friends to enter and participate in an immersive environment cross-platform compatibility having diverse interests catered to an ease of use and the avoidance of a steep learning curve an in-built commerce system as well as having a space that combines politeness and trust.

Roblox is sort of like the Matryoshka doll of gaming. At the very core lies an online platform that users can use to create their very own three-dimensional video games.

Other people can then choose to play those games created by their fellow users.

Roblox utilises a custom programming language called Lua which gives them control over the game’s world.

Glueing everything together is Roblox’s social networking features where users can meet each other form friendships engage in multiplayer gaming and participate in various activities.

“As a user of the Roblox platform you and your friends can collaborate on building or just gather and explore other users’ creations” the company says.

Crucially the users on Roblox are generally quite young with the core demographic being placed between the ages of 9 and 15.

This has resulted in Roblox being associated as the go-to platform for younger people especially as it combines entertainment with creativity and education.

When Roblox co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel launched their game platform in 2006 they had never envisioned that it would grow to 199 million monthly active users.

In fact in the first quarter of 2021 a whopping 42 million of them used Roblox on a daily basis.

“The day we released our first multiplayer game with characters there were about 20 kids on the site. They all got together in Crossroads and started building” said the late Cassel back in 2010 detailing how Roblox evolved from a single-player game to one of the most cooperative and interconnected gaming platforms in the world.

“Soon the kids noticed they could build platforms on their own shoulders (surprise we hadn’t realised this) and so they started carrying each other around on bizarre brick contraptions strapped to their backs. It was completely unexpected collaborative and fun” Cassel added.

Roblox and the aforementioned inadvertent creation of its vibrant online community have caused the company’s valuation to swell to a pre-IPO listing of about $30 billion.

This figure rose to an eye-watering $41.9 billion valuation in direct listing after the company had gone public.

In terms of revenue Roblox has performed impressively in recent years. In 2020 the company brought in $920 million in revenue a near 111 per cent increase from the previous year.

Roblox’s valuation figures are not just about present-day revenue however. They are also about the company’s potential with the community at the heart of its prospects.

While the platform itself is free and does not generate revenue through sheer usage alone Roblox does indeed charge money for in-game purchases which utilise the game’s proprietary virtual currency Robux.

This also allows the people who develop games on the platform to utilise their programming skills and creativity as well since they can charge other users to play their games.

In 2020 alone Roblox paid developers $250 million through its Developer Exchange Program.

“The Developer Exchange Program allows you to earn money by creating awesome games on Roblox. The DevEx program is based on the services that you provide on the Roblox platform” the company explains.

Roblox’s online world often referred to as the metaverse is already a diverse exciting and ever-growing destination for Roblox’s young users.

“Our hope is that the Metaverse doesn’t just look like reality. It feels like reality so that the cars in the Metaverse have engines and they have axles and they have wheels. When the wheel falls off the car the car does what we would expect in real life” said Roblox CEO Baszucki.

“So part of this hope of a physically-driven Metaverse is actually easier to program and easier to create emergent behaviour because it kind of works like we expect.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vZm9yZXgucXVlYmVjL2VuL2Jlc3QtdHJhZGluZy1wbGF0Zm9ybXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Trading Platforms 2024 » Forex Crypto Stocks Trading Platform,"BEST TRADING PLATFORMS 2024

There's a reason that the term hot tub meta became a thing at all. People wanna see it and those who think that it's done and over with are in for a rude awakening. Here are three reasons why the hot tub meta isn't going anywhere.

Never watched a hot tub stream? Then you're probably not spending much time on Twitch because even now this type of content is still very prominent on the site. Here's why.

1. The Hot Tub Meta Is Already Too Big

When Twitch's idea of dealing with the situation is to create a category designed to fit specific content you simply cannot deny said content's importance to the platform.

Many probably thought Amouranth losing her ad revenue was a sign that Twitch is shutting hot tub streamers down. After the creation of Pools Hot Tubs and Beaches it's clear that's not the case. The pool had simply become too large to be emptied.

2. The Hot Tube Meta Is Breaking Viewership Records

If you need numerical proof of reason no. 1 take a hold of this. The record viewership for a hot tub stream was broken twice in the span of the last two weeks. First byPokimane and the OfflineTV crew. Then by GeorgeNotFound.

In both instances no nudity was needed to attract the audience. The words ""Pokimane hot tub stream"" did the job all by themselves. That's how powerful the meta is months after becoming a thing.

3. The Hot Tube Meta Has Hot Girls in Bikinis

This could really be brought in any conversation but it's vindicated when speaking of the hot tub meta for obvious reasons. We made it clear a couple sentences ago: nudity isn't even a necessary ingredient. However when push comes to shove hot tubs will continue to be a thing on Twitch because there's always going to be viewership potential when hot girls in bikinis are involved. Life is that simple sometimes.

So what do you think? Is a pair of bikinis enough to pull you in or do you need a hot girl around the bikini? Or a hot boy...? No judging here you do you.

Tunnel to Towers Ambassador Nate Carroll Sets New Push-Up World Record at MetLife Stadium

Staten Island NY June 06 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On the 50-yard line of MetLife Stadium Wisconsin father of three Nate Carroll completed his 1500231st push-up to set a new world record for the most push-ups done in a year.

Carroll dedicated his 12-month quest to break the record to America’s first responders by partnering with the Tunnel to Towers Foundation to raise money for its Fallen First Responder Program.

The Fallen First Responder Program pays off the mortgages for the families of law enforcement officers and firefighters who are killed in the line of duty and leave behind young children.

Fittingly he broke the record in front of first responders during half-time of the 48th Annual Fun City Bowl an annual showdown between the FDNY and NYPD football teams hosted by the First Responders Children’s Foundation an organization that awards college scholarships to children of those first responders who have been killed or injured in the line of duty.

“It was awesome to be on the field to be cheered on by so many first responders” said Carroll.

Carroll is working with the Guinness Book of World Records and the Record Holders Republic Registry of Official World Records to get his record verified.

After more than 1.5 million push-ups Carroll still isn’t done.

His 12-month period ends on June 13 and he plans to add to his push-up total and make sure the final total features the numbers ‘911’ in honor of the 20th anniversary of the September 11th attacks.

“It was an honor to set a new world record here in New York in front of members of the NYPD FDNY PAPD and other first responders. I want this record to pay tribute to the sacrifice made by so many heroes that tragic day” said Carroll.

You can see a video of Nate Carroll’s record-breaking push-ups on his Instagram and Twitter.

Why that's good news for teams like the New York Giants.

After weeks of speculation the Atlanta Falcons are finally set to move on from star wide receiver Julio Jones.

Jones who last season fought through injuries has been one of the NFL’s most electrifying receivers over the last decade after being drafted out of Alabama sixth overall in 2011.

Jones recorded six straight 1000-yard seasons (2014-2019) and led the NFL in receiving yards (18710 in 2015).

With Jones out of the NFC that’s good news for teams like the New York Giants who prior to the trade were scheduled to face him this season.

With Jones now out of the picture that will be one less weapon for the Giants defense to have to defend when the two teams meet at MetLife Stadium in Week 3.

The Giants can instead focus on receiver Calvin Ridley and rookie tight end Kyle Pitts in the Falcons passing game.

Jones has faced the Giants four times in the regular season during Jones’s career going 3-1 in those games. Jones caught 39 out of 49 pass targets for 418 yards (10.72 yards/reception) and two touchdowns.

They also faced each other in the 2011 Wild Card game in Jones’ rookie season. The Giants won that game 24-2 but Jones caught seven of eight passes for 64 yards and had a 13-yard rushing attempt.

The Giants are 11-13 in the regular season against the Falcons having last played them on October 22 2018 in a Monday Night Football game at Atlanta that the Giants lost 23-20.

In 12 games against the Giants on New York's home turf the Giants are 4-8 against the Falcons.

As harness racing resumes at Yonkers Raceway after a brief break this Monday June 7 Empire City Casino by MGM Resorts (“Empire City”) announced today harness racing spectators can return to wager and enjoy live racing in person at the historic track beginning Wednesday June 9.

Yonkers Raceway is preparing for an exciting schedule of racing this season.

Members of the “A Sure Bet For NY’s Future” alliance of business and labor groups from the Bronx and the Greater Westchester region met with local government allies June 2 to show their support for speeding up the approval of full-scale casino gaming for Empire City Casino in Yonkers.

The rally was held to push the state to put in place an Request for Proposal (RFP) process that allows for downstate Class III casino licenses to be issued. The state budget passed in April included a Request for Information (RFI) for companies interested in applying for the downstate casino licenses but no timeline was given for the RFI to be issued by the state Gaming Commission.

“A full-scale casino license at Empire City will support the creation of 10000 direct and indirect hires $75 million in additional wages for direct hires and more than $1 billion in economic activity for our region” said Thomas Carey President of the Westchester-Putnam Central Labor Body (a member of the national AFL-CIO) and Business Representative of the Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 21 union. “It will also spur $400 million in private investment that would be made into capital investments. No tax incentives needed no public funds.”

Currently Empire City Casino has a Class II License from the New York Gaming Commission. This allows them to legally offer slot machines bingo keno and electronic card games but not physical tables with dealers and sports betting which a Class III full-gaming license would allow. Currently New York State has six Class III casinos owned and operated by the St. Regis Mohawks the Seneca Nation and the Oneida Nation on their lands.

In addition the state constitution allows the state to grant up to seven commercial Class III licenses to private entities four of which are currently in use by casinos further upstate.

As noted by Carey there was a moratorium on new licenses established in 2019 that will not expire on its own until 2023. That was put in place to protect the recently-established private casinos upstate – such as Resort Worlds in Monticello – from competition until they gained more solid financial footing. The “Sure Bet” alliance argues that while this was a good idea at the time it is now hampering the economic recovery of the greater Westchester region from the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We have over 8 percent unemployment. In the building trades those numbers reach in the double digits some trades have an over 20 percent unemployment rate” said Richard McSpedon Jr. a Vice President of the Westchester-Putnam Central Labor Body and Business Representative of Local Union No. 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). “This is a sure bet right here not only in the expansion of the full gaming license but the possibility in the future of a convention center that can be used for conferences concerts sporting events; in addition to the possibility of a hotel which not only means construction jobs but the daily and seasonal maintenance of those facilities.”

The “A Sure Bet for NY’s Future” alliance consists of more than 60 member organizations including multiple labor unions teachers’ unions local companies business councils and local non-profits. They have the backing of the Westchester County Board of Legislators. In fact it is hard to find active opponents of this license expansion. The current struggle is more about getting a concrete schedule for the licensing process rather than getting the license at all.

Attendees at the event repeatedly praised the quality of MGM Resorts International’s (the casino’s owner) employee relations.

“It’s not just jobs these are career opportunities” Shawyn Patterson-Howard Mayor of Mount Vernon where 25% of Empire State Casino’s employees live said. “These are living wage jobs. These are union jobs. These are jobs that will allow people to pay their bills take care of their children and have an opportunity to move.”

The current state legislative session ends on June 10.",,,,,,,,,

As we were all waking up to the news I got into my car and tuned in to The Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 FM in New York where Charlamagne Tha God its most outspoken host wasn’t having it. “I got a few thoughts and one of those thoughts is the reason I’m saying ‘allegedly’” he said.

At the time the country was accelerating into the third wave of the pandemic and the president had been appearing at large mask-less rallies. But the news didn’t sit right with Charlamagne. “The conspiracy theorist in me simply doesn’t believe it” he said.

As I listened he seemed to build a conspiracy theory on the fly. According to Charlamagne the president was pretending to get the coronavirus so he could be the first to take the vaccine and become a hero to the world just in time for the election. Which is the provocative Sasquatch-exists brand of conspiracy theory you might expect to hear on the show. But then Charlamagne took the conversation in a direction I didn’t see coming: “Millions will line up to take the vaccine and boom microchips for all of y’all right in time for goddamn Thanksgiving.”

To be clear: there are no microchips in any vaccine

Microchips? In the vaccine? I looked around to see if I could make eye contact with any neighbors. Did anyone else hear that? I thought. But no one else was shaking their head at their radio. Hopefully the millions who tune in to this nationally syndicated show knew he was just joking. Right? But after the fourth time Charlamagne repeated his wild claim that the government is putting microchips in the COVID-19 vaccine I couldn’t help but wonder: is this going to be a problem?

To be clear: there are no microchips in any vaccine. There’s no evidence that even one of the nearly 170 million Americans who have received a shot so far have been implanted with a tiny piece of tracking hardware.

But this conspiracy along with other false claims about the vaccine has gained traction. These dangerous myths have built on a distrust of vaccines sown for years by well-organized groups that launched targeted effective disinformation campaigns. Through glossy magazines distributed to Orthodox Jews in New York intimate seminars led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the California coast and deceptive websites like the National Vaccine Information Center these messages found receptive audiences among Americans who have grown more distrustful of its elites and institutions.

Even before COVID-19 anti-vaccine disinformation has had real consequences for our health. Measles which was controlled in the 20th century is back in the 21st. One of the key reasons according to Seth Berkley CEO of the nonprofit Gavi the Vaccine Alliance: “the spread of falsehoods about the vaccine.” The World Health Organization now ranks vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 threats to global health.

“I would just look at them like ‘This is not the time to play’”

In the US polling from March found that 42 percent of respondents believed at least one COVID-19 conspiracy theory. That survey commissioned by the nonprofit Surgo Ventures found that 16 percent of eligible Americans are a hardened group of COVID-19 skeptics steeped in conspiracy theories while another 7 percent are system distrusters. The skeptics are disproportionately white and conservative while the system distrusters are heavily Black and Latinx. This mixture of ideological strains means vaccine hesitancy has taken hold in rural communities and religious enclaves in dense coastal cities and in wine country. As the nation moves into a phase when most vaccine enthusiasts have gotten their shots this broad coalition of the skeptical poses a massive challenge for public health officials. The next phase of vaccination will likely depend on reaching members of this population and understanding their specific concerns.

Jordan Dow works at Kings County a large public hospital in Brooklyn about a mile from where I heard the microchip rumor. He said he was hearing a variant on the microchip conspiracy in his ER. Dow said that of the hundreds of patients he was giving COVID-19 nasal tests to every day 1 in 5 would ask about a tracking microchip on the end of the swab. “I would just look at them like ‘This is not the time to play’” he told me.

Most would laugh and go on with the test; others would refuse. The Surgo survey found that 1 in 14 people believe a tracking chip might be planted with the vaccine. A poll from Axios / Ipsos also from March asked 1000 American adults if the COVID-19 vaccines contained a tracking microchip. More than 1 in 4 said they didn’t know. That’s the equivalent of nearly 69 million people.

Joan Donovan research director of the Shorenstein Center on Media Politics and Public Policy at Harvard is the kind of disinformation researcher who listens to white supremacist podcasts at 2AM. That’s actually how she first learned about a mysterious illness in China before she had seen news of the outbreak published anywhere else.

“I don’t think anybody’s written a definitive case on the microchips” she said “but I have one kind of half-done that might be useful for you.”

Donovan’s analysis led me to some web chatter at the dawn of the US pandemic on March 18th 2020 — after the NBA had suspended its season but when reported American deaths were still around 150.

That’s when Bill Gates whose foundation has pledged $1.75 billion toward international pandemic aid logged onto a Reddit AMA to answer questions about the pandemic. In the chat he predicted that one day we would all carry a digital passport for our health records. He suggested not a microchip but some kind of e-vaccine card that people could flash before going into a business.

The next day a Swedish website that reads like a tabloid full of memes about biohacking wrote about Gates’ comment. The site’s administrator who goes by the name CyphR belongs to a community of biohackers who advocate for human implantable microchips. They also have them — and hope that one day we all will be using them to monitor our biometrics and verify our identity. But they believed that future was a decade away.

“We advocate for the adoption of biohacking wherever possible even if it means memeing the desired outcome”

That is until they saw Gates’ comment about digital certificates on Reddit. “We’re like WTF! This is it! Suddenly chip implants don’t only have an actual scalable mainstream application but one that is an urgent medical need” CyphR said in an email. The bloggers connected Gates’ remark with various research projects supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation including one December 2019 study exploring invisible “quantum dot” tattoos that could reveal your vaccine history when held close to a special smartphone light.

Then CyphR acknowledged they made a fateful “jump” — by suggesting the best way to implement Gates’ idea was through an implantable microchip. “We did what [we] do best and tried to meme this biohack into the mainstream” CyphR wrote. “As advocates of biohacking that’s what we do. We advocate for the adoption of biohacking wherever possible even if it means memeing the desired outcome.”

Their headline read: “Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus.”

Two days later Adam Fannin a polemical Baptist pastor from Jacksonville Florida stumbled upon the blog post online. It resonated with his deep distrust of Gates and he ran with it. Fannin who started his own church with its own YouTube channel in 2017 transformed the biohackers’ fantasy into a biblical prophecy one that was warned about in the book of Revelation: “It’s not just an implantable ID system” Fannin says on a YouTube video. “It’s literally worshipping this beast.”

The pastor’s nine-minute sermon tapped into a long-standing wide-ranging conspiracy theory that Gates through his business and philanthropy is trying to “depopulate” the planet. The pastor titled the post “Bill Gates – Microchip Vaccine Implants to fight Coronavirus” adding one pivotal word to the biohackers’ title: vaccine.

Each time I saw a new host repeat the lie it seemed to mutate tapping into a new strain of American mistrust

The video quickly got 1.6 million views — an order of magnitude more than the pastor’s account had ever received.

Then the conspiracy theory spread. Posts like this were suddenly getting shared by shock-jock comedians and doomsday preppers on YouTube; by the far-right news site Newsmax; by pop culture icons such as M.I.A. and Kanye West; and by defiant conspiracy-minded members of Gen Z on TikTok. In one minute-long video a young woman points at spurious microchip-related screenshots and over an X-Files-style score says “It’s already being activated across the globe including New York.”

Each time I saw a new host repeat the lie it seemed to mutate tapping into a new strain of American mistrust: mistrust of the medical system mistrust of the government mistrust of powerful elites. And then there’s Roger Stone.

On April 13th 2020 in Stone the lie found the superspreader it had been waiting for. That’s when the former political adviser to Trump who was convicted of repeatedly lying to Congress made a guest appearance on The Joe Piscopo Show on AM 970 in New York.

The early SNL star didn’t even need to prompt Stone before he launched in. “Whether Bill Gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate” Stone said. “He and other globalists are definitely using it in a drive for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people.”

Later that afternoon the New York Post gave the story legitimacy running the headline “Roger Stone: Bill Gates may have created coronavirus to microchip people.”

Soon the Post story and the pastor’s video each had over a million interactions on Facebook. Since then the lie has continued spreading and mutating across the world. By January according to the Surgo survey 1 in 10 US adults — and 1 in 7 Republicans — said they believed a tracking chip would be implanted with the vaccine.

Charlamagne and the Post did not respond to queries about their role in spreading the conspiracy and a Reddit spokesperson claimed the conspiracy had existed in the bowels of the web — on 4plebs — before it surfaced on Reddit.

But Fannin and Stone defended their remarks. “The idea of a microchip in order to track who has been vaccinated is no crazier than the idea of a vaccine passport” Stone said. “The first amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives every American the right to question the safety of any vaccination.” Fannin the YouTube preacher confirmed his view that “Bill Gates is an evil person” — and that he has continued to avoid the vaccine himself.

It’s easy to write off these beliefs as far-fetched. But since I started looking closely at this conspiracy theory I started seeing microchips everywhere. One night I turned on 60 Minutes and saw a segment about how the US military is developing a subdermal implantable sensor to detect viruses. But it’s not a tracking microchip right? Then a couple weeks later the show was reporting on an international microchip shortage. Where’d they all go? Then IBM announced that the company had designed the smallest most powerful microchip ever. It felt like I was consuming the raw material that would shape the next microchip conspiracy theory.

Social media is the place where so much information gets repackaged and shared as misinformation. So I went to the major platforms to ask what they are doing to contain this high-stakes infodemic. Facebook which also owns Instagram said that by May the platform had removed 16 million pieces of content for violating its COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation policy and slapped warning labels on 167 million pieces of content rated false by its fact-checking partners.

YouTube offered a statement saying the platform had removed 900000 misleading videos about the coronavirus including 30000 just about the vaccines. The video platform even has an explicit policy banning videos that claim there are microchips in the vaccine.

TikTok pointed to a policy that prohibits medical misinformation including vaccine misinformation.

But according to research by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate based in London and Washington platforms fail to act on 95 percent of COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation reported to them. That means that when people go looking for accurate information about the vaccine there’s a decent chance they will run into a falsehood first.

In April the video by the Baptist pastor that helped spark this conspiracy was still up with nearly 2 million views. I asked YouTube why but officials declined to answer. Instead two days later — more than a year after the pastor shared it spawning a wave of social media disinformation — YouTube decided to take the video down for violating its medical misinformation guidelines.

In total the platform removed six out of seven YouTube videos I asked about. The comedian Andrew Schulz — who said “So if you think that there’s not going to be more shit in that chip that they’re going to put in our arm besides proof that we’ve been vaccinated you’re outta your goddamn mind” — got to stay.

TikTok likewise removed five of the six videos I asked about and quarantined the other one to limit its spread.

Given the scale of this problem and the severity of the public health risks it poses I figured there’d be a war room of epidemiologists and disinformation specialists somewhere in the federal government poring over posts monitoring conspiracies and coordinating with social media platforms and media outlets to halt their spread. Instead Facebook for instance said the platform uses machine learning and human fact-checkers to moderate posts to flag misinformation after it lives on the site.

“less than one-half of 1 percent of global funding has gone to any research or any programs addressing misinformation”

In January a year after the first US case was reported the White House released a national COVID-19 response plan that included building the “capacity to quickly identify disinformation.” But when I repeatedly asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention what resources it has deployed for tracking and responding to that misinformation I couldn’t get an answer. I spoke with a member of the White House’s COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force Bobby Watts who is also CEO of the National Health Care for the Homeless Council. He told me about the federal government’s strategy to tackle vaccine hesitancy “with a mass education campaign to let people know about the importance of vaccinations” including messages tailored to various Asian American and Pacific Islander cultures Spanish speakers people experiencing homelessness and rural Republicans. But he didn’t know whether the federal government has a way of monitoring and interrupting misinformation influencing those communities.

After weeks of asking the CDC and the White House to provide details on how they are monitoring COVID-19 misinformation I finally turned to Joe Smyser a public health expert whose nonprofit helped create the nation’s largest vaccine misinformation tracking system. Project VCTR (pronounced “vector”) is now used by 450 organizations including the health department for New York City the city whose radio and print outlets were so decisive in the early spread of the microchip conspiracy theory. Smyser said he has been talking with a team of data scientists at the CDC who just last year started to build their own misinformation monitoring system. But he said they had to proceed with caution — and were constrained from communicating with state health departments — because misinformation was so politicized in the last administration. The CDC did not respond to queries.

Tracking medical misinformation is a relatively new and underfunded field of public health. Of the flood of money dedicated to coronavirus vaccine research production and distribution since the pandemic began Smyser said “less than one-half of 1 percent of global funding has gone to any research or any programs addressing misinformation.” The nonprofit CDC Foundation he pointed out recently put out a request for proposals for combating misinformation through social media; three to four projects will receive around $2 million each.

Meanwhile the disinvestment has left county and state health departments mostly on their own fighting the tide of COVID-19 misinformation while trying to get enough vaccines in enough arms to finally bring an end to the pandemic. With the nation’s current anemic response to misinformation a new projection from the Surgo survey estimates that only 58 percent of the US population including 74 percent of adults will be vaccinated by next April.

In New York where the microchip theory first went mainstream the city has a team that tracks vaccine rumors in order to inform its educational messaging. I recently found my way to the State Department of Health webpage dedicated to combating vaccine misinformation. It was last updated in January 2012.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkY2V4ZWMuY29tL3NvdXJjaW5nLXByb2N1cmVtZW50L2FydGljbGUvMjE0MTUzOTQvcmVzZWFyY2gtZnJvbnRpZXJzLW5hbm90ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFuZC1wb3N0Y292aWQxOS1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nanotechnology and Post-COVID-19 Manufacturing,"From raw material sourcing shortages to production issues the manufacturing industry has experienced incredible disruption as a result of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However with bits of positive news finally beginning to surface as vaccination rates increase and new cases decline the manufacturing industry has begun to take a very close look at some of the key learnings they have gathered throughout this pandemic and what the manufacturing industry may look like going forward. And one key area is innovation especially when it comes to embracing nanotechnology.

With greater scrutiny being paid in promoting cleanliness and better protection against future global health issues combined with the long-standing desire to make buildings vehicles and machinery more earth-friendly the manufacturing industry is giving nanotechnology a long hard look as a potential tool to help to tackle these challenges. This is particularly true as end-users such as renters homeowners and motorists look for glass to be a bigger part of their homes and vehicles.

With that in mind here are a few ways how nanotechnology and glass are being viewed as the next frontier for the manufacturing industry in the post-COVID-19 era.

Demand for glass

From all glass roofs in vehicles to the desire for more glass in residential high buildings the craving for glass has never been higher. Unfortunately for years builders and vehicle OEMs have looked to reduce glass use over fears of heat gain glare and durability among other things. However thanks to nanotechnology driven innovations such as suspended particle device (SPD) glass technology glass is now capable of offering much greater glare control and heat reduction. This enables auto OEMs and builders to offer a much more comfortable interior experience without sacrificing views.

Additionally as hospitals and hotels look to make their spaces easier to clean the “tintability” of nanotechnology-powered glass will allow them to get rid of unsanitary curtains and replace them with glass partitions that can be sanitized and cleaned much more easily and quickly.

The drive for sustainability

Buildings and vehicles are two primary drivers of carbon emissions today. In fact as recently as 2019 buildings were both directly and indirectly responsible for 28% of the world’s CO2 emissions while transportation was directly responsible for 24%. These are obviously massively unsettling statistics and as a result the automotive and building manufacturing sectors have been leaving no stone unturned when it comes to finding solutions. Enter nanotechnology.

For example by leveraging nanotechnology-powered glass and its heat rejecting capabilities automotive OEMs and builders have been able to drastically cut air conditioning use in their vehicles and buildings respectively. And in the case of vehicles specifically given the reduced demand for air conditioning automotive OEMs have been able to dramatically cut the size of AC compressors cutting weight and boosting fuel efficiency as a result.

Consumer goods and next-gen projection

Beyond the heavy equipment side of the manufacturing industry nanotechnology-powered glass is being embraced on the consumer goods side as well -- particularly when it comes to TVs and projection. For example some companies have begun to roll out clear TVs or TVs that resemble picture frames or the illusion of furniture and this simply wouldn’t be possible without nanotechnology-powered glass.

Moreover as we move into a world where autonomous vehicles begin to hit the roadways and automotive OEMs transform interior experiences to give passengers “something to do” since they will no longer need to drive this type of project technology will be key in transforming windows in computer and TV screens.

Each day manufacturing is getting more interesting as a result of material science and innovation. And nanotechnology -- particularly in glass -- is proving to be one of the most intriguing spaces in the material science-manufacturing revolution especially as we continue to move through the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,,,,,,,
MU,Micron Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzA2LzMtdGVjaC1zdG9ja3MtdGhhdC1jYW4tc29hci1kZXNwaXRlLWluZmxhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Tech Stocks That Can Soar Despite Inflation,"Prices on goods and services are up as the economy reopens but that's no reason to stop investing.

Inflation has picked up pace this year as effects from the pandemic ease and pent-up consumer demand for certain goods and services gets unleashed. For the record a little inflation is indicative of a healthy or rebounding economy so there's no need to panic just yet. But if higher inflation is a more prolonged problem having some money stashed away in some stocks that can still thrive will be a good move. Three that are worth a look right now are PayPal (PYPL 0.44%) Alphabet (GOOGL 1.18%) (GOOG 1.00%) and Micron Technology (MU 0.29%).

Digital payments could actually flourish in an inflationary environment

Nicholas Rossolillo (PayPal): I started loading up on digital payments stocks early this year in anticipation of higher consumer spending and I'm still a buyer now that money is flowing through the economy again at a fast pace and causing some spikes in prices. In fact as long as higher pricing doesn't continue to rise unabated for years a little inflation would actually be a positive for payment processors like PayPal.

The reason is the digital payments space collects a percentage fee for processing a transaction. If average transaction values increase the fees paid to companies like PayPal increase as well. Added to the strong and steady growth already expected this year this could set up PayPal shares for continued success where other stocks might stumble in such an inflationary environment.

Specifically PayPal is forecasting full-year 2021 revenue growth of about 20%. And since it's reaching a more profitable scale as it expands the reach of its payments and financial technology services network profitability will likely grow at an even faster rate. For reference PayPal's free cash flow rose 50% last year on a full-year sales increase of 23%. Talk about inflation beating business growth.

Adding to the case for PayPal the company ended March 2021 with $13.1 billion in cash and equivalents and another $5.99 billion in long-term investments offset by debt of just $8.94 billion. This is a rock solid leader in fintech and next-gen banking services growing at a rate that will far outpace (or even get a small boost from) some inflation. Shares currently value PayPal at 59 times trailing-12-month free cash flow not so unreasonable given the booming bottom line. Inflation or not I say this stock is a buy for the long haul.

The ABCs of market-leading stability

Anders Bylund (Alphabet): Raging inflation is often a precursor to a sharp correction to the stock market. For example the U.S. inflation rate stood at 5.6% in the summer of 2008 a multi-year high that was more than double the 2.4% rate seen a year earlier. The financial crisis that followed was the stuff of legend. History doesn't exactly repeat itself but you will often find that it rhymes. The 2008 crisis was primed by reckless investments in subprime mortgages and today's soaring stock market looks like an over-extended rebound from last year's COVID-19 recession. In other words the rising inflation rates we see right now could very well be an early sign of the next dramatic correction.

That's why this market tenor makes me want to buy stocks that should survive and thrive when that looming market drop shows up. And if their prices fall in the early days of the next market panic it should be an easy decision to buy more of them at lower prices.

One of the best ways to stay ahead of galloping inflation and future market crashes is to invest in Alphabet. The Google parent is built to last a lifetime weathering all sorts of market storms with a shrug and generate shareholder wealth along the way.

The key to Alphabet's long-term value is found in the company's extreme flexibility. What started as an innovative search engine has grown into a multi-industry conglomerate that dominates key sectors such as smartphones and online advertising services. The company is brewing up a plethora of business ideas like self-driving cars advanced medical research and quantum computing. Whatever marketwide sea change comes next Alphabet will be ready to adapt in a hurry.

Sure Alphabet's stock tends to get swept up in every recession-defining market crash but the share prices are always quick to recover. It's almost silly how badly Alphabet's twin stocks are beating the broader market in the long haul:

Alphabet's shares can take a licking and keep on ticking. That's a winning quality in the eternal battle between investors and inflation.

Higher chip prices equals massive cash flows for this cheap stock

Billy Duberstein (Micron Technology): Although discount rates go up with inflation it's possible for certain types of stocks to do well in inflationary times. These include commodity-related stocks in commodities experiencing the inflation or companies with enough pricing power that can raise prices.

Micron is the former as a sort of ""technology commodity"" company that makes basic DRAM and NAND flash memory components. Unlike proprietary logic chips such as those made by NVIDIA (NVDA -0.85%) the prices of memory chips fluctuate with global supply and demand not unlike oil or steel or agricultural products.

As is well-known the world is currently in a severe chip shortage. The 2018-2019 trade war and then the 2020 pandemic have caused chipmakers to cut back on supply and for chip users to draw down their inventory. But with the pandemic accelerating digital trends 5G phones coming to market and the economy roaring back huge demand is now overwhelming muted supply. Additionally chip supply can't just be ""turned on"" at the flip of a switch. Chipmakers need to build fabs and machines and produce these difficult-to-manufacture tech commodities without defects.

That has caused memory prices to rise this year. DRAM prices were up 8.7% quarter over quarter in the first quarter and are expected to rise another 18%-23% in Q2.

Thus it's no surprise that at a recent industry conference Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the company's May quarter revenue was likely to be ""at or above"" the high end of Micron's previous guidance with ""strong earnings."" Micron will report its May quarter earnings on June 30.

Yet another reason to be optimistic is that Micron has surged ahead of competitors on leading technology as the first memory company to produce both 176-layer NAND and the 1-alpha node in DRAM. The company just released a press release highlighting new products based on these advanced nodes for data center servers intelligent vehicles and 5G phones and laptops. These products are just hitting the market now and should be even more profitable for the company in the second half of this year.

While rising inflation and perhaps interest rates may hurt high-multiple stocks the cyclical Micron only trades at eight times next year's earnings estimates so it shouldn't be too affected by higher rates. Skeptical investors may be anticipating the end of the cycle that just started but Micron's improved technology position vis-a-vis competitors should make it more profitable through future cycles. If that's the case the stock is still a bargain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbmFuZ3Byb3BlcnR5dGFsay5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi9wZW5hbmctc291dGgtaXNsYW5kcy1pb3QtZW5hYmxlZC1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1zbWFydC1jaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Penang South Islands - IoT-Enabled Sustainable Smart City,"The Malaysian state of Penang is fast becoming an IoT-Enabled Smart City modeled on the tenets of green living strong ESG principles and sustainable economic momentum. Soon it could be one of Southeast Asia’s hottest investment destinations.

Central to that transformation is Penang South Islands (PSI). The three-island development will help the state achieve its Penang2030 vision. By combining advanced technologies for next-generation industries with eco-friendly masterplans PSI will raise the game for Penang as a leading investment destination for global corporations.

“The PSI Green Plan will play a vital role in making that happen” says Chow Kon Yeow Chief Minister of Penang. “The PSI targets a 50% reduction in CO 2 e emissions by 2030 compared to business as usual. Coupled with Penang’s advanced manufacturing capabilities ESG principles will make PSI the ideal choice for global businesses to build their manufacturing hubs while meeting their sustainability targets. Especially in the electronics medical devices and other high-end sectors where Penang already makes significant contributions.”

A Green Plan for the Penang South Islands

The PSI Green Plan promises big outcomes: 100% renewable energy for powering the Green Tech Park; a 40% reduction in urban planning emissions; a 40% reduction in non-renewable energy use from super low energy buildings with efficient cooling systems smart features and renewable energy installations; a 70% reduction in freshwater demand from the dual-purpose sewage treatment plant rainwater harvesting and water saving devices; and a 65% reduction in landfill waste with extensive recycling food maceration and composting.

The plan addresses the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 –a much-needed achievement given that Asia remains far from meeting any of the SDGs. 2 In turn PSI will become an advanced new ecosystem that serves as a model for the future of work livability and sustainability around the world.

“The PSI Green Plan will accelerate the ‘greenification’ of Penang’s economy governance and infrastructure” the Chief Minister says. “It will enable Penang to reach its full potential as a high-income low-carbon state that prioritizes the well-being of its people and the environment while providing a platform for innovative and sustainable-minded businesses to thrive.”

The environmentally conscious people-first masterplan also puts pedestrians bicycles and water transport ahead of cars. The goal is to achieve a 70:30 public-private modal share compared with 5:95 currently. To make that happen PSI will include 140 kilometers of bicycle and walking tracks as well as seven kilometers of navigational waterway. These transportation pathways will reduce transport-related emissions by up to 80%.

“There will be generous provision of public open spaces island-wide (900ac) including beaches mangroves water canal wetlands flood plains and bioswales enhancing the biodiversity design of the island by connecting people with greens and water” the Chief Minister says. “It will also reduce the Urban Heat Island effect and reinforce the design resiliency towards flood erosion and sea level rise.”

Expanding Penang’s Tech Legacy

As innovative companies gravitate to Penang PSI will fuel growth in the state’s well-established tech manufacturing sector. Dubbed ‘the Silicon Valley of the East’ Penang already produces 8% of global back-end semiconductor output. 3 With end uses linked to 5G autonomous vehicles and the IoT chips made in Malaysia power some of today’s most innovative products making Penang a vital link in electronics supply chains.

Where Penang was a hub for labor-intensive manufacturing decades ago today it designs and produces high-value-added technologies that spans everything from integrated circuits and software to embedded systems. Penang’s steady climb up in the value chain continues to attract some of the most innovative companies in the world. They are setting up Centers of Excellence Design Centers and R&D Hubs to tap into the state’s unique advantages. In the years ahead PSI will provide space for more companies to do the same as they move up the value chain.

In 2019 Penang drew a record MYR16.9 billion ($4.1 billion) in manufacturing investments—nearly 90% of which went to the Electrical & Electronics machinery and equipment and scientific and measuring equipment (including medical device) sectors. 4 In 2020 despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic U.S. front-end semiconductor equipment giant Lam Research announced a USD225 million investment to build the group’s largest manufacturing facility in Batu Kawan Industrial Park. 5 The company will join dozens of tech heavyweights including Intel which has one of the largest silicon design centers in Penang; Micron Technology which built a center of excellence for solid state drives in Penang; and National Instruments which has its largest R&D facility outside of the U.S. in Penang.

“Chip-making is a very complex process that requires manufacturing expertise” the Chief Minister says. “Through decades of hard work Penang has developed the talent and know-how to meet the needs of technology companies around the world. PSI will build on those strengths taking Penang’s manufacturing capabilities to the next level while taking sustainability the environment and lifestyle into account for businesses and their employees.”

Microsoft currently bathes in enthusiasm and self-analysis. In equal measure.

It's seen its business do astoundingly well during the pandemic. It's even seen off Amazon in managing to secure government contracts.

Redmond still though harbors old habits that it finds very hard to shake.

One of these is to nag Windows users until they pick up their PCs and toss them from great heights. Or even worse buy a Mac.

The latest episode of Microsoft Is Poking Me Through The Windows involves a pop-up message that appears in Windows 10's purpose-built notification center.

It reads: ""Microsoft recommends different browser settings. Want to change them?""

I fancy most people would sniff: ""Oh do please run along. I'm perfectly happy with my settings whatever they are and I have a lot to do today thank you.""

Redmond though is undeterred. The notification adds that you'll get ""Search that gives you back time and money."" And ""fast and secure search results with Bing.""

Oh yes. Bing the MySpace to Google's Facebook is still being pushed.

I learned that this Bing-pushing is pushing Windows users' buttons. There's a little Reddit thread where you'll see laments such as: ""You're not the first to have this Microsoft Annoyance. Apparently there are thousands in front of you.""

The most poignant perhaps was this: ""Miserably I get this despite using Edge AND having Bing set as my default search engine... (the latter of which for Microsoft Rewards). I think the 'problem' is that not ALL of my browsers had Bing as the default search engine? Which is ridiculous because I never use Chrome or Firefox anyway. But after clicking the popup it ludicrously opened up all my browsers.""

I confess I know of no one who has Bing as their default search engine. I also confess that Microsoft continues to pester even those who are already using particular Microsoft services.

I still get nags to download the new Edge browser presumably because I operate my Hotmail (diehard commitment this) account on Firefox. This is especially galling as I already use Edge for some things and find it very good.

One can of course understand why Microsoft continues to push Bing even though Google's hegemony is palpable.

The question however is why it should do it in this particular way. There's an abdication of imagination involved in knowing -- surely Redmond knows -- that you'll annoy people with your nagging.

What's most distressing is the lack of any attempt at charm or humor in these notifications.

Are they all written by engineers? Or robots perhaps?

What if Redmond tried something like: ""Yeah I know you think Bing's a really silly name. But why don't you give it a go? You never know you might be pleasantly surprised.""?

Or perhaps: ""We know you hate these nags about Bing but our bosses force us to do it. So please try Bing so that we can live a more peaceful life here at Microsoft Central.""

Cold-hearted myopic robotic nagging has been a trait of Microsoft's for many years. Why in forcing the new Edge onto Windows 7 customers without any preamble Microsoft caused some to believe Edge was malware.

Perhaps Microsoft believes that irritation works. Perhaps it simply has no better ideas to persuade anyone to try Bing.

And really it's not as if Redmond is alone in pursuing this sort of communication.

Why I've even had Apple notifying me of its angry feelings whenever I open oh Microsoft Edge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmV3aXJlLmNvbS9taWNyb3NvZnQtb3V0bG9vay00MTY0NjIw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is Microsoft Outlook?,"Microsoft Outlook is an application that's used mainly to send and receive emails. It's also used to manage various types of personal data including calendar appointments and similar entries tasks contacts and notes. Microsoft Outlook isn't free though; you must purchase it outright or pay a subscription for it if you want to use it.

The Evolution of Microsoft Outlook

Microsoft Outlook was introduced to the public in 1997 and was included with Microsoft Office 97. Outlook Express was included with Windows XP (and was the only free version). Since then Microsoft has released an abundance of updated versions each offering more features than the one before it.

Outlook is included in many of the Microsoft Office application suites including Office 2010 2013 and 2016 and Microsoft 365. It’s important to note that not all versions include Outlook though. As an example Microsoft Outlook is available in Microsoft 365 Home but isn't included in Office Home & Student 2016 for PC.

Microsoft Outlook is an application you pay for and install on your device. An Outlook email address is a free email address from Microsoft and can be accessed for free from the Outlook webmail portal: https://outlook.live.com/.

Do You Need Microsoft Outlook?

If you only want to send and receive emails you don’t need to purchase Microsoft Outlook. You can use the Mail application included with Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. You can also get your email from your provider’s web site (like https://mail.google.com/mail/). If you need to do more than that though you need a more powerful email management program.

With Microsoft Outlook you can sync your personal data with your phone tablet and other computers provided you can log in to those with your Microsoft Account. You can sort your email into folders based on rules you create send Out Of Office messages automatically flag emails for follow up and get email from Exchange servers. The latter means that you can get work email as well as personal email from the same Microsoft Outlook application even when you are away from the office. You can't do that with the Mail app that comes with Windows 10. You can also delay the sending of emails ask for receipts and more.

It’s also possible to integrate your personal data with Microsoft Outlook. It includes an address book calendar task list and virtual sticky notes. What you put in the calendar can be synced to your other devices. You can delegate tasks to others. You can also share and delegate calendars.

Do You Have Microsoft Outlook?

You might already have a version of Microsoft Outlook on your computer tablet or even your phone. You should find out before you make a purchase.

To see if you have Microsoft Outlook installed on your Windows device:

From the Search window on the Taskbar (Windows 10) the Start screen (Windows 8.1) or from the Search window on the Start menu (Windows 7) type Outlook and press Enter. Look for an Outlook entry.

To find out if you have a version of Outlook on your Mac look for it in the Finder sidebar under Applications. To find out if you have Microsoft Outlook on your phone; perform a search from any search area.

Where to Get Microsoft Outlook

Sign up for and install Office 365.

If you're sure you don’t already have a Microsoft Office or 365 suite that includes Outlook you can get the latest version with Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 is a subscription service though and you pay for it monthly. If you’re not interested in a sub consider purchasing Microsoft Outlook outright.

Some employers community colleges and universities offer Microsoft 365 free to their employees and students.

You can compare and purchase all of the available editions and suites at the Microsoft Store. Microsoft Outlook is available now in the following Office Suites:

Additionally:

You can purchase Microsoft Outlook separately for PC or Mac.

Once you decide to make the purchase follow the steps required to download the installation files. With that done run the installation program. It’s straightforward and mostly foolproof if you opt for Microsoft 365.

Microsoft Outlook Has Lots of Identities

Michael Zwahlen / EyeEm/Getty Images

People reference Microsoft Outlook in many ways and using a lot of different terms. This creates confusion around Microsoft Outlook which is quite simply a single application for managing email and other personal data. However for the sake of completeness understand you might hear Microsoft Outlook referred to in these terms as well:

Outlook

Outlook 365

Outlook email

Microsoft email

Outlook Express

Outlook Online

Users outside China reported that the search engine had returned text results for “tank man” — as the unknown person carrying shopping bags who blocked a line of tanks in central Beijing after the killings has become known. But Bing’s video and image tabs displayed no references to the event.

It was unclear how geographically widespread the filtering was.

The “tank man” images are routinely blocked within China as are other references to the military’s crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protesters which left hundreds or more dead.

A Microsoft spokeswoman said in a statement that the filtering was due to “accidental human error” and that the company was working to resolve the problem. By early Saturday the site was once again returning the video and image results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8wNi90ZWNoL3RhbmstbWFuLXRpYW5hbm1lbi1zcXVhcmUtbWljcm9zb2Z0L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUtodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzA2LzA2L3RlY2gvdGFuay1tYW4tdGlhbmFubWVuLXNxdWFyZS1taWNyb3NvZnQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft removed 'Tank Man' images on Tiananmen Square's anniversary,"New York CNN Business —

Microsoft blocked images and videos around the world of “Tank Man” the unidentified protester during China’s brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 4 1989.

The photos were taken down globally from Bing Microsoft (MSFT)’s search engine Friday — the 32nd anniversary of the event. A Microsoft (MSFT) spokesman said they were taken offline by mistake attributing the removal to “human error.” The images reappeared around the world — outside of China — on Saturday.

Bing unlike its major competitors including Google (GOOGL) operates within mainland China. That means Microsoft is forced to censor search results for Chinese users according to Chinese law — particularly images and information about the Tiananmen Square protests and the killings that ensued. China’s internet censorship typically ramps up in the weeks leading to the event’s anniversary.

Hundreds of people were killed on June 4 1989 in Tiananmen Square. The massacre made headlines around the world — as did iconic images such as “Tank Man” defying the troops on the square.

Although China’s censorship typically pertains only within its borders Microsoft’s accidental global takedown isn’t the first time Tiananmen Square information has been blocked outside of mainland China by a foreign company.

The FBI in December accused a former Zoom employee of participating in a scheme to censor meetings on behalf of the Chinese government. Xinjiang “Julien” Jin and co-conspirators allegedly terminated at least four video meetings commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre last June. Most of the meetings were organized and attended by US participants some of whom were dissidents who had participated in and survived the 1989 protests the FBI said.

Tensions between the United States and China have escalated in recent weeks over China’s alleged surveillance of American companies that operate within its borders. President Joe Biden last week expanded a Trump-era ban on American investment in dozens of Chinese firms that Washington believes are linked to China’s military.

Biden signed an executive order Thursday that prohibits Americans from owning or trading any securities tied to 59 companies citing the threat of Chinese surveillance technology. The original order signed by former President Donald Trump in November applied to 31 Chinese companies that the administration said “enable the development and modernization” of China’s military and “directly threaten” US security. Biden’s new order goes into effect August 2.

Moderna became the latest COVID-19 vaccine maker to apply for full approval by the Food and Drug Administration announcing last week that it has started the process for approval in people ages 18 and up. That follows Pfizer's announcement in early May that it was seeking approval in those ages 16 and up.

About half the country so far has gotten at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine which has been made available in the U.S. through an emergency use authorization due to the public emergency the pandemic poses. As vaccination rates decline full FDA approval could give them a boost as the distinction holds significance for a large chunk of people who remain unvaccinated. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation's latest vaccine monitor report nearly a third -- 32% -- of unvaccinated adults are waiting for full FDA approval of a vaccine before getting it.

Dr. William Moss executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said the large share of those waiting for approval came as a surprise.

""My sense is that it probably means more to the general public than it actually should"" Moss told ABC News. ""To think that that approval process is going to be the be-all and end-all is misguided to me.""

Both authorization and approval are rigorous processes that look at the safety and efficacy of a vaccine Moss said. A key difference between the two is that at least two months of follow-up data from phase 3 clinical trials are considered for authorization versus at least six months for approval.

The FDA will take several months to review the full set of data before granting approval which several experts told ABC News was very likely. For Moss with nearly 300 million doses administered in the U.S. ""there's nothing about that review process that's going to reveal anything we don't know.""

""Yes it's kind of a formal stamp of approval but I don't think it really provides much more than what we already know"" he said. ""We have more data on vaccine safety than with any other vaccine even before the review of the full approval.""

Both Pfizer and Moderna have said their vaccines continued to offer strong protection at six months after a second dose including against emerging variants and reported no serious safety concerns. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System also provides transparency and helped identify the very rare chance of blood clotting some were diagnosed with after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

Full approval would allow the vaccines to be used after the public health emergency is over in the U.S. It will also allow the companies to advertise their vaccines to people which could help encourage vaccination Dr. James McDeavitt senior vice president and dean of clinical affairs at Baylor College of Medicine told ABC News.

""I think there's a significant benefit if we start to have some privately produced professionally produced advertisements that are gonna encourage people to get vaccinated"" he said. ""It could be a significant driver.""

At the same time McDeavitt would also encourage people not to wait for approval if they plan to get the vaccine.

""If you wait a month or two or three you're exposing yourself to risk that is unnecessary and preventable"" he said. ""[The COVID-19 vaccine is] free it's incredibly safe and it's readily available. In my personal opinion it makes no sense to wait.""

Dr. John Brownstein an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor said that if waiting for approval gets more people vaccinated that's a positive but he also said there are risks in waiting as COVID-19 transmission remains active.

""All signs point to the full approval"" he said. ""So that may factor into the decision of expected approval versus the potential risk of being unvaccinated.""

Beyond approval paid time off was another sticking point for people who are not yet vaccinated. The Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 21% of employed unvaccinated adults would be more likely to get the vaccine if their employer gave them paid time off to get it and recover from side effects.

Additionally between 10% and 15% of unvaccinated adults said they would be more likely to get the vaccine if there was a financial incentive such as money or free tickets the survey found.

Seven percent said they would get vaccinated ""only if required."" Full FDA approval could open the door to more companies and schools mandating it further increasing vaccine uptake Brownstein said.

""I think we will see an opening up of more vaccine mandates by employers or other institutions even perhaps government institutions"" Moss said. ""I think they will feel more comfortable mandating that their employees get vaccinated obviously with certain rules about exemptions after a full approval.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3RvcC5jb20vY29yb25hdmlydXMvMjAyMS8wNi90aGUtY2Rjcy1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5hdGlvbi1jYXJkLWFubm90YXRlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The CDC’s COVID-19 vaccination card annotated,"Nearly 170 million people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 in the United States -- which means the same amount have been handed a version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's white record card.

Nearly 170 million people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 in the United States — which means the same amount have been handed a version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s white record card.

The CDC’s vaccination card is likely to be the primary proof of vaccination going forward as the US continues loosening pandemic restrictions. Much of the information on the card is straightforward but other parts such as the vaccine lot number point to key details that are less widely understood.

We’ve annotated a sample CDC vaccination card below in order to better go through the details of the vaccination process.

1) The manufacturer

In the US there are three Covid-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use: Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Pfizer and Moderna are two-dose vaccines while J&J is one dose.

2) The lot number and expiration date

The lot number is a string of numbers and letters that tracks this specific batch of vaccine from production into your arm. This lot number is connected to an expiration date which — much like on any food packaging — indicates when this batch of vaccine may start to degrade. Pfizer and Moderna say their vaccines have a shelf life of up to six months while Johnson & Johnson says it is conducting ongoing studies to determine how long its vaccine lasts.

This expiration date is not relevant to how long vaccinated people are protected against Covid-19. (That remains unclear.) Instead the expiration date is primarily helpful for governments and vaccine providers who have to coordinate buying and using large amounts of vaccine within the limited shelf life.

This is likely to become more important in the coming months as some of the earliest vaccine doses begin to reach their expiration dates. For example South Sudan announced plans to discard 59000 doses of donated AstraZeneca vaccine that had expired in April.

3) The date

The date of your shot is important so you know when to return for a second shot if needed and when you are “fully vaccinated.” The CDC considers people “fully vaccinated” two weeks after the date of the final shot in the vaccine series.

In addition the time of your dose may also be included because the CDC advises people to remain under observation of medical professionals for 15 minutes after getting vaccinated mainly as a precaution in case of a rare allergic reaction.

4) The location

The location of your vaccine dose is written on the vaccination card for reference just in case the background of your vaccine selfie isn’t clear. In recent weeks many mass vaccination sites like the Javits Center in New York have begun to wind down operations as demand for the vaccines has lightened.

5) The health care professional

Under the Health Services Act and under the Medicines Regulation Maldives Food and Drug Authority (MFDA) authorized the use of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine to be used in the Maldives as the fifth vaccine approved for use with the technical advice from National Pharmaceutical Board. The same is to be followed for the Janssen vaccine approved as the sixth vaccine against Covid-19.

Making the announcement on Sunday the authority listed conditions to be met when administering both vaccinations.

Manufactured by Moderna Biotech Spain Moderna and Janssen manufactured by Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson and Johnson is only to be used for active immunization to prevent Covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome in individuals over 18 years of age.

However MFDA’s statement revealed that the vaccinations may be administered to other categories and age groups based on availability and recommendations from medical professional groups so long as they are monitored for a longer period of time and undergo routine check-ups in every three months.

MFDA revealed that the approval is only exclusive for restricted use in emergency situations and is subject to regulatory provisions.

As such the authorization will only be valid for 60 days in an event that authorities revoke the state of public health emergency Maldives has been in since 12 March 2020. Further use of the vaccine requires registration in compliance with the Medicines Regulation.

Only the Director General of Public Health Maimoona Aboobakuru is vested with the power to revoke the state of public health emergency under the Public Health Protection Act. As such during the state of public health emergency the Director General may determine the need for vaccination in the Maldives.

Highlighting that the vaccines may only be administered under the context of government use MFDA revealed that doses will be supplied to the ongoing inoculation drive to be used in accordance with Health Protection Agency (HPA) guidelines and standards.

When administering doses of Moderna and Janssen patients must be briefed on all information on the vaccine as well as side effects and probable adverse effects. Only trained healthcare workers must handle the vaccine doses and patients are to be monitored for immediate reactions for 15 – 30 minutes.

Both the Moderna and Janssen vaccines are required to be stored at -25 to -15 Degrees Celcius and Moderna’s second dose is to be administered after four weeks or 28 days after administering the first dose.

MFDA revealed that a sufficient stock of the Moderna vaccines must be secured in order for authorities to utilize second doses in consideration that the vaccine is administered in two dosages.

The authority has also urged relevant facilities handling the dosages to report any suspected quality defects or product issues to MFDA. These products must not be used and separated properly labeled and stored appropriately to be handed over to MFDA for more evaluation.

MFDA also has the power to take necessary actions to recall the products and the approval is subject to change. MFDA revealed that they may revise or revoke the authorization based on safety concerns and new scientific findings to justify such changes.

Janssen vaccination doses are administrated as a single-dose of 0.5ml in intramuscular injections.

“Our yarn facilities are very important as they start our carpet manufacturing process” Todd Shail Mohawk’s senior vice president of manufacturing said in an announcement. “When we decided to expand our yarn production to help meet customer demand our Roanoke location was the perfect choice because of the talented workforce here and in the surrounding counties.

“We’re thrilled to be expanding and creating new jobs and opportunities in this community” Shail added.

Originally a carpet backing operation the Roanoke facility will now house yarn conversion operations as well. In total the location will employ approximately 300 people once the new positions are filled.

“I’m proud of our relationship with this community and proud that Mohawk has recognized that this is a great place to continue to invest our resources” Plant Manager Donald Hendrix said.

“We have a great team here already and I look forward to welcoming new team members to our organization as we grow.”

EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES

Bryant Whaley executive director of the Randolph County Economic Development Authority said Mohawk’s expansion is welcome news in the East Alabama community of around 6000 residents.

“Mohawk has been invested in the City of Roanoke for many years. An expansion of this size shows the company’s confidence in our economy and workforce” Whaley said. “I am very thankful for the opportunities this will bring to our area.”

Mohawk Human Resources Manager Deverick Williams said the Calhoun Georgia-based Fortune 500 company a global leader with some of the best-known brands in the flooring industry plans several hiring events to meet with applicants.

Information on upcoming job fairs as well as current openings can be found on Facebook at Mohawk Industries Careers he added.

“Mohawk’s growth plans are another example of the advantages offered in rural Alabama” said Brenda Tuck rural development manager for the Alabama Department of Commerce. “The larger regions in our state have been well known for a long time and now the extensive activity that is abundant in our rural communities is being recognized.”

Whaley said Mohawk’s expansion represents the third growth project announced in Randolph County in less than a year following expansions at SteelFab Inc. in Roanoke and JELD-WEN in Wedowee.

“Over 200 jobs are being created in Randolph County through these projects since August 2020” he said. “Randolph County is not only a great place to live and raise a family but it is also a great place to work.”

This article was published 05/06/2021 (1066 days ago) so information in it may no longer be current.

While hockey is no longer the central focus of Nathan Green’s life the way it once was its impact remains.

The former Brandon Wheat Kings forward who played with the club for three seasons from 2006 to 2009 received a different kind of education as a teenager that’s proven to have great value.

“Hockey teaches you to be motivated” Green said. “Especially playing junior hockey you have to be a self starter. It prepares you to lead teams whether you’re staying in competitive sports or in the work world. Not just being an assistant captain but consistently being with a team day in and day out really gives you a sense of how people work and how they’re best motivated and when to push and when not to push and when to have this conversation and when to have that one.

Submitted Former Brandon Wheat Kings forward Nathan Green poses with his wife Kaylee and son Holt. He lives in Winnipeg and works for Molson Coors Beverage Company.

“It really teaches us when we’re young just to take care of ourselves and learn to push ourselves to be successful in whatever we do.”

Now 31 Green was born in Calgary moving to Winnipeg with his family when he was three or four years old. He was on the ice at an early age in Calgary and that interest blossomed in Manitoba. The family home came with a big lot and his father Allan flooded a backyard rink starting when Nathan was seven.

Green and his brother Stephen grew up near his future Wheat Kings teammate Scott Glennie and his brother Don and the four spent a lot of time together on the ice.

“We all grew up playing hockey with each other in our backyards” Green said. “The Glennies had a rink in theirs too so we would kind of go back and forth between our house and the Glennies.”

He started to play organized hockey at age six lining up at forward for his entire career other than the odd turn in net in the early age groups. He’s grateful to his father and mother Gisele for the time and resources they invested in hockey.

“I’m extremely thankful” Green said. “I’m not at that stage yet with my son — I have a two-and-a-half year old — so we haven’t got there quite yet but I know my parents spent a lot of money to put us through our hockey whether that was fall and winter or spring and summer leagues.

“I never recall us ever having to ride with friends’ parents too often or even having to use our grandparents a lot. My parents were pretty invested in both mine and my brother’s hockey careers when we were younger. They were definitely always there at the rink watching.”

At the time the Wheat Kings were the sole Western Hockey League franchise and Green had heard about them and even saw them play a couple of times. As he entered his draft year in 2004 he knew about Winnipeg players a year or two older who had been previously selected.

“You start to take notice of (the draft) around 13 or 14 and become aware of the team and where the teams are” Green said. “You start hearing good and bad stories about them all so you start deciding which teams you may or may not want to go to.”

Brandon Sun file photo Brandon Wheat Kings forward Nathan Green breaks in on Saskatoon Blades goaltender Braden Holtby on Jan. 18 2008.

WHL scouts began to contact him so his parents who were very strict about his education allowed him to take the afternoon off school to monitor the draft. Brandon took him 67th overall in the fourth round which proved to be a popular decision in the Green household.

“Extremely excited” Green said of the reaction. “I was just happy to go somewhere … To hear I was selected by the Wheat Kings was pretty surreal.”

At 16 Green failed to make the Wheat Kings and also the Manitoba Junior Hockey League’s Winnipeg South Blues eventually landing back with the Winnipeg Wild of the Manitoba U18 AAA Hockey League.

It proved to be wildly beneficial. Green led the league in scoring with 83 points in 40 games on 34 goals and 49 assists. He attended the World U-17 Hockey Challenge with one of the Canadian teams and even scored in one of the two MJHL games he played in.

“It was a huge year” Green said. “The year kind of started out in disappointment. I didn’t think I was going to make the Wheat Kings as a 16-year-old and I don’t necessarily think my parents would have wanted me to start at that young age … It wasn’t a big shock when I was released from the Wheat Kings after training camp at 16 but I think I was expecting to make the Winnipeg South Blues that year as a 16-year-old and of course I did not.

“I remember being disappointed at the start of the year but I was able to talk to my dad and he assured me this would be the best thing playing with the AAA Wild and it ended up being the best thing for my progression.”

Green came to Brandon’s camp the next fall determined to make the club and he did.

He admitted it was a big transition as he adjusted to life away from home with billets Kevin and Angela Holder who he stayed with for all three years he was in Brandon.

“I definitely consider myself a home body” said Green who was in Grade 12 that year. “I’m definitely a little more on the reserved side and like my usual surroundings so it was different and a big change for me even though it was just a two-hour distance from home. When you’re 17 18 19 you have a big head and think you can take care of yourself and you think you know everything and you’re an adult.

“I look back at it now and I realize how young you are and how overwhelming the experience can be.”

It was also tough on the ice. Green was in and out of the lineup in his rookie campaign contributing three goals and three assists in 36 games in the 2006-07 season.

Thankfully he and the other rookies Cale Jefferies Jay Fehr Brandon Lockerby and Daniel Bartek had older players they could lean on.

The Wheat Kings who went 41-20-3-8 and lost in the Eastern Conference semifinal were led by Codey Burki Mark Derlago Andrew Clark and older Swiss rookie Juraj Simek on a team assembled by then-owner and general manager Kelly McCrimmon.

“It was a great room” Green said. “The team itself was very welcoming. It’s overwhelming coming in as a rookie. You definitely have to earn the respect of your teammates because so many young guys come and go pretty quick. Brandon has always had a history of guiding their young players in the right direction. Kelly picks the right leaders to be a part of those rooms so that the young guys can come into an environment where they feel like they can excel and they can be challenged.”

Green said the younger players looked up to the older guys and watched them closely.

A year earlier it had been Green at the top of the lineup at the U18 level and he said it was difficult at times to acknowledge and accept his new reality in the bottom six forwards battling for ice time.

“You’re young and you don’t necessarily have a good handle on your emotions” Green said. “It took a while to understand my new role. I definitely had to learn the game and it was a bit of a process for me. I definitely struggled.”

He returned as an 18-year-old in the 2007-08 season to a Wheat Kings team that graduated six of its top seven scorers and faced questions about who would create the offence.

Brandon Sun file photo Nathan Green skates at Brandon Wheat Kings training camp at the Keystone Centre on Sept. 2 2006.

It turned out Green was one of those pieces.

Skating the most with Czech import Daniel Bartek — with Jay Fehr Del Cowan or Cale Jefferies in the other spot — Green blossomed with 15 goals and 26 assists in 69 games as he centred the third line.

“It was being a little more comfortable and little more confident and trusting yourself on the ice” Green said. “Really for me after that first year that summer I thought there was really nowhere else to go for me but up.”

He was named the team’s most improved player something he called a nice accolade.

Longtime Brandon fans will best remember the 2007-08 season for how the pre-season offensive concerns were fully addressed as the team only scored five fewer goals than a year earlier. The three members of the Baby Blue Line all came in as rookies and finished in the top five in team scoring.

“It was the first year in a long time they said we might not make the playoffs and all that and lo and behold Brayden Schenn and Scott Glennie and Matt Calvert come out of training camp absolutely firing” Green said. “That continued throughout the start of the season and they never looked back from that point. We went from being a rebuild era to potential contenders with how we were playing.”

Brandon actually won one more game than the year before finishing 42-24-3-3 but the young team fell in six games in the opening round of the playoffs to the Lethbridge Hurricanes.

The Wheat Kings and Green made major strides again in the 2008-09 season. The Wheat Kings went 48-19-3-2 and Green contributed 24 goals and 35 assists in 72 games skating with Aaron Lewadniuk and Cowan.

“When you’re older you understand how to seize your opportunities properly” Green said. “At 17 the opportunities I was given I didn’t take them so of course I wasn’t given a lot of opportunities throughout the year. As an 18-year-old maybe I seized them a little better and started to get a little more leash and opportunity from Kelly and I think that just kept going into my 19-year-old year. Again a little more confidence.”

Each year the six-foot 180-pound centre got older he trained harder and developed a better understanding of what he needed to do to succeed.

In the 2009 playoffs Green was terrific piling up 14 points in 12 games as Brandon made it to the conference final before being swept by the Calgary Hitmen. He didn’t know it at the time but it was his curtain call as a Wheat King.

With seven 19-year-olds on the roster and just three overage spots the Wheat Kings moved Green to the Red Deer Rebels on June 30 2009 during the Canadian Hockey League’s import draft. With Red Deer’s pick Brandon selected Finnish forward Toni Rajala 14th overall as it prepared to host the 2010 Memorial Cup.

“I don’t think anything could have prepared me for that” Green said. “I knew it was a possibility. Kelly let everybody know. We knew it we had so many 19-year-olds on the team and there’s only space for three 20-year-olds.”

He was moving to a situation in Red Deer where they actively wanted him as an overager — and certainly more opportunities were in his future — but it was still a devastating day for Green.

“It was definitely one of the top five tough moments for me” Green said. “I loved the city I loved the people I loved the team. For three years that was where I spent 80 per cent of my time and those guys I played with are my best friends. It didn’t make it easier that a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of playing in a Memorial Cup was on the line. It was a difficult summer.

“Even when I was in Red Deer it was still in the back of my mind. It still weighs on me. I truly wish I had an opportunity to be part of that team but it’s just not how things work sometimes.”

Nevertheless Green played well in Red Deer. In his first 25 games he had nine goals and 13 assists including a goal and two assists in his return to Brandon on Oct. 2 2009 a 6-3 Red Deer victory.

Unfortunately disaster struck on Nov. 22 when a linesman fell on his leg during a 3-1 loss to the Medicine Hat Tigers.

It came on the last play of the game when a Tiger took a run at Green and he took exception to it by dropping his gloves.

“As the one ref was breaking it up — he may or may not have a little overzealous — the linesman and the Medicine Hat player fell on top of me” Green said. “I fell on my left leg in a funny way and snapped it in half. That was nasty.”

Green had surgery on the fractured leg in late November and began skating in February but had swelling issues. He finally played again on March 12 three-and-a-half months and 45 games after he hurt himself getting into two contests at the end of the season and all four in the playoffs as the Rebels were swept in the first round.

“It was very tough” Green said. “In your 20-year-old year for most guys you’re not sitting there thinking it’s your last chance because most guys have pro aspirations moving on from the WHL. I definitely did.

“I had a really good opportunity in Red Deer. I was getting a ton of playing time I was linemates with Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and another great player there at the time named Willie Coetzee. We had some good chemistry going and my game was kind of excelling at that point. I knew I had a good opportunity to get noticed and then the injury happens.”

He admitted he favoured the leg when he returned and wishes he had taken the rehab process more seriously.

“I can truthfully say that I didn’t give myself the opportunity to come back playing as strong as I could have” Green said. “That’s definitely a learning experience.”

He decided after the injury he likely couldn’t make an ECHL roster so he chose school over minor pro hockey picking Acadia University over several other suitors. The X-Men were a comfortable choice in part because his former Brandon teammate and good friend Andrew Clark was there and put in a good word for him.

Tim Smith/Brandon Sun Nathan Green unsuccessfully tries to get the puck past goalie Todd Mathews of the Kootenay Ice on a penalty shot on March 21 2009.

He thoroughly enjoyed a completely different life experience.

“It was just super cool to be out there” Green said. “I had never been that far east before and to be right on the ocean in a small very historic old town was pretty cool and the university itself was a great place.”

Even though he enjoyed it he wasn’t happy with his hockey season — in 19 games in the 2010-11 campaign he had a goal and an assist — and was a long way from home. He didn’t return entering the University of Manitoba instead in the fall of 2011.

“My passion for hockey kind of waned after being out at Acadia” Green said. “I started to realize that maybe playing the sport at a high level wasn’t in the cards for me anymore and I missed home.”

He redshirted that season and began skating with the Bisons in the fall of 2012. He was offered a spot after the pre-season but ultimately decided his hockey career was over and concentrated instead on his sociology degree with a minor in management. He graduated in 2015.

Green worked as a sales representative for UPS for nine months and then landed a job with Molson Coors Beverage Company. He is currently Manitoba’s field sales manager looking after the five sales reps. His boss’s boss is former Wheat King Greg Hutchings.

His personal life has also worked out nicely.

Green and his wife Kaylee have son Holt with a second baby due this summer.

He still skates occasionally on outdoor rinks but hasn’t played organized hockey since his university career ended although he jokes he still sometimes views himself as a teenager getting ready for his next game.

Regardless hockey’s impact continues to resonate in his life.

“I would definitely say some of my best life lessons were learned in that dressing room on the bus on the ice” Green said. “You forge some great relationships that unfortunately over time as people get busier and people move on with their families and their lives you don’t keep in touch with people you used to be great friends with but all the memories are with you forever.”

By Pamela Barbaglia

LONDON (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley has hired former Bank of America banker Luigi Rizzo for a new client-facing role overseeing a drive to win business from a wide spectrum of companies across Europe the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) sources familiar with the move told Reuters.

Rizzo who was at the helm of Bank of America's European corporate and investment banking and quit in late 2019 will become Morgan Stanley's vice chairman of investment banking for EMEA the sources said speaking on condition of anonymity.

Morgan Stanley was not immediately available for comment.

A seasoned dealmaker who started his career at Goldman Sachs in 1993 Rizzo rose through the ranks becoming a partner in 2008 and working closely with some of Europe's most prominent dealmakers including Diego De Giorgi now co-CEO at Pegasus Europe.

In 2013 he joined Bank of America to take on top jobs in both M&A and investment banking for the EMEA region and moved to Paris after the Brexit referendum to oversee the bank's rollout across the EU.

In his new role he will advise clients including consumer and retail companies financial institutions and TMT (telecoms media and technology) conglomerates in their efforts to pursue strategic combinations that could speed up their post-COVID recovery.

The 50-year old Italian who is also a lecturer at various business schools including Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management where he graduated will be based in London and report to Morgan Stanley's head of investment banking Simon Smith.

His appointment comes as Morgan Stanley - which ranked second after Goldman Sachs in Refinitiv's global M&A league table last year - aims to take advantage of a rebounding M&A market with an overall $2.4 trillion worth of M&A deals announced globally during the first five months of 2021.

In May alone global dealmaking volumes hit a monthly record of $532.9 billion.

In a research note seen by MacRumors analyst Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley asserts that it is ‘likely’ Apple has a new MacBook to show off at WWDC 2021 which kicks off shortly (on June 7).

Huberty said: “Based on our checks we believe it’s likely Apple launches a new MacBook featuring in-house designed silicon.”

There are already several rumors flying around indicating the same with recent speculation coming from another analyst Wedbush’s Daniel Ives who said one of the surprises of WWDC would be the revelation of new MacBook Pro 14-inch and MacBook Pro 16-inch models.

Renown Apple leaker Jon Prosser has also added his weight to the rumors claiming there will be a new MacBook Pro unleashed at the start of next week. So the consensus of the speculation seems to be that there will be at least one new laptop coming from Apple maybe even a pair.

MacRumors further observes that it very recently unearthed what could be battery listings for new MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch models in a Chinese regulatory database.

M2 maybe?

While Huberty didn’t elaborate on what kind of MacBook we might expect to see launched she’s predicting that the MacBook which should appear may have an M2 chip or in other words the sequel to the M1 – whereas Ives reckons Apple will stick with the M1.

The latter seems unlikely at least going by previous buzz on the rumor mill which is clearly betting on a new chip although possibly the M1X (another rumor is that the M1X is next in line with the M2 being reserved for 2022 by Apple).

Huberty further reckons that if the MacBook is M2-powered (or indeed M1X) there’ll be a fair old gap between this initial WWDC unveiling of the machine and it actually going on sale. The purported MacBook with likely hit shelves in the second half of 2021.

Certainly there are more than a few reports pointing to a second half of 2021 launch for the rumored new MacBook Pro model(s) and indeed we’ve even heard some talk of potential delays related to component shortages (which could even threaten to push the on-sale timeframe to 2022 – a possibility we’ve heard a couple of times now). As ever employ liberal quantities of condiments with all this.

The revamped MacBook Pro models are expected to run with Mini LED screens – which could be a reason for any potential delay as we’ve already seen with the iPad Pro 12.9 that uses this tech – and they could well be stunning displays. In other words any wait might well be worth it…

We’ll soon know the truth behind this but given the sheer amount of MacBook Pro rumors kicking around it’s seeming more and more likely that we will see something at WWDC which is literally just around the corner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcnRtb3JnYW50aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8wNi9waGlsaXBwLWdydWJhdWVyLWF2YWxhbmNoZS1nb2xkZW4ta25pZ2h0cy1zdGFubGV5LWN1cC1wbGF5b2Zmcy_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3J0bW9yZ2FudGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMDYvcGhpbGlwcC1ncnViYXVlci1hdmFsYW5jaGUtZ29sZGVuLWtuaWdodHMtc3RhbmxleS1jdXAtcGxheW9mZnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Philipp Grubauer used blood sweat and technology to launch the Avalanche’s Stanley Cup run: “I’ve never seen a goalie do that”,"Like all honeymoons it was over too soon. Paradise in a blink.

Darren Hersh has been coaching goaltenders good ones for 26 years. The five months with Philipp Grubauer were among the fastest of his career. Also the sweetest.

“They were just doing regular warm-up drills and Grubi grabs a puck and starts passing back and forth with me between shots” Hersh said of the Avalanche’s No. 1 net-minder the last line of defense against the Vegas Golden Knights on Sunday in Game 4 of their second-round Stanley Cup Playoff series.

“I’ve never seen a goalie do that. That’s the kind of work ethic he had. You combine the technical stuff he has with the intangibles it doesn’t really surprise me that he is where he is. What surprises me is why in the world would Washington get rid of him?”

With that Hersh laughed. He’s worked with faster guys. He’s worked with bigger ones. But the man says few goalies before or since looked to grind the way Grubauer did.

And still does.

“In drills when he would do his movement he would be getting six inches farther than anybody else” recalled Hersh who was Grubauer’s goaltending coach with the ECHL’s Reading Royals at the start of the 2012-13 season.

“At this level six inches makes all the difference. I always tell all the kids ‘Grubi’s movement would put him there before the shot’ even though he’s a normal-sized human being.”

Their paths first crossed nine winters ago when Grubi was a 21-year-old German wunderkind in the Washington Capitals’ system stuck with the Royals because of the NHL’s lockout.

He was too good for that level even then and everybody knew it: 26 games a 19-5-1 record a 2.30 goals against average and a Pentium chip between his ears — a kid seemingly two chess moves ahead at every turn.

“His movement which was him just getting his positioning was just that much better than everybody else. That’s the technical part” Hersh said.

“But the intangible part is the guy every time he’s out on the ice … he was (always) doing something. The guys that I’ve coached that have made it that far they’ve always taken their development upon themselves.”

“He was really working”

When you’re always trying to stay six inches ahead of anybody else the race never stops.

It’s hard to tell how many of those 39 saves against Vegas during the Avs’ overtime win this past Wednesday — a 2021 season-high — we should credit to nature and how many to nurture. But maybe Bob Tetiva should be credited with an assist somewhere in the box score.

“I don’t think I can attribute his performance this year to just using Sense Arena” said Tetiva the founder and CEO of Sense Arena a company whose virtual reality off-ice training platform is the cutting-edge tool of NHL cool. “He had a fantastic season last year too.”

Grubauer started working with Tetiva’s program — which uses Facebook’s Oculus Quest VR software to give users an experience that lands somewhere between “The Matrix” and Electronic Arts’ iconic NHL video game series — last summer.

Ever since the Vezina Trophy finalist has used the platform once a week give or take for roughly an hour per day.

Sense Arena posted a clip of Grubi in action wearing a black VR headset that looked like a piece of oversized scuba gear to YouTube last October. In it the Avs’ net-minder fends off a series of virtual shots wearing only a black T-shirt and shorts.

“He was one of the first pro goalies who immediately wanted to try Sense Arena” Tetiva said “and that is what I love about the pros — they are always looking for ways to improve and find an edge to their performance.

“He is (darn) professional with fantastic goalie foundations. Seeing him making the saves in Sense Arena was like looking at a goaltending guide book. He was not playing around with it. He was really working.”

As with flight simulators the VR tech allowed Grubi to practice real-world timing in real-world situations at real-world speeds at his leisure without leaving the comforts of his home or hotel.

He’s one of a handful of NHL goalies who’ve embraced the platform which is now utilized teamwide by the Knights the Los Angeles Kings the Arizona Coyotes and the New Jersey Devils.

“It’s perhaps more about the load management and how to keep Philipp’s body in shape the whole season” Tetiva said. “And that can be the role of our platform for the pros too — you can make a workout at home or while traveling not exposing your body to another number of butterflies.”

“He’s been rolling for quite some time”

Butterflies? Grubi? The ninja in white? Come on.

“He’s battled some of those injuries” Avs coach Jared Bednar said. “But after he’s put in the work and got himself healthy and strong. And you can see the confidence in him growing.

“It really started from Day 1 of training camp this year and he’s continued it through this season. So now he’s been rolling for quite some time. He’s getting recognized with the Vezina nomination and I think he’s earned it. And our team is extremely comfortable in front of him and we’re confident that he’s going to make the saves if we have breakdowns.

“We just don’t want to make as many as we did (last Wednesday) in the final two periods.”

The guys who make it this far don’t flinch. At anything.

As Grubi reminds fans night after night round after round those extra six inches can go an awfully long way.

“Nothing fazes that guy” Hersh said laughing again. “He’s just as steady of a human as I’ve ever seen. Just stoic. Business. Just no fooling around. The pressure’s not going to get to him.

“All he’s doing now just seems to be a little bit more refined. I don’t see his game being that much different from what it was. He just plays his own game better now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvMTYyNzY3OdIBJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvYW1wLzE2Mjc2Nzk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lums alumnus Saleem Ahmad appointed to American Pakistan Foundation's board of directors,"American Pakistan Foundation (APF) — a Washington-based organisation that aims to foster connections between the United States and Pakistan — has appointed Saleem Ahmad chairman of the National Incubation Centre (NIC) at Lahore University of Management Sciences (Lums) to its board of directors it emerged on Saturday.

Mosaic's K1 and K2 mine shafts at Esterhazy Sask. have long been prone to flooding forcing the company to continuously pump out salty water.

The company is building a new shaft K3 to eliminate the problem and its associated costs.

Mosaic decided to close the K1 and K2 shafts nine months early when the water inflow accelerated beyond the company's pumping capacity said chief executive Joc O'Rourke.

""There would have been potential for safety issues so we felt the right thing to do was to accelerate the shutdown"" O'Rourke said in an interview.

No workers have been injured he said.

Florida-based Mosaic accounts for 13 per cent of global potash production according to Scotiabank and also produces phosphate fertilizer. The closure will cut Mosaic's potash production by 1 million tonnes until the company can fully ramp up production at K3 by March 2022.

O'Rourke said it was unclear how soon Mosaic could restart its idled Colonsay Sask. mine.

Mosaic's production cut comes as global potash prices climb following soaring corn and soybean prices. Potash is a crop nutrient that farmers apply to increase yields.

""This will put more stress on the potash market"" O'Rourke said estimating Mosaic's cut represented a two-to-three per cent global supply reduction.

The impact of the closure will be minimal for workers as Mosaic moves employees from the closed mine shafts to K3 O'Rourke said. Labor union Unifor Local 892 said it was meeting with Mosaic about the decision.

Once K3 reaches full capacity next year and Colonsay returns to service Mosaic forecasts its annual potash production to increase by 2 million tonnes from 2020 levels.

For the second quarter this year Mosaic expects to record $20 million to $25 million in brine management cash expenses and $80 million to $100 million related to writedowns for the remaining assets at K1 and K2.",,,,,,,,,,,,

NDAQ,"Nasdaq, Inc.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2h5LWNhbm9vLXN0b2NrLWZlbGwtMTAuMi1pbi1tYXktMjAyMS0wNi0wNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Canoo Stock Fell 10.2% in May,"What happened

Shares of Canoo (NASDAQ: GOEV) slumped 10.2% in May according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock sold off amid a broader pullback that trimmed valuations on speculative plays in the electric vehicle (EV) space.

Canoo's stock appears to have gotten a boost from the company's first-quarter earnings release but it still closed out the month down double digits. Canoo published its first-quarter results on May 17 recording no revenue in the period and an operating loss of roughly $97 million. The company also unveiled the pricing for its Lifestyle Vehicle which is scheduled to hit the market next year and will be priced from $34750 to $49950.

So what

The company ended the first quarter with $641.9 million in cash and equivalent assets. For the current quarter Canoo expects operating expenses to come in between $65 million and $75 million and capital expenditures to be between $45 million and $55 million.

Now what

Canoo stock has made gains early in June's trading. The company's share price is up roughly 10% in the month so far.

Positive market momentum appears to have been the main force driving the company's gains this month and the company may also have gotten a lift from momentum surrounding meme stocks. Gains for EV truck specialist Workhorse Group in particular may have had a spillover effect that helped lift Canoo's shares. Workhorse's shares have surged early in June as investors have focused on it as a potential short squeeze candidate and the attention may have also prompted investors to move into Canoo stock.

The overall EV market is poised for big growth over the next decade and beyond but investors still have to tread carefully. There's been a surge of small players entering the space and many of these companies have been given lofty valuations despite posting little in the way of revenue or still being in design and testing phases.

Canoo has yet to release a commercial vehicle and currently has a market capitalization of roughly $2.1 billion. While the company plans to launch a vehicle next year and follow that up with a pickup truck and vehicles tailored for delivery and sporting purposes investors should proceed with the understanding that the business' outlook remains speculative and its stock is a risky play.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the e-commerce industry’s outlook for 2021 and some of the major growth catalysts for e-commerce stocks and go directly to the 5 Biggest E-Commerce Companies in China.

The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted an already growing e-commerce industry thanks to various parts of the world going into lockdowns. Closure or limited access to in-person retail outlets forced a change in consumer behavior and the consumer base for e-commerce websites increased drastically. As a result the industry has seen an unprecedented 129% YOY growth in the US. China's e-commerce industry is also thriving.

According to an eMarketer forecast 52.1% of the country’s retail sales will come from online stores in 2021 up from 44.8% in 2020. The growth of the e-commerce industry in China is unrivaled. After China the country with the highest e-commerce growth rate in South Korea is projected to have 28.9% of all retail sales made online in 2021. That figure will be just 15.0% in the US and the average among European countries will be 12.8%.

The growth of the e-commerce industry in China appears to be unstoppable over the past few years. China’s most recent e-commerce boom did not decelerate even after the country got a handle on the virus and the economy fully reopened. Last year in-store sales declined by 18.6% and were projected to decline by a further 9.8% in 2021. By comparison e-commerce grew by 27.5% in 2020 and will grow by another 21.0% in 2021.

Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.

Arrow Financial is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of US$570m which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors. Our analysis of the ownership of the company below shows that institutional investors have bought into the company. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner to discover more about Arrow Financial.

View our latest analysis for Arrow Financial

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Arrow Financial?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

We can see that Arrow Financial does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Arrow Financial's historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Arrow Financial. Looking at our data we can see that the largest shareholder is North Country Investment Advisers Inc. with 8.8% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile the second and third largest shareholders hold 7.7% and 5.0% of the shares outstanding respectively.

A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There is some analyst coverage of the stock but it could still become more well known with time.

Insider Ownership Of Arrow Financial

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Arrow Financial Corporation. As individuals the insiders collectively own US$20m worth of the US$570m company. It is good to see some investment by insiders but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

The general public -- including retail investors -- own 54% of Arrow Financial. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too. For instance we've identified 1 warning sign for Arrow Financial that you should be aware of.

But ultimately it is the future not the past that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Spoilers for both the TV and comic book versions of Sweet Tooth follow.

Sweet Tooth Netflix’s TV adaptation of the limited comic book series by Jeff Lemire hit the streaming service on Friday but fans of the original comic will discover that filmmaker Jim Mickle has thoroughly reimagined it on its way to the small screen. Both versions of Sweet Tooth share the same wild premise: Human civilization gets laid out flat by a pandemic that briskly kills off most of the population while simultaneously women begin delivering “hybrid” babies that are half-human half-animal. The main plot is set about a decade after this collapse as the remaining human survivors attempt to find a cure for the pandemic while the hybrids shunned and feared by most humans seek freedom and self-determination. On both screen and page the main character is a deer / human hybrid boy who missed the apocalypse having been raised by his father safely hidden away in the wilderness. Although Netflix’s Sweet Tooth shares some DNA with its source material however it’s not quite the same species: The filmmakers transformed the comics from a grim post-apocalyptic slog in the tradition of The Road into a sort of a hybrid trimming some of the least palatable elements of Lemire’s vision of civilizational collapse (there’s a lot less human trafficking!) adding YA-friendly plot points like a subplot about a tribe of children living in an abandoned amusement park and drawing freely from post-apocalyptic narratives that emerged after the comic book’s original 2011–2013 print run. The result is a sprawling adventure with a strikingly different tone than the comic book it’s based on. Here’s what changed when moving Sweet Tooth from page to screen.

The Look and Tone

The most obvious change between Sweet Tooth the comic book and Sweet Tooth the television series is that the comic book features Jeff Lemire’s illustrations and the TV show does not. Lemire’s work is stylized sometimes to the point of anatomical impossibility and replacing his art with photographs of actual human beings goes a considerable way toward lightening the tone. To choose just one example the filmmakers gave the character of Dr. Singh a new sympathetic backstory to weigh against the horrible things he does in hopes of finding a cure for the virus but they’d already made him a much more likable character simply by casting Adeel Akhtar in the role as you can see in this head-to-head comparison.

Most of the characters received a similar glow-up in the transition to live-action and so did the setting. The comic book’s primary visual reference is The Road and its look is similarly bleak: Sweet Tooth travels from Nebraska to Alaska and back again crossing a landscape that could generously be described as “blasted.” The TV show narrows its scope to a voyage between Wyoming and Colorado and its color palette includes the vibrant greens of the overgrown ruins from The Last of Us and the lush meadows of Horizon: Zero Dawn. That’s not to say the TV version of Sweet Tooth is better looking than the comic books—Lemire’s illustrations are striking and weird while Sweet Tooth is photographed in Netflix’s usual sharp flat house style—but it’s a lot more inviting. The change in tone can also be heard in the show’s soundscape: The first episode features “Dirty Paws” the Of Monsters and Men song featured in Ben Stiller’s The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. The song fits the show just fine but try to imagine how you’d work this expansive slightly twee needle drop into The Road and you’ll get a pretty good idea of how different Netflix’s Sweet Tooth is from the comic book:

Don’t worry though: no one in Sweet Tooth gets their groove back by going longboarding in Iceland at least in the first season.

Gus

Sweet Tooth’s protagonist a half-deer hybrid boy named Gus survives the transition to the screen more or less intact. Actor Christian Convery’s cherubic looks are a big step up from Lemire’s glum long-faced tween but the first season of Sweet Tooth takes Gus through the same basic arc he goes through in the first five issues of the comic book: Gus’s father dies a drifter named Jepperd finds the cabin where they were hiding out and Gus travels with Jepperd across the remains of America until he is taken captive by a militia group. The details of the trip are pretty different however starting with its goal: In the show Gus leaves the cabin to search for his mother who he believes is in Colorado. In the comics Jepperd offers to take Gus to “the preserve” a place where hybrids can live safely.

Gus’s backstory to the extent we see it in Sweet Tooth’s first season seems similar but not identical to the comic book version. Both stories use a Chosen One-type structure in which Gus is initially presented as a typical hybrid—to the extent a half-deer half-human can be typical—but he later turns out to have been the very first of his kind and possibly the cause of the pandemic. In both cases he is a product of science but in the TV show he’s somehow created using microbes found deep in the arctic ice. In the comic book he’s cloned from the skeleton of a deer/human hybrid found in a frozen cavern alongside several other human/animal hybrid skeletons and it’s heavily suggested that he may be a reincarnation of the Inuit god Tekkeitsertok. (The show alludes to some of this lore but seems to be saving it for later seasons.) Either way if you’re looking for a TV show that covers the relatable day-to-day travails of a perfectly ordinary half-deer / half-human kid neither version of Sweet Tooth is for you.

Pubba

Gus spends his early childhood in the care of his father who he calls “Pubba.” Played by Will Forte on the TV show both versions of the character do more or less the same thing: Hide Gus from civilization teach him to be self-sufficient then catch the plague and die. The quickest way to see the way the difference between the two characters is to compare sample lines of their dialogue. Here’s something Will Forte’s version of the character tells his son:

I’m the luckiest dad in the world you know why? Because I got to spend the last nine years with a very very special boy—you—in a world we got to build together. I couldn’t ask for anything else.

Advertisement

Now here’s something the comic book version of the character tells his son as part of what are apparently regular sermons he delivers to his son about the end of the world:

And he poisoned the waters and inflicted the air they breathed and they no longer breathed the Holy Spirit but instead his pestilent breath of pure death. And all the world’s sinners withered and rotted on the spot and God looked down and said “You have sinned you have lived as evil men and now you will leave this earth to the good alone.”

As with so many other aspects of Sweet Tooth the live-action version is considerably more pleasant. Will Forte’s Pubba also tells his son an abbreviated story of the fall of civilization using an apple being devoured by ants as a teaching aid but in the comics Gus’ father is a full-on religious nut who believes that his son is the first representative of a new race sent by an angry god to replace humanity. Will Forte’s character is an aspiring illustrator who ends up drawing a small library of children’s books for his son; in the comic books he spends his time writing out new bible spelling out his theories about the hybrids. The two characters share the same backstory and do more or less the same things to advance the plot but the TV version seems like a much better dad if you had to choose.

Tommy Jepperd

Tommy Jepperd is a very different guy in the comic book than he is in the TV show. Both versions of Jepperd are gigantic and good at killing people but in the TV show Jepperd played by Nonso Anozie is a Black former football player whose gruff exterior conceals a heart of gold. In the comic books he’s white he used to play hockey and his heart is as black as his soul at least at first. On TV Jepperd agrees to help Gus catch a train to Colorado where he hopes to find his mother and although he doesn’t think there’s much chance Gus’ mom is alive he sincerely tries to get him there. In the comic books Jepperd’s offer of help is a lie: Although he tells Gus he’s taking him to a preserve for hybrids he instead delivers him to a militia camp where scientists are experimenting on hybrid children in hopes of curing the plague then barters Gus to them in exchange for his dead wife’s remains. (The militia has his wife’s body because they kidnapped Jepperd and his pregnant wife while collecting hybrid test subjects; his wife dies in childbirth and his kid is seized by the militia.) Over the rest of the comic books Jepperd redeems himself but he starts off as a villain.

The TV show’s Jepperd isn’t anywhere near as evil at least in ways we see on screen. He is a former member of an anti-hybrid militia and it’s implied that he did terrible things to survive early in the pandemic but he doesn’t betray Gus. His wife and their hybrid child meet a different fate as well: She delivers her baby much earlier in the pandemic while there’s still some semblance of civil order and although baby and mother get disappeared apparently by government officials there’s no militia trickery involved. Accordingly Anonzie’s Jepperd doesn’t have as much of a chip on his shoulder.

The Animal Army

Advertisement

Both versions of Sweet Tooth feature a group of humans who wear animal skulls as masks in imitation of the hybrids but that’s where the similarities end. In the comic books the animal army is a group of tribes led by a lunatic named Glebhelm and his five feral half-dog / half-man sons who began life by devouring their own mother. Glebhelm uses his hybrid sons as trackers and enforcers—he lets them tear one of his own men to shreds for disobeying an order—and although he is extremely interested in other hybrids that’s mostly because he thinks his sons can absorb their powers by eating them.

The TV show’s animal army is an entirely different thing except for the costumes. Led by a teenager who calls herself Bear (Stefania LaVie Owen) they are a group of human children who have made a home for themselves in an abandoned amusement park that somehow still has electricity where they pass their time playing video games and driving bumper cars. Bear and her followers are obsessed with hybrids—Bear had a hybrid little sister who disappeared early in the collapse—but they want to protect them not feed them to a pack of ravenous dog creatures in hopes of absorbing their powers. Since the comic book and TV show versions of the Animal Army are completely different groups of people there’s no overlap in their narratives. They just wear the same kind of masks.

Dr. Singh

Dr. Singh a doctor who ends up experimenting on hybrid children in an attempt to discover a cure for the pandemic gets a near-complete makeover in Netflix’s Sweet Tooth. In the comic books readers meet him long after he’s thrown his lot in with an anti-hybrid militia and besides his medical training we know very little about his pre-pandemic life. Jim Mickle gives Singh a wife (Aliza Vellni) and an elaborate backstory which he uses to explore some of the horrifying ways society fractures during the pandemic. Singh works at a hospital that’s overwhelmed by the pandemic; when his wife catches the invariably fatal virus he finds a way to keep her asymptomatic and hide her diagnosis. (Both viruses are invariably fatal but the comic book virus causes facial sores while the TV version causes a tic in the left pinkie finger a much creepier symptom.) Meanwhile his suburban neighborhood descends into Shirley-Jackson-style chaos as a self-appointed neighborhood watch sets about burning the houses of the infected to the ground with the residents still inside. Against that backdrop Singh seems like a relatable guy trying to keep his wife alive. The comic book version of his character is many things but “relatable” isn’t one of them. After finding the “bible” Gus’ father wrote Singh becomes obsessed with his prophecies and comes to believe that Gus is a messiah.

Aimee and the Preserve

Netflix’s Sweet Tooth has three major plotlines: Gus and Jepperd’s trek across the United States Dr. Singh’s suburban hell and the story of a woman named Aimee (Dania Ramirez) who settles after the collapse in a ruined Colorado zoo where with the help of a half-pig / half-human hybrid child named Wendy (Naledi Murray) she sets up “the preserve” a place for hybrid children to live safely. Wendy is in the comic books—Gus meets her in a militia kennel where they’re both being held prisoner—but Aimee was invented for the show. Although the preserve is mentioned in the comic books it’s unclear if it actually exists or Jepperd is lying about it. It seems likely that Aimee will fill a similar structural role as a character named Lucy in the comic books if Sweet Tooth gets more seasons teaming up with Jepperd to liberate Gus and the other hybrids from the militia but she’s original to the TV series.

Steven Abbot

General Abbot the head of the anti-hybrid militia seems to have a similar background in both versions of Sweet Tooth or at least nothing on screen contradicts the comic book version. (For instance in the comics Abbot is saddled with a hapless younger brother who keeps screwing things up; that character is present in the show but his familial relationship to Abbot has not been spelled out.) The comic book version of Sweet Tooth has meaner villains than the TV show at least in terms of the kind of sociopathic violence that characterizes “adult” comic books and Abbot is no exception: in the comics he’s always murdering people. Nevertheless Steven Abbot is way more memorable as played by Neil Sandilands on the TV show than he is in Jeff Lemire’s drawings. The reason’s pretty simple: In the comic books Abbot does not evoke a cross between Sonic the Hedgehog villain Doctor Robotnik and Edward Gorey in his raccoon coat days and in the TV show he absolutely does:

Sometimes effectively adapting a comic book character for television requires a lot of writing adding new motivations fleshing out background details and even crafting entirely new plotlines before the character comes to life on screen.

Welcome to Netflix World the theme park that represents the logical conclusion of building an I.P. empire.

Please present your admission ticket to a member of our Stream Team. Guests can use their cousin’s boyfriend’s mom’s ticket this time but we really are going to crack down on that soon.

As visitors enter they can browse the many algorithmically selected souvenir shops. Some of these shops are designed for strong female leads others for rogue cops doing one last job and still others for kids British. But all of them feature Netflix World signature headgear stations where guests will be able to purchase their very own The Crown.

The entrance area also features our Hall of the Presidents . . . of Netflix. Picture it: a proscenium stage where ticket holders can see Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos the co-C.E.O.s of Netflix deliver TED Talks. And we don’t rely on animatronics; it’s really Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos. They live there now.

As guests exit the hall they’ll lay eyes on an iconic attraction—the giant house of cards from “House of Cards.” Take a selfie with the enormous playing cards that are definitely the part of our first big hit show that people remember. Power corruption and greed never looked so Instagrammable.

Continue on to Netflix World’s synergetic lands such as Nostalgia Land where adults can feel like kids again and kids can feel safe in the knowledge that modern entertainment and child-labor laws make being a child actor much less damaging these days. While these laws also prevent us from letting adults pay money to play D. & D. in a basement with teen-agers “Stranger Things” fans can still feel the thrill of adventure on our newest ride Biking Slowly Through Hawkins Indiana. And lovers of “The Baby-Sitters Club” will go wild for Kristy’s Great Idea for a Roller-Coaster a roller-coaster based on Kristy’s first great idea (the Baby-Sitters Club) and Kristy’s second great idea (this roller-coaster).

A note to our roller-coaster riders: while we encourage guests to binge-ride if you remain on an attraction for more than thirty minutes our staff members are required to ask “Are you still riding?”

If the combination of longing for simpler times and being tossed around on a giant steel contraption turns the stomach Netflix recommends visiting one of our restrooms conveniently located throughout the premises. We would like to remind our guests that any individual who looks in a bathroom mirror and says something disparaging about themselves risks summoning the Fab Five from the surrounding stalls and being Queer Eyed on the spot. Please self-criticize responsibly.

After a bathroom trip and/or total life makeover visitors can walk from the memory-rich sepia tones of Nostalgia Land to the auteur-driven sepia tones of Prestige Land. There guests will immerse themselves in the worlds of our most award-oriented properties by:

Getting high and playing chess.

Getting high in the Lake of the Ozarks.

Getting high in Colombia and then later in Mexico.

Getting high because of Nurse Ratched.

Getting high and just watching “I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson.”

During their visit guests will be able to interact with some of our most popular characters. Eager fans can ask Jen and Judy from “Dead to Me” about the death of their husbands; or ask Nadia from “Russian Doll” about the repeated death of herself; or ask Emily about Paris.

We are also pleased to offer dining options that replicate the at-home Netflix experience. Visitors are invited to choose between a wide array of party-size chip bags melted Junior Mint globs and weed at any of our themed eateries: the prison cafeteria from “Orange Is the New Black” the unrealized campsite from the Fyre Festival documentary or the chef’s table from “Chef’s Table.”

And of course Netflix World wouldn’t be complete without Shonda Land a technically not-affiliated parcel of land where we built Shonda Rhimes a massive castle staffed by actors with impeccable butts that she can visit whenever she wants without ever having to pay and she will never be mad at us. Guests who aren’t Shonda Rhimes can still pose with the cast of “Bridgerton” in the “Close-up and Ugly Cry” photo booth.

For those who feel that television isn’t really their jam there’s always Netflix Original Movie Land—we’ve recreated the outside of Grauman’s Chinese Theatre and the inside of a suburban living room where you can enjoy a randomly selected Netflix original movie. Thrill-seekers will relish the uncertainty of not knowing whether they’ll be subjected to a three-hour black-and-white Spanish-language Oscar winner or “Hubie Halloween”!

If choosing among all of these experiences seems overwhelming we invite you to open a map at the entrance and browse it for three hours while bickering with family members before giving up and going back to the hotel to rewatch “Schitt’s Creek.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtMTAtYmVzdC1wb3N0LWFwb2NhbHlwdGljLW1vdmllcy1hbmQtdHYtc2hvd3Mtb24tbmV0ZmxpeNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 10 best post-apocalyptic movies and TV shows on Netflix,"You’d think that the appetite for stories about the end of civilization would subside during a real-life global pandemic. But while many Netflix subscribers tried to forget about the outside world early on by immersing themselves in the madness of Tiger King others doubled down on all the bleakness by sending Outbreak and Contagion to the top of the most-watched list.

And the streaming giant has continued to cater to these gluttons for punishment in 2021: Awake Sweet Tooth and a second season of Black Summer will all drop over the next month. If pure escapism isn’t your bag then check out 10 of the service’s best post-apocalyptic originals.

Bird Box

(Image credit: Netflix)

Apparently 45 million Netflix viewers celebrated Christmas 2018 by watching a claustrophobic horror about a mysterious entity that drives anyone who sees it to suicide. Bird Box may sound distinctly unfestive then. But with one of Hollywood’s most likeable A-listers as its blindfolded heroine and a plot that mirrored one of the year’s big surprise hits you can understand the reasons it became such a post-turkey dinner favorite. The adaptation of Josh Malerman’s same-named novel doesn’t quite hit the same heights as the similarly themed A Quiet Place. However buoyed by Sandra Bullock’s brilliantly gutsy lead performance this is still a tense taut survival tale that will have you glued.

Into the Night

(Image credit: Netflix)

A hijacked plane must outrun the sun after its rays wipe out the Earth-bound population. Into the Night sounds like one of the many high-concept one-season wonders that emerged in the wake of Lost. But Netflix’s first Belgian original has already been renewed for a second series thanks to surprisingly strong character development an appealing and diverse cast and an ability to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its six episodes. Even better its short running time means you can binge through the whole thing in an afternoon. Just don’t read too much into the science behind the catastrophe.

What Happened to Monday?

(Image credit: Netflix)

Giving Orphan Black’s Tatiana Maslany a run for her money Noomi Rapace plays seven identical twins with seven distinctive personalities in this logic-defying but ever-entertaining dystopian sci-fi. What Happened to Monday? is set in a near-future where a one-child policy has been enforced to combat overpopulation. But having spent 30 years posing as the same person it’s only now that Rapace’s bunch of Karens must overcome several threats – including Glenn Close in a more overtly villainous form than Cruella de Vil – to stay alive. Sure it’s full of glaring plot holes but director Tommy Wirkola (the man behind Nazi zombie-slaying horror Dead Snow) patches them up with plenty of B-movie thrills.

The Society

(Image credit: Seacia Pavao/Netflix)

A group of all-American teens (played by actors blatantly in their mid-20s of course) return home from a field trip to discover that all other mankind has mysteriously disappeared. On the surface The Society looks like your average glossy YA drama. But amid all the high-school cliches there are also debates on the power of democracy privilege and religion aligning it with the existential mystery of HBO's The Leftovers just as much as the glossy mayhem of Riverdale. Sadly events in the real world put paid to a second series but the first still contains a satisfying enough resolution to make the investment worth it.

Army of the Dead

(Image credit: Clay Enos/Netflix)

After nearly a decade of increasingly bloated shenanigans in the DC Extended Universe Zack Snyder returned to his genre roots this year with arguably his most entertaining film since Dawn of the Dead. Despite its title this typically OTT mash-up isn’t affiliated with his 2004 remake of the Romero classic. Instead it’s a separate franchise spawner (a prequel and animated TV spin-off will soon follow) where a motley crew of specialists plan to rob a casino which like the rest of its zombiefied Las Vegas setting is about to get a government nuking. Sure it’s completely ridiculous but unlike most of Snyder’s comic book fare it doesn’t forget to be fun.

Tribes of Europa

(Image credit: Gordon Timpen)

Reportedly conceived in response to Brexit Tribes of Europa follows three gung-ho siblings attempting to reunite the continent after a cataclysmic event dubbed Black December splits it into several warring factions. And a mysterious cube found in an air crash wreckage appears to hold the key. Set in 2074 45 years after said disaster this dystopian sci-fi isn’t for the faint-hearted. There’s almost as much brutality and bloodshed in its six episodes as there is in the entirety of Game of Thrones. But since it's produced by the team behind Netflix’s breakout German hit Dark such hyperviolence is counterbalanced by beautiful cinematography and a rich mythology that deserves to be explored further.

The Midnight Sky

George Clooney pulls double duty in this decidedly chilly end-of-the-world drama that suggests he was taking notes while filming Steven Soderbergh’s Solaris. Returning to screens for the first time since 2016 the director plays a terminally ill Arctic Circle-based scientist who must warn a space crew heading back from Jupiter that a radiation-stricken Earth is no longer hospitable. Drenched in melancholy The Midnight Sky is far more interested in ruminating on human connection redemption and the future of civilization than delivering high-octane action. Although set-pieces including a perilous spacewalk ensure there’s still plenty to feast the eyes while Alexandre Desplat’s evocative score ensures it sounds equally majestic.

The Rain

Had The Rain arrived in the midst of the dystopian young adult boom rather than the tail end it would have deservedly garnered more attention. In this Danish original toxic rain is the enemy having wiped out almost the entire Scandinavian population with siblings Rasmus and Simone – who’ve just emerged from an underground bunker after six years – the reluctant heroes. As they search for both the father who left them and a cure the pair join forces with several other engaging young survivors most of whom have fascinating backstories of their own. If you thought that Nordic TV was all about noirish crime and woolly jumpers think again.

Cargo

(Image credit: Netflix)

Adapted from a same-named short film released four years earlier 2017’s underrated and understated Cargo brings something a little different to the overcrowded zombie stable. Firstly there’s the scorched Aussie outback setting which allows directors Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke to explore all the undead drama from an Aboriginal perspective. Then there’s the fact that anyone bitten takes 48 hours to turn into a full-blown flesh-eater – a delay that gives Martin Freeman’s newly infected father the chance to find his infant daughter a carer before he meets the same rabid fate as his wife. Few zombie flicks have tugged at the heartstrings as effectively.

Daybreak

(Image credit: Netflix)

Don’t let the fact that this outlandish comedy drama was cancelled by Netflix after just one season deter you. Laughing both with and at Generation Z Daybreak is a joyously anarchic adaptation of Brian Ralph’s same-named comic book series that combines the postmodernism of Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick even shows up) with the post-apocalyptic tribalism of Mad Max.

Colin Ford takes center stage as the transfer student determined to find his absent girlfriend in the wake of a nuclear explosion that’s turned all adults into bloodthirsty mutants. But it’s his pyromaniac tween and bully-turned-samurai pals that steal the show in a refreshing alternative to all the self-serious YA fare."

The Marines were conducting a 300-meter simulated swim to shore with all the gear they would need for the next three days of their capstone event for the initial Infantry Marine Course.

Though the Marines had spent at least one day a week for the past 14-weeks in the pool this was the first time the three platoons of Alpha Company had ever attempted anything close this specific exercise.

For battalion gunner Chief Warrant Officer A.J. Pasciuti ― who has served for 20 years with multiple combat tours including time as a reconnaissance sniper — watching this was the most nervous he has been in his career.

RELATED

The swimming event encapsulated the spirit of the new Infantry Marine Course that Pasciuti helped birth.

That course is a new experimental School of Infantry curriculum designed with an additional five weeks and to teach aspiring grunts new lessons and prepare them to take on more responsibility.

And now in the first capstone event of the new course it was all coming down to the wire.

‘More competent’

Pasciuti knew the Marines knew how to swim.

In fact 90 percent of the Marines in the course qualified in the intermediate swimmer level ― one normally not even attempted until Marines get to the fleet.

They would be given a task and told the situation but it was now entirely up to them to complete the mission.

Some of the students took off powering through the 300-meter swim while squad mates struggled.

Eventually the company learned that teamwork would get them all through the swim faster than going alone. The Marines started to tie their rucks together and use them as small flotation devices carrying three to four students at a time.

It was a success showing just how far these Marines had gone during the training cycle.

“I guarantee you can throw them off a boat 300 meters out safely day or night” Lt. Col. Walker Koury commanding officer for Infantry Training Battalion–West said while watching the Marines complete the exercise.

So far the first iteration of the course has been a success showing exactly how much a new Marine can learn in the schoolhouse if given the opportunity.

The new infantry Marines are “better trained more adoptable more competent” than previous SOI graduates Koury said.

But despite that success the real challenge has just begun.

Questions of whether the new mindset and skills learned in the course will stay as Marines hit the fleet remain. As does the broader question of whether the Corps will keep up its end of the bargain supporting the structural changes required to make this increased level of training the new Marine Corps standard.

The Corps is still working on how exactly to measure all these improvements. Some like the mentality of the Marines may never be fully quantifiable.

More quantifiable factors like marksmanship were closely monitored as Marines went through this new course for the first time.

Jeremy Laboy)

Researchers with the Office of Naval Research digitally tracked the accuracy and speed of nearly every round Marines fired from their M-27s.

“There’s a watch that they’re wearing that tracks every shot that they take and exactly when they took it in relation to the start” Joe Hamilton one of the researchers told Marine Corps Times.

The data is linked to a tablet used by the instructor to measure the accuracy of each shot enabling the school to track exactly how well the Marines have done throughout the course how much they improved and how they compare to their peers.

The Corps is still analyzing that data as it prepares for the next three experimental iterations.

In the future range data along with other potential metrics may be posted publicly for the students to help create a greater sense of competition within the course.

Of the 140 Marines who started the 14-week course only two were dropped a higher success rate than the standard SOI class.

There were no discipline issues no refusal to train and no liberty incidents Pasciuti told reporters who had traveled to Camp Pendleton California to watch as the Marines kicked off the event.

Ready for the fleet

The 138 Marines who graduated are more competent on more weapons know more secondary infantry skills ― from land navigation to communication ― than Marines who previously have graduated from the School of Infantry according to the Marines who created and led the course.

“We would expect our graduates to be able to join their units in the fleet today … and be able to directly contribute to a successful infantry unit at a team level a squad level a platoon level” Col. Coby Moran the commander of School of Infantry-West said.

“If we in the future get into a fight tonight scenario where we do need to rapidly train and deploy Marines our IMC graduates should be able to fight win survive on a future battlefield at a much greater level without that long predeployment training timeline” he added.

The Marines are also more flexible than those in the past.

“Now you have a Marine who on the exact same day at night will maneuver with support by fire he will go that same night and switch positions so now he’s doing support by fire with the machine gun for another squad in his same platoon and oh by the way he shot the LAW” Koury said.

In the past official training on the cross-section of those specific skills was only taught to staff noncommissioned officers and commissioned officers Koury added.

“By accident we created tacticians” because of the cross-training Koury said.

Change in mindset

At one point late in the course when one platoon of students was deployed in a defensive position Pascuiti Gunnery Sgt. Blake Burkhardt the Infantry Training Battalion–West chief instructor and a few other very experienced infantry Marines set off on a patrol to see if they could sneak up on the young students.

Instead the tables were turned.

As the nine-man patrol laboriously worked its way up a steep hill on Camp Pendleton California the students spotted them.

“About two hours before I made contact with them they made contact with me” Pasciuti said of the ambush.

“They found us and then they watched us suffer for the next two hours as we were trying to make our way as sneaky as we could through some of the worse terrain we could find” he added.

All on its own the platoon stealthily moved into position to ambush the patrol.

Burkhardt said he could feel eyes on him for a few minutes but was unable to spot the students before a machine firing blanks opened on them “killing” the nine Marines before they had a chance to fight back.

“I stood up and I found a bunch of lasers cycling on my chest” Pasciuti said.

The most shocking outcome from the course was that it created a Marine who at least partially had shed a mindset that often lingers as a hangover from boot camp.

Brand new Marines are often scared of independent thought and any interaction with leadership.

But at IMC students felt bold enough to challenge the battalion commander to chess.

“It’s weird; they don’t even look like boots” one of the combat instructors assisting with the final rifle marksmanship test told Marine Corps Times.

It was a sentiment often mirrored by the Marines who ran the course.

“They talk and act like Marines who have been in the fleet for two years” Burkhardt said.

The revolutionary change in mindset did not come as a result of extended training time or extra skills taught but by the radical decision to treat these privates and private first classes as adults leaders said.

“These Marines are different” Pasciuti said. “They are different because we treated them differently.”

“Marines are taught to ask why. Not why as in questioning but why as in seeking information: ’What reason am I doing this?’ O.K. then I can have context and work toward it.”

The change was lauded by the instructors on and around the course ― many have long believed they could get more out of new Marines by treating them like adults and not mindless privates.

“I’ve always believed that if you expect somebody to perform they will they’ll be hungry to perform” said Sgt. Harvey Evans an 0352 anti-tank missileman providing support to Alpha Company.

Koury banned calling the students “kids” and banned any disrespectful treatment of them helping turn the course from an extra phase of boot camp to one designed to train future platoon sergeants and squad leaders.

“If we change our language if we change how we talk to them it changes our mindset it forces us because we think in the same way we speak” Evans added.

Culture shock

There is some apprehension among instructors on how long this changed mindset will last however.

When Marines hit the fleet and “senior lance corporals” are put off by these new and relatively free-thinking privates things might change.

“It’s going to be a culture shock because you’re going to have the dude who has however many years of experience beforehand and this new and upcoming thing” said Sgt. Austin Richey a course instructor.

“There will probably be some tension where the senior lance corporals or NCOs are going to be like ‘I know more than you I’ve been on deployment’ and these guys are coming straight out their basic infantry course straight off knowing just as much if not more” he said.

In addition to the worry their new attitude will be beaten out of them in the fleet instructors said they are worried Marines’ skills will go to waste if they are put into very basic 0311 roles which normally are handed out to Marines straight from the School of Infantry.

To help protect these young Marines they were sent to the fleet in the platoons they trained with at the Infantry Marine Course.

One platoon was sent to 2nd Battalion 5th Marines on Camp Pendleton California; one to 1st Battalion 3rd Marines on Marine Corps Base Hawaii; and one to 1st Battalion 2nd Marines on Camp Lejeune North Carolina.

The three battalions are slated to be part of the Marine Corps’ experiment with the Marine littoral regiment and taking a close look at the “arms room” concept that may see the Corps ditching its weapons companies.

There Marines ideally will be used based on their skill-sets rather than just as basic rifleman the leaders said. But it is still left to be seen especially once they are no longer under Infantry Marine Course leadership.

Also still to be seen is how dedicated the Marine Corps will be to the long-term adaptation of the extended course.

The current course is set to become the standard infantry training course by 2023 coinciding with the plan to consolidate infantry military occupational specialties.

But the course will require significantly more instructors to make it work.

“For the most part if were to run it as is with the instructor cadre as is is this sustainable? Maybe” said Sgt. Preston Bundash one of the course instructors. “But if we can get more instructors involved and we get all the support we can … Yes. We just have to beef it up a little more.”

Marines move through the course with 14 students assigned to one sergeant or staff sergeant instructor acting as a pseudo squad leader a far cry from the past where roughly 300 students would be handed to just a handful of instructors.

“At the moment it’s just a lot” Bundash said. “Sometimes you’re spending anywhere from 12 to 72 hours straight with these guys.”

To make the course work Corps-wide the two schoolhouses would have to add 80 instructors.

To tempt more Marines to leave the fleet the Corps is considering returning the combat instructor billet back to a special duty assignment comparable to drill instructors rather than the tier 1 screenable billet it is currently.

The change would make instructors eligible for another $150 in special duty assignment pay a month and would increase the priority of combat instructors for manpower purposes.

Ultimately the Corps will have to commit to paying more money to move Marines through infantry school to the fleet at a slower rate.

The Corps also has more fine tuning to do as it evaluates the data and builds the final course form.

Brig. Gen. Jason Morris the commander of Training Command said the Corps may eventually extend the course to 18 weeks so that Marines can get more time on heavy machine guns and potentially more amphibious training.

“It will grow and iterate and change and develop overtime” Morris said.

Burkhardt standing next to the pool watching a squad of Marines perform their final Infantry Marine Course evaluation said he hopes to get the Marines into the ocean for their water training in a future iteration of the course.

He also knows his work is just beginning.

“If the course is exactly the same in 10 years we failed” Burkhardt said.

The Evil Corp gang also known as Indrik Spider and the Dridex gang started as an affiliate for the ZeuS botnet. Over time they formed a group that focused on distributing the banking trojan and downloader called Dridex via phishing emails.

As cybergangs started to transition to highly profitable ransomware attacks Evil Corp launched a ransomware operation called BitPaymer which was delivered via the Dridex malware in compromised corporate networks.

After being sanctioned by the US government in 2019 ransomware negotiation firms refused to facilitate ransom payments for Evil Corp ransomware attacks to avoid facing fines or legal action from the Treasury Department.

Evil Corp began renaming their ransomware operations to different names such as WastedLocker Hades and Phoenix to bypass these sanctions.

The threat actors used Phoenix in an attack on insurance firm CNA.

Evil Corp impersonates Payload Bin hacking group

After breaching the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington DC and stealing unencrypted data the Babuk gang said they were quitting ransomware encryption and instead focus on data theft and extortion.

At the end of May the Babuk data leak site had a design refresh where the ransomware gang rebranded as a new group called 'payload bin' shown below.

On Thursday BleepingComputer found a new ransomware sample called PayloadBIN [VirusTotal] that we immediately assumed was related to the rebranding of Babuk Locker.

When installed the ransomware will append the .PAYLOADBIN extension to encrypted files as shown below.

Furthermore the ransom note is named 'PAYLOADBIN-README.txt' and states that the victim's ""networks is LOCKED with PAYLOADBIN ransomware.""

PayloadBIN ransom note

After finding the sample BleepingComputer thought Babuk was lying about their intentions to move away from ransomware and rebranded to a new name.

However after analyzing the new ransomware both Fabian Wosar of Emsisoft and Michael Gillespie of ID Ransomware confirmed that the ransomware is a rebranding of Evil Corp's previous ransomware operations.

A few grim years saw major job losses after Hershey Canada and tool box manufacturer The Stanley Works left town and with the closure of the Rideau Regional Centre in 2009.

Then Tweed Marijuana Inc. arrived in 2014 and grew exponentially.

Despite the vagaries of the pot business and recent losses and layoffs by its parent company Canopy Growth Corp. it's still the town's largest employer providing around 1200 jobs according to Smiths Falls Mayor Shawn Pankow.

Still the announcement last week that the Ontario Provincial Police will close its communications centre in Smiths Falls by next June is an echo of former loss. The decision will affect 100 employees most of them civilians.

Call-taking and dispatch duties will be moved to the OPP communications centre in Orillia Ont.

Smiths Falls Mayor Shawn Pankow is confident the eastern Ontario town will rebound from its recent economic setbacks as it has before. (CBC)

The move has left Pankow disappointed and worried on behalf of the affected families.

""Families are going to have to potentially uproot their children and change schools. It means one spouse perhaps having to lose their job. It means the … probability of looking for a new job and maybe having to commute to Ottawa if there's nothing suitable locally"" he told CBC Radio's All In A Day.

In an email the OPP's Bill Dickson said the provincial police force is committed to supporting those employees.

""This includes a variety of options including potential transfers to other OPP locations"" he wrote.

That's fine for some but not all Pankow said.

""There will be some who may be able to transition to retirement but the vast majority of the roughly 100 employees will be facing a decision this fall: Here is your opportunity to relocate or here is your severance package if you choose not to"" the mayor said.

""To have to uproot your family and move to Orillia or London or North Bay it's going to be a challenge. Housing prices are rising dramatically here. They're higher in other places.""

That's especially true during a pandemic said Pankow said who's also concerned about the impact on those left behind.

""From a community perspective it is lost payroll"" he said. ""A very modest impact on the overall economy of our town but it's still impactful.""

The OPP announcement comes on the heels of another money-losing year for Canopy Growth Corp which is facing stiff spliff competition in Canada.

""As painful as it may be for the people involved when layoffs do happen … in the end from a community perspective it's the long-term sustainability of the facility that means the most to us. They are doing what they have to do"" said Pankow..

The pandemic has slowed the rollout of new cannabis stores across Ontario. Health Canada has had its hands full with its COVID-19 response which has slowed changes to consumption rules that might help Canopy Growth according to Pankow.

Like most communities the pandemic has put pressure on small businesses too.

""When you're trying to plan for the future when you're trying to line up your supply chains ... it's all very challenging"" said Pankow who added federal and provincial support has helped Smiths Falls get through the pandemic.

""We've actually had more businesses open over the last year than close which is really encouraging"" said Pankow.

""Small business has been the foundation of our community. It got us through those challenges in 2008 into 2010 2012 and 2014 when we saw a number of facilities closing ... and a real downturn in our economy.""

The Marines were conducting a 300-meter simulated swim to shore with all the gear they would need for the next three days of their capstone event for the initial Infantry Marine Course.

Though the Marines had spent at least one day a week for the past 14-weeks in the pool this was the first time the three platoons of Alpha Company had ever attempted anything close this specific exercise.

For battalion gunner Chief Warrant Officer A.J. Pasciuti ― who has served for 20 years with multiple combat tours including time as a reconnaissance sniper — watching this was the most nervous he has been in his career.

RELATED

The swimming event encapsulated the spirit of the new Infantry Marine Course that Pasciuti helped birth.

That course is a new experimental School of Infantry curriculum designed with an additional five weeks and to teach aspiring grunts new lessons and prepare them to take on more responsibility.

And now in the first capstone event of the new course it was all coming down to the wire.

‘More competent’

Pasciuti knew the Marines knew how to swim.

In fact 90 percent of the Marines in the course qualified in the intermediate swimmer level ― one normally not even attempted until Marines get to the fleet.

They would be given a task and told the situation but it was now entirely up to them to complete the mission.

Some of the students took off powering through the 300-meter swim while squad mates struggled.

Eventually the company learned that teamwork would get them all through the swim faster than going alone. The Marines started to tie their rucks together and use them as small flotation devices carrying three to four students at a time.

It was a success showing just how far these Marines had gone during the training cycle.

“I guarantee you can throw them off a boat 300 meters out safely day or night” Lt. Col. Walker Koury commanding officer for Infantry Training Battalion–West said while watching the Marines complete the exercise.

So far the first iteration of the course has been a success showing exactly how much a new Marine can learn in the schoolhouse if given the opportunity.

The new infantry Marines are “better trained more adoptable more competent” than previous SOI graduates Koury said.

But despite that success the real challenge has just begun.

Questions of whether the new mindset and skills learned in the course will stay as Marines hit the fleet remain. As does the broader question of whether the Corps will keep up its end of the bargain supporting the structural changes required to make this increased level of training the new Marine Corps standard.

The Corps is still working on how exactly to measure all these improvements. Some like the mentality of the Marines may never be fully quantifiable.

More quantifiable factors like marksmanship were closely monitored as Marines went through this new course for the first time.

Researchers with the Office of Naval Research digitally tracked the accuracy and speed of nearly every round Marines fired from their M-27s.

“There’s a watch that they’re wearing that tracks every shot that they take and exactly when they took it in relation to the start” Joe Hamilton one of the researchers told Marine Corps Times.

The data is linked to a tablet used by the instructor to measure the accuracy of each shot enabling the school to track exactly how well the Marines have done throughout the course how much they improved and how they compare to their peers.

The Corps is still analyzing that data as it prepares for the next three experimental iterations.

In the future range data along with other potential metrics may be posted publicly for the students to help create a greater sense of competition within the course.

Of the 140 Marines who started the 14-week course only two were dropped a higher success rate than the standard SOI class.

There were no discipline issues no refusal to train and no liberty incidents Pasciuti told reporters who had traveled to Camp Pendleton California to watch as the Marines kicked off the event.

Ready for the fleet

The 138 Marines who graduated are more competent on more weapons know more secondary infantry skills ― from land navigation to communication ― than Marines who previously have graduated from the School of Infantry according to the Marines who created and led the course.

“We would expect our graduates to be able to join their units in the fleet today … and be able to directly contribute to a successful infantry unit at a team level a squad level a platoon level” Col. Coby Moran the commander of School of Infantry-West said.

“If we in the future get into a fight tonight scenario where we do need to rapidly train and deploy Marines our IMC graduates should be able to fight win survive on a future battlefield at a much greater level without that long predeployment training timeline” he added.

The Marines are also more flexible than those in the past.

“Now you have a Marine who on the exact same day at night will maneuver with support by fire he will go that same night and switch positions so now he’s doing support by fire with the machine gun for another squad in his same platoon and oh by the way he shot the LAW” Koury said.

In the past official training on the cross-section of those specific skills was only taught to staff noncommissioned officers and commissioned officers Koury added.

“By accident we created tacticians” because of the cross-training Koury said.

Change in mindset

At one point late in the course when one platoon of students was deployed in a defensive position Pascuiti Gunnery Sgt. Blake Burkhardt the Infantry Training Battalion–West chief instructor and a few other very experienced infantry Marines set off on a patrol to see if they could sneak up on the young students.

Instead the tables were turned.

As the nine-man patrol laboriously worked its way up a steep hill on Camp Pendleton California the students spotted them.

“About two hours before I made contact with them they made contact with me” Pasciuti said of the ambush.

“They found us and then they watched us suffer for the next two hours as we were trying to make our way as sneaky as we could through some of the worse terrain we could find” he added.

All on its own the platoon stealthily moved into position to ambush the patrol.

Burkhardt said he could feel eyes on him for a few minutes but was unable to spot the students before a machine firing blanks opened on them “killing” the nine Marines before they had a chance to fight back.

“I stood up and I found a bunch of lasers cycling on my chest” Pasciuti said.

The most shocking outcome from the course was that it created a Marine who at least partially had shed a mindset that often lingers as a hangover from boot camp.

Brand new Marines are often scared of independent thought and any interaction with leadership.

But at IMC students felt bold enough to challenge the battalion commander to chess.

“It’s weird; they don’t even look like boots” one of the combat instructors assisting with the final rifle marksmanship test told Marine Corps Times.

It was a sentiment often mirrored by the Marines who ran the course.

“They talk and act like Marines who have been in the fleet for two years” Burkhardt said.

The revolutionary change in mindset did not come as a result of extended training time or extra skills taught but by the radical decision to treat these privates and private first classes as adults leaders said.

“These Marines are different” Pasciuti said. “They are different because we treated them differently.”

“Marines are taught to ask why. Not why as in questioning but why as in seeking information: ’What reason am I doing this?’ O.K. then I can have context and work toward it.”

The change was lauded by the instructors on and around the course ― many have long believed they could get more out of new Marines by treating them like adults and not mindless privates.

“I’ve always believed that if you expect somebody to perform they will they’ll be hungry to perform” said Sgt. Harvey Evans an 0352 anti-tank missileman providing support to Alpha Company.

Koury banned calling the students “kids” and banned any disrespectful treatment of them helping turn the course from an extra phase of boot camp to one designed to train future platoon sergeants and squad leaders.

“If we change our language if we change how we talk to them it changes our mindset it forces us because we think in the same way we speak” Evans added.

Culture shock

There is some apprehension among instructors on how long this changed mindset will last however.

When Marines hit the fleet and “senior lance corporals” are put off by these new and relatively free-thinking privates things might change.

“It’s going to be a culture shock because you’re going to have the dude who has however many years of experience beforehand and this new and upcoming thing” said Sgt. Austin Richey a course instructor.

“There will probably be some tension where the senior lance corporals or NCOs are going to be like ‘I know more than you I’ve been on deployment’ and these guys are coming straight out their basic infantry course straight off knowing just as much if not more” he said.

In addition to the worry their new attitude will be beaten out of them in the fleet instructors said they are worried Marines’ skills will go to waste if they are put into very basic 0311 roles which normally are handed out to Marines straight from the School of Infantry.

To help protect these young Marines they were sent to the fleet in the platoons they trained with at the Infantry Marine Course.

One platoon was sent to 2nd Battalion 5th Marines on Camp Pendleton California; one to 1st Battalion 3rd Marines on Marine Corps Base Hawaii; and one to 1st Battalion 2nd Marines on Camp Lejeune North Carolina.

The three battalions are slated to be part of the Marine Corps’ experiment with the Marine littoral regiment and taking a close look at the “arms room” concept that may see the Corps ditching its weapons companies.

There Marines ideally will be used based on their skill-sets rather than just as basic rifleman the leaders said. But it is still left to be seen especially once they are no longer under Infantry Marine Course leadership.

Also still to be seen is how dedicated the Marine Corps will be to the long-term adaptation of the extended course.

The current course is set to become the standard infantry training course by 2023 coinciding with the plan to consolidate infantry military occupational specialties.

But the course will require significantly more instructors to make it work.

“For the most part if were to run it as is with the instructor cadre as is is this sustainable? Maybe” said Sgt. Preston Bundash one of the course instructors. “But if we can get more instructors involved and we get all the support we can … Yes. We just have to beef it up a little more.”

Marines move through the course with 14 students assigned to one sergeant or staff sergeant instructor acting as a pseudo squad leader a far cry from the past where roughly 300 students would be handed to just a handful of instructors.

“At the moment it’s just a lot” Bundash said. “Sometimes you’re spending anywhere from 12 to 72 hours straight with these guys.”

To make the course work Corps-wide the two schoolhouses would have to add 80 instructors.

To tempt more Marines to leave the fleet the Corps is considering returning the combat instructor billet back to a special duty assignment comparable to drill instructors rather than the tier 1 screenable billet it is currently.

The change would make instructors eligible for another $150 in special duty assignment pay a month and would increase the priority of combat instructors for manpower purposes.

Ultimately the Corps will have to commit to paying more money to move Marines through infantry school to the fleet at a slower rate.

The Corps also has more fine tuning to do as it evaluates the data and builds the final course form.

Brig. Gen. Jason Morris the commander of Training Command said the Corps may eventually extend the course to 18 weeks so that Marines can get more time on heavy machine guns and potentially more amphibious training.

“It will grow and iterate and change and develop overtime” Morris said.

Burkhardt standing next to the pool watching a squad of Marines perform their final Infantry Marine Course evaluation said he hopes to get the Marines into the ocean for their water training in a future iteration of the course.

He also knows his work is just beginning.

“If the course is exactly the same in 10 years we failed” Burkhardt said.

The Evil Corp gang also known as Indrik Spider and the Dridex gang started as an affiliate for the ZeuS botnet. Over time they formed a group that focused on distributing the banking trojan and downloader called Dridex via phishing emails.

As cybergangs started to transition to highly profitable ransomware attacks Evil Corp launched a ransomware operation called BitPaymer which was delivered via the Dridex malware in compromised corporate networks.

After being sanctioned by the US government in 2019 ransomware negotiation firms refused to facilitate ransom payments for Evil Corp ransomware attacks to avoid facing fines or legal action from the Treasury Department.

Evil Corp began renaming their ransomware operations to different names such as WastedLocker Hades and Phoenix to bypass these sanctions.

The threat actors used Phoenix in an attack on insurance firm CNA.

Evil Corp impersonates Payload Bin hacking group

After breaching the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington DC and stealing unencrypted data the Babuk gang said they were quitting ransomware encryption and instead focus on data theft and extortion.

At the end of May the Babuk data leak site had a design refresh where the ransomware gang rebranded as a new group called 'payload bin' shown below.

On Thursday BleepingComputer found a new ransomware sample called PayloadBIN [VirusTotal] that we immediately assumed was related to the rebranding of Babuk Locker.

When installed the ransomware will append the .PAYLOADBIN extension to encrypted files as shown below.

Furthermore the ransom note is named 'PAYLOADBIN-README.txt' and states that the victim's ""networks is LOCKED with PAYLOADBIN ransomware.""

After finding the sample BleepingComputer thought Babuk was lying about their intentions to move away from ransomware and rebranded to a new name.

However after analyzing the new ransomware both Fabian Wosar of Emsisoft and Michael Gillespie of ID Ransomware confirmed that the ransomware is a rebranding of Evil Corp's previous ransomware operations.

A few grim years saw major job losses after Hershey Canada and tool box manufacturer The Stanley Works left town and with the closure of the Rideau Regional Centre in 2009.

Then Tweed Marijuana Inc. arrived in 2014 and grew exponentially.

Despite the vagaries of the pot business and recent losses and layoffs by its parent company Canopy Growth Corp. it's still the town's largest employer providing around 1200 jobs according to Smiths Falls Mayor Shawn Pankow.

Still the announcement last week that the Ontario Provincial Police will close its communications centre in Smiths Falls by next June is an echo of former loss. The decision will affect 100 employees most of them civilians.

Call-taking and dispatch duties will be moved to the OPP communications centre in Orillia Ont.

Smiths Falls Mayor Shawn Pankow is confident the eastern Ontario town will rebound from its recent economic setbacks as it has before. (CBC)

The move has left Pankow disappointed and worried on behalf of the affected families.

""Families are going to have to potentially uproot their children and change schools. It means one spouse perhaps having to lose their job. It means the … probability of looking for a new job and maybe having to commute to Ottawa if there's nothing suitable locally"" he told CBC Radio's All In A Day.

In an email the OPP's Bill Dickson said the provincial police force is committed to supporting those employees.

""This includes a variety of options including potential transfers to other OPP locations"" he wrote.

The OPP announced last week it's shutting its communications centre in Smiths Falls. About 100 full-time jobs will be affected mostly civilian positions. (Olivier Plante/CBC)

That's fine for some but not all Pankow said.

""There will be some who may be able to transition to retirement but the vast majority of the roughly 100 employees will be facing a decision this fall: Here is your opportunity to relocate or here is your severance package if you choose not to"" the mayor said.

""To have to uproot your family and move to Orillia or London or North Bay it's going to be a challenge. Housing prices are rising dramatically here. They're higher in other places.""

That's especially true during a pandemic said Pankow said who's also concerned about the impact on those left behind.

""From a community perspective it is lost payroll"" he said. ""A very modest impact on the overall economy of our town but it's still impactful.""

The OPP announcement comes on the heels of another money-losing year for Canopy Growth Corp which is facing stiff spliff competition in Canada.

""As painful as it may be for the people involved when layoffs do happen … in the end from a community perspective it's the long-term sustainability of the facility that means the most to us. They are doing what they have to do"" said Pankow..

The pandemic has slowed the rollout of new cannabis stores across Ontario. Health Canada has had its hands full with its COVID-19 response which has slowed changes to consumption rules that might help Canopy Growth according to Pankow.

Like most communities the pandemic has put pressure on small businesses too.

""When you're trying to plan for the future when you're trying to line up your supply chains ... it's all very challenging"" said Pankow who added federal and provincial support has helped Smiths Falls get through the pandemic.

Officials in an Adams County township outside Gettysburg are denying a key permit for a large solar project.

Four Mount Joy Township supervisors on Thursday deadlocked on motions to grant or deny a conditional use permit to the 75-megawatt solar project from NextEra Energy. Supervisor David Updyke who holds leases with NextEra was absent.

By default the permit was denied.

The decision comes after more than a year of hearings and increasingly heated debate on whether the community should host such a project.

NextEra leased 1000 acres from 18 landowners along a rural section of Route 97 for the project. It planned to build solar panels on about half the area.

People who opposed it said the project didn’t fit the rural and historic character of the area and raised concerns about lowered property values impacts to wildlife and stormwater runoff issues among others.

NextEra needed a conditional use permit to build in zoning areas along the Baltimore Pike corridor. In response to citizen concerns the motion to grant the permit had conditions including a higher bond amount to eventually decommission the project a commitment to use non-reflective panels and a requirement to get township approval for landscaping plans.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We're talking about Kanye West wearing Nikes.

In the sneaker game two things are canon: Kanye's YEEZY empire and his beef with Nike. But for Mr. West that apparently doesn't mean the competition is entirely off-limits. This week the rapper-designer was photographed in Los Angeles wearing a pair of Nikes.

But before we get to the kicks let's briefly address that fit. Ye stepped out wearing a full head covering featuring a painting of Black Jesus and an unseasonably large puffer jacket. Underneath an all-black fit leads up to a pair of black canvas sneakers embossed with a distinct silver Swoosh.

Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Twitter post. Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy

The pair in question is inspired by a one-off from the 1984 film The Terminator. While the film's version never actually released a slightly modified iteration dropped in June 2015 as part of promo pairs for the release of Terminator Genisys.

While it's not nearly as rare as the original version the 2015 “Terminator” Nike Vandal High is coveted in its own right. Even before West recently rocked them a pair would go for more than $500 on sites like StockX with several sales even hitting closer to the $1000 mark. There is currently only a single Size 10 pair available at an asking price of $14128.

The last time we spotted Ye rocking the Swoosh was Thanksgiving last year. It's unclear whether this means that Kanye has put his beef with Nike behind him. Or maybe he's just checking out the competition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzMxNTY4OTMwL3NldmVyYWwtYW5zd2Vycy12YW5lc3NhLWJyeWFudC1xdWVzdGlvbnMtbmlrZS1rb2JlLTYtcHJvdHJvLXNob2UtcmVsZWFzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Several answers to Vanessa Bryant's questions about Nike Kobe 6 Protro shoe release,"Vanessa Bryant revealed in a series of social media posts earlier this week that she was blindsided upon seeing an image of a shoe she helped design a black and white ""Mamba Forever"" special edition of the Nike Kobe 6 Protro from her late husband Kobe Bryant's signature series with the brand.

The specific colorway in question featuring subtle gold accents throughout was created as a tribute to her daughter Gianna.

""It was going to be called the MAMBACITA shoe as an exclusive black and white colorway on her daddy's shoes"" she wrote in one post. ""I picked the colors in honor of her uniform the number 2 she wore just like her uniform the inside pattern Kobe and Gigi on the back in gold instead of Kobe's signature the inside shoe details [butterfly wings halo] etc.""

The sneakers designed in conjunction with Nike nearly a year ago were originally scheduled to be released this summer before being placed on indefinite hold after Vanessa and the Kobe Bryant Estate elected not to renew the contract with Nike this year.

The heel counter features the names ""Kobe"" and ""Gigi"" on opposite shoes along with the ""Mamba M"" logo that the Kobe Bryant Estate fully owns the rights to. The Kobe Bryant Estate has also filed for trademarks in the footwear and clothing sector for additional terms like ""Mambacita"" ""Mamba League"" ""Lil' Mambas"" ""Kobe Bryant"" ""Play Gigi's Way"" and others.

@brandon1an

The shoes created after the Jan. 26 2020 helicopter crash that killed Bryant Gianna and seven other passengers were intended to raise funds for the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation and to support youth girls sports initiatives Vanessa Bryant said.

""The MAMBACITA shoes are NOT approved for sale"" she wrote. ""I wanted it to be sold to honor my daughter with ALL of the proceeds benefiting our @mambamambacitasports foundation but I did not re-sign the Nike contract and decided not to sell these shoes. [The MAMBACITA shoes were not approved to be made in the first place]. Nike has NOT sent any of these pairs to me and my girls. I do not know how someone else has their hands on shoes I designed in honor of my daughter Gigi and we don't. I hope these shoes did not get sold. @nike""

The confusion around the potential release of the shoes stems from a variety of calendar quirks surrounding the footwear manufacturer's timeline detailed contract clauses heading into the expiration window and a crucial shipping error both to and from a UK-based official Nike retailer.

The shoes were in fact not officially released as Nike does not plan to do so until a new agreement is reached with Vanessa and the Kobe Bryant Estate according to sources.

Nike officials were not available for comment when contacted by ESPN. Contacted for further comment Vanessa Bryant was unavailable. She celebrated her daughter Natalia's high school graduation this weekend.

The original Kobe Bryant endorsement extension contract with Nike was a five-year agreement beginning on the date of the Lakers star's final NBA game in 2016. It expired on April 13.

The ""Mamba Forever"" Kobe shoes designed nearly a year ago were put into production at a Nike factory in Vietnam between the dates of ""10/28/20 - 01/13/21"" as printed on a series of Kobe 6 Protro tag labels. That timeline is well in advance of the contract's expiration. There was an anticipation of a summer release until contract talks stalled in April and halted those plans.

Typically sneaker samples in specific colorways of future retail launches are created in size 9 about a year in advance and receive ""final confirmation sign-off"" about eight months in advance allowing a window for subtle tweaks to be made and execution before going into production.

The Initial Production Week or IPW is then scheduled to begin at the brand's factory partners in Asia anywhere from five to eight months in advance of a release date with production for a full run of pairs requiring a span of a couple months to be completed.

For signature sneakers that also require an endorsement contract between a partner and the brand a clause deep in every contract provides the company the ability to place a sneaker into production in advance of an expiration date if retail orders have already been placed against the design to be fulfilled and still sell the shoe after a contract has expired.

Though rare there are some instances in which this has happened in the industry such as when John Wall's Adidas JWall 2 sneaker was released at retail during the fall of 2015 after his contract with the company had expired that October.

While the Bryant contract expired in April another colorway of the Kobe 6 did recently release overseas in May with an expected June 11 U.S. launch date. The white black and del sol yellow design was dubbed the ""Playoff Pack"" edition a decade ago and is an original colorway worn by Bryant during the tail end of the 2010-11 season.

The POP colorway has largely been expected to be the last Nike Kobe release for the foreseeable future while contract negotiations continue.

The shoe's coding label includes an ""11/11/20 - 01/30/21"" production run timeline at a Nike factory in Vietnam -- also well within Bryant's prior contract's active window.

On April 23 10 days after the contract had expired Vanessa Bryant posted her pair of white ""POP"" 6s with the caption ""2 More Drops.""

Vanessa Bryant says there will be ""2 more drops"" of Kobe releases. pic.twitter.com/fJA9zraPPg — Nick DePaula (@NickDePaula) April 24 2021

Less than a month later a gleaming gold and purple Kobe 5 Protro was released during the week of the delayed 2020 Hall of Fame ceremony in mid-May 2021. The shoes had been originally created more than a year ago and planned to be released during the fall of 2020 then were delayed in tandem with the Hall of Fame's new 2021 date at which Vanessa Bryant spoke during the induction ceremony on behalf of Kobe Bryant.

Days before the recent Hall of Fame ceremony images of the Mamba Forever Kobe 6 leaked on May 12. User @Brandon1an posted product shots of the black and white sneakers clearly showing the ""Gigi"" and ""Kobe"" heel text and jersey No. 2 revealing a once-planned summer launch timeline and $180 price.

In the past month a series of shipping mistakes has led to the current confusion and a small number of consumers in England acquiring the ""Mamba Forever"" edition of the Kobe 6.

Footpatrol London a leading UK-based sneaker boutique mistakenly received several cases of the Mamba Forever Kobe 6 over a month ago. Typically cases of sneakers are sent to retailers weeks ahead of a release in boxes containing 12 pairs.

The shipment was supposed to have included the white POP colorway which Footpatrol was prepared to sell in mid-May through a common raffle system. The ""POP"" style code is CW2190-100 while the Mamba Forever style code is CW2190-002.

The retailer mistakenly then sent the pairs of Mamba Forever sneakers to raffle winners. Upon realizing the mistake the store contacted customers through email with the following message:

""We regret to inform you that due to unforeseen circumstances an error was made on your order for the Nike Kobe VI Protro causing an incorrect item to be shipped to you.

If you wish to return the item please feel free to do so free of charge via the returns label found in your parcel.

Please accept our apologies Thanks

TEAM FP""

It is believed that none of the sneakers were actually returned to Footpatrol as customers immediately realized what had instead arrived. Footpatrol did not respond to a request for comment and has not acknowledged the mishap on social media.

Miles Lomas a 22 year-old British sneaker collector immediately tried to get his hands on a pair once he realized the shipping mistake that had taken place in mid-May. It was Lomas' image on his @Milo_Sneakz Instagram page that went viral this week eventually being seen by Vanessa Bryant and shared alongside her text image statement in a two-photo album post on Instagram.

At one point Vanessa's post had more than 9500 comments from users largely criticizing Nike under the impression that the shoes had been released. The comments have since been turned off and are no longer visible.

Bryant also posted a screenshot to her Instagram post of a user's comment specifying that Footpatrol London had shipped the wrong shoe to raffle-winning customers by accident. She called attention to the comment by circling it in pink and drawing a question mark next to it.

""I didn't win the Footpatrol raffle"" Lomas clarified to ESPN in a phone interview. ""Somebody won the Footpatrol raffle and I saw people posting about it in UK buying and selling groups. I paid £420 [around $600 USD] three weeks ago on my pair. I knew something wasn't right. Obviously when Gigi's name is on it and the fact that Vanessa owns all the trademarks for the logo on the back I thought something wasn't right. I thought 'I better buy a pair.'""

He confirmed the tag label on the Mamba Forever sneaker in his possession has a November 2020 production date. After acquiring his pair Lomas facilitated the purchase of another pair for a buyer in the US for $900. A former footwear retail worker himself he believes as many as two or three cases of the shoes were mistakenly sent to Footpatrol leading to a few dozen pairs now mistakenly in the hands of customers though not intended by Nike to be released.

With the shoes beginning to sparsely circulate online on sneaker marketplaces Milwaukee Bucks All-Star Khris Middleton acquired and wore a pair during the sweep-clinching Game 4 of the team's first-round series against the Miami Heat on May 29.

""I don't really understand why it was my image that has caused such absolute havoc"" said Lomas also bringing up the under-the-radar sighting on Middleton. ""I scrolled down Instagram and I saw my right hand in seven out of 15 posts [in a row.]""

A huge NBA fan Lomas has collected Kobe Bryant sneakers for several years and traveled to the U.S. to attend NBA games in person even catching a Lakers game in Brooklyn toward the end of Bryant's career. His brother's son was named Kobe in 2019 as a tribute to the Lakers star.

Upon seeing Vanessa's post in which she mentions not yet receiving the shoes herself Lomas said he directly messaged her and offered to send his pair though she has not responded.

""I just wanted people to know they were out there. I did feel sorry for Vanessa"" he said. ""I'd happily send my pair to her.""

Since May 14 51 pairs of the Mamba Forever colorway have been sold on sneaker resell marketplace StockX with prices initially hovering around $1000 and immediately spiking after Vanessa Bryant's post on June 3. A size 10 pair sold recently for $3300.

As of Friday afternoon there were 26 pairs listed in sizes 8-13 ranging in price from $7500 to $15000. Some pairs were listed for as much as $141274 and $100000.

Shortly before 8 p.m. ET on Friday StockX removed all listings of the sneakers.

Marketplace app GOAT does not have any listings of the shoes restricting users from creating a sell page for that specific colorway though dozens of other Kobe 6 colorways have active listings. EBay is actively removing listings of just the Mamba Forever colorway.

As it stands according to brand sources there are no plans to officially release the Mamba Forever colorway of the Kobe 6. Though thousands of pairs have already been produced the shoes are indefinitely on hold and will release only if a new contract agreement is reached with the Kobe Bryant Estate.

LOS ANGELES (CNS) -- Vanessa Bryant lashed out on social media last week over the apparent release of a shoe she designed in honor of her late daughter Gianna but never approved for sale or release.

On her Instagram page Vanessa Bryant posted a photo of someone holding one of the shoes which even she doesn't have.

LA County says Vanessa Bryant lacks basis to sue deputies over crash photos

Los Angeles County attorneys contend Vanessa Bryant has no legal basis to sue four sheriff's deputies alleged to have shared unauthorized photos taken at the site of the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant his daughter and seven others according to court papers.

There was no immediate response to City News Service for a request for comment from Nike.

Bryant asked for help determining how anyone was able to obtain the shoes saying ""... that would be great because my daughters and I don't have any of Gigi's Mambacita shoes.''

Another post she shared included a tweet suggesting that a retailer called Foot Patrol in the United Kingdom had ""released a few pairs early by accident.''

Jun 5th 2021

Brooks Koepka isn't playing the Memorial. It just sounded like it at times and his nemesis Bryson DeChambeau wasn't pleased.

From the tee or from the fairway DeChambeau would hit a shot only to hear someone in the crowd scream out ""Let's go Brooksy!""

It was a not-so-subtle reminder of the beef between the two big hitters in golf that began brewing nearly two years ago and reached an extraordinary level after the PGA Championship with leaked video footage just over a week ago.

The short segment which was never aired showed Koepka doing an interview with Golf Channel when DeChambeau walks behind him the sound of his spikes on the pavement.

DeChambeau also murmured a sledge as he walked past Koepka saying: ""Just gotta start it on the right line.""

Koepka rolled his eyes and said he lost his train of thought ""hearing that bulls--t.""

The interview began anew but that clip made its way onto Twitter. So began a back-and-forth that included DeChambeau tweeting that ""it's nice to be living rent free in your head.""

Or maybe not.

The security detail following the group of DeChambeau Jordan Spieth and Patrick Cantlay removed at least two groups of spectators from the tournament on Friday for referring to DeChambeau as ""Brooksy.""

DeChambeau who played 33 holes Friday in the rain-delayed tournament and had rounds of 71-72 claimed he didn't mind at least once the round was over.

""Oh they weren't taunts at all. It was flattering"" he said.

""I think it's absolutely flattering what they're doing. They can keep calling me that all day if they want to. I've got no issue with it.""

However it emerged that the 'Brooksy' sledge did seem to bother DeChambeau at the PGA Championship too.

Koepka kept up with the needle posting a video on Twitter after the round offering cases of Michelob Ultra (one of his sponsors) to the first 50 people who might have had a ""short day"" at the Memorial from being thrown out.

""What's up guys! It's Brooksy"" he says.

""Hey thank you guys for the support. I heard a bunch of you were shouting my name at the golf tournament today. I know I'm not playing but thank you guys for showing support.""

Koepka and DeChambeau first mixed it up at The Northern Trust two years ago when Koepka was among those criticizing DeChambeau for his pace of play.

They traded jabs when Koepka was part of the ""Body Issue"" for ESPN The Magazine. DeChambeau joked that Koepka had no abs and Koepka replied he was ""two short of a six-pack"" offering a photo of his four major championship trophies.

Koepka also posted a steroid rage video after DeChambeau who had added 40 pounds of muscle and mass through an intense regimen during the pandemic yelled at a cameraman during the Rocket Mortgage Classic.

""I've got nothing against him. I've got no issues at all"" DeChambeau said.

""If he wants to play that game that's great. I'm going to keep trying to play my best game and when it comes down to it when somebody's that bothered by someone else it is flattering.""

Spieth seemed amused by the the eight hours they spent on the course Friday suggesting there were as many references to ""Brooks"" as ""Bryson"" depending on how the hole was played.

""He mentioned it to me at one point and I said 'All anyone wants is a reaction and you give it to them then ... it's going to get worse.' So it didn't seem to bother him"" Spieth said.

Rory McIlroy missed it — he was in the group behind them — but was loving the exchange.

""I sent Brooks a message when it all came out"" McIlroy said.

""I said 'I don't care what happens to me for the rest of this week this has made my week this is like the best thing ever.'

""I think it's good for guys to show personality and pretty sure whoever leaked it from the Golf Channel got in trouble"" McIlroy said.

""There's certainly people out here that don't like me I'm sure and there's a few people out here that I don't like.""

It was pointed out to McIlroy that no one is aware of such beefs.

""Yeah because I don't want it aired"" he said with a smile.

""That's life.""

For the second time this year United Launch Alliance (ULA) has announced a delay to the joint U.S. Space Force/Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Test Program (STP)-3 mixed-manifest research and technology mission scheduled to fly atop the most powerful variant of its Atlas V booster out of Space Launch Complex (SLC)-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Fla. In a blog update posted Friday afternoon the Centennial Colo.-headquartered organization explained that the cause of the delay was “to evaluate launch vehicle readiness” following anomalous observed behavior of the Centaur upper stage’s RL-10C engine during last month’s SBIRS GEO-5 launch.

A new target date for the mission—previously set to fly on 23 June—has yet to be revealed with ULA noting only that it is “working with our customer” to determine a new launch opportunity. However tweeted comments from ULA CEO Tory Bruno seemed to preclude the risk of an “indefinite” delay and the targeted 30 July launch of another Atlas V with the second Orbital Flight Test (OFT-2) of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner to the International Space Station (ISS) appears unaffected by the anomaly.

The mission was originally targeted for late February which would have made it ULA’s first flight of 2021. Its presence atop an Atlas V in its “551” configuration—the most powerful variant of the rocket equipped with a 17-foot-diameter (5-meter) payload fairing five strap-on boosters and a single-engine Centaur upper stage—offered an indicator of the size mass and complex orbital requirements of this mixed-manifest payload.

Capable of lifting up to 41000 pounds (18800 kg) to low-Earth orbit and up to 19600 pounds (8900 kg) to Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) the 551 has been used 11 times between January 2006 and March 2020 including the launches of NASA’s New Horizons to explore the Pluto/Charon system and Juno to Jupiter.

Contracts worth $191 million to launch STP-3 were awarded to ULA back in June 2017 under the Air Force’s Phase 1A procurement strategy with initial expectations that the mission would fly within the June-August 2019 timeframe although it met with significant delay. The payload’s primary space vehicle is STPSat-6 the design and integration contracts for which were awarded to Orbital Sciences Corp. (now Northrop Grumman Corp.) in February 2017.

Based upon the A500 satellite “bus” the geostationary-bound STPSat-6 will house a total of nine payloads for the Department of Defense the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and NASA to “operationally demonstrate advanced communication capabilities collect space weather data and support nuclear detonation detection in the Earth’s atmosphere or in near space”.

Leading this suite of payloads is the NNSA’s third Space and Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS)-3 built by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in Los Alamos N.M. which is part of an ongoing effort to replace neutron gamma-ray and particle detectors flown aboard Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites from the 1970s through the 1990s. It augments the optical radio frequency X-ray and particle sensors of the Global Burst Detector (GBD) payload aboard Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.

Also aboard STPSat-6 is the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD) built by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt Md. which provides an end-to-end optical relay capable of sending and receiving data from orbiting spacecraft to ground control stations.

“This evolution to more internet-like communications will reduce the amount of processing required before data can be sent to science and mission operations centers” NASA previously reported. “LCRD will demonstrate the robust capabilities of optical communications.” Specific benefits from optical communications systems include lower sizes masses and power requirements and bandwidths 10-100 times greater than traditional radio frequency systems.

Seven additional experiments from the Department of Defense’s Space Experiments Review Board are also assigned to fly STPSat-6. One of them is thought to be the NNSA’s Space and Endo-Atmospheric NuDet Surveillance Experiment (SENSER) which seeks to reduce the developmental risks for future Nuclear Detection sensors by testing and evaluating critical technologies in the space environment ahead of production and integration into next-generation systems.

However delays with STPSat-6 prompted the first postponement of the mission. In March ULA revealed that a delay had been effected “to enable the customer to evaluate the launch readiness of the spacecraft”.

Finally early last month STPSat-6 was delivered from Northrop Grumman’s Dulles Va. facility to Astrotech Space Operations in Titusville Fla. for pre-launch processing. By this time the Atlas V hardware for the mission—the Common Core Booster (CCB) and the Centaur—had also arrived on the Space Coast and were being put through their own checks ahead of stacking. Northrop Grumman announced on 12 May that its five GEM-63 solid-fueled boosters each measuring 66 feet (20 meters) in length and 5.5 feet (1.6 meters) in diameter were also in transit to the launch site.

The second element of the STP-3 payload is the Space Force’s Long Duration Propulsion ESPA (LDPE)-1 also built by Northrop Grumman. The LDPE-1 payload—reportedly now redesignated Rapid On-Orbit Space Technology and Evaluation Ring (ROOSTER)-1—is the first of a series of experimental spacecraft designed to accommodate small experiments and facilitate the deployment of small satellites.

Its design is based on Northrop Grumman’s ESPAStar platform which utilizes a modified Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) “ring” and supports a modular capability for hosting technology development and operational payloads.

The ESPAStar concept provides power pointing telemetry and command-and-control functionality. The LDPE-1/ROOSER-1 payload was delivered from Northrop Grumman’s Gilbert Ariz. facility to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in December 2020 and reportedly marks a step closer “to advancing rideshare capabilities”.

Friday’s announcement of yet another delay to the STP-3 mission is apparently tied to anomalous behavior seen in the Centaur’s RL-10C engine during last month’s mission to deliver the latest geostationary Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS GEO-5) aloft. “Those watching the live feed may have noticed some “ringing” of RL-10’s new carbon nozzle extension” tweeted ULA CEO Tory Bruno.

“While it did its job boosting RL-10’s eye-watering performance even a bit higher we want to make sure we fully understand that behavior before flying this configuration again.”

In terms of how this might impact the launch dates for successive Atlas V/Centaur missions—including the long-delayed second Orbital Flight Test (OFT-2) of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner to the International Space Station (ISS) currently targeted for 30 July—Mr. Bruno offered a more positive update. “OFT-2 does not have the SBIRS-5 configuration of RL-10” he tweeted in response to a question from Ars Technica‘s Eric Berger. “STP-3 is not indefinitely delayed. We have a structured process for manifest changes. Underway. New schedule shortly.”

That’s because it is ugly like the namesake animal but clearly more aggressive than one. And the degree of fright it is capable of projecting on enemy minds is multiplied when these things fly in formation.

The Warthog was born in the hands of a company that is no longer around on its own but part of Northrop Grumman. It was called Fairchild Republic and it came up with the aircraft all the way back in 1972.For all intents and purposes the A-10 is the single aircraft specifically developed with the goal of being an incredible support for troops on the ground in times of need. Its main weapon is the mighty GAU-8/A Avenger a hydraulically driven seven-barrel Gatling gun that can shred enemies to pieces.The Avenger can effectively fire rounds from an altitude of 4000 feet (1200 meters) and the precision is astounding: about 80 percent of these rounds can hit an area just 40 feet (12 meters) in diameter from that altitude.The Warthog packs more than just the Avenger though. It can be equipped with 16000 pounds (7.2 metric tons) of bombs missiles countermeasure flares and jammer pods.The aircraft can fly thanks to its twin General electric turbofan engines at an altitude of 45000 feet (13636 meters) and for up to 800 miles (1287 km) at speeds of 420 mph (676 kph).The video attached below published at the end of May by Combat War Footage shows a pack of three Warthogs flying in formation. We see only two of them as the pilots of the third are the ones shooting the footage but they're enough to give us goosebumps.We are not being provided with any info on when the video was shot or what unit these airplanes belong to but that doesn’t make the clip any less spectacular.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdWtkZWZlbmNlam91cm5hbC5vcmcudWsvYWlyYnVzLWRlbGl2ZXJzLTEwMHRoLWE0MDBtLWFpcmxpZnRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbus delivers 100th A400M airlifter,"Airbus has reached 100 A400M deliveries with aircraft MSN111 the tenth A400M for the Spanish Air Force.

Here's How & What to Expect,"Wanted: Volunteers to take a cruise eat have a great time enjoy the ship and not pay a dime.

The catch? You have to be willing to test an entirely new cruise experience. Cruise lines will need to sail simulated “test” cruises for new protocols before they return as part of the framework put in place by the CDC.

For many the chance to sail aboard a ship before they return to sailing for the general public — and to enjoy taking a cruise for free — is too good to pass up. But not everyone will be eligible and the experience will be different than you might be used to.

One thing to note: Since this article was first published in November 2020 the CDC has announced new rules that allow cruise lines to skip volunteer cruises if passengers/crew are fully vaccinated. In addition they’ve shared exhaustive “technical instructions” that detail everything cruise lines must do for these sailings.

Given that it will be much simpler (and faster) for cruise lines to simply require vaccinations some lines have said they won’t sail these test cruises. Others plan to go ahead with the trips.

Here’s a good idea of what to expect and what’s required.

Path to Return: Simulated Voyages

With the end of the CDC’s “No Sail Order” the agency isn’t just giving cruises the green light to get back to sailing. Instead the order has been replaced with a “Framework for Conditional Sailing.”

This framework lays out criteria that cruise lines must follow if they want to get back to sailing with paying passengers. While there are a number of steps one of them is that cruise lines must take part in “simulated voyages.”

These trips are exactly what they sound like — test cruises. With the new way of cruising dozens of changes are taking place to the cruise experience. Everything from check-in to hanging out by the pool to having dinner in the buffet is changing.

With so many changes — and the potential risks if someone does get sick — the CDC wants cruise lines to practice what life will be like on the ship and even in the terminal. This gives everyone including the authorities cruise lines and crew a chance to get things right instead of using the first paying passengers as guinea pigs.

According to the CDC instructions “at least one simulation must be conducted for each ship” that a cruise line wants to sail. In other words there is the potential for dozens of these cruises in the months ahead.

The rules surrounding the trips are complex. Technical instructions released by the CDC come in at more than 5600 words covering everything from which ships can sail one of these trips to who can sail on the cruise and even genetic sequencing of positive cases.

There is an easier path for cruise lines however. New rules allow cruise lines to skip the simulated voyages if 98% of crew and 95% of passengers are fully vaccinated.

Some lines — like Royal Caribbean — have mentioned two pathways to return. One group of ships that sails cruises with vaccinated passengers (and potentially returns faster) and another that sails with anyone and has to follow the simulated voyage path to return.

Who Is Eligible to Volunteer

Of course many people want to know if they can take one of these cruises as a volunteer. After all even with the risks cruise lines are implementing new procedures to lessen the chances of getting sick. According to the industry 400000-plus passengers have sailed since cruising resumed in some parts of the world with only about 50 cases found.

However not everyone is eligible to be a volunteer. The CDC lays out their criteria within the framework:

Volunteers Must Be 18 Years Old or Older

If you want to be a volunteer cruise passenger then you’ll need to be at least 18 years old per CDC rules. So families with kids won’t be allowed to sail. There is no upper age limit set out despite older people being more at risk of complications from the virus.

You Must Not Have Pre-Existing Conditions That Put You at Risk

As part of the criteria for being an eligible volunteer you also must not have conditions that will put you at risk if you do get sick. The CDC asks for either proof of being fully vaccinated or if not vaccinated “written documentation from a healthcare provider or self-certified statement” that a volunteer has no pre-existing conditions that put them at higher risk. So expect volunteers to be fit and healthy.

Employment or Compensation Isn’t Allowed

If you wanted to get paid for this sailing don’t expect it. The government says that the volunteers must sail on a “consensual basis.” Volunteer passengers can’t be compensated (outside of the free cruise) or allowed to sail as a condition of employment. In other words they are to be true volunteers not people that are paid to be there.

In addition all passengers must be willing to adhere to the CDC rules for the trip. This includes being checked for COVID before embarking and disembarking notifying staff if symptoms develop and being tested 3-5 days after the cruise.

What to Expect on These Volunteer Cruises

While the allure of getting to sail on a cruise as a volunteer is exciting what are passengers actually getting into? Here are some ideas of what to expect based on the instructions and guidance from the CDC:

A Trip Lasting 2-7 Days

The new technical instructions released by the CDC call for simulated voyages that last between 2-7 days with at least one overnight stay. But the CDC recommends a minimum voyage of at least three days and two nights. Given the cost and time it takes to sail one of these cruises we’re seeing that shorter trips are more common.

Far Fewer People on the Ship

Of course you’d expect that the first ships back sail with limited capacity. The cruise lines themselves have said as much. But the CDC requires only 10% of the maximum number of passengers permitted onboard per the agreements in place with ports.

So while a ship might hold 4000 passengers its port agreement might only allow it to sail at 60% capacity — 2400 passengers. If that’s the case then the simulated voyage needs a minimum of 240 passengers. If the agreement with the ports was for full capacity it would need at least 400 passengers in this example.

A Stern Warning Before Sailing

Before you even board expect to be reminded that there is a risk of cruising during this crisis. In fact the CDC points to a study that the reproduction rate onboard Diamond Princess (the ship that was held in Japan and had more than 700 passengers and crew test positive) of 14.8 before quarantine was enacted. That means for each infected person it was spread to almost 15 others. This figure is about four times higher than what was seen in Wuhan China at the start of the outbreak.

For that reason the CDC requires cruise lines to notify passengers in writing that they are taking part in a simulation of “unproven and untested” health and safety protocols in the United States and that sailing during a pandemic is an “inherently risky activity.”

The Cruise Should Feature Activities Seen on a Normal Trip (And Some Not-So-Normal)

The entire point of the simulated voyage is to test the new procedures in a real-world environment. For that reason the trip is required to have many of the same components seen on a normal cruise.

On the simulated voyage cruise lines must test embarkation and debarkation procedures including checking-in at the terminal. On the ship they need to test dining policies and entertainment venue protocols. This includes how to serve food safely and ensuring social distancing in places like theaters and casinos. The trip will also feature modified private island excursions.

In addition the CDC says cruise lines need to test some things you hope to not see on a normal cruise including evacuation procedures isolating of infected passengers and quarantining of other passengers and crew.

Testing At Embarkation and Debarkation

As part of the new framework the government is requiring cruise lines to make testing a major part of the return to sailing. On a normal cruise tests are to be conducted on passengers on embarkation day before they board the ship and on debarkation day before returning home (if unvaccinated). This will also be required on the volunteer cruises.

Facemasks Handwashing and Social Distancing

Many of the same policies that are in place on land are set to be on the simulated voyage with volunteers. The rules laid out by the CDC call for meeting standards of “hand hygiene use of face masks and social distancing for passengers and crew.”

Many people have said they won’t cruise if facemasks are required as it lessens their enjoyment of a vacation. If you want to sail a volunteer cruise — or be a paying passenger when cruises do return — expect them to be a requirement around the ship.

When Will Simulated Voyages Start?

At this point it’s still not clear when the simulated voyages will begin for all ships but a number of volunteer cruises are now scheduled. The CDC has issued instructions that allow cruises to move forward but the hurdles to complete the trip are still onerous.

Meanwhile modifications of the rules allow lines to skip the test cruises altogether if 95% of passenger and 98% of crew are vaccinated. That would save cruise lines a considerable amount of time and some are opting for this path.

Royal Caribbean was the first to announce a test voyage sailing June 20 aboard Freedom of the Seas. In addition Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line Disney and other Royal Caribbean ships have all announced test cruises between late June and early August.

Here’s just a sample of what’s been announced:

Freedom of the Seas: June 20

Grand Classica: June 25

Disney Dream: June 29

Allure of the Seas: July 27

Symphony of the Seas: August 1

In addition more test cruises are reportedly approved but dates haven’t been announced just yet. We expect more cruise lines to announce trips in the coming days and weeks.

One exception? Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. CEO Frank Del Rio said his company wasn’t looking at the new instructions because they plan to sail with everyone vaccinated.

How to Become a Volunteer Cruise Passenger

So how do you get to be a volunteer on one of these cruises? That’s a question that’s still being answered. Remember this framework to return sailing is unprecedented. The details of how it will work are still being considered.

Royal Caribbean now has a form and Facebook page to submit your interest in being a volunteer cruise passenger. You can fill out the volunteer form here (just know that 250000 people have already done so) and find the “Volunteer of the Seas” Facebook page here.

As mentioned Norwegian Cruise Lines has said they don’t plan to sail test cruises since they will require the shot to board.

Carnival Cruise Line has not made mention that we’ve seen of when they will sail simulated voyages or how they will select passengers. However we would expect more information in the coming days or weeks.

Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line has offered up the most details. The small line is “selecting a private closed group of corporate employees along with a few other guests.”

At this point so much is still up in the air. It’s not even clear if there will be an open call for volunteers like Royal Caribbean has done if cruise lines will reach out to past guests or some other method of deciding who will have the opportunity to sail.

However volunteers are chosen expect the number of spots to be limited and in-demand. Multiple companies have cited strong demand for cruises whenever they do return and the chance to be a volunteer on one of the first trips back will be historic.

It seems likely that being flexible and living within driving distance of a major port would be beneficial if there is a call for volunteers. They could sail on short notice.

We plan to continue updating as we hear more from lines about how volunteers will be chosen.",,,,,,,,,,,,

NRG selected TRC as Owner’s Engineer and later as the prime contractor for decommissioning five peaker plant facilities for Cabrillo Power II LLC located in San Diego California. These five facilities are on San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) property and were leased to Cabrillo Power II LLC for use. Cabrillo Power II LLC decommissioned each site and terminated their lease agreements so that SDG&E could reuse their properties. The key challenge to the project was SDG&E and NRG’s desire to quickly complete the process to avoid lease extension issues.

Solution

For all five facilities TRC and Source California Energy Services conducted a drawing review of hundreds of SDG&E utility drawings. Based on this review and subsequent site visits TRC created drawings that showed underground utility locations and recommended decoupling points to be used during abatement and demolition activities. TRC included photographs at pertinent decoupling locations and detailed notes to make the drawings as comprehensive as possible. The drawings were utilized for a variety of reasons that included:

Use by subcontractor for demolition bid preparation purposes

Use during environmental regulated materials surveys

Use during monthly progress meetings with SDG&E

Use during abatement and demolition activities to verify utility locations

Ultimately revised to become “as-left” drawings given to SDG&E within a turnover lease termination package TRC was awarded the contract to work with IDR the selected demolition firm to oversee the remaining work.

Results

TRC provided turnkey services to complete the demolition process aiding the client in avoiding lease extension issues. Ultimately TRC led its team to perform:

Regulated materials surveys and removal oversight

Dismantling and removal of eleven gas turbines

Demolition of over 45000 gallons of above ground storage tanks (AST) reverse osmosis (RO) tanks RO skids piping and associated appurtenances

Removal of all foundations

Removal of all underground utilities related to the facility

Soil excavation pursuant to local and state agency oversight

SWPPP preparation and inspections

Site grading permitting oversight and restoration

With more memory and significantly enhanced processing they promise to make light work of demanding real-time ray tracing GPU rendering and VR workflows.

In February 2021 we reviewed the Nvidia RTX A6000 the first pro desktop GPU to be based on Nvidia’s ‘Ampere’ architecture. With 48 GB of memory and buckets of processing power the dual slot 300W graphics card is designed for the most demanding visualisation workflows – think city-scale digital twins or complex product visualisations using very hi-fidelity textures such as those captured from real-life scans.

Of course the Nvidia RTX A6000 is complete overkill for most architects or product designers who simply want a capable GPU for real-time visualisation GPU rendering or VR. And it’s here that the new Nvidia RTX A4000 and Nvidia RTX A5000 come into play.

Announced at Nvidia’s GTC event this year the PCIe Gen 4 ‘Ampere’ Nvidia RTX A4000 and Nvidia RTX A5000 are the replacements for the PCIe Gen 3 ‘Turing’ Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000 and Quadro RTX 5000 which launched in 2019.

UPDATE: 25 March 2022. Nvidia recently launched the Nvidia RTX A4500 and RTX A5500 to held boost supply of its high-end pro workstation GPUs. Read our review of the Nvidia RTX A4500

The RTX A4000 and A5000 are mid-range ‘Quadro’ GPUs in everything but name. Nvidia’s long-serving Quadro workstation brand might be being retired but the features remain the same.

Both cards offer more memory than their consumer GeForce counterparts are standard issue in workstations from Dell HP and Lenovo and come with pro drivers with ISV certification for a wide range of CAD/BIM applications.

And with an estimated street price of $1000 for the Nvidia RTX A4000 and $2250 for the Nvidia RTX A5000 they have much more palatable price tags than the Nvidia RTX A6000 which comes in at $4650.

Nvidia RTX A4000 (16 GB)

With 16 GB of GDDR6 ECC memory the Nvidia RTX A4000 offers a big step up from the 8 GB Quadro RTX 4000. 8 GB is fine for mainstream viz workflows but for more complex projects it can be limiting so delivering 16 GB in a sub $1000 pro GPU is a big step forward. Previously 16 GB was only available on the ‘Turing’-based Quadro RTX 5000.

As you’d expect from Nvidia’s new ‘Ampere’ architecture the Nvidia RTX A4000 also offers a significant improvement in processing. This can be seen in all areas of the GPU with more CUDA cores for general processing third-generation Tensor Cores for AI operations and second-generation RT Cores for hardware-based ray tracing. It leads to a substantial performance increase in many different applications (see later on).

Furthermore as the Nvidia RTX A4000 is a single slot GPU with a max power consumption of 140W delivered through a single 6-pin PCIe connector it’s available in a wide range of desktop workstation form factors. This includes compact towers like the HP Z2 Tower G8 and Dell Precision 3650.

The board features four DisplayPort 1.4a ports and can drive up to four displays at 5K resolution. It is cooled by a single ‘blower’ type fan which draws in cool air from the top and bottom of the card pushes it through a radiator and then directly out of the rear of the workstation chassis. This is in contrast to most consumer GeForce GPUs which use axial fans that recirculate air inside the machine.

There are pros and cons to each design but a blower fan does mean you can stack cards within the chassis without having to leave space between them. This means you can get a very good density of GPUs inside a mid-sized chassis.

With the AMD Threadripper Pro-based Lenovo ThinkStation P620 for example you could get four Nvidia RTX A4000s back-to-back which could be a very interesting proposition for GPU rendering. Even though the RTX A4000 doesn’t support NVlink (so there’s no pooling of GPU memory) 16 GB is still a good amount and two three or four RTX A4000s could work out well in terms of price/performance compared to the more powerful RTX A5000 or A6000.

Another potential use case for high-density multi-GPU is workstation virtualisation using GPU passthrough where each user gets a dedicated GPU. Again this workflow looks well suited to the Lenovo ThinkStation P620 which can be configured with up to 64 CPU cores and 2TB of memory.

Other more niche pro viz features include support for 3D Stereo Nvidia Mosaic for professional multi-display solutions and Quadro Sync II an add-in card that can synchronise the display and image output from multiple GPUs within a single system or across a cluster of systems.

Nvidia RTX A5000 (24 GB)

With 24 GB of GDDR6 ECC memory the Nvidia RTX A5000 offers only a 50% memory uplift compared to the Quadro RTX 5000 it replaces.

Like the Nvidia RTX A4000 it offers a significant upgrade in all areas of processing – CUDA Tensor and RT cores.

It’s a double height board with a max power consumption of 230W which it draws from the PSU via an 8-pin PCIe connector but it’s still available in compact towers.

The board also features four DisplayPort 1.4a ports and is cooled by a single ‘blower’ type fan but only draws in cool air from one side of the card.

The Nvidia RTX A5000 supports all the same features as the Nvidia RTX A4000 but differs in two main areas.

One it supports Nvidia NVLink so GPU memory can be expanded to 48 GB by connecting two 24 GB GPUs together.

Two it supports Nvidia RTX vWS (virtual workstation software) so it can deliver multiple high-performance virtual workstation instances that enable remote users to share resources. In the Lenovo ThinkStation P620 for example you could get a very high density of CAD/BIM users who only need high-end RTX performance from time to time.

Testing the Nvidia RTX A4000 / RTX A5000

We put the Nvidia RTX A4000 and Nvidia RTX A5000 through a series of real-world application benchmarks for GPU rendering real-time visualisation and 3D CAD.

All tests were carried out using the AMD Ryzen-based Scan 3XS GWP-ME A132R workstation at 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution using the latest 462.59 Nvidia driver.

The full spec can be seen below. We’ll be posting a full review soon.

For comparison we used the last two generations of ‘4000’ class Nvidia pro GPUs – the 8 GB ‘Turing’ Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000 (from 2019) and the 8 GB ‘Pascal’ Nvidia Quadro P4000 (from 2017). Three to four years is quite a typical upgrade cycle in workstations so the intention here is to give a good idea of the performance increase one might expect from an older machine.

We also threw some Nvidia RTX A6000 scores in there. These were done on two different workstations with a 32-core Threadripper Pro 3970X and a quad core Intel Xeon W-2125 CPU. While both CPUs have lower frequencies and instructions per clock (IPC) the results should still give a pretty good idea of comparative performance especially in GPU rendering software.

Hardware-based ray tracing with the Nvidia RTX A4000 / A5000

It’s been just over two years since Nvidia introduced ‘Turing’ Nvidia Quadro RTX its first pro GPUs with RTX hardware ray tracing.

In a classic chicken and egg launch there were very few RTX-enabled applications back then but this has now changed. For design viz there’s Chaos V-Ray Chaos Vantage Enscape Unreal Engine Unity D5 render Nvidia Omniverse Autodesk VRED KeyShot Siemens NX Ray Traced Studio Solidworks Visualize Catia Live rendering and others.

Nvidia RTX gave GPU rendering a massive kick start and while there is increased competition from hugely powerful CPUs like the 64-core AMD Threadripper [Pro] we are seeing deeper penetration of GPU rendering tools especially in architect / engineer / product designer friendly workflows.

Nvidia RTX is being used to massively accelerate classic viz focused ray trace renderers like V-Ray KeyShot and Solidworks Visualize which we test below. However some of the more exciting developments are coming from the AEC sector in tools like Enscape Chaos Vantage and Unreal Engine which really make ray tracing ‘real-time’. Vantage for example is built from the ground up for real-time ray tracing so can maximise the usage of RT cores within the new GPUs.

Chaos Group V-Ray

V-Ray is one of the most popular physically based rendering tools especially in architectural visualisation. We put the new cards through their paces using the freely downloadable V-Ray 5 benchmark which has dedicated tests for Nvidia CUDA GPUs Nvidia RTX GPUs as well as CPUs.

The results were impressive. In the CUDA test the Nvidia RTX A4000 was 1.62 times faster than the previous generation Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000 and in the RTX test 1.70 times faster. The lead over the Pascal-based Quadro P4000 was nothing short of colossal – 3.53 times faster in the CUDA test. As the P4000 does not have dedicated RT cores it could not run the RTX test.

Stepping up to the Nvidia RTX A5000 will give you an additional boost. Compared to the Nvidia RTX A4000 it was between 1.27 and 1.37 times faster.

Interestingly the RTX A5000 was not that far behind the RTX A6000 which costs more than twice as much.

Luxion Keyshot

KeyShot a CPU rendering stalwart is a relative newcomer to the world of GPU rendering. But it’s one of the slickest implementations we’ve seen allowing users to switch between CPU and GPU rendering at the click of a button.

In the Keyshot 10 benchmark part of the free KeyShot Viewer the performance leap was even more substantial than in V-Ray. The Nvidia RTX A4000 and Nvidia RTX A5000 outperformed the Quadro RTX 4000 by a factor of 1.89 and 2.51 respectively. And the RTX A5000 was only 20% slower than the RTX A6000.

DS Solidworks Visualize 2021 SP3

The name of this GPU-accelerated physically based renderer is a bit misleading as it works with many more applications than the CAD application of the same name. It can import models from Creo Solid Edge Catia and Inventor as well as several neutral formats.

Since the 2020 release the software has supported Nvidia RT cores and Tensor cores to improve rendering performance with Nvidia RTX GPUs. Users can choose to render scenes with or without denoising enabled.

Denoising is a post-processing technique based on machine learning that filters out noise from unfinished / noisy images and is the foundation for many RTX-accelerated applications. It means you can get better looking renders with significantly fewer rendering passes.

DS Solidworks reckons that if a scene routinely needs 500 passes without the denoiser then you may be able to achieve the same rendering quality with 50 passes with the denoiser enabled.

We tested the stock 1969 Camaro car model at 4K resolution with 1000 passes (denoising disabled) and 100 passes (denoising enabled) set to accurate quality. Both settings produced excellent visual results.

The RTX A4000 and RTX A5000 delivered the 100-pass render in 22 seconds and 14 seconds respectively. This isn’t the most complex scene but being able to render at such speeds is quite incredible and can have a profound impact on workflows. In comparison it took the Quadro P4000 GPU 105 seconds so you can see just how far things have progressed in four years.

Real time 3D with the Nvidia RTX A4000 / A5000

While GPU rendering is a major play for the Nvidia RTX A4000 and Nvidia RTX A5000 real-time 3D using OpenGL DirectX and (in the future) Vulkan continues to be a very important part of architectural visualisation with applications including TwinMotion Lumion Enscape Unreal Engine LumenRT and others.

Of course the boundaries between real-time 3D and ray tracing continue to blur. In fact out of the list above only Lumion and Twinmotion are yet to support RTX although it should be coming to Twinmotion soon.

To test frame rates we used a combination of monitoring software including FRAPS Xbox Game Bar and MSI Afterburner. We only tested at 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution. At FHD (1920 x 1080) resolution this class of GPU simply isn’t stressed enough.

Enscape 2.6

Enscape is a real-time viz and VR tool for architects that uses OpenGL and delivers very high-quality graphics in the viewport. Enscape has used elements of ray tracing in its software for some time. Version 3.0 is RTX-enabled so full ray tracing can be toggled on and off. Later versions will use the more modern Vulkan API and support ray tracing on both Nvidia and AMD GPUs.

For our tests we used a large architectural scene of a museum and its surrounding area in Enscape 2.6 (non RTX). At 7.5GB the GPU memory requirements of this model are relatively high but Enscape models can be much larger.

In terms of performance the Nvidia RTX A4000 and A5000 delivered a very smooth experience with 30 and 40 FPS respectively. This is around twice as fast as the Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000 and three to four times faster than the Nvidia Quadro P4000.

Autodesk VRED Professional 2022



Autodesk VRED Professional is an automotive-focused 3D visualisation virtual prototyping and VR tool. It uses OpenGL and delivers very high-quality visuals in the viewport. It offers several levels of real-time anti-aliasing (AA) which is important for automotive styling as it smooths the edges of body panels. However AA calculations use a lot of GPU resources both in terms of processing and memory. We tested our automotive model with AA set to ‘off’ and ‘ultra-high’.

Considering that this pro viz application used to only really run effectively on Nvidia’s ultra-high-end professional GPUs it’s quite astounding that the Nvidia RTX A4000 – a sub $1000 card – delivered over 30 FPS at 4K resolution with medium anti-aliasing. In saying that those really pushing the boundaries of automotive visualisation will still likely need the top-end Nvidia RTX A6000 especially for high-res VR workflows.

Unreal Engine 4.26



Over the past few years Unreal Engine has established itself as a very prominent tool for design viz especially in architecture and automotive. It was one of the first applications to use GPU-accelerated real-time ray tracing which it does through Microsoft DirectX Ray tracing (DXR).

We used two datasets for testing both freely available from Epic Games: an arch viz interior of a small apartment and the Automotive Configurator which features an Audi A5 convertible. Both scenes were tested with ray tracing enabled (DirectX Ray tracing (DXR)) and without (DirectX 12 rasterisation).

The results were pretty much as expected with good scaling between all the GPUs with DirectX 12 rasterization. With real-time ray tracing enabled performance naturally takes a hit in general but the Quadro P4000 really suffers without any RT cores.

VRMark



We also tested with VRMark a dedicated Virtual Reality benchmark that uses both DirectX 11 and DirectX 12. It’s biased towards 3D games so not perfect for our needs but should give a good indication of the performance one might expect in ‘game engine’ viz tools.

CAD and BIM with the Nvidia RTX A4000 / A5000

Most 3D CAD and BIM tools tend to be CPU limited so performance is largely bottlenecked by the frequency (GHz) of the CPU. As a result the Nvidia RTX A4000 and Nvidia RTX A5000 are really overkill for most CAD and BIM applications. They are unlikely to give you significantly better 3D performance than more mainstream GPUs like the Nvidia Quadro P1000 or P2200.

However CAD applications are changing and in the future should be able to make much better use of the plentiful power of higher-end GPUs like the RTX A4000 and A5000. Both Autodesk with its new One Graphics System and Dassault Systèmes are currently working on new graphics engines that use more modern graphics APIs like Vulkan. This should not only improve general 3D performance but will make real-time ray tracing available directly in the viewport. So while the RTX A4000 / A5000 might not give notable performance benefits in CAD right now they could certainly do so in the future.

In addition it is important to note that both GPUs will be certified for a wide range of pro CAD / BIM applications which is important for some firms. This is especially true for enterprises that buy 100s or 1000s of workstations from large OEMs like HP Dell and Lenovo and want assurance that the GPUs will be stable and that they will be properly supported by the software developer.

Certification is a major reason why some firms choose Nvidia’s pro-focused RTX GPUs over their ‘consumer GeForce’ counterparts so they can confidently use applications like Revit Solidworks PTC Creo and Siemens NX alongside more viz-focused tools like Chaos V-Ray Enscape Luxion KeyShot and Solidworks Visualize.

Solidworks 2021



While most CAD applications won’t benefit from any GPU more powerful that the Nvidia Quadro P1000 or P2200 Solidworks 2021 is an exception. By using OpenGL 4.5 a more modern version of the popular graphics API more algorithms can be pushed onto the GPU so there is a benefit to higher performance GPUs.

Even so the application is still CPU limited to some extent so the performance benefit the new cards give you isn’t as big as you’d get from a dedicated real-time viz tool.

Like most CAD tools the most popular way to view models in Solidworks is in shaded with edges mode. Using the SPECapc for SolidWorks 2021 benchmark we saw a small improvement generation on generation with this display style. The Nvidia RTX A4000 was 1.10 times faster than the Quadro RTX 4000 and 1.44 times faster than the ‘Pascal’ Quadro P4000.

Solidworks also features more realistic display styles for viewing models in real time. SolidWorks RealView which is only supported by pro GPUs adds realistic materials and supports environment reflections and floor shadows. Meanwhile ambient occlusion adds more realistic shadows and helps bring out details.

Both viewing styles are more GPU-intensive so performance is less limited by the frequency of the CPU. In our tests we saw a bigger benefit over older GPUs. With RealView Shadows and Ambient Occlusion enabled the Nvidia RTX A4000 was 1.16 times faster than the Quadro RTX 4000 and 1.57 times faster than the Quadro P4000.

We were unable to test the Nvidia RTX A5000 as Solidworks 2021 SP3 did not recognise the card. We expect this to be fixed in SP4 out soon.

Conclusion

With the new Nvidia RTX A4000 and A5000 Nvidia has made its ‘Ampere’ GPU architecture much more accessible to a wider audience. In particular we see the sub $1000 Nvidia RTX A4000 hitting the sweet spot for designers engineers or architects that want a pro viz capability in their workflow.

The performance leap from ‘Turing’ to ‘Ampere’ (Quadro RTX 4000 to RTX A4000) is nothing short of impressive. In real-time 3D a 45% to 60% boost generation on generation seems typical with even bigger gains from real-time ray tracing when the enhanced RT and Tensor cores come into play. The step up from the four-year old ‘Pascal’ Quadro P4000 is simply phenomenal especially for GPU rendering.

Equipping the RTX A4000 with 16 GB of memory is very significant. While we often see models / scenes that surpass 8 GB (the capacity of the previous generation Quadro RTX 4000) scenes that are 16 GB and above are certainly less common and more the preserve of viz specialists than most architects or product designers who use standard materials and assets.

As we wait for AMD to deliver a Pro version of its ‘Big Navi’ Radeon RX 6000 series GPUs with hardware ray tracing Nvidia’s biggest competitor in pro graphics is currently itself.

The new 12 GB ‘consumer’ GeForce RTX 3080 Ti for example might have half the memory of the Nvidia RTX A5000 but offers more performance on paper for half the price. Nvidia even has a GeForce Studio driver for applications including Enscape Unreal Engine and V-Ray.

Despite the obvious attraction of Nvidia’s consumer GPUs Nvidia’s ‘A’ class models should continue to find favour in large firms and enterprises that buy in volume want more memory consistent supply pro viz features or the assurance of certification. There’s also the question of supply. As the global chip shortage continues to bite Nvidia may well prioritise manufacture of its higher-margin pro GPUs making GeForce even harder to get hold of.

Nvidia still has some work to do to flesh out its Ampere family. While mobile workstations already have entry-level RTX A2000 and A3000 GPUs there’s no equivalent for desktops.

The AEC industry would certainly welcome a sub $500 pro RTX GPU to replace the Pascal-based Quadro P2200 which is now long in the tooth. In years gone by we would have expected to see a desktop RTX A2000 before the end of 2021 but with ongoing supply challenges and high demand things are very hard to predict right now.

However Nvidia is also keen to stress how good this new GPU is at creative tasks as well so we decided to give it a spin to see if it’s a GPU that’s worth buying for creatives.

In the past if you did creative work that required a graphics card you’d often have to rely on professional GPUs such as Nvidia’s Quadro range. These are extremely expensive and for many people overkill.

The good news is that as gaming GPUs have improved over the years their abilities to handle creative tasks has also improved. In fact Nvidia has done a sterling job in this regard thanks to its Studio drivers. While its Game Ready Drivers for its GPUs focus on gaming features and performance its Studio drivers focus on creative and professional applications.

This means that while at $1199 / £1049 / AU$1949 the RTX 3080 Ti is a very expensive gaming GPU for creative professionals it’s actually a much more affordable investment than a Quadro or Titan GPU. The RTX Titan Nvidia’s previous generation card that straddled gaming and creative workloads cost a whopping $2499 (around £1800 / AU$3200) and the Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 costs $6299 (around £4400 / AU$8000).

When it comes to specs the Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti certainly seems capable of handling most creative tasks outside of seriously heavy-duty workloads from the likes of animation studios.

It has 12GB of GDDR6X memory an increase of 20% over the RTX 3080 though half the amount of the (more expensive) RTX 3090. The extra memory will be useful for animators working with high-resolution textures for example. This could drastically cut down the time it takes to render scenes again making the RTX 3080 Ti a tempting prospect for creatives.

Taking advantage of Artificial Intelligence

One of the biggest benefits of this new generation of Ampere graphics cards according to Nvidia is its AI capabilities. Far from being something used by enterprises or some far-off Sci-Fi gimmick artificial intelligence is now used in several major creative applications bringing features that were once thought impossible to the apps while automating what were once time-consuming manual tasks.

For example in the popular DaVinci Resolve application the Magic Mask tool uses the AI capabilities of the graphics card to automatically mask people and items in a video. This is a process that would have once taken a long time to do manually especially if there’s a lot of movement in the video but the tool works impressively well with the RTX 3080 Ti.

As with any creative workflow the faster you can complete a project the faster you can move on to a new one. This could have a big impact on the amount of work you can take on meaning the RTX 3080 Ti could indeed be a very wise investment.

One of the best features we tried out with the RTX 3080 Ti was Super Resolution in Adobe Photoshop with Adobe Camera RAW. In a similar way that Nvidia’s DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology uses AI with RTX graphics cards to intelligently upscale games to higher resolutions but without the performance impact usually associated with high-resolution gaming

The Super Resolution feature then takes a photo then using GPU accelerated AI upscales the photo to twice the resolution. If you have a photo that’s too low resolution to print on a large canvas for example this feature could be the answer.

The second-generation RT cores of the RTX 3080 Ti bring even better ray tracing support for more believable lighting effects in scenes. They now also support hardware-accelerated motion blur which makes it faster to create motion blur while rendering scenes.

Motion blur when used well can give an image or footage a more dynamic feel and the RTX 3080 Ti is capable of generating motion blur impressively quickly while offering realistic reflections and without distracting visual artifacts.

How does it compare to the RTX 3090?

Benchmarks Here’s how the Nvidia RTX 3090 performed in our suite of creative benchmark tests: Handbrake (1080p Fast): 37.8fps

Blender Classroom: 57s seconds

Blender fishy_cat: 42 seconds

PugetBench Photoshop: 717 points

PugetBench Premiere Pro: 715 points

At the moment the RTX 3090 is pitched as Nvidia’s ultimate GPU for both gamers and enthusiasts. This includes creatives who want a powerful GPU for work but don’t want to spend a fortune on a Quadro-level GPU.

With many gamers now being content creators and streamers there is also a huge crossover of people who want a GPU that can play games and power through creative workloads. Now that the RTX 3080 Ti has finally arrived does its lower price make it a better choice?

In our full RTX 3080 Ti review we were impressed with how close the cheaper RTX 3080 Ti came to the performance of the RTX 3090 in the games we tried out meaning for many gamers the newer more affordable card was a better buy. But can the same be said when it comes to creative applications?

Using both Photoshop and Premiere Pro for day-to-day tasks such as editing some home movies there is no noticeable difference between the performance of the RTX 3080 Ti and the RTX 3090. Now one could argue that in much more intensive use cases such as professional video editing with large files high resolutions and multiple effects there may be more of a difference but our creative benchmarks show that the difference in performance between the two GPUs is negligible.

Benchmarks Here’s how the Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti performed in our suite of creative benchmark tests: Handbrake (1080p Fast): 38.5fps

PugetBench Premiere Pro: 693 points

In the boxouts on this page you'll see the results for both the GPUs and you'll notice just how close the results are. We ran the exact same tests in the same PC using both GPUs and these results offer a pretty compelling reason to go with the RTX 3080 Ti over the RTX 3090. For the most part you're getting a pretty much identical experience with the cheaper GPU.

Overall the benchmarks and our own tests show that the RTX 3080 Ti as well as the RTX 3090 are excellent choices for creative tasks.

Does this mean there's no use for the RTX 3090? Not quite. It still has a huge 24GB of GDDR6X memory which is twice the amount of the RTX 3080 Ti. If you're going to be working with extremely high-resolution textures for example that extra memory is going to come in handy. The biggest gap in performance that we saw was in the Premier Pro benchmarks suggesting that the RTX 3090 is a better bet for video editing at high resolutions. Again though the gap isn't huge.

It also means the RTX 3090 is more future-proof. In the coming years that extra memory may be even more important so spending extra money on the RTX 3090 now could save you money later. While the RTX 3080 Ti is cheaper than the RTX 3090 it's not that much cheaper so if you have the budget the bump in price may be worthwhile.

But this is 2021 and we're in the middle of both a global pandemic and chip shortage. This means talk of prices come with a load of caveats. The bottom line is that it is almost impossible to get hold of either an RTX 3080 Ti or an RTX 3090 at its recommended retail price. This may force people's hands as you may not have the luxury of choice between the two GPUs. Instead you may have to go for whatever one is currently in stock and selling at a reasonable price.

The good news there at least is that both GPUs are excellent cards for creatives and could make a big difference to your workflow and productivity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydXN0ZWRyZXZpZXdzLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2N0cmxhbHRkZWxldGUtYW1kcy1zdXBlci1yZXNvbHV0aW9uLWNvdWxkLWJlLWEtbnZpZGlhLWRsc3Mta2lsbGVyLTQxNDI3NTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ctrl+Alt+Delete: AMD's Super Resolution could be a Nvidia DLSS killer,"This week AMD announced that its FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) technology will launch on 22 June 2021. This is a big deal for AMD which means it’s finally catching up to Nvidia which launched its own take on the technology – DLSS – as far back as September 2018.

For those unfamiliar with DLSS and FSR these are clever upscaling techniques which reduce the workload of the GPU in order to achieve higher frame rates. AMD suggests FSR can boost the 4K performance of Godfall from 49fps to 78fps all while achieving a nearly identical image quality.

With DLSS providing supported games with a massive performance boost Nvidia’s RTX graphics cards have boasted a major advantage over AMD’s Radeon GPUs in recent years. Because of this the PC gaming community has been eagerly waiting for AMD to launch its own FSR technology to level the playing field.

However AMD didn’t just ‘level the playing field’ when it detailed its plan for FSR during its Computex keynote – it turned the graphics card competition on its head. Instead of making FSR exclusive to Radeon hardware AMD has made the technology open source. This means FSR will work on any GPU within reason whether it’s made by AMD Nvidia or even Intel.

At first glance this seemed like an own goal by AMD. What’s the point in making a graphics card technology if Nvidia graphics card owners can benefit from it too? But upon further thought I realised that it’s a genius move that could thwart DLSS in one fell swoop.

The main benefit of making FSR open source is that game developers will have a greater incentive to support it. It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense for a games developer to focus time and resources on using a graphics card technology that’s only supported by a handful of GPUs. But if FSR is supported by every single modern gaming system then the decision to enable support becomes a no-brainer.

While support for PlayStation and Xbox hasn’t been confirmed just yet it seems likely that the consoles will support FSR too. Newzoo (via wepc.com) reports that console gamers take up 28% of the global games market (opposed to 23% of PC gamers) so having FSR available on PS5 and Xbox Series X would most likely convince game developers to prioritize support for AMD’s FSR over Nvidia’s DLSS.

This is a smart move by AMD as Nvidia has already struggled to garner support for DLSS. To Nvidia’s credit DLSS is supported by the majority of recent AAA games such as Cyberpunk 2077 Outriders and The Medium but there have also been some notable omissions such as Hitman 3 Resident Evil Village and Valheim. By going open source AMD could avoid this issue altogether.

I also reckon AMD doesn’t want to go into a head-to-head war with DLSS. While I haven’t been able to test FSR yet I’m sceptical that it will be as efficient as DLSS at launch. After all Nvidia has been able to polish the technology over the past few years while AMD will have to start from scratch. So with AMD unlikely to be competitive on the performance front it makes a lot of sense to focus on game support instead.

AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT

And let’s not forget while FSR will be functional on Nvidia hardware it’s probably still going to be more effective with AMD GPUs. Radeon’s vice president & general manager Scott Herkelman has clarified on Twitter (via PC Gamer) that AMD won’t be optimising the technology for GeForce hardware leaving it up to Nvidia to do the work.

Taking this all into consideration I believe FSR has the potential to be a Nvidia DLSS killer. While DLSS will probably offer a superior performance to FSR it probably won’t receive the same level of support as AMD’s solution in the future. And if support for DLSS dwindles further then Nvidia’s most powerful asset could become obsolete.

Of course this is just speculation on my part. With FSR yet to even launch yet it’s impossible to make a final judgement on the technology. But make no mistake AMD’s decision to make FSR open source is not a mistake – it’s a genius move that will have Nvidia well and truly concerned.

NVIDIA (NVDA -1.32%) has been a top growth stock for many years. A $5000 investment in this graphics card specialist five years ago is worth nearly $70000 now which isn't surprising given the pace at which the company has been growing.

Such terrific growth has made NVIDIA stock expensive. It trades at nearly 77 times trailing earnings which is higher than the five-year average multiple of 52. The price-to-sales ratio of 21.2 is also much higher than the five-year average multiple of 14. But NVIDIA remains one of the best bets for growth investors despite trading at such rich multiples because the chipmaker can sustain its high levels of growth for a long time to come and likely replicate its outstanding stock market performance.

Let's look at two reasons why.

The gaming business is set for multiyear growth

NVIDIA recently released results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. It recorded astronomical growth in revenue and earnings once again driven mainly by the stellar performance of the gaming business. Gaming revenue was up 106% year over year to $2.76 billion and accounted for nearly 49% of NVIDIA's total revenue.

Record sales of NVIDIA's desktop and laptop graphics cards fueled the gaming business's solid growth. Management said cryptocurrency-related demand also contributed though it wasn't able to quantify the impact. It is worth noting that the gaming business delivered outstanding growth despite a short supply of cards during the quarter.

NVIDIA is witnessing terrific demand for its Ampere-based RTX 30 series cards that have triggered a massive upgrade cycle. Graphics processing unit (GPU) supply is expected to remain thin in the second half of the year but CFO Colette Kress said on the latest earnings conference call that the company expects ""the RTX upgrade cycle to kick into high gear as the vast majority of our GPU installed base needs to upgrade.""

More specifically only 15% of NVIDIA's massive installed base of 140 million GeForce graphics cards are currently running RTX series cards. This indicates that the company is at the beginning of a GPU upgrade cycle that could last for a few years. One of the reasons that will be the case is because a substantial chunk of NVIDIA's customer base is engaged in esports. According to management ""about 75% of GeForce gamers play esport games and 99% of esports pros compete on GeForce.""

A powerful GPU is crucial in competitive gaming as it can deliver higher average frame rates and reduce latency increasing the chances of winning. As such the growing craze for esports is going to be a tailwind for NVIDIA's gaming business. The good part is that the company is going all out to tap this market with a wide selection of laptops powered by the RTX 30 series cards covering several price points.

Mordor Intelligence estimates that sales of gaming GPUs could clock a compound annual growth rate of 14% through 2026. NVIDIA is one of the best ways to tap this opportunity as it controls more than 80% of this market.

Data center momentum will continue unabated

NVIDIA's data center business turned in a solid performance once again last quarter with revenue rising 79% year over year to a record $2 billion. It accounted for 36% of total revenue. The segment's robust growth was driven by the increased adoption of the company's data center platforms by hyperscale customers for training artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.

NVIDIA management says that its A100 and DGX data center platforms are being deployed by customers ""to train deep neural networks with rising computational intensity led by two of the fastest-growing areas of AI: natural language understanding and deep recommendators."" Mordor Intelligence estimates that the deep learning market could post an annual growth rate of over 42% through 2025.

Meanwhile NVIDIA is witnessing strong GPU demand for AI inferencing. Shipments of GPUs used for inferencing hit a record last quarter and the trend seems set to continue. According to NVIDIA ""GPUs can better keep up with the exponential growth in the size and the complexity of deep neural networks and respond with the required low latency."" The chipmaker has already landed some notable customers in this space including Microsoft the United States Postal Service T-Mobile and others.

All of this indicates that NVIDIA is positioned to take advantage of the fast-growing market for AI chipsets. Additionally the company is on track to expand its data center opportunity with the launch of the Grace server processor in 2023 a move that will help it attack a market worth $19 billion.

So just like gaming the data center business should also keep firing on all cylinders in the coming years and help NVIDIA sustain its high revenue and earnings growth rates. Analysts are currently expecting NVIDIA to clock annual earnings growth of nearly 27% for the next five years. But don't be surprised to see NVIDIA exceed that forecast and remain a top growth stock given the catalysts its two main businesses are enjoying.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2FtZC1ncHUtZ3VpZGUtMTIyNTEzOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD GPU guide: All AMD GPUs explained and the best AMD GPU for you,"AMD

AMD has been making processors since 1969 and has been making CPUs since then. However its journey with GPU has been different. AMD entered the GPU market with its acquisition of ATI in 2006. Prior to that ATI had been in the GPU business independently since 1985. Put together AMD’s expertise in the graphics processing industry actually beats NVIDIA’s.

Due to AMD’s flip-flop pattern ATI/AMD has lagged since the acquisition. However AMD has made quick progress with its new Radeon GPUs just like it has with Ryzen CPUs. If you want to buy a GPU right now AMD actually has quite a few options that stack up decently well against NVIDIA’s offerings. To help make the choice easier for you here’s our AMD GPU guide.

AMD Radeon RX 6000 series GPUs

AMD

AMD Radeon RX 6000 series is the brand’s current flagship series of GPUs. Based on the new RDNA2 architecture the RX 6000 series brings in serious performance improvements over the last generation. While the ray tracing performance is still lacking compared to NVIDIA’s RTX 30 series the other performance metrics get quite close.

AMD is promising a 1.65x performance per watt gain from the first-gen RDNA-based RX 5000 series GPUs. Additionally you get AMD Infinity Cache a new memory architecture that boosts the effective bandwidth of the onboard memory by as much as 3.25x of the typical 256-bit GDDR6 speeds. AMD Smart Access Memory can also give an additional performance boost if you couple these GPUs with Ryzen 5000 series CPUs.

Current AMD Radeon RX 6000 GPU offerings AMD currently has four GPUs in the Radeon RX 6000 series. At the top of the lineup is the fully equipped AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT. You get 5120 stream processors and 16 GB of GDDR6 memory aided by 128 MB of Infinity Cache. This card can do some solid 4K gaming at high frame rates. The RX 6900 XT is an enthusiast card but still comes in at a price that massively undercuts NVIDIA’s equivalent offering — the RTX 3090.

Following that we have the RX 6800 series cards. The AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT sports 4608 stream processors and up to 16 GB of GDDR6 memory. It is a solid 4K card as well but can’t quite hit the higher frame rate numbers. At 1440p however it can make for a great card for high-end gaming systems that want a bit of both. The RX 6800 XT is also the best value graphics card AMD offers making it out AMD GPU guide recommendation. See also: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series: Everything you need to know

The other card in the 6800 series is the AMD Radeon RX 6800 which is a nerfed version of the RX 6800 XT. It performs marginally worse than the RX 6800 but packs in a solid value proposition. The RX 6800 has a stream processor count of 3840 and also comes with up to 16 GB GDDR6 memory. It’s a solid 1440p GPU that can do some 4K gaming.

At the bottom of the lineup is the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT. It has 2560 stream processors and up to 12 GB of GDDR6 memory. It’s primarily a 1080p card that can hit high FPS with some 1440p gaming.

AMD Radeon RX 5000 series GPUs

AMD

AMD Radeon RX 5000 series cards are the last generation GPUs from AMD. They shipped with the RDNA architecture — which ushered in a new era of improved graphics from AMD. However this series still lagged a bit in performance. It didn’t include dedicated hardware support for ray tracing like the competitor RTX 20 series from NVIDIA.

It was a bit underwhelming on release but it was a solid start for AMD. The RX 5000 series promised a 50% increase in performance per watt from the previous generation. It also had other processing features like Radeon Image Sharpening and FidelityFX for better image output.

AMD Radeon RX 5000 series GPU offerings The AMD Radeon RX 5000 series had seven cards under three sub-series. At the top of the lineup is the AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT. The card itself had two versions: the base card and an anniversary edition. The cards shared the stream processor count of 2560 and up to 8 GB of GDDR6 memory. The anniversary edition had slightly higher frequencies and TDP. The 5700 XT can do 4K with lower frame rates and 1440p with higher frame rates. It’s the best value card in the series making it our AMD GPU guide recommendation from the series.

Below it is the AMD Radeon RX 5700 with 2304 stream processors and 8 GB GDDR6 memory. It’s a 1440p GPU that can do acceptable frame rates. The 5600 series has two cards as well: the AMD Radeon 5600 XT and 5600. AMD markets these cards for 1080p gaming systems and they perform well at the resolution. The 5600 XT has a bit more headroom due to the slightly beefier specs of the XT variant.

At the bottom of the lineup is the AMD Radeon RX 5500 series. The RX 5500 XT and RX 5500 are 1080p gaming GPUs but offer lower frame rates. If you want a bare minimum AMD GPU that can do Full HD gaming but don’t want to max out the frame rates the RX 5500 series GPUs are the way to go. All three RX 5000 GPUs series also have laptop versions.

AMD Radeon RX Vega series

AMD

AMD Radeon RX Vega was the last series of GPUs to fully use the Graphics Core Next (GCN) architecture. The RX Vega used the fifth generation of architecture. The series launched alongside AMD’s Zen (i.e. first-gen Ryzen CPUs). However it failed to deliver the same level of performance jump as Zen did with AMD’s CPUs.

This generation of AMD GPUs is still revolutionary but not for its desktop cards. The desktop lineup has two GPUs: The Vega RX 56 and Vega RX 64. These cards are not quite fit for purchase today. The Vega lineup is more important for the graphical improvement that it brought to AMD’s integrated graphics for its CPUs. See also: GPU vs CPU: What’s the difference?

AMD Vega GPUs still continue to be used in AMD’s APU lineup even with the latest 5000 series APUs. These are some of the most powerful integrated GPUs you can find on the market today. The entry-level APUs use the Vega 3 6 and 8 GPUs while the mid-range APUs use the RX Vega 10 and 11 GPUs. AMD also has the Radeon VII which is the enthusiast card for the RX Vega series.

While our AMD GPU guide recommendation is to not buy Vega desktop GPUs and we fully recommend you look at AMD’s Vega-based Ryzen APUs.

AMD Radeon RX 500 series

AMD

AMD Radeon RX 500 series GPUs are some of the oldest AMD GPUs available. These cards use the 4th generation GCN architecture. This generation of AMD Radeon GPUs actually saw the use of three different fabrication processes going from a 28nm CMOS process to the Samsung/Global Foundries 14nm and then 12nm.

The Radeon RX 500 series mostly targeted the entry-level and mid-range GPU markets. The lower-end had the RX 550 and RX 560. For the mid-range AMD had the RX 570 RX 580 and RX 590. AMD also flushed out the range with some X XL XT versions as well as OEM-only variants. Our AMD GPU guide recommendation is to not buy one of these cards new right now.

AMD Radeon Pro series GPUs

AMD

The AMD Radeon Pro series is the company’s lineup of workstation and enterprise-focused GPUs. The Radeon Pro series GPUs have followed the generational iterations that AMD has had with the main Radeon lineup. AMD bundles its professional features with the Pro range.

The latest Pro GPU on the market is the AMD Radeon Pro VII which is the Pro version of the Vega-based Radeon VII. The AMD Radeon Pro Vega series actually debuted as the GPU option for Apple’s then iMac Pro. We also have the Radeon Pro W5000 series which used AMD’s RDNA architecture.

Apple’s Intel-based MacBook Pro laptops also get Radeon Pro GPU options with the latest options being the Radeon Pro 5000M series. AMD seems to have neglected the Pro series with no RDNA2 based options out yet. This could be because of the same reasons NVIDIA has ditched the Quadro brand for professional GPUs — very little distinction between the general and enterprise GPU offerings of late.

The future of AMD GPUs

AMD

AMD’s GPU offerings for the last few years have been underwhelming with NVIDIA getting very little competition. There have been a couple of great generations but consistency has been off.

However AMD is currently bouncing back significantly with its CPU lineup. Some of that success has also rubbed off on its GPU offerings. The RDNA2 based RX 6000 series is some of the best graphics processing hardware AMD has ever put out and is our AMD GPU guide recommendation. With this series it has inched closer to NVIDIA in performance than it has in a long while.

Of course AMD still has to figure out how to get ray tracing right. Next-generation gaming has a heavy focus on ray tracing and AMD is only starting to catch up with NVIDIA in that aspect. The RX 6000 series actually takes quite a leap with that. We can expect future generations of Radeon GPUs to get even better and maybe even match and outdo NVIDIA.

AMD has also done well with its gaming hardware in consoles. Both the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X/S use Radeon RDNA2 GPUs. These consoles have solid performance and offer more bang for the buck than ever before. If AMD keeps up the efforts we’re certainly going to be seeing a ton of great GPUs in the coming years.

The global silicon shortage remains the only major hurdle. If you can grab an AMD Radeon RX 6000 series GPU in these times you absolutely should provided you’re not overpaying for one.

The two met 31 years ago in Philadelphia through Biden's brother Jim. Lattif and Jim Biden had been friends since they met in 1980 through mutual acquaintances when both were living outside Washington D.C.

Lattif had been transferred in 1978 to work in McLean Va. for Ryan Homes which later became part of Virginia-based homebuilder NVR Inc.

Ten years later Jim Biden moved to the Philadelphia area six months before Lattif did as well ""merely by coincidence"" Lattif remembered.

The two remained friends and often socialized together.

In 1990 Jim Biden introduced his brother Joe then a U.S. senator to Lattif during a party at Jim's home.

""That's how we got to know one another"" Lattif said.

Lattif often traveled back and forth by train between NVR's headquarters outside the nation's capital and his home outside of Philadelphia. Biden commuted between Washington and the Wilmington Del. suburbs.

The two would bump into each other from time to time on the train.

""We chatted and we would see each other at social events at Jim's house"" Lattif said.

The two got to know each other so well they were on a first-name basis.

By 1995 Lattif had gone out on his own to build custom homes under his own company called Lattif Builders.

Shortly afterward Jim Biden approached Lattif about building a new house for his brother.

""In 1997 Joe and I sat down to talk about the house"" Lattif said. ""He had the whole thing drawn out and hired an architect to design it. I spent six months with Joe looking at different parcels in the Wilmington area.""

Biden the future president found 4 acres in the Wilmington suburbs next to a 10-acre manmade lake that was already there.",,,,,,

Old Dominion Freight Line is a less-than-truckload motor carrier that provides regional inter-regional and national service.

“They are choosing to expand their operations in Delaware which is very exciting"" said Megan Kopistecki business development manager for the Delaware Prosperity Partnership (DPP) which leads the state’s economic development efforts. ""They currently have two facilities in Delaware - two service centers - they have one in Southern Delaware in Bridgeville. And then they have one in Northern Delaware in New Castle.”

Kopistecki says Old Dominion employs 64 people and is outgrowing that New Castle service center. It’s planning a new site in Bear and to add 20 more jobs over the next three years.

“They like Delaware and they wanted to stay in Delaware and thankfully if looks like they’ve been able to find a site in Delaware to build this new facility said Kopistecki .

Kopistecki notes these logistics and distribution jobs pay up to $28/hour.

The state is prepared to give Old Dominion capital and job performance grants totaling $394500 from the Delaware Strategic Fund to support the company’s plans.

Old Dominion is already under contract on the new site and expects to have the new facility up and running within 18 to 24 months.

COLUMBIA S.C. - It was a gut-wrenching game where every pitch every at bat every ground ball mattered.



Old Dominion University and the University of South Carolina matched off in a tense three hour pitching duel Saturday night at Founders Park and although ODU's stock in trade has been its powerful bats it was the Monarch pitching staff that gave ODU one of the biggest victories in school history.



Riding the shoulders of starter Ryne Moore  who pitched seven brilliant innings the Monarchs defeated the Gamecocks 2-1 before a raucous crowd of 7315 the largest ever to see an ODU team play.



Old Dominion (44-14) is one victory away from a berth in the super regional or what in basketball parlance would be called the Sweet 16. The Monarchs meet Virginia Sunday night at 6. If ODU wins the Monarchs advance to their first super regional ever. If the Cavaliers win ODU and U.Va. will play again Monday night with the winner going to the super regional.



Virginia defeated South Carolina Sunday afternoon to advance to Sunday's game.



Coach Chris Finwood said the Monarchs needed a great performance from Moore after he went deep into his bullpen in Friday's 4-3 victory over Jacksonville and the junior from Limerick Pennsylvania delivered.



Moore threw 121 pitches struck out eight allowed three hits and only one run in seven innings. And he forced a flyout in the bottom of the seven to get out of the inning with the bases loaded.







""That was a 'For the Love of the Game' movie type moment"" Finwood said. ""He just kept making big pitch after big pitch. He's been fantastic for the the last five weeks. I can't say enough good things about him.



""He's been an absolute warrior out there. What a gutsy gusty performance.""



ODU took the lead in the top of the eighth on a rare pitching error from starter Thomas Farr a highly-regarded Major League Baseball prospect who also threw well.



Kenny Levari and Carter Trice began the inning with singles and moved to second and third on a Brock Gagliardi groundout.



With two outs South Carolina elected to send Matt Coutney to first to avoid his strong bat. He homered for ODU in the second inning.



But with Farr tiring shortstop Tommy Bell took the count to 3-2 and was walked scoring Levari.



Bell earned the walk Finwood said.



""It was a veteran at bat"" he said. ""He laid off of a few low breaking balls.



""He had a good swing on a foul ball and got down two strikes and just battled.""



Aaron Holiday who had been struggling this season then came in to relieve Moore and claimed the save.



Holiday struck out the side in the bottom of the eighth.



He hit Brady Allen with a pitch in the bottom of the ninth and then advanced him to second on a passed ball.



But with South Carolina fans standing and screaming he struck out Andrew Eyster to win the game and begin a loud celebration among the 500 or so ODU fans who made the trip to Columbia.







""Aaron Holiday the last two outings has been the guy we envisioned him to be since he came here"" Finwood said.



""It's been an up and down journey. But I was just watching him with smoke coming out of his ears in the eighth and ninth.



""That's what coaching is all about. That kid has struggled and he just got it figured out. And he picked a good time to get it figured out.""



Although ODU is seeded No. 11 in the NCAA Tournament this victory was almost certainly considered surprising in many corners.



South Carolina was playing at home and there are few programs with a better baseball resume. South Carolina is an SEC team with two national championships 32 NCAA Tournament appearances and seven East Division SEC titles.



ODU hadn't won a league title in 25 seasons until last week and entering the Columbia regional had not won an NCAA tournament game in 26 years.



And yet the Monarchs prevailed under difficult circumstances.



The crowd booed chided and generally gave the Monarchs a hard time and as Finwood predicted would be the case that did not faze them.



In fact Moore said the crowd juiced him up especially when Gamecock fans got on him.



""This was one of the biggest crowds I've ever played in front of and I was just having a blast out there"" he said.



""The crowd was just awesome. I loved that stuff. When you come to college this is the kind of crowd you want to play in front of. It was just unreal. I was locked in from the first pitch and trusted these guys behind me.""



The Gamecocks scratched out their only run in the fourth inning in part because of unforced errors by ODU.



With one out Braylen Wimmer doubled then advanced to third on a wild pitch. Colin Burgess was then hit by a pitch leaving runners at the corners. Joe Satterfield then hit a sacrifice fly to center field that scored Wimmer.



Moore then struck out George Callil on a called third strike.



ODU threatened in the top of the six putting two men on base with two outs. Kyle Battle then walked to load the bases. But Levari grounded out to first and the Monarchs stranded three baserunners.



An inning later Coutney lofted a towering fly ball to right field that a day earlier would have cleared the outfield fence. But the wind direction changed during the day blowing from right to left and that was enough to keep the ball in play by a few feet.



ODU had another scoring chance in the top of the seventh when Thomas Wheeler doubled to left center with two outs. Battle then smashed a sharply-hit ball to right field right to Eyster who gloved it with no problem.



But then came the game-winning run.



ODU fans cheered and shouted the ""ODU ODU"" chant for 20 or so minutes as the South Carolina crowd filed out.



""Our fans were fantastic"" Finwood said. ""I think they really helped us. They were all here right behind our dugout.



""They were as loud as they can be.""



Finwood said he feels a groundwell of support from ODU fans which the school hasn't experienced since before the pandemic shut down the University and college sports for much of the last 15 months.



""I can't say enough about how much that support means to these guys"" Finwood said. ""I know our fans are having a blast.



""To see the school year and everything we went through with COVID it's really gratifying for us to be the team that's bringing everybody back.



""Everyone's enjoying it and partying and tailgating before the games. It does my heart good to see everyone out. It feels a lot more normal.

Game Notes

Matt Coutney became the fourth Monarch in double-figures in homers with his 10th of the year … The previous largest crowd for ODU came in 2015 when the Monarchs drew 6029 when they hosted Virginia at Harbor Park … Tommy Bell's RBI walk in the eighth was just his 12th of the season and was hit by a pitch for a team-leading 18th time … It was the second time this season won a game 2-1 defeating Ball State by the same score on March 14. The 121 pitches by Ryne Moore were the most in his career while the eight strikeouts were a season-high … Carter Trice record a single and a double for his 23rd multi-hit game of the season … Holiday did not allow a hit in two innings striking out four to earn his first save of the season.

Nine Southeastern Conference programs were in action with three facing potential elimination. The Florida Gators LSU Tigers and Alabama Crimson Tide were all pitted against their one-loss counterpart with the loser set to depart the tournament field.

(The winning team is in capital letters and the scores are listed by each team name.)

ARKANSAS 5 vs. Nebraska 1

The Razorbacks who held the top spot in the sport for weeks on end began their tournament with a 13-8 over NJIT before drawing a date with the Cornhuskers.

With a late start time in Fayetteville Arkansas utilized only two pitchers en route to a comfortable 5-1 cruising win. Four different Razorbacks drove in runs Saturday night and look confident going forward.

ALABAMA 3 vs. Rider 1

After falling 8-1 to NC State in their first foray into this year’s tournament Alabama was attempting to stave off elimination against the Rider Broncos.

In a low-scoring affair the Crimson Tide were able to best the Broncos 3-1 on the back of Dylan Smith’s complete game in which he allowed seven hits and one run while striking out seven.

Tied 1-1 in the seventh inning Alabama pushed two go-ahead runs across thanks to a William Hamiter two-run home run a lead the Tide wouldn’t relinquish.

Florida 1 vs. SOUTH ALABAMA 19

Hosting the Gainesville regional Florida was surprised to be bested its first time out against South Florida on Friday 5-3. That loss paired them up with the South Alabama Jaguars who fell to Miami (FL) in game one.

The Jaguars who’ve lost 21 games this season only played two big name programs during the regular season Alabama and LSU (a game against Auburn was postponed). They lost those two games 11-8 and 11-1 respectively.

On Friday however they gave the Hurricanes a run for their money dropping the contest 1-0. That setup a situation in which either USA of UF would be eliminated. It didn’t take long for the Jaguars to get the ball rolling. After being shutout the previous day South Alabama pummeled the Gators into submission.

Ultimately securing a 19-1 win the Jaguars ended the Gators’ season in convincing fashion thanks in no small part to a 10-run sixth inning. USA hit three home runs to cap off the slaughter and Florida didn’t score a run after the third inning.

MISSISSIPPI STATE 16 vs. VCU 4

A weather delay prompted a later start time for these two clubs. But the Bulldogs didn’t seem to mind much en route to an easy 16-4 win.

Leading up to the sixth inning the game was somewhat close but then Mississippi State exploded for nine runs in the inning killing any hope the Rams had in pulling out a victory.

The top three batters in the Bulldog order Rowdey Jordan Tanner Allen and Kamren James all had three hits during the contest. Two players Allen and Kellum Clark drove in three runs.

The Bulldogs also connected for three home runs.

OLE MISS 4 vs. Florida State 3

Winners of their game one bout against Southeast Missouri State 6-3 Ole Miss looked to continue their good fortunes. A close and compelling game against Florida State ensued Saturday night.

The Rebels drew first blood in the opening frame when a series of errors yielded two runs (the Seminoles would commit three errors on the night all of which proved costly).

Florida State took the lead in the middle innings however. An Isaiah Perry solo home run and a Logan Lacey two-run shot — both of which came in the fifth inning — gave the Seminoles the edge 3-2. But in the seventh inning an FSU throwing error netted the Rebels two more runs giving them a 4-3 lead which would hold to the conclusion of the game.

South Carolina 1 vs. OLD DOMINION 2

The Gamecocks beat Virginia in its first day matchup with the Cavaliers remaining alive after knocking off Jacksonville Saturday. Carolina then turned its attention to a talented Old Dominion Monarchs team ranked 15th in the coaches’ poll.

In a low-scoring affair South Carolina struggled to get its offense rolling; Old Dominion wasn’t much better. The Monarchs kicked off the scoring in the second inning with a solo home run then Carolina countered with a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning to tie the game at one. Three complete innings would pass before either team would manage to score again when a bases loaded walk plated to go-ahead run for Old Dominion who would go on to win 2-1.

LSU 6 vs. Central Connecticut State 5

In game one for Central Connecticut State the Blue Devils gave the Oregon Ducks fits but ultimately lost 13-10. On Saturday CCSU tried to kindle some type of magic to keep their season alive while simultaneously ending the season of a perennial SEC power.

The Tigers on the other hand got shutout the previous game by Gonzaga yielding their possible exit from the bracket.

This game wouldn’t come easily for LSU as it would take extra innings. The Tigers plated the first two runs of the game in the first inning but Central Connecticut would storm back in the second promptly scoring five runs in the following inning taking a 5-2 lead.

In the third thanks to a home run and an RBI double LSU knotted the game at 5-5. Neither would make entrance to the run column again until the 10th inning. In the bottom of the 10th Giovanni DiGiacomo singled plating Gavin Dugas thus extending the Tigers’ season for another gasme.

VANDERBILT 4 vs. Georgia Tech 3

Everybody knew the Commodores would be trouble in this year’s tournament. In their first matchup Vanderbilt knocked off Presbyterian with ease 10-0. The following night Georgia Tech would prove to be more competitive.

With Jack Leiter on the mound Vandy ultimately beat the Yellow Jackets 4-3; Leiter struck out 11 in the process. An error and wild pitch ultimately did Tech in even though they were able to make it a one run game in the ninth inning.

TENNESSEE 9 vs. Liberty 3

It took walkoff drama to avoid defeat and secure victory in game one of the Knoxville Regional for Tennessee. In game two it looked as though they were determined to avoid a loss.

Tennessee did most of the scoring early and it came from the long ball. Liam Spence opened up the game with a home run in the first securing an early 1-0 advantage. The second inning saw four runs come across one off a Luc Lipcius solo shot then three more on Spence’s three-run job his second of the game. Drew Gilbert homered in the third and Lipcius followed it up with his second of the game staking Tennessee to a 7-0 lead heading into the fourth inning.

Liberty would plate three in the sixth but the game was never really in doubt. Tennessee added two more for good measure in the eighth.

With three clubs facing elimination only one Florida actually fell to its opponent. Everyone else lives to fight another day. When a sport has a dominant conference it’s always interesting to see how that dominance will play out in the postseason. With one casualty thus far — we’ll see how many are to come tomorrow and next weekend — I’d say the SEC is off to a pretty good start.

Tomorrow’s games begin tomorrow at noon and two SEC clubs are facing elimination: South Carolina who will do battle with Virginia; and LSU who takes on Gonzaga. The first time the Gamecocks and Cavaliers met Friday South Carolina narrowly escaped with a 4-3 victory. LSU dropped game one to Gonzaga in an offensively deficient matchup 3-0. The fun is just getting started in the 2021 NCAA baseball tournament.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NoZXJhbGQuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNi8wNy9wYW5hbWEtY2l0eS1iZWFjaC1ndWxmLWNvYXN0LWphbS1nZXRzLXN1cnByaXNlLWRlc2FudGlzLXZpc2l0Lzc1ODI4NDEwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Panama City Beach Gulf Coast Jam gets surprise DeSantis visit,"PANAMA CITY BEACH — In a surprise visit to the Pepsi Gulf Coast Jam on Sunday Gov. Ron DeSantis told the crowd of thousands that one of the largest musical festivals in the U.S. since COVID-19 began was made possible ""because Florida chose freedom over 'Faucism.'""

On the final day of the three-day event in Panama City Beach DeSantis spoke to the audience for several minutes. In a video provided by Rendy Lovelady executive producer of the event DeSantis said that the reason Panama City Beach was able to host the ""largest concert since the pandemic began"" is ""because Florida chose freedom over 'Faucism'"" referring to Anthony Fauci chief medical adviser to the president of the United States.

Panama City Beach:Panama City Beach holds record-breaking UNwineD festival in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic

With the crowd rumbling in the background DeSantis added that his message to other areas is simple.

""Open your states. Open your schools. Let people live their lives (and) don't make them wear masks"" he said. ""You know Florida is always going to be open. We love having y'all here. God bless everybody and God bless the United States of America.""

To date more than 2 million people have reported contracting COVID in Florida and 36973 people with the virus have died state records show.

DeSantis has been an outspoken opponent of federal and state restrictions related to curbing the spread of COVID. Last month DeSantis suspended local COVID-19 emergency orders and signed a proposal state lawmakers approved which limits the government's ability to impose mask requirements and other social distancing measures used to combat the coronavirus this past year.

After about 20 months since the last Gulf Coast Jam Lovelady said it felt amazing to knock the dust off his equipment and host a booming event.

""The crowd just went absolutely crazy"" Lovelady said about DeSantis' visit. ""You could tell there is such an affection for the governor.""

According to Lovelady this year's Gulf Coast Jam was ""the best one (he's) ever had.""

He said the combined attendance during the three days was right at 70000 which is about 2000 more than during past years. This came from more than 22000 tickets.

It was during this weekend's festival that the headliners were announced for the second Gulf Coast Jam of the year that will occur Labor Day weekend. They are Chris Stapleton Old Dominion and Brooks & Dunn. The rest of the lineups will be announced in about a month.

""Last night when it was all said and done it was an emotional release"" Lovelady said. ""It was successful the crowd loved it artists loved it and everybody was happy. It was very very rewarding.""

For PCB Councilman Geoff McConnell the event lit ""a nice little fire under"" the city's economy and boosted tourist development tax collections.

McConnell said he is proud of the way PCB and Florida have bounced back from the pandemic. He expected this weekend to set an example for the rest of the nation.

""This year as a whole we've had a large uptick in visitors"" he said. ""People are ready to get out people are ready to travel and Panama City Beach is seeing the benefits of that.""

In the wake of the concert PCB Police Chief Eusebio Talamantez said he did not notice any significant change in calls for service this weekend.

However there was an increase in traffic on local roads and from June 4-6 the police responded to more than 30 accidents.

""All in all I am extremely pleased on how the weekend unfolded"" Talamantez said. ""Gulf Coast Jam has been a part of our community for some time now and we have always had a strong relationship with the organization. Ninety-nice percent of the patrons of Gulf Coast Jam are exactly the type of visitors we want in Panama City Beach. They are courteous respectful and we rarely have any problems with them."""

The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 11.7% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Semiconductors industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's return on invested capital is 28.42 and its cost of capital is 8.68. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is shown below:

Chip foundries are critically dependent on water and Arizona is one of the driest states in the nation. Arizona gets only 13.6 inches of annual rainfall (compared with 50-60 inches in most of the Deep South or 30.3 inches average for the USA as a whole). But as Forrester research director Glenn O'Donnell told CNBC chip-fabrication plants are similar to indoor swimming pools—""you need a lot to fill it but you don't have to add much to keep it going.""

Counterintuitively the famously thirsty industry can even improve the local water supply due to a focus on reclamation and purification—Intel has funded 15 water restoration projects in the Grand Canyon State with a goal of restoring 937 million gallons per year and it expects to reach net positive water use once the projects are completed.

What Arizona lacks in water it makes up for with overall stability—the state is very seismically stable and does not suffer from hurricanes with low risks of other natural disasters such as tornadoes to boot. Building chip fabs without such guarantees is possible—for example Intel has a large presence in Oregon—but chip fabricators on the West Coast must take extreme isolation measures which Arizona plants don't require.

Arizona's lack of rainfall comes with another benefit—plentiful sunshine which former Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano once said gives the state the potential to be ""the Persian Gulf of solar energy."" As of 2018 the state's utility companies generated roughly 5.2 GW—nearly 5 percent of its entire power budget—via solar generation. Distributed (nonutility-scale) generation in Arizona provided another 2.3 GW in the same year.

The human factor however may add up to more than the state's natural advantages do. Intel established its presence in Arizona more than 40 years ago and currently employs more than 12000 people in the state. Arizona local universities responded by establishing ""a strong reputation for semiconductor design courses and research"" according to Gartner analyst Alan Priestley. And as Forrester director O'Donnell points out ""the political machinery in Arizona is determined to make the state business friendly... the recent announcements by Intel and TSMC come via a lot of help from federal state and local government entities.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vaW5ub3ZhdGlvbm9yaWdpbnMuY29tL2VuL2V1cm9wZXMtb25jZS1pbi1hLWxpZmV0aW1lLWNoYW5jZS10by1yZWR1Y2UtZW1pc3Npb25zLWluLWNvbXB1dGVyLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Europe's once-in-a-lifetime chance to reduce emissions in computer technology,"The semiconductor industry is like an ultimate Champions League. A handful of strong teams acquiring the best players of the world to play the best games and reach that glorious cup. And every year the expectations when it comes to performance levels get ever higher. I admit that sometimes the matches are not that interesting but when they play well it’s a joy to watch.

I guess similar to human performance limitations and in view of Moore’s law semiconductors will also inevitably reach their limits. But so far it seems that the semiconductor industry is high on taurine and progress is beyond expectations. This week at TSMC Technology Symposium TSMC updated the industry on their on-track progress +1 Billion 7nm chips shipped N6 performing at the same level of N7 N5 Volume production and N3 development on track.

Hot chips and nodes

Just some clarification on the nodes as Philip Wong explained in his Hot Chips 31 keynote speech: “It used to be the technology node the node number means something some features on the wafer. […] Today these figures are just numbers. They’re like models in a car – it’s like a BMW 5-series or Mazda 6. It doesn’t matter what the number is it’s just a designation of the next technology the name for it. So let’s not confuse ourselves with the name of the node with what the technology actually offers.”

These are said to be able to build chips in N7 N5 and N3 where EUV light with a wavelength of 13.5nm is used. The precision needed to achieve high-volume manufacturing is like flying an airplane with centimeter-level accuracy inside a tunnel.

The underlying tool that enables this leap in the semiconductor industry is nothing less than the EUV machinery. A very complex machine that has more than 100K individual parts and weighs about 180 metric tons. But let’s not forget that it has been a collective effort for 20 odd years of R&D and innovation at ASML together with its customers. Or perhaps more appropriately its partners like TSMC and also Samsung and Intel.

Smaller and smaller while demand grows bigger and bigger

Digitalization especially in sectors like Automotive and IoT is progressing at an ever-increasing rate. This will lead to a sustained and long-term demand for high- mid-and low-end semiconductor chips. As the chips are getting smaller and more efficient the industry is facing a paradox.

In the fight for increasing capacity and supply and demand one thing that gets less attention is the environmental impact of the industry. For more than a decade researchers are working on ways to measure the CO 2 footprint for semiconductor products. However it is still hard to link semiconductor fabs and our digital devices to CO2 emission. Just as it is for chemical or petroleum factories or cars that have exhaust pipes attached to them. With the rise in production capacity of advanced nodes the power and water consumption of these fans and re-use/recycling of semiconductor chips and digital devices have now become serious issues.

Global energy demand

Computing technology is predicted to account for as much as 20% of the global energy demand by 2030 with hardware responsible for more of that footprint than the operation of a system. This means that: chip manufacturing as opposed to hardware use and energy consumption accounts for most of the carbon output. In addition to that chip manufacturing also requires a huge amount of water to cool machines in fabs. In 2019 the latest year for which data is available TSMC’s daily water consumption in Taiwan was 156000 metric tons per day. At its northern production sites the company accounted for 10.3% of that region’s daily supply.

This is not something to ignore or be frightened of. With the advent of ESG environmental social and corporate governance chipmakers are being forced to take action and the major chip makers are working to address their emissions. Now that Europe is seriously discussing the option of a leading-edge fab the CO 2 footprint and other ESG aspects should be included in the master plan. Let’s not dismiss this once-in-a-lifetime chance!

In February major car manufacturers such as Nissan and Honda began to warn shareholders that revenues were likely to fall significantly below expectations. And the reason wasn’t Covid-19 – well not directly anyway: the pandemic had already significantly depressed sales in 2020. No the problem was that manufacturers were now unable to make some cars because they couldn’t get the silicon chips (processors and other semiconductor components) needed to get the vehicles rolling off production lines. As a result some factories were temporarily closing or being put on short time.

Meanwhile in the same month the computer industry was looking at a record year. Laptop sales were up 90% year on year. Tablet sales had recovered after a long slump. Even desktop computers and printers for heaven’s sake were flying off shelves and into delivery vans. So how did it happen that one industry struggled while another boomed?

The answer is that both had found themselves caught in a perfect storm that one had weathered and the other hadn’t. This storm bought three forces simultaneously to bear on an unprepared world: the fragility of a global supply chain on which both industries critically depended the exigencies of US-China geopolitics and a pandemic that more or less overnight transformed the way large parts of the industrialised world worked.

Once upon a time cars were made the Henry Ford way revolutionary in its time but involving holding huge stocks of components to feed a relentless mechanised production line. As Japan started to rebuild after the war its leading carmaker Toyota came up with a more efficient way of making them. It came to be called the “lean machine” and a key feature of it was to hold very small inventories of components and instead have the necessary parts delivered just when they were needed for a particular assembly task. It was the beginning of just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing and it eventually became the way all cars were made because lower inventories meant lower manufacturing costs better quality and higher profit margins.

But JIT critically relies on an efficient reliable and robust supply chain. If the chain falters then everything grinds to a halt. This applies whether the part is a gearbox or a silicon chip and over the last two decades chips particularly in engine management units (EMUs) have become vital to the functioning of even the humblest petrol or diesel vehicle. We’re heading towards a future when cars will essentially be computers with wheels. But even now if the relevant chips don’t arrive then it’s crisis time.

Nissan may be a big cheese in the motoring business but it’s a midget compared with Apple Amazon Google or Microsoft

The current distress of the car industry stems from the fact that the chips aren’t arriving – for several reasons. One is that there’s a global semiconductor shortage as a result of geopolitical rivalry between the US and China. This was triggered initially by the decision to exclude Huawei from western mobile networks. Another is that the computer and mobile industries having seen what had happened to Huawei began stockpiling chips on a massive scale.

A third factor is that when car sales began to dwindle in February 2020 the manufacturers reduced their semiconductor orders leaving the relevant manufacturing capacity available to be snapped up by a computer industry struggling to meet an exponential demand caused by increased home working. And the coup de grace was that car manufacturers are relatively small beer compared with the electronics industry and so found themselves languishing at the back of a queue for a dwindling supply. Nissan may be a big cheese in the motoring business but it’s a minnow compared with Apple Samsung Amazon Google or Microsoft.

So we not to mention the car manufacturers have arrived at an interesting point. A huge industry built around the idea of propelling ourselves around via a series of controlled explosions which after all is what an internal combustion engine is needs to make a paradigm shift. VW Ford Mercedes Volvo et al will need to become computer companies.

A few years ago searching for a metaphor that would illustrate the change that’s coming I came on two new cars side by side in a French carpark. One was a Porsche 911 a glorious beautifully engineered triumph of baroque technology. The other was a Tesla Model S. And the metaphor that came to mind? On the left in place of the Porsche I saw a beautifully engineered Nokia phone which was great for making calls and sending texts and not much else; on the right the Tesla stood in for the first iPhone which was basically a handheld networked Unix computer that could also at a pinch make calls. And we know how that story ends.

Nokia was a very interesting company that made great hardware. But one always had the impression that at every critical moment in the development of one of its devices the needs of the software ie computing invariably took second place. The hardware guys called the shots. Which is why the path that led the car industry to its current silicon deficit rang some sobering bells.

Recently free-form displays1 have been gaining traction as next-generation technology that will allow for both high-resolution visuals and portability at the same time. While the technology is still in its nascent stages significant research has been carried out on stretchable displays (a core technology for free-form displays) that can be stretched in all directions like rubber bands to change their shapes.

Stretchable Display and Sensor Breakthroughs

On June 4 researchers at the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) Samsung’s R&D hub dedicated to cutting-edge future technologies published research2 in the world-renowned journal ‘Science Advances’ about a technology that overcomes the limitations of stretchable devices.

Through this study stable performance in a stretchable device with high elongation was achieved. This research was also the first in the industry to prove the commercialization potential of stretchable devices given that the technology is capable of being integrated with existing semiconductor processes.

The SAIT research team was able to integrate a stretchable organic LED (OLED) display and a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in a single device to measure and display the user’s heart rate in real-time thus creating the ‘stretchable electronic skin’ form factor. The success of this test case proves the feasibility of expanding the technology to further applications. This research is expected to increase the uptake of stretchable devices in the future.

OLED ‘Skin’ Display That Can Be Stretched by Up to 30%

One of the biggest achievements of this research was that the team was able to modify the composition and structure of ‘elastomer’ a polymer compound with excellent elasticity and resilience and use existing semiconductor manufacturing processes to apply it to the substrates of stretchable OLED displays and optical blood flow sensors for the first time in the industry. The team were then able to confirm that the sensor and display continued to operate normally and did not exhibit any performance degradation with elongation of up to 30%.

To put their research to the test the SAIT researchers attached stretchable PPG heart rate sensors and OLED display systems to the inner wrist near the radial artery.3 Doing this allowed them to confirm that wrist movement did not cause any property deterioration with the solution remaining reliable with skin elongation of up to 30%. This test also confirmed that the sensor and OLED display continued to work stably even after being stretched 1000 times. What’s more when measuring signals from a moving wrist the sensor was found to pick up a heartbeat signal that was 2.4 times stronger than would be picked up by a fixed silicon sensor.

“The strength of this technology is that it allows you to measure your biometric data for a longer period without having to remove the solution when you sleep or exercise since the patch feels like part of your skin. You can also check your biometric data right away on the screen without having to transfer it to an external device” explained principal researcher Youngjun Yun corresponding author of the paper. “The technology can also be expanded to use in wearable healthcare products for adults children and infants as well as patients with certain diseases.”

Overcoming Technical Challenges With Stretchable Materials and Structure

Implementing stretchable display technology proves difficult because usually when a display is stretched or its shape is manipulated the device either breaks or its performance deteriorates. In order to overcome this problem all of the materials and elements including the substrate electrode thin film transistor emission material layer and sensor must have physical stretchability as well as the ability to maintain their electrical properties.

Thus the SAIT researchers replaced the plastic material used in existing stretchable displays with elastomer. The system developed by the SAIT team is the first in the sector to implement a display and sensor using photolithography processes that enable micro-patterning and large-area processing.

Elastomer is an advanced material with high elasticity and resilience but is limited in its capacity to be applied to existing semiconductor processes because it is vulnerable to heat. To mitigate this the team strengthened the material’s thermal resistance by tailoring its molecular composition. They also chemically integrated certain molecule chains in order to establish a resistance to the materials used in semiconductor processes.

“We applied an ‘island’ structure to alleviate the stress4 caused by elongation” said staff researcher Yeongjun Lee co-first author of the paper. “More stress was induced in the area of the elastomer which has a relatively low elasticity coefficient5 and is thus more likely to become deformed. This allowed us to minimize the stress sustained by the OLED pixel area which is more vulnerable to such pressure. We applied a stretchable electrode material (cracked metal) that resists deformation to the elastomer area and this allowed the spaces and wiring electrodes between the pixels to stretch and shrink without the OLED pixels themselves becoming deformed.”

Commercialization and Expanded Applications

The stretchable sensor was made in a way that makes continuous heartbeat measurements possible with a high degree of sensitivity compared to existing fixed wearable sensors. The solution does this by facilitating close adhesion to the skin which minimizes performance inconsistencies that can be caused by movement.6

The stretchable sensor and OLED display developed by the SAIT team were brought about by overcoming limitations in existing device performance and operational processes including those of current stretchable materials. The work done by the SAIT team is particularly significant in that it has secured chemical and heat resistance for the elastomer material thereby making commercialization of stretchable devices with high resolution and large screens more likely in the future.

“Our research is still in the early stages but our goal is to realize and commercialize stretchable devices by increasing system resolution stretchability and measurement accuracy to a level that makes mass production possible” said principal researcher Jong Won Chung co-first author of the paper. “In addition to the heartbeat sensor that was applied in this test case we plan to incorporate stretchable sensors and high-resolution freeform displays to enable users to monitor things like peripheral oxygen saturation electromyogram readings and blood pressure.”

The two biggest questions raised from Israel's point of view are whether this will be the end of tax havens and whether Israel will adopt the initiative? When such ideas have been mentioned in the past the Israel Tax Authority has remained silent and ignored the issue. But with the initiative moving forward worldwide it will now be difficult to ignore.

Among the companies that currently benefit from low levels of corporate tax through the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments and sometimes even zero rates for some Internet activities that go beneath the Israel Tax Authority's radar are: Apple Microsoft Facebook salesforce Intel Oracle and Israeli companies including ICL (TASE: ICL: NYSE: ICL) Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq: CHKP) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA).

The corporate tax rates paid by these companies under the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments ranged between 5% and 12% and sometimes even lower.

In any event in internal discussions held by the Israel Tax Authority International Department the issue has been considered over recent months. One of the major aspects of the new plan being formulated by OECD countries is that multinational giants will be required to complete an amalgamated 15% tax rate in the country where the parent company is headquartered including for countries where lower rates were paid.

In other words if a US corporation owns a corporation in Israel which only pays 10% corporate tax the US corporation would be required to pay the 5% tax difference in the US for its Israeli subsidiary thus rendering lower tax rates ineffective.

It is also likely that the tax rate paid by the subsidiary will take into account the tax on dividends paid by the subsidiary to the parent company.

With the need to make up for tax shortfalls abroad by parent companies the Israel Tax Authority understands that it won't be worthwhile for Israel staying on the outside and adopting the international initiative will be inevitable in order to prevent the loss of tax in Israel by letting parents companies abroad pay the tax elsewhere.

To some extent Israel might even profit from the move because it is not Israel that is pushing this initiative through and Israel cannot be 'blamed' for any corporate tax hike.

It is also unclear whether the new corporate tax will apply to corporations of all sizes.

International tax expert Adv. Dr. Michael Bricker a partner the Meitar Law Office says that in the past the EU spoke of a new tax regime for corporations with annual revenue of more than €750 million but the Us refused such a move.

It now looks like in a compromise move the new 15% corporate tax will be imposed on all multinational companies with annual revenue of more than $1 billion although the US wants a $20 billion threshold. Bricker said ""In my opinion Israel will profit from this and will receive additional tax revenues from the large multinational corporations without needing to act unilaterally and because of the high revenue threshold that will be set Israeli companies won't be hit.""

Adv. Leor Nouman a partner in the Tax Department at the S. Horowitz & Co. law firm agrees that the G-7 initiative is excellent news for Israel ""Generally we are talking about a very good measure for Israel. While Israel keeps a corporate tax rate of 21% and perhaps will cut corporate tax for the first bracket to 19% for example raising the minimum corporate tax rate to 15% in the world's other countries together with the rise in corporate tax in the US will make Israel more attractive.""

""In terms of the different tax structures this might lead to local entrepreneurs preferring to set up ventures in Israel father than leaving for other countries in the world and it will also attract international companies that anyway want to be close to Israel high-tech to set up ventures themselves in Israel and not only their R&D centers in Israel.""

Adv. Nouman added ""It can be assumed at least regarding the statements welcoming the arrangement published by the tech giants like Facebook Google and Amazon that if the issue is instituted then the opposition of the international companies to paying taxes in Israel which would anyway have to be paid in other countries will be reduced.""

Regarding the benefits and incentives that Israel grants corporations through the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments Adv. Nouman said ""As we are taking about specific benefits regarding mainly revenue from intangible assets there is a reasonable chance that it will be exempted from minimum tax rates and therefore the large tech companies which transfer knowhow to Israel will not be so easily harmed.""

The Darkside ransomware gang broke into Colonial Pipeline through an inactive account that didn’t use multifactor authentication according to a consultant who investigated the attack.

The Darkside ransomware gang broke into Colonial Pipeline through an inactive account that didn’t use multifactor authentication according to a consultant who investigated the attack.

The ransomware group took advantage of a compromised password for a virtual private network (VPN) account April 29 to get into the network of the Alpharetta Ga.-based pipeline giant said Charles Carmakal SVP and CTO of FireEye’s Mandiant division. The VPN account was no longer in use at the time of the attack but still provided hackers with access to Colonial’s network according to Carmakal.

Carmakal and Colonial Pipeline CEO Joseph Blount spoke with Bloomberg Friday afternoon and their comments were subsequently confirmed to CRN by spokespeople for FireEye and Colonial. The ransomware attack promoted Colonial to shut down its 5500-mile natural gas pipeline for five days resulting in more than 10000 gas stations across the Southeastern United States being out of fuel.

[Related: Colonial Pipeline Paid $5M To Darkside Hours After Attack: Report]

The password for Colonial’s compromised VPN account has since been discovered inside a batch of leaked passwords on the dark web according to Carmakal. That means a Colonial employee might have used the same password on another account that was previously hacked Carmakal said.

The VPN account in question didn’t use multifactor authentication Carmakal said meaning the Darkside hackers needed only a compromised username and password to breach the company’s network. It’s not known how the hackers obtained the correct username for the account or if managed to determine it on their own Carmakal said. The compromised VPN account has since been deactivated Carmakal said.

“We did a pretty extensive search of the environment to try and determine how they actually got those credentials” Carmakal told Bloomberg. “We don’t see any evidence of phishing for the employee whose credentials were used. We have not seen any other evidence of attacker activity before April 29.”

Shortly before 5 a.m. on May 7 an employee in Colonial’s control room saw a ransom note demanding cryptocurrency prompting a shutdown of the pipeline that 45 percent of the East Coast relies on for fuel supplies Blount said. He is slated to testify next week before the Homeland Security Committees for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives while Carmakal will testify in front of the House’s committee.

Many of the questions are likely to center around Colonial’s controversial decision to pay Darkside a $4.4 million ransom in Bitcoin to receive a decryption tool. “Our job and our duty is to the American public” Blount told NPR. “And if owning that de-encryption tool gets you there quicker then it‘s the decision that had to be made … It was the right decision to make for the country.”

After learning of the compromise Colonial promptly brought in Mandiant to investigate how far hackers had probed and install new detection tools that would alert the company to any follow-up attacks Carmakal said. Investigators haven’t found any evidence the Darkside affiliate tried to regain access according to Carmakal.

Mandiant also tracked the hackers’ network movements to determine how close Darkside was getting to compromising systems adjacent to the company’s operational technology network Carmakal said. While the hackers did move around within Colonial’s information technology network Carmakal said there wasn’t any indication they breached the company’s more critical operational technology systems.

“The last thing we wanted was for a threat actor to have active access to a network where there is any possible risk to a pipeline” Carmakal told Bloomberg.

Blount said Colonial has hired Black Hills Information Security Owner John Strand and Dragos Founder and CEO Rob Lee to consult on cyber defense and ward off future attacks. “I can confirm that they have retained myself and Dragos Inc. to help them on OT/ICS cybersecurity” Lee wrote on Twitter. “I don’t have further comments but will note they are an excellent team and their proactive work is laudable.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

New Line/Warner Bros’ The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It led the international box office with $26.8M from 43 markets while Paramount’s A Quiet Place Part II saw its sophomore frame add $19.2M. The films were bolstered by domestic which continues to see audience appetite for returning to cinemas.

The Conjuring 3 went out early in just two offshore hubs last session and expanded with another 41 markets this weekend. The latest in the hit horror series that returns paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren has pushed the group of seven films to $1.86B global the top horror franchise ever. For this James Wan-helmed installment the overseas total is now $33.1M and $57.1M worldwide.

Conjuring 3 ranked No. 1 in 31 of its launch markets this frame and in like-for-likes is tracking 12% above Annabelle and 30% over the first Conjuring at today’s rates. Mexico which leans into horror was the top play this weekend with $6.7M at 3090 locations. As Korea rebounds it put Conjuring 3 at No. 1 for a $3.1M start at 900 sites. Coming out of its sophomore session the UK leads all play at $7.5M. There are still 29 markets to come over the next few months (see more below).

Paramount After debuting to a fantastic $22M in just 12 markets last weekend the John Krasinski-helmed A Quiet Place Part II picked up another $19.2M in 16 markets. That takes the offshore running total to $50M and worldwide to $138.6M. Markets in release overseas currently rep 47% of the international footprint. On a like-for-like basis AQP2 is running 15% ahead of the original 2018 hit. The UK and Russia saw notable No. 1 debuts with a respective $5.1M and $4M including previews. In China the drop was just 52% for a market total of $29M — Maoyan has raised its projections on the film to RMB 233.7M ($36.5M) which would be higher than the previous entry’s RMB 221M.

Disney Also after debuting last frame Disney’s Cruella saw a scant 7% drop in those same opening markets taking $18.6M in a total of 36 material territories. That lifts the offshore cume to $43.4M and gives the Emma Stone-starrer a worldwide total of $87.1M. Cruella kicked off in China today a rare Sunday launch and grossed $1.8M at No. 4. The early social scores are encouraging with a 9.2 on both Maoyan and Tiao Piaopiao however the Douban critical score is fairly low at 6.8. Maoyan is currently projecting a dismal $5M finish although that’s after only one day of play and the service is known to update its estimates. The coming weekend in China adds Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway as well as Alibaba’s Are You Lonesome Tonight? (aka Tropical Memories) and a pair of animated films from China and Japan.

Still topping China’s box office Universal’s F9 has crossed $250M internationally with $256M through Sunday in just eight markets. The weekend was worth $13.4M for a 57% drop from the last session which had seen a hefty 81% dip.

Universal Pictures In China F9 has now overtaken Godzilla Vs Kong to become the biggest Hollywood movie to release during the pandemic. It’s grossed an estimated RMB 1.3B ($203.8M) to date on par with Hobbs & Shaw at the same point in release. The latter film topped out at RMB 1.43B. Maoyan currently predicts that F9 won’t match Hobbs & Shaw landing at RMB 1.38B but time will tell as the film was again No. 1 this weekend and has no similar demo competition ahead of it. The gross through Sunday gives Universal bragging rights to six movies that have crossed the $200M milestone in the Middle Kingdom the most ever for a single studio (above Disney’s five). In Korea F9 is just 16% below Furious 7 with a cume of $17.7M to notch the biggest gross for a Hollywood movie across both 2020 and 2021. There are still many markets to come which will begin with Australia on June 17 as rollout continues through the summer.

Columbia Pictures’ Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway scampered off with another $4M from 14 markets down just 20% to cume $45.8M ahead of its China and North American releases this coming Friday.



And we are hearing that Demon Slayer – Kimetsu No Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train has indeed passed the $500M global mark but are still waiting on those pesky official figures to attribute a precise number. The Sony Pictures Releasing International cume is $3.1M of the total hailing from 719 screens in two markets. In Russia Demon Slayer ranks as the highest grossing anime film ever and the top Japanese production with $1.7M.

Breakdowns on the films above and more have been updated below.

Indonesia kicked off with $2.2M from 1300 topping A Quiet Place 2 by 49% and 287% above the first Conjuring. In Australia where cinemas are still closed in Victoria (30% of the market) a $2.2M launch on just 199 screens was the third best bow for a Conjuring movie. Spain chimed in with $1.8M from 454 also the third best debut in the series. Horror hungry Brazil scored the best start of the pandemic era at $1.6M from 913 ahead of the Annabelles and double the original film. The UK has grossed $7.5M after two frames.

Disney Disney’s Cruella had a fantastic hold in the markets where it opened last session dropping just 7%. The weekend was worth $18.6M in 36 material markets for a $43.4M offshore cume to date and $87.1M global.

China opened on Sunday in fourth place with $1.8M. Social sentiment is very good but Maoyan is eyeing a very low finish which could certainly change in the coming days. However piracy has to be a concern and there is a holiday ahead next weekend which will usher in a handful of local films.

Elsewhere Cruella scored a No. 2 bow in Russia with $2.4M 23% ahead of Mulan. Second weekend holds were higher in several markets including Switzerland (+83%) Portugal (+58%) Brazil (+19%) Korea (+9%) Spain (+7%) and Colombia (+4%).

It’s the end of an era.

FX’s groundbreaking drama Pose wrapped its three-season run Sunday with a series finale that delivered both heartbreak and hope for the future.

The series from creators Steven Canals and Ryan Murphy helped usher in a new era of storytelling with its historic casting of transgender actors to play trans characters in the 1980s-set ballroom drama. Now after a Peabody Award and landmark Emmy win for star Billy Porter Pose signs off by honoring the queer men of color and HIV/AIDS crusaders who fought for visibility and access to life-saving medication.

The finale saw Blanca (Mj Rodriguez) and Pray Tell (Porter) fight for access into a clinical trial that in a stark reminder of the racial injustices that continue to exist today favorited white men. After Pray comes close to death the cocktail prolongs his life long enough for him to reunite with his ex-boyfriend Ricky (Dyllon Burnside). Ultimately though Pray sacrifices his own life so Ricky can survive and create his own legacy as Ricky had no idea that Pray was giving up his own meds to save his life.

Following Pray’s death Blanca Ricky and the rest of their chosen family spread part of Pray’s ashes as part of an Act Up protest to fight for access to life-saving medication. The series ends in a hopeful note as Blanca imparts Pray’s words of wisdom to a new generation of kids who have arrived on the ballroom scene and are struggling to achieve their own success. The series also had a nod to Sex and the City and featured Blanca Elektra (Dominique Jackson) Angel (Indya Moore) and Lulu (Hailie Sahar) meeting for drinks as they celebrate their professional accomplishments in a scene that culminated the fight for survival and acceptance that Pose also represented.

The Hollywood Reporter caught up with Porter and Canals over Zoom to discuss the show’s creative conclusion how Pray Tell’s death sped up Porter’s plans to break his 14-year silence about his HIV status and their hopes for Pose‘s lasting legacy.

Billy you spoke openly in the tremendous THR cover story about starting trauma therapy during the pandemic. What was it like to film Pray Tell’s death having done that work on your on yourself?

Porter: Having done the work on myself that was the self-care component of being an actor that we don’t always get the opportunity to understand that we need. I’m grateful for the trauma therapy because I was able to already have my mind in the right space and understand that Pray Tell has been and continues to be down to the very end a proxy for my healing. When that is the conscious objective you can hold on to your sanity. How does that bear out in real time? What does that mean? Well Steven can tell you that for episode two of season three — when we were shooting the break-up scene with Ricky I pulled him aside and said “I don’t have more than two takes in me.” In seasons one and two I would have done it however many times somebody asked me to do it.

Steven you directed the series finale which featured Pray Tell nearly dying a few times before he ultimately sacrifices his life for Ricky. Assuming you learned about Billy’s HIV status on the day of the series finale with the rest of the Pose cast would you have done anything differently in the finale?

Canals: Billy and I had a conversation privately at the onset of us starting Pose. When was that during the pilot?

Porter: We were shooting the pilot and I knew that we were going to be talking about this. I wanted the creator to have the information. I wasn’t telling a lot of people. You may have been one of the only people who knew but I felt like the creator of the show needed to know because I felt like subconsciously it would inform where Pray Tell’s storyline went.

Canals: We never talked about it again until we were going into shoot the series finale. It wasn’t anything I ever brought up in the writers’ room. I never talked about it with Ryan Murphy or the other producers. I knew that it wasn’t anything that Billy had ever talked about and it’s never come up in any interviews for the show. That’s private information. It made the process of working on the show sensitive to me because I was always hyper aware. It’s similar to the experience with the ladies as well that I never want to be re-traumatizing one of our actors. I never want you to feel like you have to go to these scary to places and not feel like you’re not supported. The benefit of over the past three seasons building a rapport and a relationship with Billy specifically is that he’s never not advocated for himself. If there was ever going to be a moment where Billy was going to feel uncomfortable — or was not going to want to go there — that he would say “We need to have a conversation.”

I wanted to be able to hold space for him. Going into the third season Billy and I had a great conversation talking about the importance of the show specifically for us as queer men of color living in the shadows of all of the people who came before us whose names we don’t know but if it weren’t for their work and it wasn’t for all the things that they did we wouldn’t be able to stand in our truth and be where we are. Throughout this season working with Billy I had a real ally who shared the goal of the story. The show has been so much bigger than us and our own experiences and has been shining a light and honoring our forebears.

When did you know that Pray Tell was going to die?

Porter: I knew he was going to die in season one. Ryan Murphy mentioned that Pray Tell might not survive.

Canals: We had conversations about it in the second season. It was tricky for us because in the room we were really sensitive to the fact that we were telling a story about HIV/AIDS. When you have not one but three characters who are HIV positive is it realistic to think that you’re going to craft a narrative that takes place at the height of the epidemic where there still was a lack of access to resources and a lack of access to medical care and think that at no point they are never going to get sick? In the context of a television show you can’t have these characters continue to get sick every couple of episodes and wind up in the hospital. We were hyper aware that there was another greater story there for us to tell around HIV. It wasn’t specifically around Pray Tell is going to die as much as it was a conversation about the sacrifices that the community had to make to survive. We made the decision that Pray Tell would be the character for us to tell that story through. Telling a story of the fullness of what it means to be diagnosed with AIDS to know that you have a finite amount of time left and then what are the what are the choices that you’re going to make moving forward in life. We see that when a Pray Tell goes home to have closure with his mother. We started that story in the second season when he joined Act Up and we come back to that in the third season.

Billy you said that before you went in to film this last episode you called your mother and told her about your HIV status. Did filming Pray’s passing influence that decision at all?

Porter: The reality is it was logistical. When I went in to film the death scene I said to the whole set — remember Steven? — I said: “This is the death of Pray Tell and the rebirth of Billy.” I was very clear about this journey because I have lived too long to not let this moment be the moment that it’s supposed to be. This character was sent to me for a reason. Logistically I have a memoir that coming out Oct. 19 and I was talking to my publicist the brilliant Simon Halls of Slate PR going through the year — there’s new music and then my memoir is coming out October and I’m going to reveal to the world that I’m HIV positive. I had planned on doing it inside of my book but he said “Billy you can’t play Pray Tell in Pose die of AIDS and not say it then because unfortunately the cynical cancel culture will come after you. It’s not fair it’s not right but they will.” I was like “Alright what do you think I should do?” and he said “Well you should do it now.” Within 24 hours Simon and Ryan Murphy crafted this space for me to come out as positive in the way that I did. I had already done the work and I had already built myself up to doing it. I had already decided with my sister our mother is not dying so I’m going to have to tell her. We’re going to have to tell her we had planned on doing all of this with the timeline set for October. We just had to push it up six months.

After Pray’s passing the character lives on as Blanca imparts the wisdom she learned from him to a new generation of kids at the ball. Was it always the plan for Pray to die and Blanca to survive? Was there any other ending that you considered?

Porter: I am not one of the creators but as a storyteller my natural instinct was Pray needed to die and Blanca it needed to live.

Canals: From the very beginning of season one there was never a question to me that we would ever lose Blanca because she is the person who launches us into this story. It was always going to begin and end with her. Blanca was going to have to deal with some form of a loss before being able to get to the other side of everything that we’ve seen her deal with — poverty violence etc. From the moment that I met with Ryan I always knew that the show was ending in 1995-96 with the cocktail. The question became what is the emotional ending? The cocktail comes out everyone takes it and they’re fine. We recognize that there was an opportunity for us through that story to have a much deeper conversation. It isn’t simply Pray Tell has HIV and then it becomes AIDS then he dies. As much as it is about a Black gay man making a decision to sacrifice his life to save a much younger gay Black man who doesn’t have access to quality medical care. That ultimately is the important part of the story: that Pray Tell did the thing that so many of our forebears had to do. The sacrifices that they had to make in the ’80s and ’90s. That is the power of the story and specifically of Pray Tell’s death. You could have made the decision in the final hour to say everyone’s going to live. The show has always been aspirational but it felt all the more important — especially in the midst of shooting this in the middle of a global pandemic — to say once again look at the ways that our people had to sacrifice to survive.

Pose has meant so much to so many different communities. When you think back about the entirety of this historic series what are you most proud of?

Porter: That we have been able to make the invisible visible. I have felt invisible for a really long time and that’s hard to believe because I’m actually one of the lucky ones. I went to drama school and worked in this business in various forms and I was completely invisible. The totality of who I am was completely dismissed. I’m proud to say that that is no longer the case.

Canals: I co-sign Billy’s sentiment. Everything around visibility obviously is not only the lasting legacy of the show but it is so important. One of the things that was so important coming into Pose was that we as queer and trans people don’t have our histories taught in school curriculums; we have to go out and we have to seek that information. We’re seeing these narratives and this history from a completely different perspective. Specifically in the case of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the crack epidemic of the ’80s and ’90s — which is the environment I grew up in in housing projects in the Bronx — we were there on the front line. We were on the ground dealing with the ramifications of all of this and we had no support from anyone.

Porter: In 2021 we still have no support. None whatsoever. Make no mistake about what’s going on right now.

Canals: Look at legislation that is preventing young trans people from if it isn’t using bathrooms and they’re not allowed to play in sports they can’t get married. What is going on in this country?!

Porter: And voter suppression! How was it even still legal that we still have to go through this bullshit to make it stop? Make it fucking stop for good once and fucking for all. It’s never going to stop for good. That’s the whole point.

Looking ahead what do you see as the next barrier that needs to get kicked down in television specifically as it pertains to the LGBTQ community?

Porter: Transgender people playing their gender without qualification. Which I think Mj is getting ready to do right? Is her character [in the Apple show] transgender or is the character simply female?

Canals: That I don’t know. But I agree with Billy. I used to say during the first season that success will be when the trans women of the show can go out and be cast to play any woman not just a trans woman. Now I would say success will be when everyone on our show who is queer and trans but also happens to be Black or Latin — because you can’t strip those identities away — we’ll be able to have the same opportunities as their white or straight or cis counterparts.

I can appreciate what Pose represents to the television landscape and the breakthrough nature of it. And it is also not lost on me that I have yet to see another trans content creator pitch and sell a show and have that be made on television. There are trans characters on television but when we debuted it was us and Transparent. Now coming off of it where’s the visibility? Where are the other shows where you have your two leads on a show who are an Afro-Latin trans woman and a Black queer man and both of those characters happen to be living with HIV. And one of our actors is actually HIV positive. Where’s that on television? Because once we leave there’s a huge gap now. I always have a hard time patting myself on the back for all the great things that Pose represents because the intention was always to see the door get kicked down and to see more progress. I’m hopeful that that will come but I would be lying if I didn’t say I’m disappointed that it didn’t happen over the course of the past four years since our show was announced.

Porter: Every single one of us on this show has been empowered by our creative team — including you Steven — to understand how to take the power that we’ve earned through this show and be the change that we want to see. I’m Black I’m gay I’m HIV positive and I just sold a TV show to Peacock. We have to recommit to choosing hope love and all of these aspirational ideas that we have so that we can speak life into ourselves and into those around us so that it can change. I hope that Pose can teach people how to look in the face of nothing and choose something anyway. That’s the power of our show. These characters had nothing and they chose life anyway. That is the power of the theme of it that surpasses anything. I have never in my life felt more empowered than I do in this very present moment. My fear of failure is gone; it already happened. I chose myself inside of it and transcended it. That is the only energy that I’m interested in putting out into the world.

Steven what’s next for you?

I’m refilling the creative well. I’ve been watching a lot of films watching television listening to great albums and getting reacquainted with life. This was the longest season ever. We were in the writers’ room pre-COVID went to New York were shut down for six months and then we went back to shoot for six months. I’m also keeping my eyes open to what’s happening in the world so that can inform my next project in the way that Pose was informed by what I was seeing. There’s a lot of really great queer content right now including It’s a Sin and Generation.

Now the inevitable question: While Pose is done after 25 episodes could either of you envision a reboot reunion/movie or spinoff?

Porter: I can’t because I’m dead! (Laughing.) I feel like this story is done. I don’t mean that in a bad way; I just mean it as in we have told this story. It’s time to tell a different story. That was the other thing I said with Pray Tell — it’s the rebirth of Billy and it’s time for me to tell a different story. I’ve been talking about AIDS since it started. I’m ready to tell another extension of it something that expands me a little bit more now personally.

Canals: Yes I think when it comes to Pose — and I know we talked about this on the podcast — there other versions of the story to tell. We could easily tell the present day narrative of ballroom or the new kids who we meet at the end of the finale. We could flashback to the early ’80s and we could tell the story of early House of Abundance. I came into Pose knowing exactly what the story was. We said it was the story that was grounded and rooted in what was happening in this socio-economic community in New York in the ’80s. It was an investigation into the HIV/AIDS epidemic through the lens of queer trans Black and Brown people who happened to be part of the ballroom community. From the very beginning there was always a clear end point and we got there. If I was ever going to dive back into these characters there needs to be something new to explore because everything that I wanted to say around resilience and survival I said over these three seasons.

Was there anything you wanted to do during Pose that you didn’t get the chance to accomplish?

Canals: Yes and it’s really ridiculous — for three seasons I really wanted it to film a scene on a subway. (Laughing.)

Porter: I did everything I wanted to do. The only thing that I didn’t get to do was directing episodes because of COVID but I’m still directing.

Here’s to hoping there’s another collaboration between you both where you can film on subway and direct.

Porter: We definitely will.

Premam director finally reveals! - Tamil News,"Director Alphonse Puthran's 2015 release Premam is a movie that made waves all over South India. ‘Premam’ is about a love affair that takes place over three periods in the life of a young man named George. The film stars Anupama Parameswaran Sai Pallavi Madonna Nivin Pauly and a bunch of newcomers. However even after you leave the theatre the first thing that comes to mind is Malar miss and her student George.

After watching the coming of age movie it has left several movie-buffs curious on whether actress Sai Pallavi's character Malar had actually lost her memory or purposefully avoided Nivin Pauly's character towards the climax.

Six years after the film's release the director finally answered the much-hyped question. In a recent interaction with fans the director was asked about the same and here's what the director replied. Alphonse said that Malar did lose her memory after the accident. Once after she regained her memory she remembered George. Seeing him at his wedding Malar realizes that he is happy with Celine.

George also realized that Malar had regained his memory when showed the 'super' action with her hand. The director added that he revealed this through actions and music and not by dialogues.

Three years ago Square's (SQ -1.58%) co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey predicted bitcoin (BTC -1.08%) would overtake the U.S. dollar in global importance to become the internet's ""single currency"".

Bitcoin's price has risen more than 400% since Dorsey made that prediction to The Times and many investors still closely associate Square's fintech business with bitcoin's future. However Square's approach to bitcoin still differs from its competitors in four key ways.

1. Its first mover's advantage

Square added bitcoin trades to its Cash App which was used for peer-to-peer payments in early 2018. That feature differentiated Cash App from PayPal's (PYPL 0.75%) peer-to-peer payments app Venmo and attracted new users who were looking for an easy way to buy and sell bitcoin.

Square's approach was disruptive since bitcoin trading had previously been limited to niche exchanges like Mt. Gox and Coincheck which both failed to protect their users from hacks and scams.

Square simplified the process by directly buying bitcoin selling it to Cash App users at a slight margin and not charging any additional transaction fees. It started allowing users of its Cash Card a debit card which was linked to Cash App to earn bitcoin ""Boosts"" from their purchases last year then it added free peer-to-peer bitcoin transfers earlier this year.

Last year more than 3 million customers bought and sold bitcoin on Square's Cash App. This January over 1 million Cash App users bought bitcoin for the first time. Cash App had 36 million monthly active users at the end of 2020 -- so Square still has plenty of room to gain more bitcoin buyers.

2. It only sells bitcoin

Many other companies followed Square's lead. Robinhood launched free cryptocurrency trades about a month after Square and PayPal -- which had repeatedly refused to enter the cryptocurrency market -- finally added crypto trades and payments to its main app in late 2020.

However Square doesn't dabble in other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin even as Dorsey's fellow billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Cuban promote other cryptocurrencies like dogecoin (DOGE -2.51%).

3. It holds bitcoin on its balance sheet

Many companies that provide bitcoin trading services don't actually hold bitcoin on their balance sheets. Yet Square has gradually added more bitcoin to its own coffers (not Cash App) over the past few years and its bitcoin holdings accounted for roughly 5% of its cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2020.

That investment won't break Square if bitcoin suddenly crashes but it could still generate massive long-term returns. Considering how bullish Jack Dorsey is on bitcoin it wouldn't be surprising to see Square add more bitcoin to its balance sheet this year -- especially after the cryptocurrency shed about 30% of its value over the past month.

4. It's not an all-in bet on bitcoin

Square usually generates most of its revenue from its transaction-based fees and seller services. But last year many small and medium-sized businesses which use those services shut down during the pandemic.

Fortunately Square's bitcoin revenues from Cash App skyrocketed roughly nine times year-over-year to $4.57 billion or 48% of its top line last year and offset the slowdown in its transaction-based business. However it only retained 2% of those bitcoin revenues as gross profits and the higher mix of lower-margin bitcoin revenues squeezed its adjusted earnings.

Therefore Square's bitcoin business absorbed some of the pandemic's impact but it definitely isn't an all-in bet on bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. Instead investors looking for a more speculative ""pure play"" on the crypto market should take a closer look at Coinbase (COIN 0.02%) the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.

What does this all mean for investors?

Square's stock often rises and falls with bitcoin's price but its business is only partly tethered to the world's top cryptocurrency. Its core business which consists of payment processing services and other business tools remains a more broadly diversified play on the growing fintech market.

Simply put investors who believe in bitcoin should simply buy the cryptocurrency. Investors who want a more conservative fintech stock which isn't as exposed to cryptocurrencies might prefer PayPal which trades at much lower valuations than Square. However investors who want the best of both worlds and aren't afraid of a little near-term volatility should still consider Square to be a solid investment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMCw3MzQwLEwtMzkwOTI1MCwwMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayMe discreetly powering an SMB revolution | Ctech,"Adam Kima was certain he had found a winner. With a partnership with Real Madrid and revenue beginning to stream in Kima's startup QualiPic looked to be on the road to great success. QualiPic offered sports fans virtual face painting allowing them to select a logo of their favorite clubs and upload a photo of themselves to receive a picture with their face 'painted' with the logo that they could then share on social media. The early signs were very promising but one email from PayPal would derail all of Kima's dreams. PayPal notified Kima out of the blue that they had suspended his account due to QualiPic infringing copyrights. Kima tried to convince them that was not the case and that he had an agreement with the likes of Real Madrid but it would be three months until his account was finally reactivated.

""QualiPic failed even though we had an amazing product and everything was going perfectly"" Kima told CTech. ""PayPal shut me down. They said we were infringing on rights even though we weren't. A long process ensued and after three months they reopened our account but by then the business was screwed. I didn't have any real knowledge of the payment world or of the copyright and legal world and that ended up resulting in our entire startup failing.""

QualiPic may have folded but it ended up leading to Kima's current venture named PayMe which he co-founded with Adam Kogan.

""My personal motivation is to help small businesses. I failed in my previous startup because I lacked knowledge regarding things that weren't part of my core business. Both Adam and I carry these scars and are trying to heal them one at a time"" explained Kima.

PayMe has developed a platform that provides companies of all sizes white-label fintech services offering a comprehensive suite of financial services via an API that can be integrated under any brand addressing the needs of SMBs while also allowing PayMe partners to generate new revenue streams from these channels. These services include instant digital on-boarding credit card processing alternative payment methods pre-integrated services needed to run and manage a business online and offline POS solutions automatic invoicing credit card reconciliation and anti-fraud protection to name a few.

PayMe processed over $150 million in 2020 generating revenue of over 3% on its payment volume which represents a premium of over 350% compared to revenue generated by traditional payment companies like acquiring banks and PSPs on their payments volume.

""The dream is to take the many technologies that every business needs and make them readily accessible"" explained Kima. ""There is a big gap between the rich and the poor in the business world. Someone rich can afford to focus on his core business and if he needs help with finances he hires a CFO and if he needs help with marketing or on the tech side he'll bring in specialists that will take care of all the details which he doesn't know much about. A small business can't afford to do that and that is the gap I'm aiming to close.""

Kima said PayMe is planning on going public on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange later this year admitting that the boom in company valuations in the tech market has become too alluring to resist.

""We are aiming to go public because we simply cannot ignore the current valuations in the market. Had you told me a year ago that I would be doing an IPO this year I would have said no way but because of the valuations in the tech world at the moment this has become a good alternative to raising funds from a VC. Going public also requires a far more structured business. I like that PayMe is growing in a steady and stable manner. If the company is organized there really isn't any reason not to go public. The questions you are being asked before going public are really all quite legitimate.""

PayMe is essentially bootstrapped raising an initial $150000 when it was founded in 2013 but nothing else since. Kima explained that even though PayMe is focused on the finance sector it is for every intense and purpose a technology company.

""All of our competitors are focused on a particular niche. We have 29 employees at PayMe of which 23 are either developers or product staff. We have just a single salesperson. In other companies there is an opposite ratio. We aren't really a financial company. We are a tech aggregator. We have competition in every sector but no one else is combining all of these services and offering them as a brandless API"" said Kima. ""Our platform is an API that is provided via distributors such as Wix and Isracard and we are also in the midst of negotiations with one of the biggest banks in Europe and one of the biggest banks in Israel. We provide our platform as a white label that they can integrate into their systems which allows them to also increase their revenue from their clients as well as the stickiness"" said Kima.

""20% of small businesses shut down after one year. Of the remainder 30% close in the second year. Some 50% of those that survived the first two years close within five years. That means that 90% of small businesses don't survive more than five years"" added Kima. ""Our hypothesis is that many of these businesses don't survive due to the fact that a small business owner needs to not only be an expert in his own profession but also needs to have an understanding in many other fields like finance payment HR and marketing. Research shows that 70% of businesses close because they have a cash flow problem and not necessarily because they aren't creating revenue.""

Some 95% of PayMe's clients are currently Israel-based but the company is now ready to expand further afield with Europe being its next target market.

""We ended up doing a little too well in the Israeli market. As an entrepreneur who doesn't want to raise money but rather build up his business in an organic fashion I couldn't just pass on the revenue that the Israeli market was creating even though initially it was only supposed to be a beta site. Now we are in a situation in which we either go public or raise money and then the Israeli market can become that beta site while we try to enter the European market"" said Kima. ""We are intentionally targeting the European market as it is far more fragmented than the U.S. market and there are far more banks to work with.""

Kima broke down the company's strategy in Europe. ""We will offer businesses a very low transaction commission almost zero because we know that in the long-run they will use at least an additional two services that we offer and that will cover the commission we aren't charging on transactions"" said Kima. ""This way we will be able to realize our vision of giving SMBs all the tools they need to fulfill their potential.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRtei5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8wNS9lbG9uLW11c2stdGFyZ2V0ZWQtYW5vbnltb3VzLWhhY2tlci1ncm91cC1iaXRjb2luLXRlc2xhL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRtei5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8wNS9lbG9uLW11c2stdGFyZ2V0ZWQtYW5vbnltb3VzLWhhY2tlci1ncm91cC1iaXRjb2luLXRlc2xhLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk Targeted in Anonymous Hacker Group's Latest Video,"Elon Musk appears to be in the crosshairs of a notorious group of hackers who are responsible for some of the biggest digital breaches/leaks in modern history.

The Tesla CEO is the subject of a new video posted by Anonymous -- a coalition of self-described freedom fighters who use the ""V for Vendetta"" Guy Fawkes mask as their logo ... and who've caused a lot of grief for different orgs over the years including Scientology PayPal and others.

In their latest offering ... they're going after Elon claiming the power he wields over cryptocurrency markets -- and the cavalier way he wields it -- has gone far enough ... especially as it pertains to Bitcoin which has reacted wildly to Elon's words of late.

Anonymous claims that even though Elon has positioned himself as concerned about the environment with Tesla's pivot away from Bitcoin he doesn't practice what he preaches within the company itself -- hurling many allegations against him and Tesla's practices at large.

Anonymous goes on to take even more shots at Elon personally ... saying he suffers from a superiority/savior complex -- noting he once dubbed himself the ""Emperor of Mars"" -- and that he's actually hurting working-class people and their prospects by his constant crypto trolling.

There's a lot to unpack here ... but the bottom line is Anonymous seems to think Elon isn't a friend to the common man -- something they consider themselves to be -- and because of that ... they seem to be issuing a warning. As to what that is ... it remains to be seen.

Anonymous has famously disrupted computer systems from large corporations as well as municipalities -- especially following police-involved deaths like Michael Brown and recently George Floyd whom they vowed to avenge by ""exposing"" MPD's alleged misdeeds.

A new study has raised the possibility of a heart condition being a very rare side effect of the Pfizer shot.

Seven US teen boys experienced chest pain within a few days of having their second COVID-19 vaccine.

A new study published on Friday has sparked concerns that a heart condition could be a very rare side effect for teens and young adults receiving the second dose of COVID-19 vaccines.

Health authorities are investigating whether reports of heart inflammation in seven US teen boys across several states can be linked to the administration of a Pfizer shot the Associated Press reported.

The study published in the Official Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics shows that the seven boys – aged between 14 and 19 – experienced chest pain within a few days of having their second coronavirus vaccine.

Heart imaging tests showed a type of inflammation of the heart muscle called myocarditis.

None of the teenagers were critically ill and all were sent home from the hospital after two to six days Dr. Preeti Jaggi who co-authored the report told AP. It is currently believed that the inflammation was temporary Jaggi said.

This study follows news from Israel that suggested there is a ""probable link"" between receiving the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and the appearance of myocarditis Israel's health ministry said on Tuesday.

Out of more than 5 million people who got the vaccine 275 people reported heart muscle inflammation mainly young men the health ministry said.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month recommended investigating the possibility of a link between myocarditis and mRNA vaccines which include those from Pfizer and Moderna Insider's Sarah Al-Arshani reported

The rate of reported myocarditis cases after COVID-19 vaccinations however was not different from the baseline rate which means there may not be a link between vaccination and the condition Al-Arshani wrote.

Eligible teens are still being encouraged to be vaccinated due to a rising number of hospitalizations among young people the CDC said.

The CDC has allowed the use of the Pfizer vaccine for people 12 years old and up.

The Japanese government is currently rolling out coronavirus vaccines produced by US companies Pfizer and Moderna. Both shots are based on messenger RNA a type of genetic material which is why they are known as ""mRNA vaccines."" The two vaccines have much in common but also key differences.

The following information is from Japan's health ministry the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as Pfizer and Moderna.

Intramuscular injection

Both vaccines are administered via intramuscular injection a technique that delivers the shot to muscles underneath our subcutaneous fat. The needle is inserted at a right angle into the upper part of the arm close to the shoulder. Experts say this technique allows the body to absorb the vaccine more quickly than through hypodermic injection between the skin and muscle which is used for the flu vaccine in Japan.

Number of shots and time between doses

The Pfizer vaccine is administered in two doses with the second shot usually given three weeks after the first. The Moderna vaccine is also administered in two doses with the second one usually given after four weeks.

Efficacy

Both vaccines were very effective in clinical trials and have since demonstrated high efficacy in the inoculated population.

In clinical trials the Pfizer vaccine led to a 95% decreases in symptomatic cases and the Moderna vaccine resulted in a 94.1% reduction.

Efficacy against variants

Both vaccines have been found to be highly effective against the variant first identified in the UK which is now spreading across Japan and many other countries.

A paper published by Pfizer and its partners says that a laboratory test showed their vaccine to be just as effective in neutralizing the variants first detected in the UK and Brazil. It says the vaccine provided ""sufficient"" protection against a variant first detected in South Africa.

Moderna and its partners say their vaccine has been shown to work just as well against the UK variant as against earlier strains. It appears to be less effective against the South Africa and Brazil variants but Moderna says the levels are still sufficient to protect against them.

Potential side effects

A Japanese health ministry study group looked at side effects of the Pfizer vaccine and released their findings on April 30. They said 23.2 percent of people experienced fatigue after the first dose with the figure rising to 69.6 percent after the second dose; 21.2 percent experienced headaches after the first dose and 53.7 percent after the second; 3.3 percent reported a fever of 37.5 degrees or higher after the first dose and 38.4 percent after the second.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released results of clinical tests involving the Modern vaccine and people aged 18-64. The data shows that 38.5 percent experienced fatigue after the first shot while 67.6 percent did so after the second; 35.4 percent had a headache after the first shot and 62.8 percent after the second; and 0.9 percent developed a fever after the first shot and 17.4 percent after the second.

Storage requirements

Both vaccines contain mRNA which is unstable and can be easily damaged and so require stringent storage measures.

Japan's health ministry says the Pfizer vaccine can be kept at temperatures between minus 25 and minus 15 degrees for up to 14 days. After it is thawed in advance of injection the vaccine has to be refrigerated at between 2 and 8 degrees and used within 5 days.

The Moderna vaccine should be held in freezers at temperatures between minus 50 and minus 15 degrees. At medical facilities it can be kept in refrigerators at temperatures between 2 and 8 degrees for 30 days.

Columbus Hy-Vee Pharmacy Manager Kara Johnson said some children 12 and older have already received the Pfizer vaccine at the Hy-Vee in town.

According to Hy-Vee's website minors must have parental or guardian consent to receive the Pfizer vaccine. Hy-Vee also asks that a parent or guardian accompany all minors to their vaccine appointments -- first and second dose.

Johnson said the Columbus Hy-Vee Pharmacy 3010 23rd St. is only offering the Pfizer vaccine.

""It has only been Pfizer here at our location"" Johnson said.

In Nebraska Hy-Vee locations are receiving doses of vaccine from the federal government through the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program along with Walmart CVS Health Walgreens and others.

In Columbus CVS Health and Walgreens are also offering the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine according to vaccines.gov which is a free federal website where users can search for vaccine locations.

""All children ages 12 – 15 are now eligible to receive the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine at CVS Pharmacy provided there is parental or legal guardian consent and the child is accompanied by an adult"" said a statement from CVS Health emailed to the Telegram on Friday by CVS Health Midwest Region Corporate Communications.

Similar guidelines are in place at Walgreens according to a statement emailed to the Telegram on Friday by a Walgreens corporate spokesperson.

""Parents or guardians can utilize Walgreens guest scheduling functionality to book an appointment for their children which is required for adolescents who are 12-years-old"" the Walgreens statement said. ""Adolescents ages 13 and older can make an appointment themselves.""

Those wanting to receive a Pfizer vaccine in Columbus should schedule using the appropriate online sign-up tool for Hy-Vee CVS Health or Walgreens each of which can be found on their respective websites.

Currently the Pfizer vaccine is approved for use on people 12-years-old and older in the United States. Right now it is the only COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. approved for minors or people younger than 18.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorsed the use of the Pfizer vaccine for people ages 12 and older on May 12 right after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized it for people ages 12 to 15 on May 10. Before that the FDA had already approved the Pfizer vaccine for those age 16 and older.

Columbus Community Hospital (CCH) and the East-Central District Health Department (ECDHD) are also providing COVID-19 vaccines in Columbus. Currently they are only offering Moderna.

""Good Neighbor/East-Central is not doing the Pfizer vaccines here. Our vaccines are Moderna"" ECDHD Communications Development and Marketing Director Julie McClure said.

Minors are not eligible to receive the Moderna vaccine which the FDA has only authorized for use on people 18 and older.

""ECDHD nor any of the hospitals within the jurisdiction have received Pfizer vaccine recently"" ECDHD Chief Public Health Officer Chuck Sepers said. ""CCH's first round of vaccines were Pfizer in December but never received another allocation.""

People can schedule a vaccine appointment at ECDHD in Columbus by registering online using Nebraska's vaccine sign-up portal vaccinate.ne.gov.

However Sepers noted that Federal Retail Pharmacy Partners like Hy-Vee are not required to use vaccinate.ne.gov. As such there is no guarantee that people will receive a Pfizer vaccine if they use vaccinate.ne.gov to sign up for an appointment in Columbus.

According to vaccines.gov the Columbus Walmart is offering Moderna. However as with the other Federal Retail Pharmacy Program participants people who want to receive a Moderna vaccine at the Walmart in Columbus may wish to use the scheduler on Walmart's website.

Daegu mayor under fire after Pfizer fraudsters trick council

Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin is under fire after the city's recent proposal to secure Pfizer doses for 30 million people was confirmed to be fake.Criticism came after the Medi-City Daegu Council an association of medical institutions in the city held negotiations with a foreign trading company to import Pfizer doses for 30 million people in three weeks separate from the doses for 33 million people that the government has agreed with Pfizer.The council and the trading company were said to have exchanged documents and the Daegu Metropolitan Government transferred the proposal to the Ministry of Health and Welfare.The government concluded on Thursday that Daegu’s Pfizer vaccine purchase proposal had “reliability issues.”“Pfizer only supplies its vaccine to central governments and international health organizations and hasn’t approved the distribution to Korea to any third-party organization"" said Sohn Young-rae a senior health official of the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters during a briefing on June 3.Health and welfare minister's policy advisor Yeo Jun-seong indicated in hashtags on a related Facebook post that the purported address of the foreign trading company appeared to be in Florida its phone number in Portugal and its website not operational.Pfizer Korea later issued a statement saying “The Pfizer headquarters and Pfizer Korea have not authorized any entity to import sell or distribute the vaccine to Korea thus it cannot be provided through an intermediary.”The company added that it will launch an investigation and will take legal action against the unofficial transaction if necessary.Some Daegu citizens expressed anger and disappointment at Mayor Kwon for the confusion and a petition was posted on the Blue House website.A petitioner described as a Daegu citizen wrote ""I am so embarrassed that I cannot live in Daegu anymore"" and demanded that the mayor make an official apology. The petition had more than 6000 signatures as of Sunday.The Daegu Metropolitan Government released a press release on June 4 expressing regret over the confusion and the backlash.""The proposal for the introduction of the vaccines was made last December by Medi-City Daegu Council [...] as a way to help the government procure vaccines” the press release said stressing that the city merely wrote a letter of purchase intent to the Council in the name of the city’s mayor as per a Health Ministry manual.“It is regrettable that regardless of the success or failure of the vaccine purchase the recent statement of the ruling party saying that [it] was an incident that devalued the country’s national prestige is distorting and disparaging the local medical community’s efforts made in good will” it added.BY SEO JI-EUN [seo.jieun1@joongang.co.kr]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA2LTA3L3F1ZWVuc2xhbmQtZXhjZWVkcy13ZWVrZW5kLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtdGFyZ2V0LXByZW1pZXItcGZpemVyLzEwMDE5NDYzNNIBKGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDAxOTQ2MzQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Queensland exceeds weekend COVID-19 vaccine target as Annastacia Palaszczuk gets first Pfizer dose,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-07/queensland-exceeds-weekend-covid-vaccine-target-premier-pfizer/100194634 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA2LTA3L3F1ZWVuc2xhbmQtZXhjZWVkcy13ZWVrZW5kLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtdGFyZ2V0LXByZW1pZXItcGZpemVyLzEwMDE5NDYzNNIBKGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDAxOTQ2MzQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

By Laila Kearney

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil prices pulled back on Monday after touching two-year highs on expectations of improved demand and OPEC producers keeping supply curbs in place.

Prices retreated from session highs early and analysts cited pressure from Chinese data showed crude oil imports fell to a year's low in May.

""That took away some of the enthusiasm that the oil bulls had seen"" said Phil Flynn senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.

Brent crude settled at $71.49 a barrel falling 40 cents after hitting $72.27 a barrel its highest since May 2019.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate settled at $69.23 a barrel after touching $70 for the first time since October 2018.

Investors may have sold some contracts to take profits when WTI hit the round number of $70 said Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates.

""Regardless fresh highs suggest sustainability of this bull move with some higher values likely lying ahead"" Ritterbusch said.

Crude has risen for two weeks with Brent up by 38% this year and WTI rising 43% helped by nascent recovery from pandemic-related demand disruptions and supply curbs by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies.

The producer group known as OPEC+ has boosted oil prices by sticking to supply restraints through July. On Monday OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said OPEC+ expects inventories to fall further in coming months.

Analysts expect oil prices to remain buoyant with pullbacks brief due to increased global demand following decisions by the United States and Europe to loosen COVID-19 restrictions while India has begun to ease its latest lockdown.

""With some improvement in the pandemic situation in India and the recovery in the U.S. China and Europe remaining on track oil should remain a buy on dips"" said Jeffrey Halley analyst at brokerage OANDA.

The Ben Hogan Trophy was first issued by the Friends of Golf (FOG) in 1990 at Bel-Air Country Club in Los Angeles which at that time also included academic achievement in its original list of standards. In 2002 members of Fort Worth’s Colonial Country Club partnered with FOG to reimagine The Ben Hogan Award.

That year the award was moved to Hogan’s hometown and the site of five of his PGA TOUR victories. The program also began recognizing the top amateur and collegiate golfer weighing all college amateur and professional events over the previous year. Since that time winners of The Ben Hogan Award have combined to accumulate 44 PGA TOUR victories and more than $265 million in prize money on the tour.

Three winners are currently ranked in the top 15 in the Official World Golf Rankings—Jon Rahm (No. 3) Viktor Hovland (No. 12) and Patrick Cantlay (No. 15). Other recipients include Ricky Barnes Matt Every Rickie Fowler Doug Ghim Bill Haas Chris Kirk Hunter Mahan Maverick McNealy Ryan Moore Patrick Rodgers Kyle Stanley Nick Taylor Sahith Theegala D.J. Trahan Peter Uihlein and Chris Williams.

“We are extremely pleased to have PNC Bank join The Ben Hogan Award family” said Harold Muckleroy chairman of The Hogan Trophy Award committee. “The addition of PNC will allow The Ben Hogan Award to continue to expand its prominence nationally and internationally and further solidify its place as the pinnacle award in men’s college golf.”

Overseen by the Golf Coaches Association of America (GCAA) The Ben Hogan Award’s selection committee which votes during the semifinalist finalist and winner rounds is made up of more than 30 leaders and experts in professional amateur and collegiate golf domestically and internationally. The 2021 recipient will be named Friday June 4 at a luncheon hosted at Colonial Country Club which will honor all three finalists: Pierceson Coody of the University of Texas John Pak of Florida State University and Davis Thompson of the University of Georgia. The recipient will earn the first invitation into the PGA TOUR’s 2022 Charles Schwab Challenge.

While 2009-batch IAS officer Sindhuri has been transferred to the post of Commissioner for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments the 2014-batch officer Shilpa Nag has been appointed as Director for E-governance Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department.

Shilpa Nag had accused Rohini Sindhuri of ‘humiliating’ her and had on May 3 addressed a press conference holding up an 18-page handwritten letter to announce that she was stepping down from her post. Within hours Sindhuri released a press statement alleging dereliction of duties by Shilpa and asked her to give a detailed account utilisation of the Corporate Social Responsibility fund (CSR) of Rs 12.3 crore. Now both of the officers have been transferred. Bagadi Gautam will replace Sindhuri as the Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru and Lakshmikanth Reddy will replace Shilpa Nag as Mysore City Corporation (MCC) Commissioner.

Following the spat between the two officers Karnataka Chief Secretary P Ravi Kumar had held a meeting in Mysuru on May 4 to take stock of the COVID-19 preparedness of the district where it was learnt that both IAS officers had submitted over 100-page reports (their side of the story) to him. Shilpa Nag also tried to hand over her resignation to him but he did not accept it and instead asked her to focus on the COVID-19 related work in Mysuru.

Apart from Sindhuri and Nag the order of their transfer also states that Special Health Commissioner P Rajendra Cholan has been given additional charge as the Managing Director (MD) of Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited (BESCOM) while Dayananda KA is now a Commissioner of BBMP Administration.

Earlier the Karnataka government had ordered an inquiry against Rohini Sindhuri regarding the construction of a gym and an indoor swimming pool in her official residence.

One of Sindhuri's harshest critics in the district former minister and JD(S) leader Sa. Ra. Mahesh has been raising the issue for the last two months. He had even released documents in this connection.

However the allegations were shot down by Sindhuri who said that all the construction works at her premises were well within the frameworks of law.

The order was issued by the principal secretary to the state government on May 31 but it came to light after Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Commissioner Shilpa Nag's public outburst against Sindhuri on Thursday.

The order marked 'urgent' and addressed to the Regional Commissioner of Mysuru cites the complaints submitted by Mahesh and former MCC corporator K.V. Mallesh among others against the construction of an indoor swimming pool and gym at a cost of Rs 50 lakh in the official residence of Sindhuri which happens to be a heritage building.

The order directed the Regional Commissioner of Mysuru G.C. Prakash to investigate the matter and submit a detailed report within seven days.

Meanwhile the construction work also found mention in Nag's outburst on Thursday when she said that as MCC Commissioner she could have served a notice to Sindhuri over the issue but she did not do so.

A war of words erupted on Thursday after Nag held a press conference to announce her decision to resign from her post accusing Sindhuri of humiliating her at every step.

For Stephen Ames it’s really cool.

The professional golfer from Canada figured shooting 12-under par would at least place him in championship conversation at the 20th Principal Charity Classic. By golly he was right.

Ames was a bunch more than just being in the conversation. He stormed back from seven shots down entering Sunday’s final day to win his second seniors’ event this one by a stroke over Mike Weir.

“At the beginning of the week I actually had a number in my mind that I was trying to achieve and that was 12-under” Ames told reporters while holding the trophy on the 18th green. “I figured if I was able to shoot four under each day I figured 12 under would be a good enough number.”

Ames’ final-round 5-under 67 was enough to move up eight spots to the championship for the first time since 2017. Fellow Canadian Weir’s rise from fifth after the second round to runner-up was the result of a 3-under 69 on the par-72 6846-yard layout.

As for second-round leader Tim Herron — well he faltered and that’s putting it gently. After leading by four strokes going into the final 18 holes Herron closed with a 4-over 76 and fell into a tie for third.

“I was in grind mode” Herron said. “Even though riding a cart I got a little tired mentally. It was a little tough with the putter. (Saturday) I just had the groove. It’s weird from one day to the next day.”

He played Sunday's final five holes 3-over par while Ames was even over the same holes.

""I wasn't able to get any momentum going"" Herron said.

This tournament represented one of Des Moines’ largest outdoor gatherings since at least sometime in 2019. Let’s just say it’s been a long time. At least two years I’m guessing.

“Life is getting back to normal” said Dan Houston chairman president and CEO of Principal Financial Group. “We’re shaking hands; we’re taking that for granted. We’re having conversations 18 inches from each other. This is like this is a big step back to normalcy for me.”

Houston always has a smile while greeting people at the tournament. When I talked to him Friday morning on day one that smile was wider than normal as he tooled around the hilly Wakonda layout in a golf cart.

“It was terrible not having this last year” he said. “People were looking for things to do. We were grinding the economy down by not having the event. When you have the event it stimulates hospitality it stimulates recreation travel and entertainment.

“We didn’t want to see that happen this year so believe me we were going to push this through.”

I asked him what Iowa State can expect at the Sept. 11 Cy-Hawk football experience in — and around — Jack Trice Stadium. No further explanation was needed. He knew where this was heading.

“It’s going to be amazing” he said. “We’re going to get 10000 people each day at the golf tournament. Take that times six or so and that’s what you’re going to have in the stadium. Take that (10K) by seven or eight and that’s about what you’re going to get in the parking lots for tailgating.”

The Principal Charity Classic capped attendance at 10000 each of the three days. The most recent co-ed state track meet at Drake Stadium had daily crowds of around 10000 15000 and 10000 respectively.

Downtown Principal Park is back to crowd-normal. Our state’s plethora of auto racing tracks is at normal capacity. Ditto the Downtown Farmers' Market.

Yes this summer is our coming-out party. Our return to as close to normal as we’ve seen in a long long while.

“This is another example that people have had enough” Greg Edwards president and CEO of Catch Des Moines said while scanning the crowd Sunday afternoon. “There’s been a lot of pent-up demand. More and more people are wanting to get out and do things.”

I caught up with Edwards near the Wakonda clubhouse. Person after person walked up to him during our conversation. Great event they’d say. Great to be outdoors again.

“I think we’re going to have another Roaring '20s” Edwards said referring to what generally is described as the time between America’s past and future. “I think people are so anxious to get out and travel. And just do stuff.”

Like the 30000 or so that attended this wonderful golf tournament. Like actually playing in front of a crowd.

And for Stephen Ames ...

Like winning after starting the final day tied for ninth.

“2020 was a no-show for the year with COVID and everything going on” he said. “Look around at the crowd. It’s great to have spectators again.”

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYXdheXRvZ2FyZGVuLmNvbS9zY3VscHR1cmFsLXBvdHMtaW4tdGhlLWdhcmRlbi13aXRoLXN0ZXBoZW4tcHJvY3Rlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter,"Pin 11 11 Shares

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

The city’s tax on parking lot revenues is already set to fall to 22.5% from 25% with the expiration of a temporary tax increase passed last year but a bill introduced by Councilmember Cherelle Parker last month would lower the rate even further to 17%. At a council hearing on the bill this week officials estimated that the expiration would cost $40 million in forgone revenue over five years and another $90 million were Parker’s bill to pass.

Not long after a string of progressive elected officials and urbanist groups began raising questions about the promises that the bill would truly help parking lot employees while others criticized the bill as a handout to parking lot companies or as poor transit policy.

Councilmembers Kendra Brooks Jamie Gauthier and Helen Gym all came out publicly in opposition to the legislation on Friday a few days after the trio of progressively aligned pols also savaged business tax cuts introduced by Mayor Jim Kenney’s budget proposal.

“[Kendra] Brooks opposes all proposed tax cuts including the parking tax and is calling instead for those funds to be allocated to city services that will uplift working families and those most harmed by the pandemic” said Margaret Hart a spokesperson for the councilmember.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzA1L2JsYWNrcm9ja3Mtbm8tMS1nb2FsLWluLXdva2UtaW52ZXN0aW5nLWh1Z2UtZXNnLWZ1bmRzLWhhdWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BlackRock's 'No. 1' goal in 'woke' investing: Huge ESG-funds haul,"Progressives love the story of Engine No. 1 a small activist investor that just fought its way onto the board of what many wokesters consider the most vile company in the world: oil giant Exxon­Mobil.

Most activists — think Paul Singer and Carl Icahn — are in it for the money. Engine No. 1 wants to make money with a progressive twist: The fund’s founders argue that there’s gold in green.

These savvy veteran investors say making the world a better and greener place will translate into big earnings for companies and bigger returns for shareholders. Windmills apparently can produce efficient ­energy at a profit. Electric cars will soon be replacing gas guzzlers.

Whether this sentiment expands beyond the woke is a matter of debate. I know plenty of investors who aren’t convinced that green investing is anything more than a politically ­induced fad that will never make money and wouldn’t get financing if it weren’t for government grants. As proof they point to the world’s greenest company — electric-car maker Tesla — which feasts on government subsidies and barely turns a profit despite its much-hyped stock price.

Of course that hasn’t stopped the progressive celebrations over the news that Exxon will now have to place three reps from Engine No. 1 on its board to force change.

Engine No. 1 wants the company to figure out ways to reduce its carbon footprint which again sounds good until you realize it’s also a fancy way of saying it wants Exxon to do less of what it’s good at. And by the way what does Engine No. 1 know about running an oil company?

Giving credibility to this apparent lunacy has been one of the biggest and most profitable institutional ­investors out there: BlackRock. The $9 trillion investing monster run by Larry Fink may be the most powerful financial firm in the world because it holds shares in large doses of so many big companies and thus can ­direct corporate policy.

And guess what? BlackRock backed this no-name cadre of woke activists even as Exxon persuasively argued that Engine No. 1 wasn’t qualified to help run an oil company. With BlackRock on the fund’s side ExxonMobil eventually folded like a cheap tent.

A spokesman for Engine No. 1 and BlackRock had no comment. But a BlackRock company official said the company’s vote was a result of its concern that Exxon doesn’t have clear climate-change strategy and its long-term performance will suffer in a “low-carbon economy.”

Fink has been a huge cheerleader for so-called ESG (environmental social and corporate governance) investing. ESG is all about ensuring that companies BlackRock holds in its multitudes of funds adhere to certain progressive edicts (like executives not paying themselves too much money).

Sounds good on paper — until you drill down. For starters such investing methods are highly political and veer far to the left. Companies often get good grades for supporting lefty causes such as Black Lives Matter. Oil companies like Exxon will get higher marks for building wind farms that produce energy inefficiently.

Something else for investors to consider: These funds lately haven’t beat ­indices that are simply created to make you money and only do so when they pack themselves with high-flying tech names.

But here’s where Fink and BlackRock still come out ahead: They have sensed that with all the media hype of ESG investing as the next frontier they can also make a lot of money creating a new type of fund dedicated specifically to ESG — and then charge more for it.

My sources inside BlackRock say that over the past year Fink has transformed the place into an ESG cultural center. Fink talks ESG nonstop at company town halls. Seminars on ESG investing seem to take place every week. An executive named Brian Deese was promoted to push money managers to consider ESG in all their investment decisions.

Deese is now one of several BlackRock officials who hold key positions in the Biden administration as director of the president’s National Economic Council.

This revolving door between Washington and Wall Street gives Fink a huge voice in US economic policy. It’s no surprise that the Biden White House is issuing new environmental rules left and right to satisfy its woke base and by extension those who want woke investments which Fink is happy to provide.

By the end of the year BlackRock could have as many as 150 so-called exchange-traded funds that adhere to ESG standards. ETFs are supposed to carry lower fees than normal funds because they mirror a typical basket of stocks like the S&P 500.

But with ESG screening methods BlackRock has found a way to inflate management fees of this seemingly prosaic investment. In fact studies show that management fees on ESG funds are more than 40 percent higher than other ETFs.

BlackRock currently manages about $200 billion in ESG client money which means that number is likely to grow and add to BlackRock’s profits.

Now with Engine No. 1 likely to occupy three seats on Exxon’s board it isn’t too much of a stretch to see the company passing Fink’s ESG screens for his ETFs with flying colors.

In short Fink will look like a darl­ing to Democratic politicians he’ll get a lot of left-leaning rich people to put cash in what they feel are “moral” stocks — and he’ll laugh all the way to the bank.

Will the rest of the investors make money? Quibbles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYW1hem9uLXdhbG1hcnQtbWNkb25hbGRzLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zaG93LXByaWRlLWRvbmF0ZWQtYW50aS1sZ2J0cS1wb2xpdGljaWFucy0yMDIxLTbSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FtYXpvbi13YWxtYXJ0LW1jZG9uYWxkcy1jb21wYW5pZXMtc2hvdy1wcmlkZS1kb25hdGVkLWFudGktbGdidHEtcG9saXRpY2lhbnMtMjAyMS02P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big companies celebrate Pride but gave to anti-LGBTQ politicians,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDYvMDQvc2VjLWZpcmVzLXJlcHVibGljYW4td2F0Y2hkb2ctNDkxOTM50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SEC fires Republican audit watchdog after push from Warren Sanders,"Warren said Duhnke’s removal was “absolutely the right move” and she signaled that she would push for a bigger shakeup. The SEC which is also responsible for hiring the PCAOB’s leaders may grant her wish. The agency said it would seek candidates for all five of the regulator’s board positions even as three of its members who serve five-year terms remain in place.

“Our auditing process needs to be independent and with integrity” Warren said in a Twitter post. “Let’s replace the other members with people who live up to the agency’s mission.”

While the PCAOB is little known to people outside of finance the demands by Warren and Sanders show the extent to which progressives are trying to reshape regulation with Democrats in control of Washington. Among their goals is that the PCAOB join the campaign to force companies to disclose their role in climate change one of the most controversial issues confronting corporate America.

The left’s effort to overhaul audit oversight is triggering pushback not only from Republicans but also business groups and some government watchdogs who warn that throwing out the board members threatens the political independence of the PCAOB’s operations.

As part of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act Congress established the PCAOB to bolster oversight of how publicly traded companies are audited. Lawmakers decided to create the new independent body which operates as a nonprofit corporation after accounting scandals called into question the reliability of financial information that companies provide to investors.

The Washington-based regulator was tasked with policing major audit firms such as KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers that public companies pay to ensure the accuracy of their financial statements. The SEC serves as the PCAOB’s overseer and SEC commissioners are responsible for appointing PCAOB leadership.

The SEC which is led by three Democratic commissioners and two Republican commissioners did not provide a breakdown of the votes it took Thursday. But the agency’s GOP commissioners on Friday rebuked the decision to remove Duhnke who before being appointed to lead the PCAOB in 2017 served as longtime aide to Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.).

In a joint statement Republican SEC Commissioners Hester Peirce and Elad Roisman — who also served as aides to Shelby — said they had concerns about “the hasty and truncated decision-making process underlying this action.” They said it set a “troubling precedent for the commission’s ongoing oversight of the PCAOB and for the appointment process.”

“Although the commission has the authority to remove PCAOB members from their posts without cause in all of our actions we should act with fair process fully-informed deliberation and equanimity none of which characterized the commission’s actions here” they said. “Instead the commission has proceeded in an unprecedented manner that is unmoored from any practical standard that could be meaningfully applied in the future.”

Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee said it amounted to a politicization of the PCAOB and that “I will be holding Mr. Gensler accountable for this decision.”

“Chairman Gensler appears to be treating the PCAOB like a political football beholden to a left-wing Democrat commission that panders to progressives like Elizabeth Warren” McHenry said. “If this is the case it’s unclear why the PCAOB should continue to exist as a separate entity from the SEC going forward.”

While it alarmed Republicans Friday’s announcement may help ease tensions between the left and Gensler whose relationship with long-time liberal allies was becoming strained in the early days of his SEC tenure.

Progressives first applauded when President Joe Biden nominated Gensler to serve as Wall Street’s top cop because of his Obama-era chairmanship of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission where he cracked down on big banks. But in April Gensler infuriated many of his biggest advocates when he hired a corporate defense lawyer to lead SEC enforcement. The enforcement director stepped down days later amid concerns about her conduct in a case representing ExxonMobil. The episode left Gensler facing fierce scrutiny from his former champions and Wall Street reformers are now trying to keep pressure on the SEC chair.

“He had a tremendous reputation coming out of his time [in the Obama administration] for a willingness to pick big fights” said Revolving Door Project executive director Jeff Hauser who has been calling for the PCAOB leadership’s ouster. “The question is is he still that Gary Gensler?”

Gensler said in a statement Friday that the PCAOB “has an opportunity to live up to Congress’s vision.”

“I look forward to working with my fellow commissioners Acting Chair DesParte and the staff of the PCAOB to set it on a path to better protect investors by ensuring that public company audits are informative accurate and independent” Gensler said.

The PCAOB has faced a series of scandals since its launch that have called into question its ability to police conflicts of interests in corporate audits.

William Webster the first chair that the SEC appointed to lead the PCAOB resigned after just a few weeks on the job because of revelations that he served on the board of a company accused of accounting fraud. In 2018 prosecutors charged former PCAOB employees with leaking confidential information on inspection plans to KPMG one of the “Big Four” accounting firms.

A 2019 report from the Project on Government Oversight found that over 16 years the PCAOB brought only 18 enforcement cases involving 21 audits against the four leading accounting firms even though it cited 808 instances where the companies issued defective audits.

In 2017 as the KPMG leak scandal began to unfold the SEC declined to reappoint the PCAOB’s existing board members and replaced them with five new leaders including Duhnke who as chair secured one of the most coveted jobs in Washington with a salary of $670000.

In the eyes of Warren and Sanders the SEC’s move to clean house in the Trump era did nothing to strengthen the PCAOB’s oversight of the finance industry.

In a letter to Gensler on May 25 the lawmakers said the new board was populated with “partisan cronies with a deregulatory agenda and little relevant experience.” They said the PCAOB under Duhnke moved to weaken audit standards and that enforcement actions plummeted. Duhnke himself has faced internal complaints about his conduct and a wrongful termination lawsuit.

Before news broke of Duhnke’s firing PCAOB officials defended their track record in recent years. Duhnke said that preliminary inspection results for the largest U.S. audit firms in 2020 “show the greatest improvement in audit quality in the past decade.” PCAOB spokesperson Jackie Cottrell said the board was allocating substantial and increasing resources to enforcement priorities with an emphasis on cases involving significant audit failures. Cottrell also said that the termination lawsuit claims were “baseless.”

But progressives warned it was an urgent priority the SEC to revamp the PCAOB as investors pile in to a surging stock market and a rush of private firms try to take advantage of the boom by going public through special-purpose acquisition companies. They also see the PCAOB as key to supporting a likely push by the SEC to force public companies to disclose their contributions and exposure to climate change.

The demand to start fresh with the PCAOB board presents a tough choice for Gensler who declined to comment for this story. Some government watchdogs are warning that removing the entire board may make matters worse.

“There’s no room for politics on an audit board” said Project on Government Oversight policy analyst Tim Stretton. “Starting fresh every four or eight years with a new administration would inherently make this board partisan.”

Business groups are also warning the SEC against removing the PCAOB board.

“The bipartisan Sarbanes-Oxley legislation established the PCAOB in such a manner to keep politics out of financial reporting” said Tom Quaadman executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness. “Firing the board would be a giant leap backwards and endanger audit quality.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzA1L2FuZHJldy15YW5nLWFuZC1lcmljLWFkYW1zLWxlYWRpbmctZGVtb2NyYXRzLWluLW55LW1heW9ycy1yYWNlLWFyZS1iYWNrZWQtYnktZ29wLWJpbGxpb25haXJlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andrew Yang and Eric Adams leading Democrats in N.Y. mayor's race are backed by GOP billionaires,"General elections in New York City have become almost an afterthought and nearly everyone assumes that the winner of this month's Democratic primary will be elected the city's mayor later this year. It appears that billionaire hedge fund managers who have previously donated millions to conservative Republicans are now using their wealth to try to shape that Democratic primary to their liking — specifically by blocking a progressive Democrat from becoming mayor of the nation's largest city.

Former presidential also-ran Andrew Yang and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams widely seen as the two leading candidates in the crowded New York race have sometimes tried to claim progressive credentials something of a necessity in the city's current political climate. (Although outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio has become a highly controversial figure he was handily elected twice while strongly aligned with the progressive movement.)

But Yang and Adams have also attracted the financial backing of hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin who spent more than $60 million to back Republicans in last year's elections and fellow hedge fund billionaire Dan Loeb who has given tens of millions to Republican candidates and conservative PACs over the past decade. Yang has also gained the support of libertarian billionaire investor Jeff Yass who has donated more than $25 million to Republicans and whose company was the main funder of a PAC that pushed the false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from former President Donald Trump.

The three billionaires have a ""history of funding the most extremist racist and anti-democratic forces within the Republican Party"" said a report from Our City a progressive super PAC that opposes Yang and Adams.

The longtime investors appear to be hedging their bets in the city's ranked-choice primary where voters can rank up to five candidates in order of preference. But Yang and Adams' progressive rivals along with many activists worry that the billionaire right-wingers are trying to buy power in a city where Republicans are virtually an endangered species.

""They're not satisfied with just owning one candidate — they want two"" City Comptroller Scott Stringer a mayoral candidate running to the left of Yang and Adams warned last month.

Republicans are increasingly outnumbered in the Big Apple winning just 27% of the vote in the last mayoral election so in a sense it's logical for GOP donors to seek out new and unlikely allies to continue to exert their influence.

""Within this primary is a fight between Democrats and Republicans"" Gabe Tobias a former senior adviser to Justice Democrats and the executive director of Our City said in an interview with Salon. ""There are Democrats who are more progressive and some others who are trying to put forward a progressive image because that's what they have to do to win this election."" But in reality he said ""if it were an open general election"" those pseudo-progressive candidates would likely align with Republicans.

Griffin Loeb and Yass have each donated $500000 to the pro-Yang Comeback PAC which is run by Lis Smith a top aide to former Democratic presidential contender (and now Transportation Secretary) Pete Buttigieg Politico first reported. Griffin and Loeb gave the same amount to the pro-Adams Strong Leadership NYC PAC which is run by Jenny Sedlis a longtime charter school advocate.

Super PACs have become the vehicle of choice for wealthy donors to wield influence in politics in the wake of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision even as New York has rolled out a new public campaign financing program that provides matching funds to qualifying candidates in an effort to boost grassroots campaigns.

""Citizens United has created a terrible situation with endless amounts of money pouring in from super-wealthy individuals to try and influence policy"" Susan Lerner executive director of the good-government nonprofit Common Cause NY said in an interview with Salon. ""The Supreme Court has basically turned on the money spigot and it's simply bad for democracy.""

Super PACs are allowed to raise unlimited sums but are prohibited from directly coordinating with political campaigns. Yang and Adams have denied they had anything to do with the billionaire donations but critics say the contributions undermine the two candidates' appeals to the city's growing progressive base.

""Where your money comes from matters just as much as having a lot of money"" Max Burns a Democratic consultant and founder of Third Degree Strategies said on Twitter. ""When you're in bed with snakes like Griffin and willingly take his money that says a lot about your values.""

Griffin the founder and CEO of Citadel and one of the richest people in Illinois recently bought a Manhattan penthouse for a record $240 million. He has largely supported Republicans last year contributing $39 million to the Senate Leadership Fund a super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and $15 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund a super PAC affiliated with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. He previously contributed more than $1 million to Future 45 a pro-Trump super PAC. He has also occasionally donated to Democrats notably including embattled New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo a longtime foe of the state's progressive wing.

In his home state of Illinois Griffin spent $20 million to try to kill tax increases for the rich in 2020 according to the Our City report prompting a protest by the Service Employees International Union which accused him of ""hurtful racist greed.""

Burns told Salon that while Griffin has donated to both Republicans and Democrats the reason to feel ""concern about those massive contributions is more about values than partisanship.""

""What Yang's folks don't see or don't want to see is that the common denominator is Griffin (and megadonors like him) donate to candidates they're confident will play ball"" Burns said in an email.

""Democrats can't and shouldn't ever be the people playing ball with the super-rich they have enough people looking out for them in the GOP already. Either we're the party trying to build a New York that works for everyone or we're a party at least partially under the sway of hedge fund tycoons whose interests are directly opposed to our values. But we can't be both.""

Loeb a former Democrat who left the party in 2010 over opposition to former President Barack Obama has donated millions to the Congressional Leadership Fund Senate Leadership Fund the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He gave $27 million to the conservative pro-LGBTQ American Unity PAC which supported supposed Republican moderates like Sen. Susan Collins R-Maine and Rep. Elise Stefanik R-N.Y. according to Sludge. Loeb has also donated to Cuomo and various liberal causes but has funded super PACs that attacked progressive lawmakers like Rep. Ilhan Omar D-Minn. and Rep. Jamaal Bowman D-N.Y. according to the Our City report.

Loeb is a longtime charter school advocate who served as chairman of the Success Academy Charter Schools network which Sedlis co-founded. He stepped down in 2018 after accusing New York State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins who is Black of inflicting ""more damage to people of color than anyone who has ever donned a hood"" while raging against unions. Sedlis continued to defend Loeb as he came under fire for other racially charged comments and as Democrats and progressive groups faced calls to return his ""tainted"" cash.

The Success Academy network was ordered to pay $2.4 million in a disability discrimination judgment earlier this year after five Black students with learning and other disabilities alleged that one of the schools created a list of students it wanted to force out.

Yass co-founder of the investment firm Susquehanna International Group is a board member of the libertarian Cato Institute and the second-largest donor to Club for Growth Action an anti-union super PAC that backs numerous Republicans who tried to overturn the election including Sens. Ted Cruz R-Texas and Josh Hawley R-Mo. Yass also donated millions to a super PAC that backed the brief 2016 presidential campaign of Sen. Rand Paul R-Ky. and gave $8.6 million to the Protect Freedom PAC which promoted ""Stop the Steal"" conspiracy theories after Trump's election loss. Yass has since tried to distance himself from the false election claims in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Yass who was a key backer of the Students First PAC a group affiliated with former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' American Federation for Children told Politico that he supports Yang because he supports charter schools and has criticized teacher unions.

""Andrew has a lot of libertarian leanings"" he told the outlet. ""He is not quite a libertarian to say the least but he has those leanings.""

Tobias agreed that Yang's proposals are tinged with libertarian ideology noting that his universal basic income plan is a ""darling of libertarians"" because it would ""give people small amounts of cash and then cut social programs.""

These longtime Republican donors target ""people who they think will help them exercise the power that they want to have"" Tobias said. ""If they think that's going to be Democrats they'll donate"" with the goal of exercising power through a connection to a winning candidate.

""They really don't care about anything but their own political power and when that means aligning themselves with the most extreme far-right racist anti-democratic elements of the Republican Party they're more than happy to do that"" he continued. ""That kind of influence to me is so anathema to anything that Democrats in New York City want it's preposterous.""

Yang and Adams have both said they have nothing to do with the donations or the super PACs as required by law. But Tobias argued that the candidates' refusal to denounce the support of billionaires who have funded the extremist wings of the far right amounts to ""tacit acceptance"" of their support.

These billionaires have framed their support around charter schools. Adams is a supporter of charters while Yang used his own money to help start a charter school in Manhattan. Yang has called for increasing the number of charter schools in the city and has criticized the teachers' union for delaying school reopenings amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Charter schools which are funded by the government but privately run offer students an alternative to struggling public schools especially in poorer areas advocates say. But teacher unions have long opposed charter schools since they are largely not unionized and have accused charter schools of manipulating admissions to cherrypick students who are most likely to do well while consigning the neediest students to underfunded and struggling public schools.

The national American Federation of Teachers and New York's United Federation of Teachers have launched their own super PAC NY4Kids to support Stringer the city comptroller who has repeatedly railed against his opponents for being aligned with Republican megadonors.

These big GOP donors ""are funding Eric Adams' and Andrew Yang's campaigns because they are determined to buy City Hall"" Stringer said in a statement last month adding ""We can't let anyone — whether they're a Republican a former Republican or a corporate Democrat — undermine public education.""

Stringer's backers at UFT are backing legislation to make charter schools more accountable and calling to roll back the 2017 Trump tax cuts and raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy to boost public school funding.

Stringer assailed Yang over his wealthy backers during a mayoral debate last Wednesday noting that Yang's own supporters have described him as an ""empty vessel"" who is devoid of government experience or policy views.

""I don't think you're an empty vessel"" Stringer quipped. ""I think you're a Republican.""

Stringer was referring to comments made by Bradley Tusk a former aide to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich who has since made a fortune as a venture capitalist and adviser to companies like Uber.

Tusk helped recruit Yang into this year's mayoral race and Yang's top aides all work for his lobbying firm Tusk Strategies according to City & State. Tusk Strategies is also registered to lobby on behalf of the tech firms Latch and Bird in front of the city that Yang would run if he wins according to Sludge.

Tusk's relationship with Yang highlights a growing problem which Susan Lerner of Common Cause described as a ""new class of influencers"" who are a ""hybrid between consultants and lobbyists"" and ""in essence are setting themselves up to be a shadow government.""

In earlier political eras she said ""Campaign consultants were campaign consultants and lobbyists were lobbyists and they were not some blending of the two. Typically the people who worked on a campaign to elect an individual follow that individual into government and take a position in the administration"" thereby becoming ""accountable to the people."" She is concerned that someone like Tusk operating behind the scenes ""appears to want to set himself up as the shadow mayor.""

After media reports highlighted the glaring conflicts of interest in Tusk Strategies' relationship with Yang Tusk published a Medium essay vowing not to lobby Yang or his staff on issues that ""intersect"" with his business interests. He did not say the same about other people at his company. Tusk also vowed to disclose all interactions with the city and said no one from his firm would raise money for Yang if he is elected.

Tobias expressed skepticism over those promises saying that Tusk and other super-wealthy supporters have ""invested a lot of money a lot of time because they want a candidate like Yang who will do the things that they want to do"" he said. ""It seems pretty clear-cut and they didn't even deny that.""

Lerner said there is a dangerous lack of regulations surrounding this new version of backstage influence-peddling in politics: ""Our regulatory system has to figure out how to deal with this so that there's not a continuing threat of undue influence by people who are not accountable to the public."""

Commercial real estate developer Dick Anagnost of Anagnost Investments and The Landing at Nashua LLC are planning on resuscitating the large parcel at 2 East Spit Brook Road which has remained vacant for almost 20 years.

The site sits down East Spit Brook between Old Navy and a Gulf station.

“This proposed Costco Warehouse would be a relocation of the existing Costco that is currently in Nashua” Matt Bruton of BL Companies one of the engineering firms involved with the project told Nashua city planners in April. “They have outgrown that current location and are looking to create a new store to their current standards.”

Anagnost said when he acquired the land at 2 East Spit Brook Road in 2018 for $7.1 million there was no plan to move Costco there.

“When we originally purchased that land I didn’t have as much a plan as it was still contaminated” he said. “We’re the ones who got the Brownfields clean-up done and got the Brownsfields designation. I had to do that before I could figure out a development scheme.”

Previously Anagnost told The Telegraph that the parcel “was the last property of its size in that area – the last major parcel on Daniel Webster Highway in South Nashua.”

The proposal calls for a nearly 157000 square-foot Costco store 800 parking spaces a Costco gas station with nine fueling stations to accommodate 18 vehicles and a three-story True Storage facility.

Anagnost said the concept for that land has always been “twirling around in the back of my head” and he is a big proponent of commuter rail in the region.

“It’s very close to the Mass border” he said. “It’s only nine miles from the Lowell transit station for trains. And it has the side spur so I’ve always had the multi-modal kind of development idea there that would put the first train station in New Hampshire essentially just across the Nashua border.”

It’s built for it Anagnost said adding “I was building in my head a design around the train station.”

Costco did approach Anagnost at one point but the time schedule that they wanted was “too aggressive” for AI at the time. Later Costco’s schedule eased and they and Anagnost began negotiations again.

“They became the centerpiece of the development” he said.

Additionally developers said the site allows for restaurant with retail and office space.

Several years ago the former Hampshire Chemical site also the former W.R. Grace property was listed in a study as one of three possible commuter train stops if commuter rail returns to Nashua.

“As you can see this is a very large project” Fuss & O’Neill’s Brian Pratt told the planning board. F&O and another engineering firm.

Anagnost said that traffic issues have never been a problem with the new proposed location for Costco which is set down East Spit Brook road several hundred feet.

“No” he said “Everybody has welcomed us. There was concern about the size of signs among the neighbors but then they realized we’re 650 feet down the roadway.”

The only “neighbor” to raise a traffic concern was BJ’s Wholesale Club located down the DW near Lowes; BJ’s is planning on opening a members-only gas station on Allen Mello’s property located on Adventure Way.

“We have solutions to what they’re talking about” Anagnost said. “But other than that we’ve not had anybody talk to us to complain about traffic issues.”

In fact for anyone who’s tried to access Costco at their current location at 311 DW Highway address right next to Long’s Jewelers they know traffic congestion when they’re sitting in it.

“Actually our plan would alleviate a bunch of the problems at that intersection” Anagnost said. “When you take out the Costco what replaces it won’t be as traffic-heavy as Costo’s. So that intersection will become better.”

Anagnost said once they get city approvals within 30 days site work will begin. It will take six to seven months to complete that pushing the timeframe to January or February of 2022.

According to the plans on file at Nashua City Hall improvements that are proposed at the East Spit Brook Road and Daniel Webster Highway intersection will aim to increase vehicle capacity in that area and the project will also improve the municipal storm water system at the east end of East Spit Brook Road.

“This property has been vacant for over 15 years” Fuss & O’Neill senior project engineer Amy Sanders said. “The development of the gas station Costco Wholesale and the self-storage facility will increase the property value and promote future economic development including future pad sites and a municipal train station. This development will provide a strong economic community that will foster additional future development.”

Residents also lined up for more than an hour to ask questions of Frank and the team putting together the more than $200 million project with most of those questions centering on financing and the development’s potential impact on Richmond Heights Schools.

California-based DealPoint Merrill sought to make the event festive by providing live music free frozen custard Belle Oaks T-shirts and water to those in attendance.

A member of that team Bialosky Cleveland architect Paul Deutsch told of plans for the mixed-use development which will fill over two construction phases 1.5 million square feet with 800 luxury apartments retail stores a resort-style pool a dog park a large pond a path circling the property and more.

As he spoke renderings were shown on a large screen set up to the left of the covered stage upon which the planners talked.

Frank told of how DealPoint began its association with the city four years ago with its purchase of the mall’s former Macy’s building and its subsequent conversion to a self-storage facility.

The pandemic has held up the project’s progress but Chip Marous who heads Marous Brothers Construction (which built Richmond Heights City Hall) said his crew will start work in about three months. The first undertaking will be the demolition of the mall which has stood since its 1966 opening.

DealPoint Merrill CEO David Frank addresses those in attendance at an event held Saturday at Richmond Town Square to answer questions about the Belle Oaks Marketplace project. (Jeff Piorkowski special to cleveland.com)

Construction on the two phases is expected to take about three years with the first phase -- including 375 apartments the pool and the pond -- set to open sometime in 2023.

There was no mention Saturday of the expected sale of the mall to DealPoint by mall owner Michael Kohan. DealPoint owns the former Sears building and its lot on the mall’s northern end as well as the Life Storage (formerly CubeSmart formerly Macy’s) building. Plans call for Life Storage the Regal Cinema and Planet Fitness to remain as parts of the new development.

“The purpose of this little event is to share with you as our family of Richmond Heights” Frank told the crowd. “To give you an idea of what we anticipate happening on this property.

“We’re here to address your questions your concerns your comments and we’ll address them all. Truly this is your event and not ours.”

DealPoint Merrill President Sterling McGregor said the development will be supported by 400000 square feet of “daily-needs retail.”

“Daily needs is the stuff you use all the time” he said. “Grocery stores gyms gasoline banks health and wellness (and) entertainment -- all the things that you want every day at your fingertips. And that’s what this community (Belle Oaks) is going to have.

“It’s a live-work-play community. You can live here work here and play here and have lots of things to do in terms of the amenities.

“The center of this project will have a central park with large promenade that goes completely through the entire project” McGregor said. “It’s a park-like setting and that’s going to be a very attractive way to live.”

Jeff Pongonis a landscape architect with the firm MKSK of Columbus said the project will produce “a neighborhood not a development.”

“It’s a very walkable community and very much focused on the kind of pedestrian amenities that we think folks will find pleasurable in a neighborhood” he said.

In all DealPoint is seeking two 15-year tax abatements over which Richmond Heights Schools Superintendent Renee Willis has voiced concern. Willis is concerned that the 800 apartments will include children who will use the city’s public schools but that the school district will not be properly compensated. If those children were to use vouchers to go to private schools the district would lose further state funding.

The entire issue is complicated by the fact that the southern end of the mall site -- which is to be constructed as the second phase of development and which will include more than 400 apartments and retail -- lies within the South Euclid-Lyndhurst School District.

Caleb Bell a lawyer with the Ohio law firm Bricker & Eckler which is handling the project’s financing answered a good deal of audience questions.

Bell called Belle Oaks a “special” project because of the many amenities it will offer.

“We helped this project get financing from the world to come in and pay for many of the amenities that you need -- public parks open streets the walkways and pathways that were mentioned (by previous speakers).

“If a developer doesn’t have any type of bond financing” Bell said “they don’t have the ability to both get the quality in the development and also get all those amenities in the ground. So projects of this scale use bond financing. They use very long-term bond financing.”

He said development projects such as Cleveland’s east bank of The Flats and Pinecrest in Orange as well as others around Ohio have used at least 30-year bond financing. Because of Belle Oaks’ large price tag he said it is in need of long-term financing as well.

Bell also made clear that the city is not paying for the amenities and is not issuing its bonds or guaranteeing the project.

“That’s really important for you as community members because your elected officials want to bring you quality but they also don’t want to put it on your back” he said.

He also added when questioned about how much Richmond Heights Schools would receive from the project that as the mostly closed mall now exists it is paying property tax but not much else. With millions of dollars of investment on the Richmond Heights portion of the mall its value will increase and those living in the apartments will pay income taxes.

Speaking during the question-and-answer portion of the event Terry Butler a former Richmond Heights school board member and current member of the city’s Planning & Zoning Commission asked Frank about an open letter DealPoint posted last year.

The letter concerned the school district’s request for a lump sum of $3 million from the developer to put an end to negotiations on a tax payroll split between the schools and DealPoint. DealPoint wouldn’t give that amount (it offered $300000) which Willis said meant that the district was forced to put on last November’s ballot a 5.9-mill operating levy. Voters turned down that levy request.

The DealPoint open letter accused Willis of fiscal irresponsibility and led to hard feelings on the part of the school board.

“You have demonstrated somewhat of a willingness to alienate our residents to a certain extent by denouncing our superintendent” Butler said to Frank. “Our superintendent who led the building right down the street of a (new school) building that should be attracting people to Belle Oaks.”

Butler asked Frank to negotiate with the schools to determine if a satisfactory deal can be reached. Butler said he doesn’t want to see an instance in which DealPoint gets its tax abatement then later sells off Belle Oaks to a management company and leaves the Richmond Heights Schools with a 30-year tax abatement.

“We need something to fix the relationship between Belle Oaks and our schools” Butler said backed by audience applause.

Frank responded by stating that negotiations are still open with the schools. He said that Willis has been invited to see architectural plans the school board has met with the project team to go over plans and that the project team has submitted two written offers to the school board.

“Further” Frank said “there have been subsequent meetings with members of the school board and superintendent with (City) Council.

“I’d be happy again to meet with the school board the superintendent or the (school board) president” Frank added. “No way in the world do I want to give you the impression that I am close-minded or the team is close-minded to make a deal with the school district.”

Butler said there is still a belief among the community that “this is not a good deal with us.”

Frank said he agreed with Butler and that he would “love” to work to come to an agreement.

The average suburban church in the United States of any denomination can look uncannily like a big-box store or self-storage center set back far from the road and surrounded by an ocean of asphalt. And unlike the parking lots at those other suburban mainstays most church lots are empty six days a week.

Christ Church Fairfax Station Va. (Addison Del Mastro)

Perhaps the location of churches along suburban arterial roads says something about our society’s attitude toward the centrality of faith. Or perhaps it merely follows from the land-use rules that shape sprawl in general including regulations that stipulate a minimum number of parking spots based on a building’s use.

While suburban churches on large lots are often associated with Protestant “megachurches” there’s a supersizing trend in Catholic parishes too in response to the shift of the U.S. Catholic population away from older Northern cities and toward the South and West. In many of our newer parishes which often serve large but dispersed Catholic populations there is no practical alternative to being near a highway and providing a large parking area. But parishes can still think about how to use their properties in more holistic ways. One big question: What could be done with parking lots outside of weekends and holy days?

While suburban churches on large lots are often associated with Protestant “megachurches” there’s a supersizing trend in Catholic parishes too.

In most places zoning laws make it hard to repurpose all that space for anything but parking but as the last year has shown us parking lots and car-centric streets can indeed become more useful outdoor spaces. Sprawling church properties made open-air Masses and drive-through confession possible during the most difficult days of the pandemic. They can also be used as staging areas for disaster relief and can aid in the sheltering of people experiencing homelessness. Such uses can clash with zoning ordinances or fire regulations; for example even temporary shelters can be construed as a “residential” use on a property without residential zoning. But there can be workarounds: A temporary ordinance in Palo Alto Calif. which took effect early this year permits churches to temporarily house people sleeping in vehicles.

Other churches occasionally hold farmers’ markets opening their otherwise dormant parking lots to small business owners regardless of religious affiliation. But this can generate problems too. In 2009 several churches around Spokane Wash. were ordered to close their parking-lot farmers’ markets or pay taxes on the real estate. The issue was that operating even a very small-scale commercial business on tax-exempt land was not allowed even if it was not the church itself engaging in the commercial activity.

Churches occasionally hold farmers’ markets opening their otherwise dormant parking lots to small business owners regardless of religious affiliation.

This is not an issue in all municipalities but certainly many churches’ legal counsel would advise avoiding activities that have the potential to bring legal scrutiny or jeopardize tax-exempt status. And many with a small staff and busy clergy do not have the capacity to take on the zoning board.

Some churches however have gone big. In late 2019 a coalition of housing advocates and mostly Protestant houses of worship under the banner “Yes in God’s Back Yard” successfully lobbied the city of San Diego to ease parking minimums and permit affordable housing on formerly mandated parking space around churches. As of 2020 at least one San Diego church has gone forward with such a housing project.

Pasadena Calif. has been considering liberalizing its own parking minimums also with an eye toward allowing churches to make fuller use of their properties. And a California bill signed into law in September 2020 “prohibits local agencies from denying a housing project proposed on property owned by religious institutions solely on the basis of parking.” (In 2020 the California legislature also considered a more ambitious statewide “YIGBY” bill modeled on the San Diego reform but that one died in committee.)

For Catholic parishes similar explorations may be better suited for the diocesan rather than the parish level. While this can make activism more difficult for individual parishes it can also allow creative ideas to be implemented on a large scale and advocacy at the diocesan level can accompany efforts to achieve zoning reforms on a regional or statewide basis.

It is easy to look at empty sprawling parking lots and wonder if by not paying taxes the churches they belong to are somehow failing to be productive—financially anyway. But a more fruitful framing would be to focus not on extracting tax revenue but on enabling houses of worship to use their own real estate more productively. Some may already want to and it is ironic that they are forced to seek permits or engage in lobbying to do so. Bad incentives and a byzantine land-use regime are often the province of libertarians or policy wonks but they affect everybody every day. Loosening them would make our communities stronger. It could help reduce reliance on the automobile. And in the social and environmental spirit of “Laudato Si’” it might even help protect our common home.

A number of tipsters pointed out that Lenovo mentioned TSMC as the supplier for Qualcomm’s chips but two of those tipsters believe that Samsung will provide the technology to not just help develop the next-generation Snapdragon 895 but also its own Exynos 2200.

Qualcomm May Not Have an Option to Opt for TSMC as Apple Was Previously Reported to Have Secured Initial 4nm Chip Supply

According to MauriQHD who has had a solid track record in these past few months has heard from his source ‘Hades’ that both the Snapdragon 895 and Exynos 2200 will be made using Samsung’s 4nm process. With the Exynos 2200 it is obvious that the Korean giant’s advanced node would be used but what could compel Qualcomm to stick with Samsung?

A while back it was reported that Samsung would be mass producing the next-generation Snapdragon X65 5G modem using its 4nm technology so that partnership alone could fuel evidence that the Snapdragon 895 would be made on the same node. Also keep in mind that earlier Qualcomm reportedly paid Samsung $850 million to mass produce the Snapdragon 888 so both of them might have secured an agreement for this very moment.

Samsung Foundry makes the next Snapdragon AP (Waipio maybe 895) and Exynos 2200.

Both are 4nm not 5nm.

Samsung renamed their 5LPA (3rd Gen 5nm) -> 4LPE (1st Gen 4nm).

Because there is no performance difference between 5LPA and 4LPE. from my source Hades (7/8 correct) pic.twitter.com/pXNT5kAifJ — Mauri QHD (@MauriQHD) June 5 2021

TSMC might not have been a cost-effective option for the San Diego firm despite the Taiwanese manufacturer possessing superior nodes than Samsung. Another reason could be that TSMC’s 4nm capacity is already booked with Apple securing the initial supply for not just the upcoming node but for the 3nm process too so from this angle it looks like Qualcomm will have to put faith in Samsung once again.

Will the performance and power efficiency of both the Snapdragon 895 and Exynos 2200 be adversely impacted due to Samsung’s 4nm technology? We will have to see once detailed thermals and other tests are conducted so stay tuned for more details.

The event is unique in multiple ways. It will be the first time SummerSlam has been held in an NFL stadium and also takes place on Saturday rather than Sunday as is tradition for WWE pay-per-view events.

Photo by Michael Dougherty/VTDigger

Jay Peak receiver Michael Goldberg has reached a $32.5 million settlement in a lawsuit he brought against former attorneys for Ariel Quiros the resort’s past owner.

The lawsuit alleged those lawyers allowed millions of dollars to be bilked from investors in projects in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom headed by Quiros.

The proposed settlement outlined in a Friday court filing is among the largest reached yet in the financial scandal with the various parties associated with it including other law firms banks and the developers.

Other larger ones include a $150 million settlement reached with Raymond James & Associates a financial institution that had been used by Quiros in carrying out the alleged fraud.

The latest proposed settlement stems from a lawsuit filed nearly two years ago in Miami where Quiros lives and many of his businesses are based. The suit was brought against lawyer David Gordon of New York City and the firm where he works Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp LLP.

The proposed settlement agreement calls for the firm to pay the receiver $32.5 million. After fees and other expenses according to the filing about $10 million will go to operations of the receivership which includes running the properties at the center of the fraud scandal Jay Peak and Burke Mountain ski resorts.

Roughly $20 million will go to investors who put money into development projects headed by Quiros and his former business partner Bill Stenger Jay Peak’s former CEO and president who have “allowed claims.”

Exactly which group of investors that includes was not clear in the filing and Goldberg could not be reached for comment. How much each investor would receive would be determined by the court according to the settlement agreement.

More than 800 foreign investors put at least $500000 each into a series of projects led by Quiros and Stenger over a decade.

The investors made their investments through the federal EB-5 visa program with the hope of obtaining green cards or permanent U.S. residency if the money they put into the projects created a required number of jobs.

Many of the investors were left out of their investments and their chance of green cards after regulators brought the projects to a halt in 2016 terming the financing by the developers a “Ponzi-like” scheme.

The proposed settlement filed Friday stated that Goldberg and his receivership may not need all of the $10 million set aside to keep the resorts afloat in which case additional funds can go to those investors with “allowable claims.”

“Given the uncertainties associated with the COVID19 crisis the funds will be held for such purposes at this juncture in an abundance of caution” the filing stated.

The deal is contingent on a federal judge granting a bar order which would protect the law firm from any future lawsuit by investors related to the Jay Peak EB-5 projects. The bar order would not apply to any legal matter brought by federal or state agencies.

“In colloquial terms” the proposed settlement agreement stated “MSK’s willingness to settle — for $32500000 — is contingent upon ‘global peace’ with respect to all claims that could be asserted against the MSK Released Parties relating in any way whatsoever to the EB-5 Actions the Receivership Entities or MSK’s Activities.”

“The settlement does not constitute a finding of liability or wrongdoing” MSK stated in an emailed response late Sunday. “While we strongly contest the claims we decided to settle this lawsuit to avoid distraction from our core mission and the cost of litigating the matter to success.”

Michael Pieciak commissioner of the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation called the agreement a “significant settlement” that will benefit Jay Peak investors as well as the resorts facing financial uncertainty due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

“The fraud in the Northeast Kingdom” Pieciak said in a statement issued Friday “caused significant harm to the investors and the community and today’s settlement is another big step forward toward healing and financial restitution.”

Goldberg’s lawsuit brought against MSK accused the law firm of playing a role in the scandal.

“MSK’s and Gordon’s conduct fell below the standard of care for any attorneys let alone those holding themselves out as experts in the areas of securities and corporate law and breached fiduciary duties owed to the Receivership Entities” the lawsuit stated.

The lawsuit included claims against Gordon and the firm of legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty. The law firm according to the proposed settlement denied wrongdoing in reaching the agreement.

Gordon represented Quiros and other entities connected to Quiros from mid-2013 through March 2017 and according to the lawsuit had racked up along with “local counsel” nearly $3 million in legal bills.

In March 2017 Quioros fired Gordon as well as other members of his legal team representing him at that time accusing them of keeping him in the dark and overcharging him.

According to the receiver’s lawsuit shortly after signing up to serve as counsel Gordon and the firm learned “Quiros had directed the commingling of tens of millions in investor funds among the projects’ various phases and entities in an effort to cover construction shortfalls.”

In addition according to the lawsuit “MSK also learned that Quiros had financed his purchase of the Jay Peak resort in 2008 by diverting millions of dollars of EB-5 investor funds held by certain Receivership Entities.”

Those receivership entities included other EB-5 financed projects that foreign investors had put money into including hotels and condos at Jay Peak as well as a water park and ice rink.

“Defendants failed to advise the Receivership Entities that violations of the private placement memorandum and securities laws were occurring” the lawsuit stated.

“As a result of Defendants’ breaches” the lawsuit added “investor money continued to come in increasing the Receivership Entities’ exposure. That exposure increased by tens of millions of dollars after Defendants began representing Quiros and the Receivership Entities in mid-2013.”

MSK and Gordon learned about the misuse of funds related to AnC Bio Vermont a failed project to build a $110 million biomedical research center in Newport “no later” than May 2014 according to the lawsuit. That’s when Quiros testified during an “investigative session” conducted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

At that deposition according to the lawsuit Quiros testified about transferring $18 million in funds from investors in that biomedical research facility project to help cover debt from earlier projects. Despite being aware of this action the lawsuit stated Gordon did not warn the “decision makers” associated with the other entities what Quiros was doing.

“Quiros testified that ‘once [an individual] invests it is now my money. It is totally my money’” according to the lawsuit. Quiros further testified that once investor funds were transferred to a Quiros-controlled account he could ‘do whatever I want’ with them.”

Gordon and MSK fired back at Goldberg in a filing in response to the lawsuit calling Goldberg the man now overseeing Jay Peak and other properties at the center of the EB-5 investment scandal greedy.

“[Goldberg’s] avarice cannot be overstated” the filing stated adding “The Receiver crosses the line of zealous advocacy and seeks to gain advantage in this civil case by trying to link a defense lawyer to his former clients’ alleged criminal conduct.”

In addition that filing stated Goldberg’s legal action uses terms like “concoct” “mislead” and “cover-up” to ascribe “nefarious” intent to Gordon and MSK where none exists.

“In reality” according to the filing “the MSK Defendants did exactly what attorneys are hired to do: vigorously defended the clients against potential government overreach.”

Goldberg filed the lawsuit in 2019 two weeks ahead of criminal charges that were brought against Quiros and Stenger and two of their associates in connection with the AnC Bio Vermont project that despite raising more than $80 million from about 160 EB-5 investors never got off the ground.

Quiros has since pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing. Stenger has maintained his innocence and is set to stand trial in the fall."

The state of affairs with current-generation graphics cards is quite grim at the moment. Due to high consumer demand and fabs stretched to max when it comes to production everything from ""lowly"" NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards to the flagship GeForce RTX 3090 is hard to find at retail stores (online and B&M). In addition they are selling for incredible sums on the secondary market.

For example the newly launched GeForce RTX 3080 Ti sold at $2400 to $2800 versus its MSRP of $1199 within the first few hours of availability. Now a new phenomenon seems to have struck the Amazon Marketplace. And unfortunately it appears that at least one company is combining two of the most odious practices possible to defraud customers.

A company called NIGUBAHU is selling ZHMIAO-branded products that appear to be counterfeit versions of popular GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards. For example the company's GeForce RTX 3090 seems to be a fake version of the MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ventus 3x. NIGUBAHU simply has blurred out the MSI logos on both the images of the retail box on the product page and the fans on pictures of the card itself.

GeForce GTX 3080? That's a new one to us...

The company also sells ZHMIAO GeForce RTX 3060 and ""GTX 3080"" graphics cards with the latter looking like a knockoff of the Gigabyte Gaming OC with the logos again blurred and misspelled product name. Interestingly it's not just the brand/trademark infringement that is going on that is so appalling. Just look at the prices for these cards.

The ZHMIAO GeForce RTX 3060 has a list price of $3858.99 which is an outrageous sum of money even if we consider the already inflated street pricing of Ampere cards. For example genuine GeForce RTX 3060 cards currently sell for around $900 (MSRP $329). So who in their right mind would pay over four times the average street price for this knockoff? More importantly who would pay even $900?

Who do think they're fooling with these horrible Photoshop blurs?

It's a similar situation with ZHMIAO's GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 priced at $6619.99 and $7981.99 respectively. That compares to already mind-blowing street prices of around $2200 and $3000 respectively. So again paying 2.5x to 3x over already inflated street prices is absolute insanity.

If the sky-high prices aren't enough to turn you away the prospects of getting a non-functioning counterfeit device are incredibly high with these product listings. This is made even more comical because counterfeit goods are typically priced much lower than street pricing for genuine products to entice buyers not dramatically higher. And who knows you could end up getting a box of rocks on your doorstep if you're foolish enough to give this obvious scammer your business.

However what's even more confounding is that Amazon has not yet stepped in to crack down on what is obviously a scammer looking to make bank in a market already overrun with bots and scalpers. Whatever the case this is a clear-cut case of ""buyer beware"" so stay far away from these product listings and any other that just don't pass the smell test.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3ctZ29vZC1pcy10aGUtbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwODAtdGktZm9yLWNyZWF0aXZlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How good is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti for creatives?,"If you’ve read our full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti review you’ll have seen that it is an excellent graphics card when it comes to gaming even rivaling the mighty RTX 3090.

However Nvidia is also keen to stress how good this new GPU is at creative tasks as well so we decided to give it a spin to see if it’s a GPU that’s worth buying for creatives.

In the past if you did creative work that required a graphics card you’d often have to rely on professional GPUs such as Nvidia’s Quadro range. These are extremely expensive and for many people overkill.

The good news is that as gaming GPUs have improved over the years their abilities to handle creative tasks has also improved. In fact Nvidia has done a sterling job in this regard thanks to its Studio drivers. While its Game Ready Drivers for its GPUs focus on gaming features and performance its Studio drivers focus on creative and professional applications.

This means that while at $1199 / £1049 / AU$1949 the RTX 3080 Ti is a very expensive gaming GPU for creative professionals it’s actually a much more affordable investment than a Quadro or Titan GPU. The RTX Titan Nvidia’s previous generation card that straddled gaming and creative workloads cost a whopping $2499 (around £1800 / AU$3200) and the Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 costs $6299 (around £4400 / AU$8000).

When it comes to specs the Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti certainly seems capable of handling most creative tasks outside of seriously heavy-duty workloads from the likes of animation studios.

It has 12GB of GDDR6X memory an increase of 20% over the RTX 3080 though half the amount of the (more expensive) RTX 3090. The extra memory will be useful for animators working with high-resolution textures for example. This could drastically cut down the time it takes to render scenes again making the RTX 3080 Ti a tempting prospect for creatives.

Taking advantage of Artificial Intelligence

One of the biggest benefits of this new generation of Ampere graphics cards according to Nvidia is its AI capabilities. Far from being something used by enterprises or some far-off Sci-Fi gimmick artificial intelligence is now used in several major creative applications bringing features that were once thought impossible to the apps while automating what were once time-consuming manual tasks.

For example in the popular DaVinci Resolve application the Magic Mask tool uses the AI capabilities of the graphics card to automatically mask people and items in a video. This is a process that would have once taken a long time to do manually especially if there’s a lot of movement in the video but the tool works impressively well with the RTX 3080 Ti.

As with any creative workflow the faster you can complete a project the faster you can move on to a new one. This could have a big impact on the amount of work you can take on meaning the RTX 3080 Ti could indeed be a very wise investment.

One of the best features we tried out with the RTX 3080 Ti was Super Resolution in Adobe Photoshop with Adobe Camera RAW. In a similar way that Nvidia’s DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology uses AI with RTX graphics cards to intelligently upscale games to higher resolutions but without the performance impact usually associated with high-resolution gaming

The Super Resolution feature then takes a photo then using GPU accelerated AI upscales the photo to twice the resolution. If you have a photo that’s too low resolution to print on a large canvas for example this feature could be the answer.

The second-generation RT cores of the RTX 3080 Ti bring even better ray tracing support for more believable lighting effects in scenes. They now also support hardware-accelerated motion blur which makes it faster to create motion blur while rendering scenes.

Motion blur when used well can give an image or footage a more dynamic feel and the RTX 3080 Ti is capable of generating motion blur impressively quickly while offering realistic reflections and without distracting visual artifacts.

How does it compare to the RTX 3090?

Benchmarks Here’s how the Nvidia RTX 3090 performed in our suite of creative benchmark tests: Handbrake (1080p Fast): 37.8fps

Blender Classroom: 57s seconds

Blender fishy_cat: 42 seconds

PugetBench Photoshop: 717 points

PugetBench Premiere Pro: 715 points

At the moment the RTX 3090 is pitched as Nvidia’s ultimate GPU for both gamers and enthusiasts. This includes creatives who want a powerful GPU for work but don’t want to spend a fortune on a Quadro-level GPU.

With many gamers now being content creators and streamers there is also a huge crossover of people who want a GPU that can play games and power through creative workloads. Now that the RTX 3080 Ti has finally arrived does its lower price make it a better choice?

In our full RTX 3080 Ti review we were impressed with how close the cheaper RTX 3080 Ti came to the performance of the RTX 3090 in the games we tried out meaning for many gamers the newer more affordable card was a better buy. But can the same be said when it comes to creative applications?

Using both Photoshop and Premiere Pro for day-to-day tasks such as editing some home movies there is no noticeable difference between the performance of the RTX 3080 Ti and the RTX 3090. Now one could argue that in much more intensive use cases such as professional video editing with large files high resolutions and multiple effects there may be more of a difference but our creative benchmarks show that the difference in performance between the two GPUs is negligible.

PugetBench Premiere Pro: 693 points

In the boxouts on this page you'll see the results for both the GPUs and you'll notice just how close the results are. We ran the exact same tests in the same PC using both GPUs and these results offer a pretty compelling reason to go with the RTX 3080 Ti over the RTX 3090. For the most part you're getting a pretty much identical experience with the cheaper GPU.

Overall the benchmarks and our own tests show that the RTX 3080 Ti as well as the RTX 3090 are excellent choices for creative tasks.

Does this mean there's no use for the RTX 3090? Not quite. It still has a huge 24GB of GDDR6X memory which is twice the amount of the RTX 3080 Ti. If you're going to be working with extremely high-resolution textures for example that extra memory is going to come in handy. The biggest gap in performance that we saw was in the Premier Pro benchmarks suggesting that the RTX 3090 is a better bet for video editing at high resolutions. Again though the gap isn't huge.

It also means the RTX 3090 is more future-proof. In the coming years that extra memory may be even more important so spending extra money on the RTX 3090 now could save you money later. While the RTX 3080 Ti is cheaper than the RTX 3090 it's not that much cheaper so if you have the budget the bump in price may be worthwhile.

But this is 2021 and we're in the middle of both a global pandemic and chip shortage. This means talk of prices come with a load of caveats. The bottom line is that it is almost impossible to get hold of either an RTX 3080 Ti or an RTX 3090 at its recommended retail price. This may force people's hands as you may not have the luxury of choice between the two GPUs. Instead you may have to go for whatever one is currently in stock and selling at a reasonable price.

The good news there at least is that both GPUs are excellent cards for creatives and could make a big difference to your workflow and productivity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9kZWxsLWludGVudGlvbmFsbHktY3JpcHBsZWQtYWxpZW53YXJlLW0xNS1yNXMtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA3MC1ncHUtYnktZGlzYWJsaW5nLTEwLW9mLWNvcmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dell intentionally crippled Alienware m15 R5's GeForce RTX 3070 GPU by disabling 10% of cores,"Don’t buy Alienware m15 R5 if you want a fully spec’ed RTX 3070 Laptop GPU

Earlier this week we covered a story that unfolded on Reddit and TechPowerUP forums on the topic of GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU in Dell’s Alienware m15 M5 gaming laptop. As it was discovered Dell has put a cut-down graphics card in this system which features as many as 10% of CUDA cores disabled.

What could’ve been a simple mistake turned out to be an intentional decision by Dell. The manufacturer has decided to limit the performance on Ryzen 5000 series equipped Alienware m15 R5 systems. This is truly an unprecedented thing to see in a gaming laptop considering that these days NVIDIA gives laptop makers a lot of flexibility in deciding which graphics card SKU to use and how much maximum power (TGP) it should have enabled. In fact NVIDIA even allows laptop makers to choose which features to enable (Dynamic Boost Optimus etc.). In other words disabling CUDA cores is simply the last thing to expect.

Dell has confirmed to Jarrod’s Tech who is currently testing the exact same laptop that the decision to disable the cores on RTX 3070 GPU was intentional by their engineering team after ‘careful testing and design choices’. The laptop maker has also confirmed it may enable more cores in the future which just shows that the decision to limit CUDA core count made completely no sense in the first place.

Update: Tom’s Hardware has reached out to Dell for clarification as well. Apparently it is a mistake that will be fixed by mid-June:

“We have been made aware that an incorrect setting in Alienware’s vBIOS is limiting CUDA Cores on RTX 3070 configurations. This is an error that we are working diligently to correct as soon as possible. We’re expediting a resolution through validation and expect to have this resolved as early as mid-June. In the interim we do not recommend using a vBios from another Alienware platform to correct this issue. We apologize for any frustration this has caused.” — Dell spokesperson to Tom’s Hardware

NVIDIA has taken a hard stance on laptop makers and have them display TGP variants on their product pages. It took many months though but most notebook brands are now displaying detailed information on both the TGP and clock speeds.

Dell Alienware division appears to be an exception though. In fact not once in the product description Dell reveals the true specification of the RTX 3070 graphics card installed in the system. There are is no information on clock speeds or TGP being used by the system. Not to mention the disabled CUDA core count.

The graphics card in this system has 4608 CUDA cores instead of 5120 which are official NVIDIA specifications. The GPU maker does not even list RTX3070 with 4608 cores as an option.

The decision to intentionally disable CUDA cores on RTX 3070 Laptop GPU by Dell may raise a lof questions considering that no such ‘feature’ is to be found in Alienware m15 R4 and upcoming R6 laptop (at least not to our knowledge). Both the R4 and R6 are Intel-based systems.

The M1X on the other hand may be in a league of its own according to the latest performance estimates provided by a YouTuber.

Apple M1X GPU With 32 Cores Roughly Equal to a 93-Watt RTX 3070 Found in Laptops

Dave2D appears to be excited for the redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models mainly because of that M1X silicon. According to a previous report Apple is working on two custom chips codenamed Jade C-Chop and Jade C-Die. While both of them are expected to feature a total of 10 processing cores the number of GPU cores will be significantly different depending on which model you purchase.

The YouTuber believes that the higher 32-core GPU option will be available in the 16-inch MacBook Pro since the increased number of cores would require more power. The larger machine could accommodate this power requirement thanks to having a bigger footprint which in turn will allow it to house a bigger battery. The M1X with a 32-core GPU is also expected to feature a larger die size which again might only be found in the bigger MacBook Pro since it has the size advantage for sporting a better cooling solution.

However that is not the part you are looking for. What you are looking for is how much performance the M1X GPU can deliver. Well according to Dave2D the 32-core option with a 40-watt limit could deliver the same number of frames as an RTX 3070 for laptops operating at 93 watts. The benchmark used to obtain these estimated results is GFXBench 5.0 Aztec running at 1440p. In short the M1X GPU consumes less than half the power of laptop RTX 3070 but delivers near-equal performance.

If that happens in real-world scenarios you can rest assured that a lot of jaws will be dropping to the floor. The M1X GPU with 16 cores also obtains respectable results with Dave2D showing that at an estimated 20-watt power consumption it can deliver much better performance than the Radeon Pro 5500M and GTX 1650. Both results show a gigantic leap in GPU performance especially for a MacBook Pro which ships in a noticeably thinner chassis.

Of course you need to be reminded that these are just estimates and we will get to know accurate results shortly after the arrival of the new MacBook Pro models. Speaking of arrival we might expect them during WWDC 2021 though other reports claim that mass production will not happen until later this year. Whatever transpires we will keep our readers in the loop and update them accordingly so stay tuned.

Until then you can check out Dave2D’s video below along with some extra links that dives deeper into the M1X’s potential performance and specifications.

Note: This review was first published on 2 June 2021.

NVIDIA’s most opened secret of 2021 the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU is out. Quite literally by the time you read this NVIDIA’s own Founders Edition version as well as those from partners the likes of ASUS Gigabyte and ZOTAC will be available for purchase from 3 June onwards. But before we go into the card’s performance let’s talk quickly about the new card’s hardware design first.

I’ve always admired the hardware design of NVIDIA’s Founders Edition series and the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition ranked as one of the best-looking graphics cards in my books. It is modern-looking elegant and devoid of the aggressive “gamer-ish” accents seen in many partners’ cards. It’s a matter of personal taste of course but you can’t deny that the Founders Edition cards especially the RTX 30 Series looks and feel exceptionally premium.

With the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition NVIDIA has stuck with the same gorgeous shroud design as the RTX 3080 FE’s certainly a confidence that the same cooling block will be able to handle the anticipatedly higher heat output from the new GPU. It’s even got the same 12-pin connector located out of the middle of the card’s side and comes with a Y-cable adapter that hooks to two traditional 8-pin PSU power connectors. As with the RTX 3080 FE you’ll need a 750W-rated PSU to run the RTX 3080 Ti FE too.

Specifications

In terms of where it stacks in NVIDIA’s RTX 30-Series SKUs the RTX 3080 Ti is essentially the generational successor to the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and sits between the vanilla RTX 3080 and RTX 3090. Let’s look at the specifications:

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Specifications RTX 3080 RTX 3080 Ti RTX 3090 GPU GA102-200 GA102-225 GA102-300 SM 68 80 82 CUDA Cores 8704 10240 10496 RT 68 80 82 Tensor Cores 272 320 328 ROPs 96 112 112 GPU Base clock 1440 MHz 1370 MHz 1395 MHz GPU Boost clock 1710 MHz 1670 MHz 1695 MHz Memory 10 GB GDDR6X 12 GB GDDR6X 24 GB GDDR6X Memory speed 19 Gbps 19 Gbps 19.5 Gbps Bandwidth 760 GB/s 912 GB/s 936 GB/s Memory bus 320-bit 384-bit 384-bit TGP 320W 350W 350W MSRP US$699 US$1199 US$1499

In terms of raw hardware specifications the RTX 3080 Ti features 12GB of GDDR6X video memory (an extra 2 GB over last year’s RTX 3080 which launched at US$699). But look closer at the table above again and you can see the reason that the RTX 3080 Ti is priced much closer to the RTX 3090 than the RTX 3080 is that its specs are much closer to those of the RTX 3090 on paper - aside from having half the VRAM. So while the RTX 3080 Ti is essentially a souped-up version of the RTX 3080 it’s probably not farfetched to also consider it as an “RTX 3090 Lite” which seems to be more technically accurate.

The key spec for the new GPU is the 80 streaming multiprocessors (SMs) it lays claim to which is a notable bump over the RTX 3080's 68. With each SM housing 128 CUDA Cores we are looking at a total of 10240 CUDA Cores with the RTX 3080 Ti. That's a lot and not far off the 10752 of the RTX 3090. The chip's 80 RT cores should also mean it'll be able to deliver better ray-tracing performance while the 320 Tensor Cores will help with NVIDIA's DLSS 2.0 cleverness.

If you're wondering why the RTX 3080 Ti has slightly slower clocks than the RTX 3080 don't be fooled. This is because the new GPU has more CUDA Cores to keep it cool and ultimately will still have notably better performance due to the amount of CUDA Cores on offer despite the disparity in speed. It's the same reason why the RTX 3090 easily outclassed the RTX 3080 despite featuring lower clock speed even before the arrival of the RTX 3080 Ti.

I’ve already covered the RTX 30-Series quite extensively including my review of the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition. Apart from sharing the same design the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti also comes with all of the same bells and whistles as the vanilla RTX 3080 – including DLSS ray-tracing and Reflex technologies – so I won’t go into detail about the card’s tech features. If this is your first time reading up about an RTX 30-Series card or have not read my RTX 3080 FE review I do recommend you do so. Otherwise let’s check out how the RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition fared in our benchmarks."

The use of the splash and rocket emoji is commonly used by CumRocket’s fans online while the inclusion of a moon emoji signified that its price was heading “to the moon”.

Mr Musk’s latest post on Twitter follows a similarly cryptic message on Friday in which he simply wrote: “Canada USA Mexico.”

The acronym produced by these three countries combined with a flurry of other crypto-related tweets meant that it was widely interpreted as an endorsement of semen-themed cryptocurrencies.

The SpaceX CEO also changed his Twitter profile photo to an anime image featuring the bitcoin logo with the character sporting “laser eyes” - a symbol used by cryptocurrency enthusiasts that signifies their hope that bitcoin will hit $100000.

The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $36000 having fallen from an all-time high above $64000 in mid April.

CumRocket responded to Mr Musk’s tweet with a mocked-up version of SpaceX’s Starship rocket featuring the cryptocurrency’s logo.

Bitcoin price crash: Has the market finally collapsed or do previous patterns hint at new all-time highs?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iaXRjb2luLWV0aGVyZXVtLXdlZWtseS10ZWNobmljYWwtYW5hbHlzaXMtMDI1MzM0ODUwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin and Ethereum – Weekly Technical Analysis – June 7th 2021,"Bitcoin

Bitcoin BTC to USD rose by 0.48% in the week ending 6th June. Following a 2.50% gain from the previous week Bitcoin ended the week at $35780.0.

A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin fall to a Sunday intraweek low $34160.0 before making a move.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $32362 Bitcoin rallied to a Thursday intraweek high $39482.0.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $39875 and $40000 levels Bitcoin fell back to sub-$35000 levels.

Finding support over the weekend however Bitcoin revisited $36000 levels before ending the week at $35700 levels.

4 days in the green that included a 4.68% gain on Monday and a 4.39% rise on Thursday delivered the upside for the week. A 6.07% slide on Friday pared some of the gains however.

For the week ahead

Bitcoin would avoid a fall back through the $36474 pivot to support a run the first major resistance level at $38788.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $38000 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally the first major resistance level and last week’s high $39482.0 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended breakout Bitcoin could test resistance at the 32.6% FIB of $41592 and resistance at $43000. The second major resistance level sits at $41796.

A fall back through the $36474 pivot would bring the first major support level at $33466 into play.

Barring another extended sell-off Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$30000 levels. The second major support level at $31152 should limit the downside.

At the time of writing Bitcoin was up by 2.26% to $36588.0. A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin fall to an early Monday low $35487.0 before rising to a high $36784.0.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

Ethereum

Ethereum rallied by 13.54% in the week ending 6th June. Following a 13.69% gain from the previous week Ethereum ended the week at $2710.97.

A mixed start to the week saw Ethereum fall to a Sunday intraweek low $2275.22 before making a move.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $2002 Ethereum rallied to a Thursday intraweek high $2890.0.

Ethereum broke through the 38.2% FIB of $2740 and the first major resistance level at $2844.

A Friday and Saturday pullback however saw Ethereum fall back to sub-$2600 levels before steadying.

While finding support on Sunday Ethereum failed to break back through the 38.2% FIB.

4-days in the green that included a 13.38% rally on Monday delivered the upside for the week.

Story continues

For the week ahead

Ethereum would need to avoid a fall back through the 38.2% FIB of $2740 and the pivot at $2625 to bring the first major resistance level at $2976 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed however for Ethereum to break out from last week’s high $2890.0.

Barring an extended crypto rally the first major resistance level and resistance at $3000 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended breakout Ethereum could test resistance at the 23.6% FIB of $3369 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $3240.

A fall back through the 38.2% FIB and the pivot at $2625 would bring the first major support level at $2361 into play.

Barring another extended sell-off in the week Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$2000 levels. The second major support at $2011 should limit the downside.

At the time of writing Ethereum was up by 3.03% to $2792.98. A mixed start to the week saw Ethereum fall to an early Monday low $2691.66 before rising to a high $2799.44.

While leaving the major support and resistance levels untested at the start of the week Ethereum broke back through the 38.2% FIB of $2740.

The stock of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NAS:REGN 30-year Financials) is believed to be modestly undervalued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $511.89 per share and the market cap of $54.5 billion Regeneron Pharmaceuticals stock gives every indication of being modestly undervalued. GF Value for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is shown in the chart below.

It is always important to check the financial strength of a company before buying its stock. Investing in companies with poor financial strength have a higher risk of permanent loss.

One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is 13.4% which ranks better than 66% of the companies in Biotechnology industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 22.5% which ranks better than 67% of the companies in Biotechnology industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's return on invested capital is 33.02 and its cost of capital is 2.01. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is shown below:

Currently one of the greatest threats facing PMOs and the successful delivery of projects in the Middle East is the shortage of talent and lack of investment in developing key project management skills resulting in significant recruitment challenges. Compounding this the profession appears to have something of an image problem and although the perception is slightly better in the Middle East than elsewhere in the world more needs to be done to help attract talent and reduce the skill gap.

Across the globe project managers are viewed more as tactical troubleshooters rather than strategic partners suggesting a widespread lack of understanding of the value and impact of project management. In the Middle East 44% describe project managers as ‘schedulers’ and only a third say they are ‘essential’. A key attribute of the Project Influencer is being able to adapt and reevaluate in order to do things more efficiently. However when describing project managers only a quarter of respondents chose phrases like ‘flexible’ ‘creative’ and ‘realising visions’.

PwC’s ‘Who is the Modern Project Manager’ report points out that project managers have evolved in response to the ever changing-environment they find themselves in. Their role is no longer focused solely on scope schedule and budget. Rather individuals are needed who can successfully influence the outcomes of projects through their strategic awareness and interpersonal skills firmly focused on influencing outcomes building relationships and achieving the strategic goals of their organisations. From the survey data (figure 3) we can see that organisations view these Project Influencer capabilities as being crucial to the successful delivery of project outcomes.

They had grown up in the same house. Each had watched the other rise to national prominence. They had come to express similar political sentiments.

There was also one difference: One of them Robert was born into slavery. But their relationship remained close enough that they strategized together in the days surrounding the 1876 Republican convention which nominated the man who had just become president at the time the letter was sent Rutherford B. Hayes. And some newspapers had reported as fact what had long been rumored: They had the same father.

Whether that was true or not Robert who was 16 years older knew that John’s late father had dreamed of John going to the Supreme Court since giving the newborn baby the name of his own legal hero Chief Justice John Marshall.

Forty-four years later John was in contention for the court seat being vacated by one of Abe Lincoln’s old friends David Davis and Robert was taking on the self-appointed role of adviser and protector.

Hayes who had prevailed in a disputed election by promising concessions to Southern whites wanted to pick a southerner for the court seat. But that appointee would have to run a gauntlet: confirmation by a deeply suspicious Senate Judiciary Committee headed by a Vermont Republican who was wary of Southern backsliding on civil rights.

So any nominee had to be both Southern and fully satisfactory to Northern progressives.

At this perilous moment John Harlan agreed to take on one of the most politically thankless tasks of the era: serving as one of Hayes’ representatives to assess a violent uprising in Louisiana where disruption in state elections had yielded rival governments. The situation was so fraught that the Republican governor was a virtual prisoner in his makeshift statehouse. His allies cited massive violence that had kept Black voters from the polls. Democrats however decried the federal mandates preventing unrepentant Confederates from exercising their franchise restrictions that were enforced by U.S. troops still mustered in New Orleans 12 years after the end of the Civil War.

Almost everyone sensed that Hayes was on the verge of removing the troops part of the unwritten bargain that had enabled him to assume the presidency. And many people believed that Hayes’ Louisiana Commission which John Harlan had just loyally pledged to join was a sham orchestrated to produce the very outcome that had already been promised: restoration of power to racist Democrats.

In Robert’s eyes focused on the Black community and its Northern allies no good could come of this commission. John was sacrificing his career to Hayes’ convenience. Radical Republicans would never confirm a Supreme Court justice who could be blamed for surrendering to a mob of ex-Confederates. In political terms John was wading into a swamp and Robert knew it. So he did something surprising for a person born enslaved even one reported to be in the family bloodline: He invoked their common upbringing conjuring the memory of the family patriarch and speaking in the kind of code that only family members use.

Do-do-take-care.

John did take care. The Louisiana Commission proved to be just as much of a powerless dead end as Robert had envisioned and Hayes removed the troops. But John managed to extricate himself from the mess by plausibly claiming that the Republican government had collapsed on its accord. His service earned him Hayes’ approval and by October 10 Robert was writing from Washington that he had conferred with many people who had touted John’s Supreme Court credentials to Hayes and that they “had no doubt that you will be appointed.”

Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan | Library of Congress

The rest is history. John Marshall Harlan went on to have a miraculous career on the bench earning the sobriquet “The Great Dissenter” for his uncanny prescience. He took forward-looking stances that not only envisioned the legal structure of the 20th century but helped to shape it. Most importantly he stood alone in fighting back against his colleagues in the cases that destroyed African-American hopes for generations: The Civil Rights Cases of 1883 which deprived Black people of access to railroads inns and theaters; Plessy v. Ferguson which endorsed the legal underpinnings of segregation; and the punishing Berea v. Kentucky which gave the constitutional stamp of approval to a law banning interracial education even in private schools where people of all races wanted it. At this utterly dark moment in American law John Marshall Harlan was a solitary beacon.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Still riding the high of becoming the first-ever father-son WWE SmackDown Tag Team Champions in history Rey and Dominik Mysterio appeared on WWE's The Bump recently to talk about their triumphant defeat over The Dirty Dawgs (Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode) at WrestleMania Backlash.

Advertisement

As they were jumping in the panel showed a clip from Seth Rollins' interview last week on the show and how the ""SmackDown Savior"" mentioned that without his steadfast fixation to conquer the Mysterios last year Dominik would not be the star that he is today. In essence Rollins believes it was his doing that helped Dominik jumpstart his WWE career and forward his skills towards becoming a new champion. Dominik responded to Rollins' comments from last week by saying he can't fault the man for thinking that.

""I mean he's not wrong"" Dominik Mysterio responded. ""He did kind of help me and guide me. At the end of the day it is Seth Rollins. He's one of the best in this business and one of the best to ever do it. So I have to give credit where credit is due.""

With a strong alliance already intact as father and son the panel asked Rey and Dominik if either of them has faced any challenges as tag team partners. Rey answered first.

""I haven't faced any challenges yet with him"" Rey Mysterio mentioned. ""We're still growing as a team and still getting to know each other. I'm used to being with Superstars that have been in the business for quite some time. It's normally me learning off of my team or my partner.

""In this case I learn from Dom. But it's more of what Dom picks up from me and I have to guide him. It's kind of cool for me to play the role of teaching my son how to run the ropes and to do certain things and compliment him when he does great. Other times when he does something wrong I make sure and point the finger at him. So I'm probably his biggest critique.""

Trying not to say the wrong thing Dominik responded to the same question but tried not to laugh when he discussed his father's stubbornness as a tag team partner.

""It's pretty smooth sailing. He is very hard-headed. He's stubborn"" Dominik noted with a laugh. ""We don't bump heads but like it's hard to get my point across sometimes when he's not getting it. Eventually he gets it and we work it out.""

Since his arrival to WWE Dominik has surprised fans watching worldwide by pulling out all the stops with his mat-based technicality and Lucha Libre style approach in the ring. Dominik shared that he and his father are spending time watching old matches of Rey's to attain an idea of where they want to take their in-ring strategy in the future. But he refused to share any more information than that.

""We've been watching a lot of film from back in the day with my dad and Eddie [Guerrero] my dad and Batista [and] my dad and [Chris] Benoit. So we've been studying and picking up things here and there that we can do our way if that makes any sense? We're putting our own little twists and turns on it. We've got some things in the works"" Dominik revealed.

Looking back at his tenure in this sport Rey admits he takes great pride in becoming a focal point from his early beginnings in WCW to where he is now as the SmackDown Tag Team Champion. He promises fans will be star-struck when they get to see him and his son perform in front of them in a few months.

""I was truly blessed to be part of wrestling in the mid-'90s. Not only to be part of wrestling but to be one of the pioneers who revolutionized the sport in WCW in the Cruiserweight division alongside all my partners"" Rey began. ""But that was really cool to live that moment at the time. We really weren't understanding we were changing the sport for good.

""To see the new generation and how many of those Superstars have been inspired by what we did in the mid-'90's is incredible! I gotta stay on my toes man. I gotta make sure that every time I deliver I deliver something fresh. Being able to have Dominik by my side – who helps me out a lot because of his height – we have a lot of cool things planned to do together as tag team partners that I think we'll keep the fans on their toes epically when we go live in front of an audience.""

Before the pandemic Laurie would regularly travel to Antique Fairs from Brighton to Northumberland buying and selling vintage goods.

But when this became impossible due to Government restrictions Laurie needed to pivot her business to become more sustainable.

“With everything that happened last year I realised I was ready for something a bit more permanent” she said.

""I’ve been operating as an Antiques Dealer for over a decade but I needed to find out a little bit more about the structure of running a small business to move things forward.

To help her figure out her next steps Laurie took on Understanding Enterprise a free course recently expanded to anyone over the age of 19 living in South Tyneside Gateshead Sunderland or Durham.

“Understanding Enterprise gave me that knowledge and supported the development of my business plan for the shop. Having worked on my own for so long it was really helpful to have people to bounce ideas off and give me feedback” said Laurie.

“The teaching and support were excellent and the online delivery meant I could fit it around my other commitments. It really gave me the confidence I needed to take the next step. The course also gave me an amazing local network of like-minded people and let me know about the support that’s available out there for small business owners.

“I think despite all the uncertainty this year has left a lot of people inspired to make a change or try something new. If you’re thinking about turning your passion into a business or changing or growing your existing business this course will really help you figure out how to get started.

“The response I’ve had since opening has been amazing I think people were definitely missing something a little bit different in the area and hopefully we can provide that for them.”

The Level 1 Award in Understanding Enterprise is delivered by FIRST in partnership with Skills South Tyneside and provides a recognised qualification in Entrepreneurial skills.

Charlotte Windebank MD and Cofounder of FIRST said: “The pandemic had a significant impact on employment in the region meaning some people lost their jobs and others have been left reconsidering what they want to do with their careers.

“Extended periods on furlough provided many with the opportunity to work on side hustles or personal projects they just didn’t have time for before and job insecurity for others meant looking for new ways to generate income.”

She added: “2020 was a record year for new businesses and 64% of the early-stage founders we’re currently working with set up their businesses during the pandemic.

“Whether you’re looking to gain employment get a promotion change career or start-up and grow your own business we’ll help you develop your ideas and provide opportunities and resources to put those plans into action.”

The Understanding Enterprise Level 1 course is completely free to anyone over 19 years old living in South Tyneside Sunderland Gateshead or Durham.

Places are available on the June intake of the course the intensive two-day courses will be delivered on June 10 and 11 and then 24 and 25.

A bite-size option begins on June 29 with twice weekly two-hour sessions for three weeks.

Cllr Mark Walsh lead Member for Regeneration and Economy at South Tyneside Council said: ""Laurie is a shining example of that grit and determination.

""Upskilling herself and reshaping her business to make it more sustainable in a post covid world.”

He added: “Our region’s indomitable spirit and resilience has seen us through this pandemic and it is those same qualities that will allow us to come out of it stronger capitalising on new and innovative solutions.”

Royal Caribbean International announced Friday that six of its ships will sail from major US ports in Florida and Texas beginning in July.

Vaccines are not required for passengers but all ship crew members will be vaccinated. Guests who are unvaccinated “will be required to undergo testing and follow other protocols” according to a news release from the company.

The company’s first cruise since the coronavirus pandemic began will launch on July 2 in Miami more than a year after the US Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention’s (CDC) no-sail order brought cruises to a halt said the release.

“This is it. Vacationers can finally plan to take their precious time off this summer and truly get away after what has been a challenging time for everyone” said Michael Bayley president and CEO of Royal Caribbean International in the release.

Most ships are still awaiting CDC approval to sail. Since October of last year the agency has issued a series of evolving requirements and guidelines in the form of a Conditional Sailing Order CNN has reported.

A lawsuit challenging that order from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is still unresolved. The two sides failed to reach an agreement in mediation DeSantis’ office said Thursday according to the Miami Herald.

The cruise line says it is continuing discussions with the CDC and “multiple state local and port authorities in the U.S. and with various destination communities regarding the various requirements for the upcoming sailings” said the release.

Bayley thanked DeSantis Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava Broward County Mayor Steve Geller and others “for their steadfast support of our industry and for providing access to vaccines to the thousands of crew on our ships off the eastern seaboard.”

According to Bayley as of Friday afternoon “90% of all vacationers booking with Royal Caribbean are either vaccinated or planning to get vaccinated in time for their cruise.”

By the end of August 12 Royal Caribbean ships will be cruising in the Bahamas the Caribbean Alaska and Europe the company said.

The news release said people 16 and older sailing from Seattle to Alaska must be fully vaccinated and those 12 or older must be vaccinated as of August 1. Travelers departing from an international port must meet that nation’s travel requirements.

Royal Caribbean cruises are back — but vaccinations will be optional.

The travel company announced on Friday that an additional six ships will resume trips from US ports in Florida and Texas starting in July and August. In a statement Royal Caribbean said that while all crew members will be vaccinated against COVID-19 guests are ""strongly recommended to set sail fully vaccinated"" but will not be mandated to do so nor show verification.

""Those who are unvaccinated or unable to verify vaccination will be required to undergo testing and follow other protocols which will be announced at a later date"" Royal Caribbean said on Friday.

The decision is a stark reversal from the company's initial vaccine mandate announced last month which required vaccinations for all passengers over 16 years old on ships sailing from the US and the Bahamas.

""The combination of the vaccines and testing and contact tracing all these kinds of protocols really helps us reach our objective which is to make cruising safer than in your home community"" Richard Fain Royal Caribbean's CEO told the BBC in May. ""We want you to be more comfortable walking onboard a ship than walking down Main Street.""

After Friday's announcement Royal Caribbean's frequently asked questions page has been updated to show that vaccines will only be required for ships departing from Seattle Washington and the Bahamas.

The reversal comes on the heels of efforts by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to prohibit vaccine requirements including a recently passed bill that fines businesses $5000 each time they request proof of vaccination. A similar policy that bans certain companies for requesting vaccine verification was enacted by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in April.

""In Florida your personal choice regarding vaccinations will be protected and no business or government entity will be able to deny you services based on your decision"" DeSantis said during the bill signing last month.

The Florida policy is slated to go into effect on July 1 as cruise ships in the US begin to set sail for the first time in a year due to the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously halted cruise operations — which became early hotbeds for the spread of the virus — from sailing in March 2020.

Under current CDC regulations cruise lines can resume business on the condition that its crew is fully vaccinated and that it completes a test trip with volunteer passengers to demonstrate its ability to ensure safety protocols. A ship can skip the test by adhering to a vaccine threshold that calls for a combined 95% of employees and passengers to be vaccinated.

In a statement Royal Caribbean International CEO Michael Bayley thanked Gov. DeSantis and fellow Florida politicians for ""their steadfast support of our industry."" Despite removing the proof of vaccination requirement he pointed to company data that claims 90% of Royal Caribbean consumers are ""either vaccinated or planning to get vaccinated in time for their cruise.""

""This is it. Vacationers can finally plan to take their precious time off this summer and truly get away after what has been a challenging time for everyone"" Bayley said in a statement.

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’I’m the best decision your organization has ever made’"" Ross said.

But Ross wasn’t done.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

Brady likely knew there were going to be some things said that he might not like but he seemed to want the subject of the jokes to stay with him not his former owner.

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

Buffington,"LEWISTON – William S. Buffington 81 of South Paris passed away on Monday April 29 2024 from a life well-lived at Central Maine Medical Center. He was born May 22 1942 in Colebrook N.H. to Elmer and Leora (Marsh) Buffington. Willie was the second of five children.

Willie met the love of his life Crystal while working construction in Gorham Maine. They married in 1966 and resided in the Norway-Paris area. Willie got a job at C. B. Cummings until he started hauling house trailers in 1972 for Hardy’s and then Dick Webber at Northeast Housing. He started and opened his first business Willie’s Repair in 1978. This business is still family operated and supporting 3rd generation family. Retirement was driving him crazy so Willie and Crystal built and opened self storage units. Willie also started Willie’s Enterprises which included tractor work snow plowing and hauling gravel. Willie continued to volunteer at the Paris Fire Department and stayed busy and productive right up to the end.

During his younger years Willie spent a lot of time at Oxford Plains Speedway. He had 68 wins and earned 4-track championships in the figure-8 division. He even managed to win one of the crazy enduros. He earned the nickname “Captain Crunch” over the years and added a lot of fans and lifelong friendships during his 20 plus years of racing.

Willie joined the South Paris Fire Department in 1966. He volunteered for over 57 years rising to the rank of Deputy Chief. Willie always gave his all in all situations. He would be the first to respond and the last to leave. He led by example and never hesitated to step in and help. He was instrumental in fundraising for the department coordinating “boot” drives raffles and the food shack at the fair.

Willie is survived by his wife of 57 years Crystal (Fothergill) Buffington. She helped him navigate everything through out the years; his son Christopher Scott Buffington and his wife April of Paris; his daughter Angela Buffington of Lewiston; grandsons Brandon Nicholas and Matthew all of Paris; bonus grandson Ryan Thomas and his partner Rya of Norway; great-grandchildren Charlotte and Marlee Buffington; special sisters-in-law Sharon Tate of Florida and Cheryl Coffman of Buckfield; brother James Buffington of Tennessee; sisters Eleanor and Floyd Ricker of Kentucky and Alberta Flanders of New Hampshire; and many special nieces and nephews.

He was predeceased by his parents; and an older brother Robert of Tennessee.

Companies Mentioned

A few weeks ago we walked the last mile setting up the CI/CD pipeline at my current project. Right now in order to deploy these components you require either the Vlocity Build tool (CLI) or Vlocus IDX tool (UI) The tool provides multiple options to retrieve and deploy components. The full list of commands can be referenced in the Github repo of the tool but usually you will end up writing a script like the following to be executed through your CI tool.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzA1L2JldHRlci1idXktdmVldmEtc3lzdGVtcy12cy16ZW5kZXNrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Veeva Systems vs. Zendesk,"Which niche CRM services provider is the better overall investment?

Veeva Systems (VEEV 0.03%) and Zendesk (ZEN) are both cloud-based CRM (customer relationship management) service providers but they serve very different markets.

Veeva's CRM services help life science companies maintain their relationships with customers store and analyze data and keep track of all the latest regulations and clinical trials. Its growing list of more than 1000 customers includes pharmaceutical giants like AstraZeneca Moderna and Merck.

Zendesk provides CRM services to over 160000 clients across a wide range of industries. Unlike Salesforce (CRM -0.47%) -- the CRM market leader which mainly serves larger companies -- Zendesk primarily offers basic customer support and ticketing services for small to medium-sized companies.

Veeva and Zendesk both work with Salesforce. Veeva co-founder and CEO Peter Gassner was once Salesforce's senior VP of technology and Veeva's platform still runs on Salesforce's services. Zendesk's platform can be natively integrated with Salesforce's to provide growing businesses with additional tools.

In an article published in December I compared these two CRM companies and declared that Zendesk's improving fundamentals and lower price-to-sales ratio made its stock a better buy than Veeva's. However Zendesk's stock has dipped about 5% since I made that call while Veeva's stock has stayed nearly flat. Did I overestimate the market's potential interest in Zendesk? Let's take a fresh look at both companies to find out.

Veeva generates rock-solid growth

Veeva's revenue rose 33% to $1.47 billion in its fiscal 2021 which ended Jan. 31. Its adjusted operating margin expanded from 37.3% to 39.8% and its adjusted net income grew 36% to $473 million. It ended the year with a net retention rate of 124% which means its existing customers spent 24% more money year over year on its services.

In the first quarter of its fiscal 2022 Veeva's revenue grew another 29% year over year to $434 million its adjusted operating margin expanded from 38.5% to 41.8% and its adjusted net income jumped 40% to $147 million.

For the full fiscal year Veeva expects its revenue to increase by 24% to 25% its adjusted operating margin to remain stable and for its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to grow by 19%. It also anticipates that it will generate $3 billion in annual revenues with an operating margin exceeding 35% by 2025.

Veeva's growth remains consistent for two simple reasons. First it enjoys a first-mover advantage in the life sciences niche and doesn't face any meaningful competitors. Second escalating competition between drugmakers -- which will continue for the foreseeable future -- is fueling higher demand for Veeva's cloud-based services.

Veeva is also one of the few high-growth cloud companies that have remained consistently profitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP measures.

But Zendesk is just as consistent

Zendesk's revenue rose by 26% to $1.04 billion in its fiscal 2020 which aligns with the calendar year. Its adjusted operating margin rose from 3% to 7% and its adjusted net income increased 71% to $63 million.

In the first quarter of 2021 Zendesk's revenue grew another 26% year over year to $298 million. Its adjusted operating margin expanded from 4% to 8% while its adjusted net income grew 72% to $22 million. It ended the period with a dollar-based net expansion rate of 114% which is roughly comparable to Veeva's net retention rate.

Zendesk expects its revenue to increase 25% to 27% for the full year and for its adjusted operating margin to hold steady. Analysts expect its adjusted earnings to rise by 33%. However Zendesk still isn't profitable on a GAAP basis and it doesn't expect that to change this year.

Zendesk hasn't provided any ambitious long-term revenue forecasts like Veeva has yet but it expects its net expansion rate to remain between 110% and 120% in a ""normal market environment"" as it courts larger customers and rolls out new platforms like Zendesk Suite.

Zendesk still indirectly competes against Salesforce but its stable outlook indicates that it has secured a defensible niche in the CRM market with its simpler ticketing and support services.

The valuations and verdict

As of this writing Veeva trades at 71 times forward earnings and 24 times this year's sales. Zendesk has a forward P/E ratio of 127 and trades at 12 times this year's sales. Neither stock can be considered a bargain as investors rotate from growth to value stocks.

But if I had to choose one over the other I'd choose Veeva over Zendesk this time because it's profitable on a GAAP basis trades with a lower P/E ratio faces fewer competitors and is offering investors clearer predictions of its growth trajectory over the next few years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMCw3MzQwLEwtMzkwOTMzNiwwMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gong employees heading for $1 billion payday: “We celebrated for five minutes and moved on” | Ctech,"Gong employees have got a big payday coming their way. The company which last week became Israel’s highest valued privately owned tech startup following its $250 million Series E round at a valuation of $7.25 billion after money is expected to allow its employees to sell their shares in the company as it did in the previous round last August.

Gong which developed software for analyzing calls from sales and service representatives employs 600 people - all of whom hold options. It is estimated that about 10%-15% of the company's holdings are in the hands of the employees valued between $750 million in a conservative estimate and about $1 billion in other estimates.

On average each employee holds options worth around $150000-$200000 but CEO and co-founder Amit Bendov noted in a conversation with Calcalist that according to the company’s new value there are employees (more than a few according to Calcalist's estimate) with at least $1 million in options. “We have nearly 600 employees some with millions of dollars in options. In the previous round we allowed employees to sell their shares and only 40% chose to do so. I guess a similar amount of employees will sell this time. It makes me very happy that people can sell and get rich. I guess many will be able to pay off their mortgage or buy a new car.""

First-time investor alongside industry insider

The current round of fundraising was led by investment firm Franklin Templeton in its first significant investment in a private Israeli company. The global investment firm was founded in New York in 1947 and currently manages $1.5 trillion in assets. One of the largest shareholders in the company and one of its first investors is Shlomo Kramer. Existing investors also participated in the current round including Coatue Salesforce Ventures Sequoia Thrive Capital and Tiger Capital.

According to estimates Kramer founder of Check Point and Imperva and now CEO of Cato Networks owns about 10%-15% of Gong a holding worth about $1 billion. Kramer also has significant holdings in At-Bay which ensures companies against cyber threats; cyber company Aqua which announced a $135 million funding round at a $1 billion valuation in March; American company SomaLogic which recently went public and is traded at a market value of about $2.2 billion; fintech unicorn Fundbox as well as a 20% share in Exabeam valued at around $500 million.

The funds raised in this round are expected to be used to double the workforce in the company with plans to reach about 300 employees in Israel and about 1000 employees in total worldwide by the end of 2021. It is worth noting that back in December 2018 Gong won Calcalist and Microsoft promising start-up competition in the field of big data and AI. Gong customers include Autodesk Hubspot LinkedIn Outreach PayPal Shopify Slack Twilio Zillow Zoominfo.

The value Gong reached recently was higher than any other private Israeli company. Next Insurance recently announced a company valuation of $4 billion with cyber company Snyk being valued at $4.7 billion. Gong surpassed those companies by a significant margin. ""We try not to make a fuss about it but there is also no need for fake modesty it is a beautiful milestone. We do not live for it and are not excited about the value. We celebrated for five minutes and moved on.""

“A proportional spike”

Bendov said that the company did not demand a specific value during this round and rather let investors who wanted to invest in the company view the data and make appropriate offers. ""We received many offers and built a consortium of investors because many were willing to take up the whole round. We did not necessarily go with the highest offer we looked at the identity of the investors and looked for deep pockets for the long term.""

The record-breaking value of the company does not scare Bendov who said that ""Gong can reach much more than $20 billion but the burden of proof is on us. We are not heading for an IPO in the coming months and we do not know what the market will be like and what the market multipliers will be by then. We always thought about something big about a company that is worth billions. I always thought it was possible to reach a hundred billion.""

The company's growth rate has accelerated significantly in the last ten months and it is estimated that its annual revenue rate is at $100 million rising from $30 million in its previous round. ""The spike in our value is proportional to the spike across all the data not only in revenue but in the quality of transactions in the caliber of transactions the number of innovations and how many customers are increasing their use of our software"" said Bendov.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYWNxdWlyZXJzbXVsdGlwbGUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvZ3V5LXNwaWVyLXdoeS1pLWNvbnRpbnVlLXRvLW93bi1iZXJrc2hpcmUtaGF0aGF3YXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guy Spier: Why I Continue To Own Berkshire Hathaway,"In an interview earlier this year with The Omaha YouTube Channel Guy Spier discussed why he continues to own Berkshire Hathaway. Here’s an excerpt from the interview:

Spier: In the case of Berkshire Hathaway you’ve got to assume that the day you buy it Warren Buffett is no longer around. But the businesses that are in there even if they don’t own Amazon and they don’t own Salesforce.com and various other cloud and other businesses that are thriving in this time they have plenty of great businesses that will do absolutely fine.

You can be very… we can be very confident that the people at the top allocating capital even after Warren Buffett is gone are going to do a decent job of it and so what’s the likelihood that it turns out a return that is somewhat better than the S&P? It’s a very very good chance and you have to put the money somewhere.

I would say that more and more… I realize that like I don’t lose sleep over my Berkshire Hathaway position and I in a certain way actually I’m coming to the… I mean Warren Buffett said that he can’t guarantee that he’ll exceed the S&P over the next 10 years if I’m not mistaken from the annual meeting this time around.

But would you rather be in the S&P and have maybe some more volatility or have more worries or would you rather be in Berkshire Hathaway and sleep better at night and have less worries or know that it’s counter-cyclical but when the right moment comes they’ll be able to deploy a lot of capital.

Now the first observation is obvious to any parent who has a Lego-obsessed kid who is quicker and more creative than they are. But the second required a lot of staring at the iconic bridge that was recreated in brick form for Miniland a feature of Legoland Discovery Center that’s probably more of a treat for parents than for kids.

It’s an astounding recreation of landmarks from San Jose San Francisco and Oakland — along with a few familiar structures in the region like Apple Park in Cupertino Stanford’s Hoover Tower and Memorial Church Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara and the Campanile at UC Berkeley. There’s an amazing amount of detail to the nearly 40 “builds” which took a team of some four dozen model builders based in Florida more than 7150 hours to create.

Sam Suksiri the Milpitas resident who won a position last year as the venue’s Master Model Builder told me the builds — many are glued together — were shipped in large chunks to Legoland Discovery Center Bay Area where he helped assemble them and populate them with Lego’s ubiquitous minifigures. The designers traveled to the Bay Area to look at the real-life buildings that would be replicated creating architectural plans and 3D models.

The Winchester Mystery House does a great job of recreating the labyrinth-like 160-room mansion and plays into the lore surrounding the landmark — including the second-floor door that opens to a one-story drop. Look carefully and you’ll even see a Sarah Winchester minifigure on a balcony. “They were doing as much detail in a small model as they could” Suksiri said. “This one was really tricky for the model team.”

Other downtown San Jose sights include the San Jose Museum of Art St. Joseph Cathedral Basilica San Jose City Hall and Plaza de Cesar Chavez. The San Francisco street scene is absolutely jaw-dropping with the Transamerica Pyramid Salesforce Tower City Hall Oracle Park the Ferry Building and Fisherman’s Wharf all part of the action. Both a cable car and a Muni streetcar move through the scene and you can pull a lever to operate a BART train in an underground station that leaves the San Francisco set and — no joke — “arrives” at the Oakland set a few feet away. There are other fun interactive bits too like playing hoops at the Lego version of Chase Center or scoring a TD at Levi’s Stadium. I’m holding out hope that they’ll add a Shark Tank complete with a Patrick Marleau minifigure to the display.

The Golden Gate Bridge model is equally stunning in its detail — including the Aquaman minifigure near the water — and elsewhere in the Bay you can watch prisoners — in striped outfits of course — escape from their cells at Alcatraz (which is totally OK if you think about it as Alcatraz the fun tourist attraction and not Alcatraz the brutal prison filled with hardened criminals).

There’s just one catch: Adults can’t get in without being accompanied by a child 17 or younger and vice versa. Operations Manager Michelle Duncan told me there are plans for after-hours grownup events in the space so all you childless adult Lego fans (or Adult Fans of Lego as they are known) will have your chance.

Now young Lego fans will be giddy from everything they can do. There’s a laser maze a pirate-themed climbing fort and an “Imagination Express” ride where you can zap targets with a light-emitting wand (a lot like the Ghost Blasters ride at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk). You also can take in a short animated Lego movie presented in 4D — on top of the regular 3D visual effects you’ll get gusts of wind and water spray to match the action on screen. Skyscrapers can be built to withstand a shake-table quake and there are build stations for kids of varying expertise. That includes the car-building stations next to a track where you can race your creations against other visitors’. (But not your son because you will lose.)

Legoland Discovery Center’s grand opening is June 14 but there are a limited number of tickets available to visit June 8-13 at www.legolanddiscoverycenter.com/bayarea.

READY TO PARTY: Palo Alto Players is marking its 90th anniversary this month with a bunch of virtual events leading up to a hybrid celebration on June 27 that will include a live in-person gala fundraiser that will be livestreamed to audiences as well. As it’ll be Palo Alto Players’ first time back to the Lucie Stern Theater since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic the title “Welcome Home” is just right.

Managing Director Elizabeth Santana says the company is thrilled to be able to welcome the community back to the theater for the first time in 15 months to celebrate the milestone anniversary. “It has been a challenging year but we have been honored to serve the community the entire time and are excited to look to the future as we celebrate our collective resilience and the power of the arts to heal and bring us back together” she said.

The three virtual gatherings leading up to the gala are a trivia night with Drunk Broadway’s Joey McDaniel on June 10 a Players-Peninsula Center Stage reunion on June 17 and a virtual cabaret featuring the next generation of performers on June 24. Those events all start at 7 p.m. and are free and open to the public. You can get more information on those as well as reserve a ticket to the June 27 gala at www.paplayers.org."

The stock of ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW 30-year Financials) gives every indication of being fairly valued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $460.65 per share and the market cap of $91 billion ServiceNow stock appears to be fairly valued. GF Value for ServiceNow is shown in the chart below.

Because ServiceNow is fairly valued the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth which averaged 25.8% over the past three years and is estimated to grow 25.43% annually over the next three to five years.

A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. ServiceNow has been profitable 3 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months the company had a revenue of $4.8 billion and earnings of $0.75 a share. Its operating margin is 5.10% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Software industry.

One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of ServiceNow is 25.8% which ranks better than 85% of the companies in Software industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 104.8% which ranks better than 98% of the companies in Software industry.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months ServiceNow's return on invested capital is 2.93 and its cost of capital is 7.78. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of ServiceNow is shown below:

DeCesare’s got big plans for the security analytics vendor. “I ultimately believe that our destiny is to be a major player in the larger category called security operations” he said in an interview with SDxCentral.

The latest funding round led by the Owl Rock division of Blue Owl Capital and supported by existing investors Acrew Capital Lightspeed Venture Partners and Norwest Venture Partners brings Exabeam’s total raised to $390 million over six funding rounds beginning in 2014. And it shows that investors “realize how big Exabeam can be” DeCesare said.

“We have a chance to be to cyber what ServiceNow is to the services market — the unification the ability to create a CMDB and sit on top of your service system your ticketing systems — that’s the real estate we occupy” he added. “The round tells the marketplace just how well positioned Exabeam is to be a big successful player and I saw that same opportunity which is why I jumped at it.”

DeCesare says Exabeam’s size (about 411 employees) and company culture created by founding CEO Nir Polak among other factors attracted him. “Having come off running big McAfee where we were many thousands of employees I definitely like the smaller-size company where you can be more nimble” he said.

Polak meanwhile will continue on as an “active member” of the executive team remain at the company and assume the role of chairman of the board.

Exabeam’s Evolution

DeCesare sees himself as a “stage two” CEO brought in to scale the company and expand its use cases as it targets the larger security operations market.

When he looked at the larger market trends DeCesare said Exabeam occupies a front row seat to capitalize on them. “One of which was this transformation of data” he said. “All the on-prem systems the SIEMs the data lakes that have grown up for 20 years on prem are all moving into Snowflake and [Amazon Web Services] and [Microsoft] Azure usually for ROI purposes. And Exabeam took perfect advantage of that movement happening.”

Exabeam started in user entity and behavior analytics (UEBA) before moving into security information and event management (SIEM) and more recently extended detection and response (XDR). It correlates and analyzes data from third-party vendors’ agents and connectors across endpoints cloud workloads and the network.

“The main DNA of the company is around this advanced-analytics offering” DeCesare said. “It’s the ability for Exabeam to come into a company and take their firewall feed from Palo Alto their Splunk feed their CrowdStrike feed all these different things they’ve bought and pull those into a central place and then be able to help the security operations teams prioritize how to go after an insider or outsider threat.”

DeCesare Talks R&D M&A IPOs

In addition to scaling Exabeam’s existing security analytics and SIEM business DeCesare plans to pump money into research and development. “We have customers asking us every day to go into new areas” he said adding that compliance would be a next logical step. “The area of compliance is an area that we can be a very large player in.”

While the company’s threat detection and response capabilities can help security operations teams prioritize which threats to mitigate first “right after a breach is closed there’s a whole compliance aspect of the same value prop” he explained.

DeCesare said that while he prefers developing new capabilities organically he’s not ruling out mergers and acquisitions. “A lot of companies that were really small suffered pretty substantially during COVID” he said. “If there’s companies that aren’t going to make it on their own then those are the interesting things for us to consider especially if they fit our product portfolio the right way.”

DeCesare took ForeScout public in 2017 and in earlier interviews Polak said an initial public offering (IPO) was in the company’s future. An IPO “is still on the table” and DeCesare said he believes Exabeam “will be quite successful in the public market” but it’s not a top priority.

The $200 million funding round provided a sufficient cash infusion to ensure that Exabeam doesn’t need to go public he said. “We have a lot of nuts in the tree for a cold winter” DeCesare added. Instead of an IPO “the focus for the next year is building a sustainable business that can carry us for many years.”",,,,,,,,,

In fact in 2019 motorcyclist Norman Chung died from injuries he sustained after he was involved in an accident on one of the problematic corners which is now badly in need of repairs.

Another motorcyclist Lance Douglas also succumbed to injuries from an accident at the venue in 2012.

Gore told The Sunday Gleaner that his association is desperately seeking the more than $5 million it will take to resurface sections of the track in time for the reopening of the St Ann-based facility.

“I would say that there are four corners and a straight that need intervention right away and that would probably (cost) in the region of about five million dollars” said Gore.

“I think if we can find a sponsor that can take up something like that then I can tell you that brand or whatever they decide to promote will be placed all over the racetrack just like Miracle Corporation who sponsored us two million dollars is going to be all over the racetrack” he added. “We will definitely make sure that they get their money’s worth as far as advertising is concerned at Dover Raceway.”

He pointed out that his organisation is very big on the safety of their drivers and motorcyclists and therefore all the COVID-19 safety guidelines will have to be followed once they are granted approval by the Government for resumption.

TRACK SAFETY IMPORTANT

“There are many different things that can happen which can cause an accident but as a club we have to look at the scenarios that are in front of us which are track preparations and the safety of the track itself for everyone” Gore said.

“If we can also go around and use the tyres that we have to make barricades and use the infrastructures that we have to make it as safe as possible then we need to do this which is very important” he said.

There have been no competitive racing at Dover Raceway for more than a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and despite this Gore shared that the JRDC has still managed to maintain the facility with help from a number of sponsors and well-wishers.

“The likes of Sherwin Williams has come on board and they have donated paint to help paint up the place and to make the place look pretty” he said. “We have people who are going and cutting the grass every Tuesday and so Dover is looking beautiful right now.”

But with improving vaccination rates falling virus numbers and easing restrictions visitors have been flocking back to retail centers.

As California is moving ahead to fully reopening its economy on June 15 malls are under pressure to adapt to high foot traffic and welcome more visitors.

“I’m not sure if more people will start shopping simply because June 15 rolls around” said Steven Sayers senior general manager at Glendale Galleria. “But we have been seeing a continued upswing in demand for the last several months. More people have been coming out shopping.”

Nearly 65% of consumers said last month they’d feel safe visiting a mall a 7% uptick from a few weeks prior marking consumer confidence in shopping in-person according to consumer research company Morning Consult which conducts weekly surveys among roughly 2200 adults nationwide.

Despite the rise in online shopping amid stay-at-home orders 45% of customers said they are excited to return to the malls according to the data.

Since January there has been a 41% increase in foot traffic to stores and restaurants nationwide according to the data from Zenreach which measures store visits. Shops and restaurants in Southern California have seen a 124% bump in in-person visits since January the data said.

At the open-air mall 2nd & PCH in Long Beach foot traffic has mostly recovered and is near pre-pandemic levels according to John Nahas the president of Southern California CenterCal Properties.

Nahas credited part of the shopping center’s quick recovery to the fact that it’s not an enclosed space but he also acknowledged that some essential businesses — like the Whole Foods that anchors the property — helped keep shoppers coming even in the worst of the health crisis.

And now as June 15 nears he said he expects the growth in customers to continue.

“As we approach the expiration of restrictions in Long Beach” Nahas said “we expect visitation to increase further as our tenants will be able to accommodate a higher volume of customers.”

Although new guidelines released in May don’t specifically mention shopping malls physical distancing or capacity limitations will no longer be required at all businesses starting mid-June. Restrictions at restaurants and bars will be lifted and the state will align with mask requirements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention according to the state guideline.

Sayers said he anticipated no occupancy or social distancing restrictions but he didn’t expect clarity from the department of public health until midnight June 14.

“We’ve all become accustomed to dealing with uncertainty over the last year” he said. “We would always like things to be certain because it’s easier to make a plan.”

Currently there are fewer than 200 seats in the food court area in Glendale Galleria and after mid-June Sayers’ team was planning to add more seats to indoor and outdoor areas. Handwashing stations and sanitizer dispensers he added will remain available in the foreseeable future. Retail stores inside the mall he said might still require visitors to wear masks even after June 15.

“Housekeeping and security will still be wearing masks probably even if they’re vaccinated just to give people that sense of safety” he said.

Paris-based Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield which runs 29 malls across the country including ones in Sherman Oaks Canoga Park Century City and Culver City said it was ready to return to full capacity later this month.

“What we expect is a rebound of the consumption very quickly” said the company CEO Jean-Marie Tritant during a recent investor call. “The question for us is really being ready when there would be the economic rebound.”

David Simon chief executive officer and president of the Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group which owns the Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance said during a recent earnings call that “2020 was a difficult year for all those affected by COVID-19 including our company. We feel confident we have turned the corner and we expect growth in earnings and cash flow in 2021.”

The company’s net income was $1.1 billion in 2020 or $3.59 per diluted share a 17% percent decline due to slashed revenues from tenant rent abatements higher rents and lower sales Simon said.

While the vaccine rate is ramping up with nearly 50% of California adults having at least one dose it remains to be seen whether the foot traffic will return to pre-pandemic levels.

To fully reopen in mid-June Los Angeles County needs to show it has sufficient vaccine supply and maintaining stable and low hospitalization rates.

When it comes to June 15 a lot of things are still up in the air.

Los Angeles Supervisor Kathryn Barger said during a recent recovery-focused Policy on Tap discussion hosted by the San Fernando Valley Chamber of Commerce she didn’t know what the state health orders looked like but she would encourage the county to mirror the state’s guidelines.

“Businesses have been frustrated by the conflicting message between the state and the county” she said.

With the e-commerce boom during lockdowns malls and other brick-and-mortars are now under more intense pressure to reinvent themselves but there is still a future for indoor malls experts say.

“What you’re gonna see is more experiences in malls” said California Retailers Association President Rachel Michelin during the Policy on Tap discussion. Malls are adding gyms bowling alleys and other types of amenities to woo people in she said. Shoppers can find a restaurant inside a department store or a complimentary glass of wine while they are browsing the shelves and running errands.

President of the Valley Industry and Commerce Association Stuart Waldman said as much as people survived the last 12 months by ordering online they are not willing to do it anymore.

“There’s something about going to a mall and walking around” he said. “For anyone who’s grown up in Southern California a mall is part of their lives.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuY29tL2xpc3RzLzI3Mjc2NS1zaW1vbi1rYXJhbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Simon Karam,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.constructionweekonline.com/lists/272765-simon-karam on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuY29tL2xpc3RzLzI3Mjc2NS1zaW1vbi1rYXJhbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

M. Smucker Company (SJM) and more.

Is America ready to get back to work?

As of end of May weekly initial jobless claims dropped to 385K falling below the 400K mark for the first time since March 2020 when the pandemic hit the U.S. economy. Reported claims were better than initial expectations of 390K. On the other hand the total number of Americans who continued to receive unemployment benefits did not subside (3.77 million). Many states decided recently to withdraw from federal unemployment benefit programs following reports that it has been more difficult for companies to hire workers with unemployment benefits paying more than minimum wage. Millions of people in 24 states are set to lose unemployment benefits as early as June 12.

Foodservice labor shortage

The food industry particularly restaurants is struggling to find enough workers. There were a record-high 8.1 million unfilled jobs at the end of March including 993K at restaurants and hotels and 878K at stores. Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer says it could take months to fill restaurant job openings. Charleston restauranteur Patrick Whalen is less optimistic. He thinks that the inherent issues of low pay lack of benefits and ‘toxic’ workplaces are some of the reasons that workers won’t return. COVID-19 was simply the straw that broke the camel’s back.

Food manufacturing recovery

Food manufacturing plants also felt labor market strains albeit to a lesser degree than foodservice. Pre-pandemic food manufacturing businesses employed 1.66 million workers. As of April the industry re-hired 77% of the 1.1 million jobs lost during the pandemic shutdowns (see chart).

Food retail expansion

At the same time food delivery businesses have less trouble finding workers as e-commerce continued to grow at a record pace across America. Pre-pandemic food retail employed 3.07 million workers and as of April the total workforce expanded to 3.11 million (see chart). Amazon recently announced that it will hire another 75K in its fulfillment and logistics network. The positions pay an average of $17 an hour and include signing bonuses of up to $1000 plus an additional $100 for new hires who can show proof they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

Looking ahead

ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson expects continued job recovery particularly among the consumer-facing industry. Private businesses in the U.S. hired 978K workers in May the most in 11 months led by leisure & hospitality (440K); education & health (139K); and trade transportation & utilities (118K). Most economists expect the overall unemployment rate to fall below 6% by the end of June and 5.5% in 12-month time.

Others are more wary of social and health factors that have resulted in less than robust job recovery. A recent survey showed three main reasons of the current labor shortage:

Continuing child-care demands keeping parents at home

Extended enhanced unemployment benefits

Lingering health concerns

The labor shortage is prompting businesses to re-think compensation benefits as well as work conditions amidst re-opening efforts.

Amanda Holden stirred even more travel envy with her social media followers by sharing another bikini snap on her sunny holiday.

The Heart Radio presenter is currently enjoying a getaway abroad with her husband Chris Hughes and their two children.

It doesn’t look like they’ll be coming back anytime soon as Amanda shared another photo of herself on the beach.

In the snap the Britain’s Got Talent judge is seen wading through the water in a black mesh bikini and a pair of sunglasses resembling a Bond girl.

‘Fancy a dip?! #familytime ❤️🌞’ she captioned the photo.

Amanda 50 shared another photo of herself reclining on some rocks and joked: ‘This swimsuit makes me look like I have an ab.’

Louise Redknapp and Ashley Roberts were among the stars to compliment Amanda’s beach look with several fire emoji while one follower said: ‘Seriously Bond has found his new Bond woman.’

Amanda shared a sweet photo of her daughters (Picture: @noholdenback Instagram)

The presenter also shared a photo of her daughters Lexi 15 and Hollie nine posing sweetly together on the beach with the sun glistening.

Amanda first revealed the family had jetted off with a photo of her in a white two-piece bikini.

It sparked speculation that they were in Portugal which at the time was on the UK Government’s travel green list.

One fan wondered: ‘Where are you?’ to which another follower replied: ‘Portugal or Gibraltar at a guess.’

Another joked: ‘Beautiful. Is that Bradford in the Background.’

‘Looks like Portugal’ another wrote.

However Portugal has since been moved to amber due to a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.

If Amanda is indeed in Portugal and doesn’t fly back before Tuesday it could mean that the family will have to isolate at home for 10 days upon their return.

Officials of Farmers Investment Co. which grows pecans in Sahuarita and Freeport McMoRan which runs a major copper mine in the Green Valley area say they are not concerned about shortages on the scale likely to befall the CAP in the next few years.

But they are concerned about the effects of shortages should the current drought last a long time — which is what many scientists are forecasting.

FICO’s pecan groves now get about 40% of their water from CAP supplies owned by Freeport and Tucson Water. They might at some point have to replace at least some of that with the groundwater pumping that CAP was brought in to replace.

In addition Dick Walden FICO’s president and CEO said he believes this region will need to eventually bring in additional water supplies possibly by building a desalination plant for seawater or brackish groundwater to counteract impacts of increasingly arid weather and accelerating population growth.

Brackish water found in groundwater in parts of western and west-central Arizona has more salts and other dissolved solids than fresh drinking water but less than seawater.

“We also need to leverage technology to use water more efficiently as we are doing here on the farm” Walden said. “Hopefully more efficient water consumption and use of renewable water will get us through this challenging period.”

Major investments

Both companies have invested heavily in bringing CAP’s Colorado River water to Southern Arizona.

FICO and Freeport last year jointly finished work on a $17.1 million project to build a series of CAP-bearing pipelines totaling 11 miles to take the water to FICO’s pecan groves in the Sahuarita-Green Valley area.

Freeport supplies 65% of the 10000 acre-feet of CAP water that’s now used on the pecan groves and paid $11.2 million for construction. FICO supplied the balance of the construction tab.

The remaining CAP water used at the groves is owned by Tucson Water.

In all Freeport says it imports about 30000 to 50000 acre-feet of CAP a year to the Phoenix and Tucson areas. The company exchanges the CAP water besides what’s used on the pecan groves with other users for the rights to groundwater lying closer to its mines in the Green Valley area and in Gila County’s Miami.

Freeport leases 22000 acre feet of CAP water from the Gila River Indian Community that is being stored at other farms around the state which the state recognizes as “groundwater savings facilities.”

Able to pump elsewhere

Putting that CAP water onto the farms allows Freeport to do future exchanges of that water for other groundwater or to gain long-term credits from the stored CAP that allow Freeport to pump groundwater elsewhere including at its Sierrita Mine just west of Green Valley.

The credits are granted by the Arizona Department of Water Resources which regulates groundwater pumping under a 1980 state law calling for an end to over-pumping of aquifers in the Tucson area and other urban areas by 2025. These credits provide legal compensation for the groundwater pumped elsewhere and Tucson Water gets similar credits for the CAP water it uses to irrigate the groves.

Between them the pecan groves and the Sierrita Mine use 48000 to 51000 acre-feet a year. That’s equivalent to about half of what the 739000 people served by Tucson Water use each year.

No immediate cuts

When shortages occur both Freeport’s and Tucson Water’s CAP supplies being used at the groves won’t be affected for at least the first two years because that water has a higher priority than the CAP water that will be cut at first.

Those first-round cuts likely to begin next year will fall largely on Pinal County farms.

Under the complex system that state and federal officials have established to manage potential future cuts in CAP deliveries CAP users with a lower priority will get their supplies reduced or eliminated before those with a higher priority.

The water irrigating the pecan groves south of Tucson in Pima County is a mix of two different types of CAP supplies that have higher priorities than the Pinal farmers so will be be cut off at later stages of shortages.

Starting in 2023 some of the CAP water belonging to Freeport that is used at the pecan groves could start being cut. At first the cuts will be “mitigated” by other water supplied by the state and the CAP’s operators.

2026 to be a key year

By 2026 assuming shortages continue through then no more mitigation will occur. But Freeport even then could make use of credits it gets from other CAP supplies that it has stored elsewhere for many years said Linda Hayes a Freeport spokeswoman.

Also when no more mitigation water is available Freeport could send some of the CAP water it leases from the Gila River tribe to the groves if some of the supplies now being used for the pecan trees are reduced Hayes said.

But starting in 2026 if levels at Colorado River reservoir Lake Mead continue to fall CAP could suffer a more severe shortage that would start to cut some of even the top priority project water now being placed at the pecan groves.

Hopes for new technologies

Walden said he hopes that as clean water becomes more scarce and expensive the market will develop new technologies to use water more efficiently and clean it more effectively.

He cited desalination of brackish groundwater and recycling of wastewater for human consumption as possible examples.

“Other countries such as Israel Australian and Switzerland and even (California’s) Orange County are leaders in developing state-of-the-art purification techniques that make water fit for human consumption that would otherwise go to waste. Desalinization has come a long way as well especially with brackish as opposed to ocean salt water” Walden said.

FICO officials are “proud of the fact that we’ve been able to be helpful in reducing our groundwater use through the waterline and will continue to do so by farming in the most efficient way possible” Walden said.

If the current drought persists “we’ll respond by using the water available to us in the future be it reclaimed water groundwater reduced deliveries of CAP water or some combination thereof” he said.

Climate change analysis

Freeport’s Hayes added: “A sustained drought for longer periods is a concern. We know that climate change is expected to exacerbate drought conditions.”

To deal with that and other potential climate-related risks across Freeport’s entire business the company has started work on “a robust and comprehensive climate change scenario analysis” with help from an outside consultant Hayes said.

The analysis will identify potential climate-related risks and opportunities including those involving water stretching to 2050 Hayes said.

Freeport will also study opportunities to enhance its resilience and that of nearby local communities. The company expects to provide more information about its findings and recommendations later this year.

In addition the mining company has taken significant steps to switch to as much renewable recycled low quality and reused water as possible Hayes said. It continues to evaluate additional water reuse and recycling options and improve water efficiencies at all operations she added.

“Company-wide we used four times more recycled water than new water in 2019 achieving a water-use efficiency rate of 87%” Hayes said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvaGVhbHRoY2FyZS9iaW90ZWNoL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUvY2lwYWNhLWV5ZXMtdG8tbWFuYWdlLTEwMDAtaWN1LWJlZHMtaW4tMi15ZWFycy1pbi1zb3V0aGVybi1zdGF0ZXMtdG9wLW9mZmljaWFsL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgzMjc3ODkzLmNtc9IBrgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvaGVhbHRoY2FyZS9iaW90ZWNoL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUvY2lwYWNhLWV5ZXMtdG8tbWFuYWdlLTEwMDAtaWN1LWJlZHMtaW4tMi15ZWFycy1pbi1zb3V0aGVybi1zdGF0ZXMtdG9wLW9mZmljaWFsL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MzI3Nzg5My5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CIPACA eyes to manage 1000 ICU beds in 2 years in Southern states: Top official,"Find this comment offensive?

Flyers in and around Jackson will now be able to fly dozens of domestic and international routes through the airline including nonstop flights to Atlanta Houston Orlando Florida and the Baltimore-Washington D.C. metro area.

Southwest's return comes as the airport is in the midst of a downturn in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The airline's departure in 2014 after 17 years of service also dealt a blow to the destination as it provided 27% of available seats out of Jackson at the time according to a Jackson State University study.

Low-fare flights abound:Frontier Airlines to resume flights from Jackson to Orlando Disney World

Air travel may start to pick up as more Americans receive COVID-19 vaccinations and begin to plan vacations again. According to a March report from Forbes airlines have started to report increases in bookings and more people passing through airport security checkpoints. Experts believe those airlines may be attempting to focus on domestic travelers as the industry continues to recover from losses incurred by the pandemic.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in October that he was pleased Southwest chose to return to the capital city calling it great news for travelers.

“I want to applaud the JMAA Board of Commissioners and CEO for their hard work and vision. JAN has become a strong regional competitor and Southwest’s return is the most recent evidence of their efforts” he said.

A Muslim woman from Texas said Southwest Airlines discriminated against her for wearing a hijab.

Fatima Altakrouri told NBC DFW she was denied the chance to sit in an emergency exit row while her sister who wasn't wearing a veil was not.

The two were flying from Fort Lauderdale Florida to Dallas Texas on May 22. Altakrouri said she and her sister Muna Kowni saw the emergency exit row had the last two seats near each other on the plane.

Altakrouri said she asked a flight attendant whether she could sit there and was told she couldn't. She also overheard a flight attendant say she ""couldn't speak English and would bring the whole plane down in an emergency"" according to a release on Altakrouri's complaint from the Dallas-Fort-Worth chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

""I told her twice 'She speaks English"" Kowni told USA Today. ""She's spoken English in front of her.""

Altakrouri told multiple outlets she has filed a complaint with the Department of Transportation.

Southwest Airlines did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Spokesperson Brandy King told USA Today that the company's internal reports ""do not support claims made by the passenger regarding comments or decisions being made based upon appearance.""

""The safety of our passengers is paramount and individuals seated in an exit row are required to verbally indicate that they can perform certain duties in flight"" King's statement continued. ""Our Crew is responsible for getting that confirmation from a passenger before seating them in an overwing exit row and was unable to gain acknowledgment from the passenger during boarding. Therefore as a courtesy the Crew offered her an alternate seat.""

Southwest has been in hot water for alleged discriminatory behavior in the past. In October of last year for example Southwest apologized to a 22-year-old woman who was barred from boarding a flight to Chicago for wearing a ""lewd obscene and offensive"" top.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndsYnQuY29tL3ZpZGVvLzIwMjEvMDYvMDcvc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLW1ha2VzLWl0cy1iaWctcmV0dXJuLWphY2tzb24tbWVkZ2FyLXdpbGV5LWV2ZXJzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYWlycG9ydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines makes its big return to the Jackson Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport,"Southwest Airlines makes its big return to the Jackson Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport

It happened on a Southwest Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Orlando last summer. And the now-retired pilot Michael Haak 60 of Longwood pleaded guilty last week to a misdemeanor charge of lewd behavior and was sentenced to a year of probation and a $5000 fine.

More Cerabino humor:Dear graduates congratulations for all you've (accomplished/endured) | Frank Cerabino

Federal prosecutors said that Haak left the pilot’s seat and disrobed in the cockpit after the plane had reached its cruising altitude. Then he began watching porn on a laptop computer.

At some point he metaphorically began to bring his recreational pursuits in for their final descent in front of the female co-pilot a woman he had first met that day.

“As the plane continued its flight Haak further engaged in inappropriate conduct in the cockpit as the first officer continued to perform her duties as an assigned aircrew member” the prosecution statement reads.

Now I know why the cockpit door is locked.

Airline pilot taking some personal time in cockpit

The passengers on the Southwest flight had no idea that their pilot was spending some very personal me-time during the flight.

And Haak while speaking at his sentencing hearing made it sound like this was just some kind of good-natured camaraderie he was sharing with the female co-pilot – again a woman he just met.

“It started as a consensual prank between me and the other pilot” Haak said. “I never imagined it would turn into this in a thousand years.”

OK I know what you are thinking. Clearly he’s got an imagination deficiency.

I mean who wouldn’t imagine – in less than a thousand nanoseconds – that getting out of your pilot’s seat to disrobe and carry on in front of a woman you barely know might somehow backfire?

That it would be more easily classified as sexual harassment than a prank?

Cockpit porn is harmless prank?

But in Haak’s defense this happened on a Southwest Airlines flight.

Anybody who flies on Southwest knows that the company encourages its flight crews to imagine themselves as airborne comedians.

The airline has a culture statement that stresses a “fun-LUVing attitude” for its employees.

Flight crews are encouraged to project light-hearted demeanors and to be creative with their public-address announcements to the passengers. Passengers seem to enjoy it and many pass on through online posts the funny things they hear from the crews on Southwest flights.

They say things like “In order to enhance the appearance of your flight crew we will be dimming the cabin lights” or “Your bags will be available on Carousel 4 in the terminal or two weeks later on eBay.”

They tell passengers to be careful removing their bags from the overhead compartments because “shift happens.”

'Fun' at Southwest is part of the culture

Even the safety announcements are fodder for humor on Southwest.

“Should this flight turn into a cruise your seat cushion can be used as a floatation device” is a common line.

The pilots get in on the fun too: “Sorry folks for that rough landing” one pilot was reported as saying. “It wasn’t my fault. It was the asphalt.”

Another pilot made this announcement as the plane was taxiing at the airport: “If the window seat is open on your row please move to it so that when we pass by Delta over there they will think that our planes are full.""

So maybe Haak’s “not in a thousand years” surprise that getting nekkid and watching porn during the flight was just taking the fun-LUVing to a new level.

At least he didn’t make an announcement about it.

“Ladies and gentlemen we have reached our cruising altitude so sit back and relax while I get out of these clothes and watch 'Grinding Nemo.' ”

Helping Southwest develop new announcements

Now that this story has gone viral it’s a great opportunity for Southwest flight crews to craft jokes that give passengers the impression that all their pilots are in the cockpit disrobed watching porn and spending some very personal me-time during the flight.

I think I can help. Here are four sample announcements that flight crews on Southwest might want to use:

1. “Ladies and gentlemen we have reached our cruising altitude of 30000 feet so I’ll be turning off the pants-belt sign in the cockpit.”

2. “Ladies and gentlemen I’m being told from the cockpit that we anticipate experiencing some turbulence over Dallas … er excuse me I’m being corrected. That’s over 'Debbie Does Dallas.' ”

3. “Ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking. I can’t tell you how much I’ve enjoyed flying you today to your destination. And I mean that. Literally.

""I really can’t tell you. That’s what my attorney says. Sorry.”

4. “Ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking. Does anybody have a battery charger for a Mac laptop?

""My battery died in the middle of my movie and I really need to see how it comes out in the end. Thanks loads.

""In other news those of you sitting on the left side of the plane might want to look out of your windows.

""That’s the Grand Canyon down below. … Oh never mind. I’m being told by my first officer that’s the skyline of Cleveland Ohio.”

Video Goes Viral,"In a shocking incident a woman inside the US-based Southwest Airlines punched a flight attendant when the latter asked her to wear her seat belt as the plane was preparing to land at San Diego International Airport. A viral video of the incident is now making rounds on social media where the attendant’s face is seeing to bleeding after the woman passenger hit her so hard.

The incident reported by CBS News stated that the flight was flying from Sacramento to San Diego. The video shows that 28-year-old Vyvianna Quinonez getting on her feet and hitting the attendant when asked to follow the instruction. The flight attendant sustained injuries while two of her teeth also broke during the brawl.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 0.72%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtbnlzZS0xNjE0NDAyNzEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

Global Cost Reduction Program Supporting Gross Margin Expansion

The Company continued executing a series of initiatives that are expected to generate $1.5 billion of pre-tax run-rate cost savings by the end of 2024 growing to $2 billion by the end of 2025. Of the $2 billion savings $1.5 billion is expected to be delivered through a supply chain transformation that leverages strategic sourcing drives operational excellence consolidates facilities and optimizes the distribution network and reduces complexity of the product portfolio.

These actions are expected to return adjusted gross margins* to historical 35%+ levels. Additionally the Global Cost Reduction Program is expected to optimize the Company's cost base to fund investments that accelerate growth in core businesses.

The Global Cost Reduction Program generated incremental pre-tax run-rate cost savings in first quarter 2024 of $145 million. Since inception of the program in mid-2022 the Company has generated approximately $1.2 billion in pre-tax run-rate savings and reduced inventory by $1.9 billion.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

1970s

Total stores: 4

Starbucks was born in 1971 in Seattle by three friends from the University of San Francisco all instructed in the art of roasting by gourmet coffee company Peet’s founder. Throughout the 70s they sold Peet’s roasted coffee beans and grinders proving popular and profitable grossing US$46832 in the first nine months and opening a second store in 1972. They began roasting their own beans and opened a roasting plan in 1978. The brand’s name and logo were inspired by nautical mythology the logo a mermaid (though brown not green) and the name taken from Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick. Starbucks moved to its second location in 1977 Seattle’s famed Pike Place Market where the store with the original brown logo still remains.

1980s

Total stores: 55

In 1982 after Starbucks opened its fifth store featuring the first Starbucks bar and selling brewed coffee Howard Schultz joins Starbucks as director of marketing and starts providing coffee to fine restaurants and espresso bars. Following a buying trip to Milan where he experienced a cultural awakening inspired by the city’s coffee bars Schultz tried to convince Starbucks to test the coffeehouse concept in downtown Seattle. They decline and Schultz opens his own coffee bar Il Giornale in 1985 using Starbucks roasted beans and in 1987 acquires Starbucks for US$3.8m becoming CEO of Starbucks Corporations. He opens stores in Chicago and Vancouver Canada with 55 stores by the end of the 80s. Full health benefits are offered to all employees in 1988.

1990s

Total stores: 2498

Starbucks becomes the first privately owned US company to offer a stock option program and completes its initial IPO in 92. It makes numerous acquisitions including Tazo Tea and extends the brand into grocery channels US-wide including its newly launched Frappuccino bottles. It was the decade Starbucks starts giving back launching its Foundation opening stores in underserved neighbourhoods via a joint-venture partnership with Magic Johnson establishing an emergency financial assistance fund for partners and partnering with Conservation International to promote sustainable coffee-growing practices.

The 90s saw a 45-fold increase in store openings from 55 to 2498 including debuting its first online store first licensed airport store (Seattle) first drive-through location and first store outside of the US (Japan in 96) before rolling out global stores in the UK Malaysia New Zealand Thailand China Kuwait and Lebanon among others.

2000 – 2010

Total stores: 16858

Ethics health sustainability and digital dominate the decade. Starbucks begins selling Fairtrade certified coffee introduces ethical coffee-sourcing guidelines debuts its first two Farmer Support Centers (Costa Rica Rwanda) unveils the industry’s first paper beverage cup eliminates all artificial trans fats from beverages and acquires Ethos Water. Store openings grow seven-times during the decade across 42 new countries including Hong Kong Australia Saudi Chile Turkey Germany Brazil Russia and Jordan and its first overseas roasting facility.

Having stepped back from the CEO role in 2000 chairman Schultz returns in 2008 adopting a new company mission statement focused on ‘inspiring and nurturing the human spirit’ and upping digital transformation unveiling Starbuck’s first online community debuting Twitter/Facebook pages launching a loyalty card program and Starbucks Card mobile payment and offering customers unlimited Wi-Fi.

2011-2021

Total stores: 32000

Starbucks doubles its number of stores with 15000+ in the US alone and extends its reach to 80 countries including Guatemala Morocco Finland India and Vietnam. Elevation takes centrestage with the acquisition of La Boulange and Teavana launch of Cold Brew iced coffee and opening of Starbucks’ first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in Seattle. The company reaches a 99% ethically sourced coffee milestone in 2015 and opens an ethical coffee farming R&D centre in Costa Rica.

Hiring its first chief community officer in 2012 the brand opens its first community store in an underserved neighbourhood with 15 more opening during the decade; rolls out US$1.5m in neighbourhood grants creates a community fund of US$100m to help advance racial equity commits to hiring 10000 military veterans and 100000 opportunity youth and hires its first chief inclusion and diversity officer in 2020. And on March 18 2019 Starbucks opens its milestone 30000th store in Shenzhen China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZWVodWdnZXIuY29tL3N0YXJidWNrcy1yZXVzYWJsZS1jdXAtcHJvZ3JhbS1ldXJvcGUtbWlkZGxlLWVhc3QtYWZyaWNhLTUxODc3OTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks Launches Reusable Cup Program in EMEA,"Starbucks announced a reusable ""Cup Share"" program that will be in every one of its 3840 stores across Europe Africa and the Middle East by 2025. The plan which is part of the company's efforts to cut down on waste will start immediately with a trial in the U.K. France and Germany before rolling out to other countries based on user feedback and local regulations.

Customers can put a deposit on one of the specially-made reusable cups that work for both hot and cold beverages. They come in three sizes and have been tested to last up to 30 times. Each cup has an identifying number that allows the company to track when a deposit has been paid. When the customer is finished with it the cup is returned to a kiosk or cashier and the deposit is refunded.

The cup itself is designed with waste reduction in mind. Its ""patented foaming technology... results in a rigid and durable wall structure with up to 70% less plastic than current reusable cups."" It provides insulation for hot and cold drinks without needing a sleeve which further reduces waste.

Customers opting for the reusable cup will receive a further 25-30 pence/cent discount on their purchase while those in Germany U.K. Switzerland and the Czech Republic will have to pay a 5-cent surcharge if they opt for a disposable paper cup. This is a smart disincentive and one that should be increased considerably to act as an even greater deterrent. The less attractive disposability becomes the more people will avoid it.

A press release says that the Cup Share program has been designed to ""overcome barriers currently limiting reusable cup usage."" According to a U.K.-based study conducted by environmental behavior expert Hubbub and commissioned by Starbucks in 2019 the biggest barriers to reusable cup use are forgetfulness and embarrassment. More than one-third (36%) of people own reusable cups that they don't use because they forget to bring them and 27% say they'd feel embarrassed asking a store to put a drink in their own cup.

By providing an in-store option for reusability both of these problems are resolved. The request to fill a cup becomes legitimate even encouraged and the customer doesn't have to bring their own cup from home.

Hubbub's CEO Trewin Restorick said ""It is massively encouraging to see the steps that Starbucks is taking which makes it as easy as possible for people to choose a reusable cup. The company has run reuse trials to understand what incentivizes customers to act and pioneered different pricing mechanisms. Building on this expertise they have set out bold plans using their scale and influence to chart a new way forward that could change the entire industry.""

It would be nice to see additional measures put in place to encourage people to use their own however. Thirty uses isn't all that many for a reusable cup—only a month's worth of daily coffees. Most people own insulated cups that they've used far more times than that which is why an incentive that greatly discounts bringing one's own should be a top priority for the company—something like 1 Euro or more. This could be offset by greatly increasing the surcharge for disposables to act as a true deterrent. If that is too complicated a basic sign above the cash that says ""We'd love to fill your reusable cup"" might go a long way toward building customer participation.

This news follows an announcement that Starbucks will eliminate all disposable cups in South Korea by 2025. All of these new initiatives are helping to get the company toward its goal of cutting landfill waste in half by 2030. It has a long way to go. Bloomberg cites an audit that found Starbucks dumped 868 metric kilotons of coffee cups and other waste in 2018 more than twice the weight of the Empire State Building.

John Hocevar campaign director for Greenpeace USA Oceans said Starbucks is starting to show the kind of leadership we need to see from a company of its size but that there's still a long way to go:

""Ultimately it is not enough to offer a reusable program in only some countries; Starbucks must move away from disposable cups and toward reuse across its locations worldwide. While this is a great indication of where the company wants to go there are still tens of thousands of Starbucks stores handing out billions of throwaway cups each year. Making reusability the only option will make Starbucks the kind of leader that other companies relying on throwaway plastic will need to find a way to follow.""

In the meantime for those of us in North America where reusable cup programs have not yet been announced please persist in taking your reusable cup to the coffee shop. The more people who do it the more it's normalized—and the more it signals to companies that this should be a top priority.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml2cHJlc3NvbmxpbmUuY29tL29wZW4vc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWV5ZXMtbmV3LWxvY2F0aW9uLWluLWltcGVyaWFsL2FydGljbGVfM2QwMDZmODQtYzY1Yy0xMWViLTg0MTMtYTMxZGM2NjBlNTc2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks eyes new location in Imperial | Open | ivpressonline.com,"1371138342::cfb49c8e-2422-11e5-99a3-d7f5c6e8b241

The stock of Starbucks (NAS:SBUX 30-year Financials) is believed to be modestly overvalued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $111.99 per share and the market cap of $132 billion Starbucks stock appears to be modestly overvalued. GF Value for Starbucks is shown in the chart below.





Starbucks Stock Gives Every Indication Of Being Modestly Overvalued

Because Starbucks is relatively overvalued the long-term return of its stock is likely to be lower than its business growth which averaged 9.1% over the past three years and is estimated to grow 6.79% annually over the next three to five years.

Investing in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company. Starbucks has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.17 which is worse than 67% of the companies in Restaurants industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Starbucks at 3 out of 10 which indicates that the financial strength of Starbucks is poor. This is the debt and cash of Starbucks over the past years:

It is less risky to invest in profitable companies especially those with consistent profitability over long term. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. Starbucks has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months the company had a revenue of $23.8 billion and earnings of $0.84 a share. Its operating margin is 7.48% which ranks better than 81% of the companies in Restaurants industry. Overall the profitability of Starbucks is ranked 8 out of 10 which indicates strong profitability. This is the revenue and net income of Starbucks over the past years:

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Starbucks is 9.1% which ranks better than 84% of the companies in Restaurants industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -11.2% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Restaurants industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Starbucks's return on invested capital is 5.12 and its cost of capital is 6.51. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Starbucks is shown below:

TikTok user @torivile who appears to be a Starbucks employee posted the video which now has over 230000 likes. The video showed multiple bags filled with Minute Maid lemonade and Torani syrup.

The caption read: “we aint even Starbucks no more.”

@torivile ice in the toddy bc no ice bucket / store bought lemonade and syrups?¿ #starbucks #fyp ♬ –

One TikTok user commented “and I thought my store had it bad..” while another was quick to reassure that “This is normal when shipments don’t come in or you don’t order enough product sometimes this is why your drink could taste a bit different.”

Starbucks has been facing a shortage of fan-favorite drinks like the Very Berry Hibiscus Refresher as the coffee chain experiences nationwide supply issues.

For weeks Starbucks customers have reported via social media not being able to order drinks like a Frappuccino Peach Green Tea Lemonade Iced Guava Passionfruit Drink and drinks using oat milk. Others claim their local Starbucks are also out of various syrups which makes many drinks unavailable.

@Starbucks why are yall ALWAYS out of the very berry hibiscus — yailine (@yailxne) June 4 2021

Starbucks responded to an upset customer sharing: “the Iced Guava Passionfruit Drink will be temporarily unavailable as we work to restock some of your other favorite beverages.”

Hi Kelly. The Iced Guava Passionfruit Drink will be temporarily unavailable as we work to restock some of your other favorite beverages. Thank you for your patience! — Starbucks (@Starbucks) June 5 2021

Luckily for many concerned customers Starbucks has no plans to discontinue the popular Very Berry Hibiscus Refresher. The company is simply waiting for supplies.

A vintage Jantzen Diving Girl she’s dressed in a bikini top and a light pink swim cap. Her finned mermaid tail a sparkly blue and emerald green shimmers in the right light and her arms are outstretched as if preparing to take a deep dive off the 1962 Airstream trailer sitting below.

Meet Winenona the official mascot for Wine on Wheels a mobile bar that’s been popping up at weddings parties and events all over the Tampa Bay area.

“For the most part everyone wants her up there” said owner Melody Maria whose roaming cocktail business has blossomed during the pandemic.

An increased interest from cautious clients looking to entertain outdoors in socially distant settings has led to a boom in mobile bar businesses like Maria’s. From small intimate gatherings to large 100-plus-people events Maria says she’s fielded requests for everything from backyard barbecues to boozy brunches and lavish garden engagement parties.

The idea for a mobile bar came from a lifetime love of travel Maria 52 said. Originally from Minneapolis she launched Wine on Wheels in late 2018 after relocating to St. Petersburg several years prior. Before the move Maria worked in advertising marketing bartending and event planning.

A business model where she got to take her talents on the road felt like a natural progression that fused all her career paths into one Maria said. So when she came upon a listing for a 1962 Airstream trailer for sale in Fort Myers she knew she couldn’t pass it up.

Outfitted with mid-century modern decor inside including a reclaimed bowling alley floor the bar looks out through a 6-foot-wide window that’s decorated with lights fresh flowers and drink garnishes. Since launching the silver Airstream — and Winenona — have attracted their own kind of fanfare Maria said. “Usually what I get from people is that they want to live in it” she laughed.

Because Florida state law forbids mobile businesses like Maria’s from selling alcohol directly to consumers she operates it as a “dry bar for hire” service — meaning she can’t sell individual gin and tonics to anyone who walks up to her rig but if someone hires her team to sell mimosas to 100 people at a private event and pays for it ahead of time that’s perfectly fine. Through partnering with local liquor companies like St. Petersburg Distillery Maria says she often works in tandem on promotional events at markets and events like St. Petersburg’s ArtWalk.

From a midday mimosa bar for a newly engaged couple to a 200-person wedding each bar setup is uniquely tailored to what a client envisions for their personal event. A short interview and questionnaire form let Maria know the size scale and general design desired after which she comes up with a proposal. Pricing varies but prospective clients can expect that a party for 150 people with wine beer and a few cocktails might fall somewhere in the $1500 range while larger events at bigger venues can run upwards of $2200.

What makes Wine on Wheels fitting for so many different occasions is that guests can tailor the theme and decor entirely to their own taste. Though Maria loves to be behind the bar she says she happily hires outside bartending staff for clients who might be searching for a different look. Even Winenona who has to be hoisted onto the trailer before each event is an optional piece of flair. If she doesn’t jibe with the party’s aesthetic she’ll stay behind. (Most people love having her along for the ride though.)

Maria says her favorite part of the job is getting out into the community and meeting new people. The Airstream trailer is its own conversation piece and people love to stop and chat.

“It’s an iconic piece of history” she said. “Hearing the stories from people about growing up traveling in them — it brings back memories.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy52Y3N0YXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC9zb2NjZXIvMjAyMS8wNi8wNi9jaWYtY2hhbXAtc3QtYm9uYXZlbnR1cmUtbG9zZXMtZGl2aXNpb24tdi1zdGF0ZS1yZWdpb25hbC1maW5hbC83NTc1OTg4MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banged-up CIF champ St. Bonaventure loses in Division V state regional final,"The thigh injury was protected by two layers of tape and sliding pants meant for the softball field.

But the idea of missing the CIF State Division V regional final was much more painful for Leilani Armenta.

So the hobbled star striker found the strength to give the St. Bonaventure High girls soccer team one last run out before the book closed on her memorable sophomore season.

The CIF-Southern Section Division 6 champion Seraphs’ run ended with a 1-0 loss to visiting Temecula-Linfield Christian on Saturday night at Ventura College.

“It was an amazing season” Armenta said. “Nobody expected us to be here this season. Being here today was truly a blessing. The outcome was not what we wanted … but we had our opportunities.

Playing without injured starters Sara Kurgan and Lorenza Misel and with Armenta at far less than 100% the Seraphs’ 10-match winning streak was snapped despite a valiant effort until the final whistle.

“These girls have gone through a lot” St. Bonaventure coach Eisa Ganjour said. “It’s really nice to see them come together and pull this off like this.

“Like I told them there’s no shame losing a state final like this. They are CIF champions and they should be very proud of themselves.”

The Seraphs (11-4-1) edged Linfield Christian (17-3-3) in the section final 1-0 on Armenta’s overtime golden goal last weekend.

A week later Linfield Christian forced in a corner kick in traffic in the 11th minute and goalkeeper Heidi Marshall made it stand up with three spectacular saves. Marshall denied Armenta on a breakaway in the 17th minute and then tipped an Armenta free kick and Armenta’s headed corner over the crossbar seconds apart on the hour mark.

The banged-up Seraphs never stopped scrapping and running. They fought lasted until second-half stoppage time when Armenta hit the post with an incredible long-range effort from a tight angle after a desperate mazy run.

“She made some amazing saves” Armenta said. “I hit the post. They didn’t have as many opportunities as us. They had that one lucky corner. It was a cluster in the box. That’s just how it goes sometimes.”

The postseason isn’t over for St. Bonaventure senior Finnegan Saucedo who spent the night racing up and down the wing after helping the Seraphs’ softball team win its CIF-SS Division 6 second-round playoff game by hitting a triple.

“Being busy is just how I roll” Saucedo said. “I’ve been doing it all my life.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXctZmluZGluZy1pbi00OS1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLWluZHVzdHJpZXMtdGhlLW1ham9yLWZpcm1zLWFyZS1vd25lZC1ieS1jb21tb24taW52ZXN0b3JzLTE1OTgwOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New finding: in 49 Australian industries the major firms are owned by common investors,"In more than a fifth of Australia’s industries the two biggest firms control at least half the market.

Think of telecommunications supermarkets department stores packaging airlines hardware service stations cinema chains and commercial television.

In industries like these there’s a temptation to share the spoils — not to compete too hard on price or service.

How much stronger would that temptation be if both dominant firms in each industry were owned by the same shareholder or set of shareholders?

Neither firm might want to put the other out of business.

There’s evidence to suggest this has indeed been the case in the United States where increases in common ownership have been linked to higher airline fares more expensive pharmaceuticals and higher bank fees.

It’s enough to make you wonder whether there’s common ownership in Australia.

Competitors share owners

To find out Andrew Leigh and I collected data from IBISWorld on the firms that compete with each other across Australia’s 443 industries.

We then matched that data to shareholding disclosures for each of the firms listed on the share market and analysed the extent to which competitors were owned by the same investors.

Our findings just published in Economic Record are troubling.

They identify common ownership in 49 of Australia’s 443 industries.

Read more: Should monopoly businesses have an obligation to create competition?

They are significant industries. The 49 together account for more than one third of Australia’s total industry revenue.

They include commercial banking explosives manufacturing fuel retailing general insurance and iron ore mining.

In firms in those industries in which we can identify at least one owner 31% share a substantial owner with a rival.

Concentration is bigger than it looks

Market concentration is traditionally measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) on a scale in which an HHI of less than 1500 is considered to be competitive an HHI of 1500 to 2500 is considered to be a moderately concentrated and an HHI of 2500 or more to be a highly concentrated.

When we modified the HHI to take account of common ownership the scores of some industries jumped.

The index for banking jumped from 1534 to 5850; the index for funds management services jumped from 1254 to 3014. The index for department stores jumped from 3061 to 4888.

All up effective market concentration was 20% higher than had been thought.

This is a problem because concentrated markets have been linked to a decline in the labour share of income low productivity growth and low investment as well as high prices markups and rising inequality — all challenges Australia is facing.

Who are these common owners? They are overwhelmingly institutional investors predominantly BlackRock and Vanguard.

This is unsurprising given one of either BlackRock Vanguard or State Street is the largest shareholder in 88% of S&P500 companies in the United States.

BlackRock Vanguard and State Street

But do they influence corporate decisions? The literature suggests they do.

Documenting the channels through which common owners affect competition Nathan Shekita identifies 30 cases of common owner intervention across industries including pharmaceuticals oil and gas banking and ride-sharing.

In 2019 BlackRock engaged 2050 times with 1458 companies in 42 markets.

Martin Schmalz provides a case study of how this can occur.

An activist hedge fund campaigned in 2015 to have DuPont take a more aggressive approach to winning market share from its competitor Monsanto.

The campaign was opposed by institutional investors including BlackRock and Vanguard. Upon the news that the activist campaign against DuPont had been defeated Monsanto’s shares rose 3.5%.

Schmalz believes it’s possible that these institutional investors voted to maximise the value of their entire portfolio which included significant stakes in DuPont’s competitor.

Our own study has plenty of limitations. We can only see Australian firms that are listed on the securities exchange we can only observe shareholdings that exceed 5% we can only see the largest competitors.

Read more: Is Australia’s media market one of the world's most concentrated?

These data limitations mean we might have understated common ownership.

Our findings ought to be enough to get policymakers and regulators looking more deeply into common ownership and monitoring its changes.

Rafael's share of the deal is estimated at $150 million.

The positions are a Rafael development and are referred to in the IDF as ""lethal"" positions. They are used by the IDF’s ground forces on Armed Personnel Carriers (APC) as well as on navy ships. The U.S. Army is expected to equip three brigades with about 900 APCs in total with the new positions carrying a 30mm cannon.

The positions will provide the APCs with stronger firepower and better protect soldiers thanks to their remote control operation that will allow the crew to shoot while remaining inside the APC.

Meanwhile it appears that Rafael is also on its way to seal another deal for the Iron Dome defense system. The U.S. Marine Corps has announced it is looking into combining the Iron Dome’s Tamir interceptors with an American-made radar and operation system to protect American forces and interests against cruise missiles which Iran and its proxies have proven to accurately use. The Iron Dome has displayed its capabilities against such a threat in past tests.

According to a report on Janes a global open-source intelligence company the plan to integrate the Israeli missile into American systems has recently received engineering approval and a decision on whether to proceed with a deal and acquire the interceptors by 2022 will be taken soon. It is unclear whether Rafael and its American partner Raytheon will receive a direct order for the interceptors or whether they will have to bid in a tender. The two already announced a year ago that they are preparing for a joint American-based production of Tamir interceptors. The U.S. Army has already purchased two full Iron Dome batteries for $373 million in a deal that includes IAI radars a mPrest control system and 480 interceptors.

Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz visited the U.S. last week and discussed special assistance the Americans could provide Israel including the restocking of Iron Dome interceptors replacing those used by the Israeli Air Force to intercept rockets from Gaza during last month’s Operation Guardian of the Walls.

According to reports the aid package could reach around $1 billion including funding for the purchase of American precise weaponry for Israeli aircraft which was also widely used during the Gaza operation. The United States has financed most of the cost of equipping the IDF with its Iron Dome batteries to date with about half of the system's components being manufactured in the U.S. and transferred to Israel for final assembly.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzcmFlbGRlZmVuc2UuY28uaWwvZW4vbm9kZS81MDI1MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In latest contract with US Army Rafael to supply 30mm cannons for three Stryker brigades,"Oshkosh Defense announced on Friday that it was awarded a $942.9 million contract by the U.S. Army to integrate a 30mm Medium Caliber Weapon System (MCWS) onto the Stryker Double V Hull Infantry Carrier Vehicle.

In its statement Oshkosh said that the company has teamed with Pratt Miller and Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems to deliver an MCWS that provides increased lethality accuracy and range while maintaining the mobility and survivability of the Stryker vehicle. Oshkosh will integrate onto the vehicle's chassis a 30mm weapon system based on Rafael's proven ""Samson"" family of turrets. The contract calls for the integration of the MCWS onto three Stryker Brigade Combat Teams as well as a full spectrum of system technical support interim contractor logistics support and integrated product support Oshkosh said.

According to Army officials the first delivery order covers 91 vehicles valued at roughly $130 million. The Army could build up to six Stryker brigades with the MCWS version so the potential contract value is roughly $942 million over six years. The first unit to receive the MCWS Strykers will be the I-2 Stryker Brigade Combat Team out of Joint Base Lewis McChord in Washington State with fielding by the unit expected to be completed by December 2023.

The Defense News website reported that Oshkosh beat out two other teams adding that while the Army would not name competitors sources familiar with the process identified them as a General Dynamics Land Systems and Kongsberg Defense team and a Leonardo DRS and Moog team.",,,,,,

The two federal agencies overseeing the sector include the USDA which has faced criticism from Congress for how it secures its own data. And unlike other industries that have formed information-sharing collectives to coordinate their responses to potential cyber threats the food industry disbanded its group in 2008.

Now food producers need to face the fact that disruptive cyberattacks are part of what Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack calls their “new reality.”

National security threats to the agricultural supply chain haven’t received enough attention across the entire federal government argued Rep. Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) who serves on both the House Intelligence and Agriculture committees.

“Too often agriculture is dismissed as: ‘It’s important but it’s not that big a deal’” Crawford said in an interview. “If you eat you’re involved in agriculture. We all need to recognize that it’s a vital industry and this [incident] illustrates that.”

The North American Meat Institute which represents meatpackers declined to comment on the state of the industry’s cybersecurity measures or potential changes following the hack.

The downside of ‘enormous technology’

The cry of alarm from the University of Minnesota’s Food Protection and Defense Institute arrived in the most unassuming of packages: as one of more than 180 official comments filed to the USDA related to a presidential order about securing the nation’s supply chains.

“Fast-spreading ransomware attacks could simultaneously block operations at many more plants than were affected by the pandemic” the institute warned in its May 18 filing noting that Covid-19 last year forced a shutdown of slaughterhouses that prompted fears of meat shortages and price spikes.

It was just the latest in a series of warnings from national security and law enforcement agencies private cybersecurity companies and academic researchers.

In November the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said in a report that its threat-hunting service had witnessed a tenfold increase in interactive — or “hands-on-keyboard” — intrusions affecting the agriculture industry over the previous 10 months. Adam Meyers the company’s senior vice president of intelligence said that of the 160 hacking groups or gangs the company tracks 13 have been identified in targeting agriculture.

A 2018 report from the Department of Homeland Security examined a range of cyber threats facing the industry as it adopts digitized “precision agriculture” while the FBI said in April 2016 that agriculture is “increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks as farmers become more reliant on digitized data.”

The industry also offers plentiful targets: As the Department of Homeland Security’s cyber agency notes the ag and food sector includes “an estimated 2.1 million farms 935000 restaurants and more than 200000 registered food manufacturing processing and storage facilities” almost all under private ownership.

For decades however most farmers and foodmakers have prized productivity over all else including security — trying to eke out profits in an industry with chronically narrow margins and meet the growing global demand for food. In the quest for efficiency meat plants are ratcheting up their processing line speeds and investing in robotics to more quickly carve up carcasses. Farmers are adopting high-tech innovations like drones GPS mapping soil sensors and autonomous tractors with vast data behind it all.

All that connectivity and automation comes at a cost.

“This is part of the downside of having an enormous technology enormous capacity to turn a lot of data and become more efficient” Vilsack said. “There are risks associated with that.”

‘No industry is off limits’

The disruption to JBS which controls nearly a quarter of America’s cattle processing has raised concerns mainly about the impact on meat markets. USDA data shows wholesale beef prices have steadily ticked higher each day since the hack with choice cuts climbing above $341 per hundred pounds as of Thursday morning.

Higher prices are just one of many potential consequences. Cyberattacks could also lead to the sale of tainted food to the public financial ruin for producers or even the injury and death of plant workers according to the Food Protection and Defense Institute a DHS-recognized group.

In its public comments to USDA the institute highlighted gaping holes in the industry’s preparedness including a general “lack of awareness throughout the sector” and scant guidance from government regulators. It also noted that large parts of the industry rely on decades-old custom-written software that is essentially impossible to update along with outdated operating systems like Windows 98.

“The agriculture industry probably lags behind some of the other industries that have been hit harder by cyber crime” like the financial sector which has long been a prime target for criminals said Michael Daniel president and chief executive of the Cyber Threat Alliance a nonprofit organization.

However the JBS hack just like the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in May and the ensuing gasoline-buying panic shows that “no industry is off limits” he added. Ransomware operators “are going to go wherever they think they can extract money.”

Daniel a cyber coordinator during the Obama administration said he would recommend that industry executives take basic steps like assessing their companies’ digital preparedness and reviewing federal security guidelines.

“What I would be telling them is: You really need to be thinking about how you manage your cybersecurity risk just like you manage commodity price risk just like you manage natural disaster risk just like you manage legal risk” Daniel said.

The White House similarly advised all companies on Thursday to harden their defenses including by installing the latest software updates and requiring extra authentication for anyone logging onto their systems.

Meyers from CrowdStrike said seriousness with which cybersecurity is regarded varies “depending on who you’re talking to in the ag industry.” He said multinational conglomerates that have intellectual property worth protecting make it a priority but “as you get down the food chain so to speak they probably think about it less seriously.”

The JBS hack “is the big wake-up call for all these small medium and large businesses. You can’t stick your head in the sand and hope it’s not going to happen to you because it is” Meyers said. “You need to be prepared and you need to get yourself ready to fight. Because if you don’t you’re going to be paying a ransom and somebody’s going to be eating your lunch.”

A call for Congress to act

Congress may need to step in to help fix the situation said Crawford the House member from Arkansas who reintroduced legislation earlier this year that would establish an intelligence office within USDA. The office would serve as a conduit for the department to keep farmers informed of threats to their livelihood including espionage and cyber operations by malign actors.

A key reason the industry isn’t prepared against dangers like ransomware is that the U.S. intelligence community hasn’t considered the national security threats to agriculture as much as it should Crawford argued.

He added that communication must go both ways: Companies need to have their cyber experts share what they see with their government counterparts. No such requirements exist for the food and ag industry.

“What I would advise the private sector to do is be proactive on these things as possible” according to Crawford who is organizing a “business intelligence and supply chain integrity” forum this summer that will feature cybersecurity experts government officials and representatives from the clandestine community to educate local businesses about digital threats.

USDA has not proposed any significant policy changes following the JBS attack instead asking food and agriculture companies to take voluntary steps to safeguard their IT and infrastructure from cyber threats. Vilsack on Thursday pointed to guidelines from DHS’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency that companies can adopt for their own protection.

There’s no shortage of policy recommendations from experts in the field. Most proposals involve educating industry leaders and employees setting minimum standards for cyber safety or improving coordination between companies and agencies.

Another step recommended by the Food Protection and Defense Institute: USDA and DHS should work with the industry to create a cyber threats clearinghouse — known as an “information sharing and analysis center” — to collaborate on studying and addressing digital risks.

Other critical industries including the electricity and financial sectors already have their own ISACs but the food industry does not. Instead some food and ag companies have joined a broader information-sharing group that covers the information technology industry said Scott Algeier executive director of the IT-ISAC.

“They wanted to engage with other companies but did not have an ISAC. So they applied to us” said Algeier whose organization also provides a threat-sharing forum for the elections industry.

The nonprofit Internet Security Alliance has called for federal grants and other incentives for food companies to step up their cyber defenses.

“Increasing cybersecurity will cost money and finding the additional funding will not be simple for the sector since it is governed by tight margins and faces a highly competitive world market” the group wrote on its website.

Special to USA TODAY

Corrections and clarifications: A previous version of this story did not include AT&T's latest robocall-blocking security software ActiveArmor.

Remember back in the day when your phone rang and you would answer it? Robocallers have ruined that. Now we stare suspiciously at every call and send unknown numbers even when it looks local straight to voicemail. And for good reason.

So far in 2021 scammers have made 22 billion calls nationwide. That's roughly 67 calls to every man woman and child in America. Answering calls from an unknown number invites a scammer – and in many cases actual criminals – into your life.

Here are the five most straightforward ways to block robocalls and eventually get them to – mostly hopefully fingers crossed – stop calling us for good.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9nb2xkZW5rbmlnaHRzL2dvbGRlbi1rbmlnaHRzLWZhbnMtcmV0dXJuLWluLWZ1bGwtZm9yY2UtdG8tdC1tb2JpbGUtYXJlbmEtcGhvdG9zLTIzNzE0OTYv0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9nb2xkZW5rbmlnaHRzL2dvbGRlbi1rbmlnaHRzLWZhbnMtcmV0dXJuLWluLWZ1bGwtZm9yY2UtdG8tdC1tb2JpbGUtYXJlbmEtcGhvdG9zLTIzNzE0OTYvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Golden Knights fans return in full force to T-Mobile Arena — PHOTOS,"Fans celebrates the Vegas Golden Knights win 3-2 against the Colorado Avalanche in Game 3 of a second-round NHL hockey Stanley Cup playoff series at T-Mobile Arena on Friday June 4 2021 in Las Vegas.

The first home games for the Vegas Golden Knights in mid-January were surreal when the NHL’s 56-game pandemic season began. By 7PM when the games started darkness had enveloped the exterior of T-Mobile Arena and there was not a soul in sight on the plaza leading to the venue.

In fact metal barriers ran along the perimeter of the arena plaza. The atmosphere outside the arena was more spooky and depressing than anything else exhibiting the life existence of a nuclear winter. There was not a person to be seen except maybe another media member coming to the game or leaving the building. That’s a pandemic for you.

The one lasting image I have of leaving VGK games in January was Channel 3 sports anchor Bryan Salmond a lone figure on the vast plaza outside the arena doing a post-game remote. See this story’s lead photo.

Inside the sports venue there was not a single fan in any of the 17367 fixed seats for NHL games. Instead just red and gold seat wraps draped on every single seat.

Not having fans didn’t stop the VGK game-production folks from cranking up the volume (and base) for the in-game music though. And arena hosts Mark Shunock and Katie Marie Jones still did their pre-game welcome-to-the-VGK-game schticks even without the fans because the mere traces of a game entertainment atmosphere could trigger Golden Knights players to have that extra burst of energy on the ice to perhaps score that game-winning goal or block a shot. Hey you never know.

Such was the life of live Vegas Golden Knights games starting Jan. 14 and even in February as America struggled with a pandemic and started the march of vaccination shots across the nation.

*

On March 1 the Golden Knights welcomed the first fans back into the arena.

LVSportsBiz.com reported on all eight Las Vegas Raiders home games at Allegiant Stadium without fans in 2020.

And we also reported from all the Golden Knights home games in January and February without fans.

Our conclusion is that major league sports without fans are essentially high-powered glorified elite pick-up games with players who are the world’s best athletes competing in some of the planet’s nicest sports venues and wearing impressive uniforms. Sports without fans are a different entertainment genre. There’s a different mojo to the sports product when fans aren’t around in the venue.

The emotionality of the collective experience was missing.

You might as well play Strat-O-Matic or video games that simulate sports games.

The emotional juice was not there.

That all changed at T-Mobile Arena on March 1 when 2605 fans showed up for a hockey game between the Vegas Golden Knights and the Minnesota Wild. The Knights defeated the Wild 5-4 in overtime. (Talk about foreshadowing.)

For the first time in 363 days there were human beings in those arena hockey seats.

*

There is no disputing the simple fact that as more and more Americans were vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus while still wearing face coverings less and less Americans were dying from the novel coronavirus.

As vaccinations increased and COVID-19 cases dropped stadiums and arenas opened their doors to more and more fans.

Drawing 2605 fans per game (or 15 percent of capacity) in the month of March the Golden Knights had permission from Clark County to host more fans as the months progressed.

In April attendance was increased to 3950 a game or 22 percent of capacity.

Life was returning to the five-year-old sports and entertainment building off the Strip.

*

By May 7 VGK attendance in the arena had reached 7567.

And when the Knights hosted the first game of the Stanley Cup playoffs on May 16 attendance hit 50 percent of capacity — 8683. Perhaps you recall Minnesota defeating the Golden Knights 1-0 in overtime on that Sunday.

The Golden Knights needed seven games to dispatch nemesis Minnesota. In Games 5 and 7 against the Wild the Knights had 12156 fans in the arena or 70 percent of capacity. On May 28 the VGK defeated Minnesota 6-2 in Game 7 to clinch a playoff series for the first time at T-Mobile Arena.

*

The Golden Knights moved on to play two games against the Colorado Avalanche in Denver in a much-anticipated round two match-up between the two teams with the most points during the abbreviated regular season. The VGK lost both and returned to T-Mobile Arena and a packed house of 17504 for Game 3 Friday.

When the Golden Knights pulled out a stirring 3-2 comeback win against Colorado thanks to two goals 45 seconds apart by Jonathan Marchessault and Max Pacioretty the massive crowd at T-Mobile Arena erupted in a primal roar that rivaled the noise levels of any VGK home game during the franchise’s four years at T-Mobile Arena.

Game 4 is Sunday at 5:30PM Vegas time.

Expect another 17500 insane fans in the building that was ghostly silent just outside its doors a mere five months ago.

So what happened to all those red and gold seat coverings?

Well the Golden Knights are selling them for 10 bucks apiece.

Quit Being Snobby About Sex in Games,"Liara and Shepard are the perfect video game couple. Sending love hearts. (Credit: Bioware)

Picture this: dimming lights a photo frame strewn upon the floor a pair of worn-out snakeskin boots dusty under the bed and two bodies rolling on the mattress. Hang on isn't this supposed to be a sci-fi game? Isn't she an alien? What is going on? Where did the snakeskin boots come from? This ain't a western!

A few things are going on but we're not going to get into the nitty-gritty of the scene described above (that would just be ob-scene... get it?). We can promise you one thing though: some folks are going to be a tad unhappy. Well screw them right? Stuff 'em. What are they good for anyway? Well probably something – but certainly not this!

To be honest there are probably no snakeskin boots under Shepard's bed – that doesn't suit her style – but it sounded good so I went with it. A good way to start considering the amount of finger-pointing that's about to be had. Why issex in video games such a taboo? Oh and why is there such a double-standard? Why is sex so wrong but if we grab ourselves a sniper rifle and murder a family of Krogan everything is just A-Okay. Seems a bit unfair!

There are two kinds of snobs when it comes to video game sex prudes:

The ""I'm going to be morally opposed to sex in video games""

The ""Garrus is a babe why did you date Liara?""

Let's take a look at both of these arguments. First though let's take a moment to appreciate this: whilst it is tedious that we even need to have this conversation at least it isn't that bogus ""does violence in video games make our kids murderers"" debate. Urgk. That's always painful.

Video games cause violence? No evidence? Damn must be correct then! (Credit: Bored Panda)

The ""I'm Going to be Morally Opposed to Sex in Video Games""

The year is 2004 (or perhaps 2005) and a mini-game has been discovered in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Hot Coffee as the mini-game was dubbed allowed players to have sex in-game. Shock horror front page headline. There you go! CNET had a pretty great headline. It'll make you laugh:

Hackers behind sex change says 'Grand Theft' maker.

That's right! The headline doesn't even have the full name of the game. Not even ""Auto"". Ouch Rockstar that must have really hurt your pride. CNET's really showin' you some respect there. Anyway the headline in question was about Rockstar's initial claim that the Hot Coffee mini-game was the work of a hacker... Here's a quick quote:

In a statement on Wednesday Rockstar claimed it is not responsible for the so-called ""Hot Coffee"" mod. Instead the Take-Two Interactive subsidiary said the mod was the result of ""the work of a determined group of hackers who have gone to significant trouble to alter scenes in the official version of the game.

This claim was consequently proven false. It turns out that GTA: San Andreas'video game sex scene was just simply removed by the developers before launch but left in the source code. Before you get angry at Rockstar for lying though: who cares?

Where's the need to be offended? Most people have sex. Most people watch pornography. Pretty much everybody watches violence in television movies and games. For goodness sake: The Lion King Monsters Inc. and Harry Potter are all pretty bloody violent and it's fine. Why the hell is it okay to watch Simba literally leave Scar to be brutally torn apart and eaten by Hyenas but if Harry and Ginny bumped-uglies on-screen that would be an absolute outrage? Actually now that I think about it it's pretty stuffed up how Scar meets his demise...

If we are that concerned about children then a movie like The Lion King should probably not be shown to kids. I mean it's a great movie but that only makes sense right? Look: I'm not saying that San Andreas or Mass Effect should be played by a five-year-old. I also don't think that kids should miss out on a classic like The Lion King or Shrek. That would be a shame!

It would be irresponsible for five-year-old's to play some of these games – that's the point of rating systems like the ESRB or PEGI. It seems pretty simple to me: just don't let them play it. Now if you did stop your kids from playing inappropriate video games then who gives a toss about Liara and Shepard awkwardly getting it on or the recent Hot Coffee mod in Red Dead Redemption 2?

The ""Garrus is a babe why did you date Liara?""

Well this is a really silly argument. Garrus is one sexy beast but Liara? It's Liara. Of course you should date Liara. How's there even a question?

Yep that's the entire answer. Do you want a summary? We like summarizing stuff... Here you go: everything is ""immoral"" if you search hard enough. It's kind of hypocritical to complain aboutvideo game sex when everything is ""problematic"" if you think hard enough. The solution? Use common sense don't let your kids play GTA VI when it comes out and chill out. Seriously. Guys. Chill.

Project General Manager John Ohanian who has championed the planning and entitlement efforts for Tapestry since its beginning told the Daily Press that July is the target date for DMB Development to break ground on the 15663-home site.

“The first phase will be the property adjacent to Ranchero Road and will include 2104 total units” Ohanian said. “These will be developed over the next five years.”

The project will include a total of nine construction phases that will take about 20 years to develop Ohanian added.

DMB a developer specializing in large-scale communities also announced the groundbreaking of the project for the homes and 700000 square feet of retail and commercial space.

The Tapestry footprint lies generally between State Route 173 to the south and Summit Valley Road to the north Arrowhead Lake Road to the east and the Hesperia city limit to the west.

Two portions of Phase One stretch north beyond Summit Valley Road including one section that reaches Ranchero Road just east of Rancho Middle School and the other that ends just south of Krystal School of Science Math & Technology on Krystal Drive.

Tapestry was approved in January 2016 by the Hesperia City Council which consisted of then-Mayor Bill Holland the late Paul Russ former Councilman Eric Schmidt former Councilman Mike Leonard and the late Russ Blewett.

Now Councilman Bill Holland — the last remaining member on the dais who approved Tapestry — told the Daily Press that the groundbreaking will set off a chain reaction of road improvements.

“One of the biggest changes to the development agreement is the construction of Rancho Las Flores Parkway from I Avenue to Highway 138” Holland said. “They’re front-loading that project which will benefit the entire city.”

Road improvements

The Scottsdale Arizona-based DMB San Bernardino County and Hesperia will work to widen Ranchero Road Ohanian said.

“The City’s involvement in Phase One will be similar to our role in other housing developments which includes plan review and site inspections and other responsibilities of the Development Services Department “ said Deputy City Manager Rachel Molina in a statement. “Otherwise the City’s focus is on the Ranchero Corridor Widening Project.”

With an estimated price tag of $48 million Ranchero's widening is a joint effort between Hesperia the county and the San Bernardino County Transportation Authority Molina said.

Ranchero will be widened between the railroad underpass just east of Seventh Avenue and the Ranchero Road Interchange at Interstate 15. The project will also build a new bridge over the aqueduct as required by the state according to Molina.

Ranchero will increase to four lanes with medians and turning pockets according to Ohanian who said DMB is contributing $12 million to this improvement.

New traffic signals will be installed on Ranchero at Maple Cottonwood and Seventh avenues Holland said.

“The off-site road project is scheduled to go to bid this summer and start construction in the fall” Ohanian said. “It is an approximate 14-month project. All on-site roads and improvements will be constructed by the developer at their own expense.”

Last year the city held several online community workshops to receive feedback from the public as they work to improve I Avenue from Ranchero Road to Bear Valley Road in preparation for Tapestry the Daily Press reported.

Some of the improvements include the widening of the two-lane roadway to include a center left-turn lane.

Amenities recommended in the plan include improving sidewalks and bus shelters and adding street lighting at major intersections and Class II bike paths.

“Tapestry may be the most advantageous development for the entire city of Hesperia” Holland said. “I also believe that John Ohanian’s commitment goes beyond Tapestry which is evident as his company deploys resources that will benefit all of Hesperia.”

What took so long?

Movement on Tapestry comes nearly five years after the Hesperia City Council unanimously approved the project against a tidal wave of opposition from residents and groups.

“After project approvals we went through a series of environmental lawsuits which needed to be resolved before we could proceed” Ohanian told the Daily Press. “That lawsuit settlement was followed by a period of specific detailed designing and planning to present plans to the city that they could approve and issues permits to construct.”

In June 2017 the court battle that Hesperia officials said delayed Tapestry was resolved after the Terra Verde Group made major concessions the Daily Press reported.

The settlement — between Terra Verde and the Center for Biological Diversity the San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society and the Sierra Club — included the removal of 533 homes in the southern Grass Valley Village area which Ohanian said equates to losing nearly $50 million of the project’s value.

Removing Grass Valley allowed 1060 additional acres of open space for wildlife and the arroyo toad and created several habitat enhancements and corridors that allow wildlife to move around and under roadways.

With Tapestry's scope now updated to include fewer homes the projected population of nearly 50000 has dropped by nearly 1800 residents and will closely resemble the former Rancho Las Flores project which Terra Verde purchased in a bankruptcy sale nearly nine years ago.

The settlement of an additional lawsuit filed by the Crestline Sanitation District included a reduction in the development’s footprint on the Summit Valley floor.

The district has used the discharged area for about 40 years with a permit from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board. The effluent is used for irrigation of grazing land and recharges the groundwater basin through percolation according to Tapestry's EIR.

Ohanian said the COVID-19 pandemic threw the financial market into a “period of turmoil” which also slowed Tapestry's progress.

“Our business plan has always been to build this project with equity not debt so we needed for the investment market to stabilize” Ohanian said.

Public outcry

When Tapestry was first introduced in January 2015 many residents said the housing project would bring added traffic congestion crime noise and air pollution. They also said it would destroy the beauty and nature of Summit Valley.

Conversely a handful of people lodged praise saying Tapestry would produce local jobs revitalize the economy make homes available to millennials and bring major road improvements leading into the new community.

Some concerns included allegations of a flawed EIR the project being abandoned an incomplete water supply assessment and an exodus of High Desert residents.

Mark Pfister a general contractor told the City Council in 2016 that the EIR had many issues that have been “glossed over” and “shoved in the back” of the report that took him eight hours to read.

Pfister who lives on Highway 173 said the major issues are high density traffic and environmental concerns.

Still others said they feared major rain and snow storms would cause traffic jams in the area adding that an earthquake could damage to the nearby Cedar Springs Dam that holds in Silverwood Lake placing many lives at risk.

Benefit claims

Tapestry’s 9366-acre community is anticipated to bring more than $7 billion in capital investment upon completion of the project DMB said.

“We expect continued economic growth and employment opportunities in Hesperia Victorville and other nearby locations leading to a nice balance of jobs and housing for the entire area” Ohanian said.

According to Ohanian Tapestry will offer thousands of families opportunities for outdoor recreation within a reasonable commute to San Bernardino Riverside and Ontario.

Some residents lauded the developer for financing the project and the associated road improvements construction of a water reclamation facility and the addition of schools.

Buford Lee Cribb who lives near Ranchero Road said the project represents progress for Hesperia.

In 2019 Ohanian said that when planning for Tapestry the developer put on its “2030 glasses in order to build for future demands” with homes that will feature solar energy water recycling and walkable neighborhoods.

Who's involved?

Brent Herrington president and CEO of DMB Development called Tapestry one of the largest new communities to be developed in Southern California in years.

As such in a press release Herrington said DMB takes great pride in developing Tapestry “with a deep sense of reverence and environmental responsibility.”

“Our goal is to create a strong active and caring community that treasures the natural beauty of this area” he said.

Hesperia Venture I LLC the owner of the property and an affiliate of Schlegel Capital LLC acquired the Tapestry site in 2012 and assembled a team to plan and entitle the site for development.

Alex Vahabzadeh and Ray Wirta of Beaumont Americas a private equity investment group led financing for the project DMB officials said.

“Tapestry has the benefit of a scenic location an under-supplied housing market and convenient access to major employment centers” says Wirta. “A new community of this quality and in this setting will provide a welcome alternative for thousands of Southern California families.”

American Superconductor reported revenues of US$87m in line with expectations but it unfortunately also reported (statutory) losses of US$0.95 per share which were slightly larger than expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. With this in mind we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.

See our latest analysis for American Superconductor

Taking into account the latest results the consensus forecast from American Superconductor's three analysts is for revenues of US$109.9m in 2022 which would reflect a sizeable 26% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. The loss per share is expected to greatly reduce in the near future narrowing 24% to US$0.72. Yet prior to the latest earnings the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$98.8m and losses of US$0.64 per share in 2022. So there's been quite a change-up of views after the recent consensus updates with the analysts significantly increasing their revenue forecasts while also expecting losses per share to increase. It looks like the revenue growth will not be achieved without incremental costs.

There was no major change to the consensus price target of US$27.33 with growing revenues seemingly enough to offset the concern of growing losses. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently the most bullish analyst values American Superconductor at US$30.00 per share while the most bearish prices it at US$24.00. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting American Superconductor is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Of course another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. For example we noticed that American Superconductor's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully with revenues forecast to exhibit 26% growth to the end of 2022 on an annualised basis. That is well above its historical decline of 2.8% a year over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 11% annually. Not only are American Superconductor's revenues expected to improve it seems that the analysts are also expecting it to grow faster than the wider industry.

The Bottom Line

The most important thing to take away is that the analysts increased their loss per share estimates for next year. Happily they also upgraded their revenue estimates and are forecasting revenues to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.

Keeping that in mind we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have estimates - from multiple American Superconductor analysts - going out to 2023 and you can see them free on our platform here.

You still need to take note of risks for example - American Superconductor has 3 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

CHRISSY Teigen has been “CUT” from marketing for her new Safely cleaning brand with Kris Jenner after “sales tanked” amid her bullying scandal The Sun can reveal.

The latest career blow comes as her Cravings cookware line has been dropped from big retailers including Target Macy’s and Bloomingdale's for controversial comments she made towards Courtney Stodden.

Just days before Courtney 26 revealed they had suffered “years of bullying” at the hands of the TV personality Chrissy 35 launched a brand new cleaning brand.

Safely debuted in early May with Chrissy and Kris 65 as both founders and spokespeople for the brand.

Both of the stars were heavily featured in promo for the line since it was announced in March however since Chrissy was slammed for “bullying” women Safely has not publicly showed her once.

A source told The Sun: “Kris Jenner has been in crisis mode for weeks with Chrissy’s scandal.

“She likes Chrissy but she’s a numbers girl first and their sales tanked after all of Chrissy’s tweets came out.

“It's the worst case scenario for them they just launched their cleaning brand days before the scandal.”

The insider said that the “company has had to completely change it’s marketing strategy” because their “whole plan was to focus on the homes and families of Kris and Chrissy.”

“They know they can’t show Chrissy anymore but her with her kids was originally the whole appeal of the brand.

“It's been a very pricey mistake” the informant added.

Despite the ongoing backlash the wife of John Legend has not been completely dropped from the brand yet as “it’s tricky since she was “part of creating the company she's not just a spokesperson” the source concluded.

Reps for Safely and for Chrissy did not respond to The Sun's request for comment.

The former Lip Sync Battle host was heavily featured in ads for Safely across all social media platforms websites and commercials.

She has not been used in a public advertisement since May 9 - just before the Courtney’s comments came out.

Courtney - who is nonbinary and prefers ""they"" pronouns - alleged in a new interview that Chrissy would send horrific tweets and DMs including comments that appeared to encourage suicide.

The blonde beauty rose to fame when they married then 51-year-old actor Doug Hutchison in 2011 when they were just 16 years old.

The bullying tweets from Chrissy are from 2011 and 2012 - when Courtney was still a teen.

After the tweets were brought back into the spotlight last week Chrissy issued a public apology but the damage appears to have already been done.

Fans also dug up tweets of the mom-of-two “bullying” Lindsay Lohan and Teen Mom alum Farrah Abraham over the years.

Last month The Sun exclusively revealed that Chrissy's kitchen items have been removed from Target's website as well as Macy’s and Bloomingdales.

Yesterday it was revealed she was ""replaced on a Netflix show” Never Have I Ever she was due to appear on.

Or follow us on Google News

I just passed 15000 miles in my 2019 Tesla Model 3 SR+ and had a brief service visit. I figured this was a good time for an article on my service needs and experiences so far. This is service up to 3 months short of 2 years and as just noted right beyond 15000 miles.

Additionally during my recent service visit I got guidance on recommended or necessary service for the next few years which I think could be useful to share broadly.

Tesla Model 3 12V Battery Replacement

The service I got was a 12V battery replacement. I got a warning on the Tesla touchscreen when I went to charge one day that I needed to replace the 12V battery. Happily one of my young daughters didn’t see the warning pop up before me and purposefully or accidentally close the notification before I saw it because after dismissing the message I didn’t see it or any other notification about this again. (They are often jumping to the front to watch or play something when I go to plug in so I really could have missed the message and then had the car die on me.) It seems odd that Tesla doesn’t have this message remain somewhere (notification screen app etc.) until the issue is resolved but at least the girls didn’t get to it before me (this time).

When I was at a Tesla Service Center a few months before that I had already seen various forum discussions about Tesla vehicles getting this warning or dying without notice due to a dead 12V battery so I made sure to ask the service tech about it at that time. He said that you should get the battery replaced quickly after getting the warning. The car will still drive for a few days before the battery dies but not for very long. So I got to work and requested Tesla service to replace the 12V battery almost immediately.

I scheduled service via the app for an opening a few days later. The app indicated that it could be a mobile visit (also known as Ranger service) meaning I didn’t have to take the car to the service center — a Tesla technician just came to me.

My car is still under warranty so the battery swap was complimentary. I didn’t realize that beforehand so it was certainly a nice surprise.

Tesla Service Schedule

Back in the old days Tesla used to give Model S buyers a multi-year maintenance schedule. In fact you had to follow it or pay a fee if I recall correctly. However that wasn’t super popular new Tesla cars improved week after week even Tesla’s earliest vehicles proved the lack of need for much service and Tesla discontinued the service schedule. That said Teslas still do need some service.

Not knowing much about it and having an experienced Tesla employee right there to interrogate I asked the technician a few more questions when he was in my driveway and he offered up seemingly clear and convincing answers. He told me that the following service should be done at the designated timeframes:

Tires should be replaced as the tread gets to low. He told me mine need to be replaced in the next 2000–3000 miles or so — between about 17000 and 20000 miles. That sounds early but it’s apparently quite common with the Model 3 (ymmv). I’ll be sure to write an update in a couple of months or so.

After 2 years the car should have a brake fluid flush.

After 4 years the coolant should be replaced.

After 4–6 years the AC desiccant should be replaced.

Not too bad.

Previous Tesla Model 3 Service

Before now I had a minimal amount of service to check a few things (which didn’t really need checked) to replace the AC filter (which had gotten mildewy in the Florida heat and humidity) to rotate the tires and to glue a little trim in slightly that I thought might be sticking out too much.

A new HVAC filter cost $34 and a cleaning supply cost $16.50. Tesla Service labor would have come to $39.75 but it was done pro bono. Tesla had just recently pushed out an over-the-air firmware update to help limit how much this happened and how often the filter would need replaced and it was basically serviced without charge this time because of how soon after buying the vehicle it needed to be done (a bit more than a year into ownership).

I also asked them to check on several minor things which they did for free.

Lastly and the reason for going in I had my tires rotated which cost $35.

Almost one year prior in December 2020 I stopped into the service center to have them check a few things. Though it was all minimal and nothing needed to be done so the cost was $0.

Having owned a BMW i3 for 9 months before the Model 3 and having visited BMW service a handful of times one area where BMW did better is its service center was also much more attractive with a big TV a bunch of snacks and coffee options and a nicer and more open view. The Tesla service center a rather new one and certainly not a regional hub is much more barebones and almost warehouse-like. It’s not exactly an inspiring place. That said BMW dealers make a solid profit on service and charges well beyond their costs for many things whereas Tesla has held the view since Day 1 that service should not be a profit center and everything Tesla Service does is basically at cost.

All in all I’m very happy with Tesla Service. A few things could be a bit better but there’s very little to complain about and there’s a lot to be thankful for. It’s mostly simple quick and convenient. Also although there’s still the tendency there to worry that you’re going to spend too much on something you don’t need fixed or serviced yet the nice thing with Tesla is that you know it’s not trying to suck every dime out of you — it’s not looking to make service a profit center at all. Just don’t expect to be pampered too much and wooed for the same reason.

In the past few years an electric version of the early American automobile boom is unfolding on a global scale.

Chinese startups like Aiways Li Auto Nio WM Motor and Xpeng are already making electric vehicles ( EV s) in their thousands. In Europe Croatia’s Rimac and Spain’s Hispano Suiza are building hypercars while Britain’s Arrival is manufacturing electric vans. American companies such as Canoo Fisker Lordstown Lucid and Rivian hope to start full-scale production soon.

But what about the 520 miles of range?

When Tesla first unveiled the new Model S in January the company introduced a new Model S Plaid+ which replaced the previous Plaid as the new top performance version.

The Model S Plaid+ was advertised as having over 520 miles of range on a single charge and a 0-60 mph acceleration in less than 1.99 seconds.

As for the Model S Plaid it replaced the Model S Performance and Tesla said it would get 390 miles of range and a 0-60 mph acceleration in 1.99 seconds.

At first the automaker said that the new Model S Plaid would come in just a few weeks and the Model S Plaid+ would come in late 2021.

However Model S Plaid deliveries were delayed to now a delivery event to be held on June 10th and the Model S Plaid+ was delayed all the way to mid-2022.

Tesla even stopped people from placing new pre-orders on the new Plaid+ last month:

Now as Tesla is sending out invites to the delivery event later this week CEO Elon Musk announced that the Plaid+ is canceled:

Plaid+ is canceled. No need as Plaid is just so good. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 6 2021

When Electrek asked Musk to clarify the statement the CEO told us that Tesla is not seeing a need for a range of more than 400 miles anymore:

“What we are seeing is that once you have a range above 400 miles more range doesn’t really matter. There are essentially zero trips above 400 miles where the driver doesn’t need to stop for restroom food coffee etc. anyway.”

The biggest difference between the Plaid and Plaid+ was the ~120 more miles of range that the latter was supposed to have.

Tesla also said that it would have faster acceleration but it didn’t elaborate on how much faster it would be.

Electrek’s Take

Well I do agree with Elon that you practically never see someone drive for 400 miles without stopping 400 miles of EPA range is not real-world range in every situation.

For example people who live in colder climates would like a longer range for winter driving when your car becomes 20-50% less efficient depending on the temperature and conditions.

Also a 500-mile range does wonders to help break the psychological barrier that some people have when it comes to electric range – even if they don’t need that much range.

But other vehicles could help achieve that like the new Lucid Air which had a bit of a rivalry with the Model S Plaid+ when it was first announced and maybe the new Roadster?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZXNsYS1jYW5jZWxzLXBsYWlkLXBsdXMtbm8tbmVlZC1hZnRlci11cGdyYWRlLXRvLXJlZ3VsYXItcGxhaWQtZWxvbi1tdXNrLXR3ZWV0cy0xMTYyMzAyMzIzMdIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L3Rlc2xhLWNhbmNlbHMtcGxhaWQtcGx1cy1uby1uZWVkLWFmdGVyLXVwZ3JhZGUtdG8tcmVndWxhci1wbGFpZC1lbG9uLW11c2stdHdlZXRzLTExNjIzMDIzMjMx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla cancels Plaid Plus; 'No need' after upgrade to regular Plaid Elon Musk tweets,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-cancels-plaid-plus-no-need-after-upgrade-to-regular-plaid-elon-musk-tweets-11623023231 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZXNsYS1jYW5jZWxzLXBsYWlkLXBsdXMtbm8tbmVlZC1hZnRlci11cGdyYWRlLXRvLXJlZ3VsYXItcGxhaWQtZWxvbi1tdXNrLXR3ZWV0cy0xMTYyMzAyMzIzMdIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L3Rlc2xhLWNhbmNlbHMtcGxhaWQtcGx1cy1uby1uZWVkLWFmdGVyLXVwZ3JhZGUtdG8tcmVndWxhci1wbGFpZC1lbG9uLW11c2stdHdlZXRzLTExNjIzMDIzMjMx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Leveraging Howe & Howe’s commitment to innovation and Textron Systems’ decades of design and manufacturing excellence our M5 vehicles provide the speed mobility and unmanned capability needed to modernize future forces while protecting our warfighters. The customer will begin integration and testing of their own robotic controller technologies in preparation for the 2022 Soldier Operational Experiment. Insights gained from these vehicles will help shape future capability requirements and program priorities.



The Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) is a program launched by the U.S. Army to acquire different types of unmanned ground combat vehicles including the RCV-L RCV-M and RCV-H. The whole Robotic Combat Vehicle family will use common navigational software and control interfaces already being field-tested. Each variant will use the same electronic and mechanical standards a so-called modular open architecture that should let soldiers in the field plug and play a range of payloads from missiles to smoke generators to radio jammers.



While all of the variants are payload agnostic and can be equipped with a variety of modular mission payloads – such as Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear detection kits smoke obscuration modules electronic warfare and various weapon systems – the Light variant under 10 tons could likely support reconnaissance-related missions; the Medium under 15 tons could support direct fire augmentation; and the Heavy 20-25 tons could bring decisive lethality to its assigned unit.



This summer both the RCV (L) and RCV (M) vehicles will undergo shakedown testing individually in operations together and eventually combined with the ground vehicle capability testbed the Mission Enabling Technologies Demonstrators (MET-D) that serve as the RCV control vehicles during testing. MET-Ds are technology development tools that help the U.S. Army to evaluate emerging technology in a relevant tactical environment and decide if the new technology is worth integrating on new or legacy combat platforms.

The RIPSAW M5 from Textron Systems and Howe & Howe Inc is one of the candidates for the RCV-M variant of the RCV program which must have a weight from 10 to 20 tons.

The Ripsaw was a concept of tracked unmanned ground combat vehicle designed and built by Howe & Howe Technologies which is now part of Textron Systems. It is powered by a Diesel hybrid engine. The tracked suspension consists on each side of six road wheels four return rollers a drive sprocket at the rear and an idler at the front. It can reach a maximum speed of 72 km/h.

In October 2019 during AUSA defense exhibition in Washington D.C. the RIPSAW M5 was presented with a Protector medium-calibre turret-30 (MCT-30) armed with a 30mm/40mm Bushmaster cannon and a 7.62mm coaxial gun.

To identify the proteins that interact with Pirh2 and hence may represent its potential targets for ubiquitination we used the GST-pulldown approach combined with high-resolution MS (Fig. 1). To this end the recombinant protein Pirh2-GST was incubated with the cell extract prepared from the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T (Fig. 1A). Native GST protein was used as control for nonspecific binding. The Pirh2-GST-bound proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS.

D The list of functionally distinguished groups with selected representative proteins that interact with Pirh2. Full size image

The MS analysis has yielded 346 interacting proteins in total: 50 proteins interacted with GST only 256 proteins interacted specifically with Pirh2-GST and 40 proteins interacted with both GST and Pirh2-GST. The raw data were published in the Mendeley Datasets Repository (https://doi.org/10.17632/24bh4cvhzd.1). The data processing consisted of excluding prokaryotic proteins keratins Pirh2 protein and GST from the list of interacting proteins. Each identified protein for which at least three peptides were detected (score ≥ 3) and which either did not bind or bound poorly GST compared to Pirh2-GST was defined as significant. After processing the data obtained we revealed 225 proteins bound to Pirh2 but not GST (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S1).

We grouped the identified proteins according to their functions in the cell. As a result we found that almost half of the identified proteins belong to “Ribosomes and translation” and “RNA processing and splicing” groups (Fig. 1C D). In total we combined all identified proteins into 15 groups with several representative proteins from each group being shown in Fig. 1C D. Among the Pirh2-interacting proteins were the ones that are involved in gene expression regulation DNA repair apoptosis and tumor transformation (e.g. PARP1 ku70 Sirt1 HuR and Dicer).

To validate our GST-pulldown results we chose one of the highest (HuR) and one of the lowest scoring proteins (Ku70) and carried out reciprocal pulldowns of Pirh2 using the Ku70-GST or HuR-GST recombinant proteins. Both HuR-GST and Ku70-GST but not GST alone were able to bind Pirh2 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus we confirmed the specificity of protein–protein interactions with Pirh2 in our assay.

Pirh2 interacts with and ubiquitinates the RNA-binding protein HuR leading to its proteasomal degradation

As our results clearly suggested that Pirh2 is important for the expression of proteins we questioned whether Pirh2 can regulate the mRNA stability thereby indirectly affecting the protein biosynthesis. It is noteworthy that HuR a global regulator of mRNA stability has emerged as one of the strong Pirh2 interactors (Fig. 2). Thus we decided to investigate the functional significance of this interaction. First we performed reciprocal GST-pulldown assay using the purified HuR-GST protein and the cellular extract prepared from HEK293T cells. We demonstrated that HuR-GST binds the endogenous Pirh2 protein more strongly compared to GST supporting the previously obtained LC-MS/MS data (Fig. 2A).

A Ponceau-stained membrane. HuR-GST fusion protein and native GST protein are denoted with arrows (left); western blot analysis of Pirh2 binding to GST and HuR-GST (right). B Identification of the Pirh2 domains involved in HuR binding. WB analysis of GSTpull-down assay with purified GST-tagged proteins: GST full-length Pirh2 (Pirh2-GST) the N-terminal domain of Pirh2 1–132 a.a. (NTD-GST) the RING domain of Pirh2 138–189 a.a. (RING-GST) and the C-terminal domain of Pirh2 190–261 a.a. (CTD-GST) (upper panel); the scheme demonstrating the Pirh2 domain structure (bottom panel). C Pirh2 interacts with HuR in cellulo.

An empty pIRES vector was used as negative control. E Co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous HuR and Pirh2 proteins using anti-HuR monoclonal antibodies. Full size image

To determine the portion of Pirh2 responsible for HuR binding we employed GST-pulldown assay. To this end purified GST-tagged deletion mutants of Pirh2 (the N-terminal domain 1–137 a.a. (NTD-GST) the RING domain 138–189 a.a. (RING-GST) and the C-terminal domain 190–261 a.a. (CTD-GST)) were incubated with the whole-cell extract from HEK293T. The full-length GST-Pirh2 protein and GST alone were also analyzed as positive and negative controls respectively. Results of the binding experiment (Fig. 2B) clearly suggest that the N-terminal and RING domains of Pirh2 are responsible for the Pirh2-HuR interaction.

To confirm the GST-pulldown interaction results we performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of endogenously expressed HuR and ectopic Pirh2-3×FLAG or conversely endogenously expressed Pirh2 and ectopic HuR-3×FLAG. We found that that Pirh2 specifically interacted with HuR in cellulo (Fig. 2C D).

We also confirmed the Pirh2-HuR interaction on the endogenous level by co-immunoprecipitation. The endogenous Pirh2-HuR complex from HeLa cells was precipitated using anti-HuR monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 2E). Taken together these results confirm an existence of the Pirh2-HuR interaction in cells.

Next we analyzed whether Pirh2 affects the HuR protein level in cells. To test this we transfected H1299 cells with increasing amounts of the Pirh2-expressing plasmid. The total amount of DNA in each sample was normalized with an empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3A increasing levels of Pirh2 expression led to a concomitant reduction of the HuR level. We also tested the effect of Pirh2 on HuR in another tumor cell line MDA-MB-231 which constitutively expressed either control plasmid (LEGO) or Pirh2 (LEGO-Pirh2). Expectedly constitutive overexpression of Pirh2 decreased the protein level of HuR (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Fig. 3: Pirh2 downregulates HuR level via ubiquitination and targeting for the degradation. A Pirh2 decreases HuR level in H1299 cells. Transfection of H1299 cells with different quantity of pcDNA3-Pirh2 plasmid proportionally decreases HuR level. Empty pcDNA3.1 was used as a control and to keep the total plasmid DNA amount 3 μg in each sample. The normalized intensity ratios were calculated as ratios between the signals of proteins analyzed and the corresponding actin bands on the basis of three measurements. Error bars indicate ± SD. *p ≤ 0.05 vs. empty vector transfection according to Student’s t-test. B Pirh2 shortens half-life time of HuR. Western blot analysis of HuR protein level in H1299 cells transfected with pcDNA-Pirh2 and pcDNA3.1 empty vector and treated with 50 μM cycloheximide (CHX) for 8 and 16 h. The normalized intensity ratios were calculated as ratios between the signals of proteins analyzed and the corresponding actin bands on the basis of three measurements. Error bars indicate ±SD. *p ≤ 0.05 vs. empty vector transfection for the corresponding time points according to Student’s t-test. C WB analysis of HuR level in HeLa cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-Pirh2 plasmid (Pirh2 OE) and pcDNA3.1 as a control (ctrl). The cells were treated with 10 μM MG132 for 16 h. D Pirh2 ubiquitinates HuR in cellulo. Western blot analysis of Ni-agarose-precipitated 6His-ubiquitinated HuR protein from HeLa cells transfected with pIRES-HuR (HuR-3×FLAG); pIRES-HuR and pcDNA-6His-Ubiquitin (Ub-6His); and pIRES-HuR pcDNA-6His-Ubiquitin and pcDNA-Pirh2 (Pirh2). pcDNA3.1 vector was used to keep the same amount of total plasmid DNA in each sample (right). Western blot analysis of Pirh2 and HuR-3×FLAG in inputs (left). E In vitro ubiquitinilation assay. Ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) UbcH5b (E2) and GST-tagged HuR (HuR-GST substrate) and biotin-tagged ubiquitin were added in equal amounts in each portion of the reaction. GST full-length Pirh2 (Pirh2 FL-GST) and the catalytically inactive N-terminal domain of Pirh2 1–132 a.a. (NTD-GST) were tested for their ability to ubiquitinate HuR. No E3 ligase control was also used. The WB analysis of the ubiquitinilation reaction was performed using anti-biotin antibodies. Two variants of exposure are shown for better illustration. The relative amounts of purified proteins used in the reaction are demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. S5. Full size image

To investigate whether the effect of Pirh2 on HuR involved its protein stability we performed the cycloheximide-mediated blockade of the protein synthesis. To this end H1299 cells transfected with the Pirh2-coding plasmid or the empty vector were used. As shown on Fig. 3B ectopic expression of Pirh2 attenuated the level of HuR expression and ultimately reduced the half-life of the protein from 16 to 8 h. Thus we confirmed that Pirh2 affected the protein level of HuR in different cell types. The fact that adding a proteasome inhibitor MG132 to HeLa cells stabilized the protein level of HuR even in the presence of Pirh2 indicated that HuR attenuation likely involved the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome system (Fig. 3C).

As Pirh2 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase that polyubiquitinates its targets leading to their proteasomal degradation we assumed that HuR may be a novel substrate for Pirh2-dependent ubiquitination. To test this hypothesis we performed ubiquitination of HuR in HeLa cells expressing 6His-ubiquitin and different levels of Pirh2 (Fig. 3D). Ectopic overexpression of Pirh2 increased the level of polyubiquitinated HuR hence suggesting that HuR is a potential target of Pirh2-dependent ubiquitination. We also repeated the ubiquitination assay in HEK293T cells with essentially similar results i.e. Pirh2 was able to ubiquitinated HuR (Supplementary Fig. S3). To address the question of Pirh2 involvement in ubiquitination of HuR we also compared the efficacies of in cellulo ubiquitination of the endogenous HuR protein in the presence of the full-length or mutant Pirh2 (Pirh2 NTD) proteins (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Indeed the full-length Pirh2 protein ubiquitinated HuR more efficiently compared to the Pirh2 NTD mutant protein. We also confirmed the inability of catalytically inactive mutant of Pirh2 to downregulate the HuR protein level (Supplementary Fig. S4B).

Furthermore to prove that Pirh2 is involved in direct ubiquitination of HuR we performed in vitro ubiquitination assay using purified GST-tagged full-length Pirh2 (Pirh2 FL-GST) and the catalytically inactive Pirh2 mutant (Pirh2 NTD-GST). We also used a non-fused GST protein as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 3E efficient ubiquitination of HuR occurs only in the presence of the full-length Pirh2 protein.

Thus we demonstrated that Pirh2 was able to interact and ubiquitinate the RNA-binding protein HuR leading to its destabilization on the protein level.

Pirh2 affects HuR stability during the heat-shock response

It is well established that HuR protein plays a role in heat-shock response affecting the mRNA stability and cellular localization of its target genes including mRNA of HSP70343536. In addition HuR was shown to form cytoplasmic stress granules in response to heat shock (HS) yet its total level in the cell decreased37. Therefore to assess the physiological significance of Pirh2-mediated attenuation of HuR we examined how Pirh2 affected the stability of HuR under the heat-shock stress conditions.

We asked a question of whether Pirh2 via attenuating the HuR stability may affect cell survival after the treatment with sublethal HS. We performed colony-formation assay to test the viability of HeLa cells with suppressed Pirh2 or HuR expression compared to control cells after 45 °C heat-shock exposure for 3 h. Pirh2 KD led to a statistically significant increase in the number of colony-forming units compared to control cells whereas KD of HuR had the opposite effect (Fig. 4A B). The efficiency of Pirh2 and HuR KDs is demonstrated in Fig. 4C. We have also performed cell cycle analysis of HeLa cells with Pirh2 and HuR KD exposed to HS(45 °C 2 h) followed by 16 h of recovery. In response to the heat-shock treatment the amount of Pirh2 KD cells in the G2 phase was higher compared to control cells whereas HuR KD cells displayed the opposite effect (Supplementary Fig. S6). As the sublethal dose of HS causes proteotoxic stress that mainly results in the G2/M cell cycle arrest3839 we concluded that KD of Pirh2 which leads to an increased G2 arrest correlated with cell survival.

A Knockdown of Pirh2 leads to an increase of HeLa cell viability after heat-shock exposition.

The normalized intensity ratios were calculated as ratios between the signals of proteins analyzed and the corresponding actin bands on the basis of three measurements. Error bars indicate ±SD. *p ≤ 0.05 vs. scrambled for the corresponding time points according to Student’s t-test. E Pirh2 stabilizes c-Myc protein in HeLa cells.

Error bars indicate ±SD. *p ≤ 0.05 vs. scrambled for the corresponding time points according to Student’s t-test. Full size image

Next we investigated whether Pirh2 attenuated the level of HuR upon HS in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4D protein levels of both HuR and Pirh2 decreased upon the exposure of cells to high temperature. However in HeLa cells with KD Pirh2 the level of HuR was higher at all the time points compared to the matching control cells. To address the question of whether KD of Pirh2 augments the amount of cellular HuR by increasing its mRNA level we performed qRT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Fig. S7). We established that suppression of Pirh2 did not affect the HuR mRNA level. Noteworthy in contrast to the expectation attenuation of Pirh2 led to a moderate decrease of the HuR mRNA level therefore strongly suggesting that the increased level of HuR observed in Pirh2 KD cells was due to the protein stabilization and not to the regulation of its transcription (Supplementary Fig. S7).

It has been reported that c-Myc proto-oncogene sensitizes cells to heat-induced cell death4041. Hence downregulation of c-Myc would be a plausible mechanism responsible for the survival of HeLa cells upon HS. In this respect we have recently shown that Pirh2 was a positive regulator of c-Myc expression in H1299 cells and that the attenuation of Pirh2 resulted in a decrease of c-Myc levels24. Notably HuR is a negative regulator of c-Myc expression at the level of mRNA stability42. Taking these facts together we hypothesized the existence of a putative regulatory loop whereby Pirh2 stabilized c-Myc via the degradation of HuR and the latter in turn inhibited the translation of c-Myc. To test this hypothesis we ascertained whether Pirh2 KD simultaneously stabilized HuR and attenuated c-Myc both in normal conditions and after HS. In agreement with our hypothesis in Pirh2 KD cells we observed a modest but reproducible elevation of HuR levels concomitant with a decrease of the c-Myc level (Fig. 4E).

We also confirmed the involvement of c-Myc in the Pirh2-regulated heat-shock response. To this end HeLa Pirh2 KD and scrambled control cells were transiently transfected with the c-Myc expression vector and the colony-formation abilities of these cell lines were compared before and after HS. In agreement with our hypothesis that the Pirh2/HuR interaction affects the HS response via c-Myc we found that the forced expression of c-Myc sensitized HeLa cells to HS irrespective of the Pirh2 status (Supplementary Fig. S8).

Pirh2 activates c-Myc expression via downregulation of HuR

As HuR was shown to downregulate c-Myc via recruiting the RNA miRNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to its mRNA42 we first examined the effect of Pirh2 on c-Myc on the level of mRNA in H1299 cells. When mRNA levels of c-Myc were compared between H1299 cells with constitutive Pirh2 OE and control cells (ctrl) it became apparent that the elevated c-Myc mRNA level correlated with overexpression of Pirh2 (Fig. 5A). On the contrary the c-Myc mRNA level was attenuated in shRNA-mediated KD of Pirh2 (Pirh2 KD) (Fig. 5B). Interestingly genotoxic stress caused by 1 μM doxorubicin treatment for 16 h had no effect on the ability of Pirh2 to stabilize the level of c-Myc as judged by RT-PCR (compare Fig. 5A B). The same pattern was observed on the protein level (Fig. 5C D).

Considering that c-Myc is a potent cell cycle regulator we performed cell cycle analysis using isogenic cell lines that differed in the Pirh2 status. To induce genotoxic stress cells were treated with Etoposide for the indicated time period. Pirh2-mediated G2/M block was observed in cells treated with 100 μM etoposide for 24 h (Fig. 5E). On the contrary Pirh2 KD cells demonstrated the opposite effect (Fig. 5F).

Pirh2 prevents HuR binding to c-Myc mRNA

As it was noted above HuR was shown to downregulate c-Myc via recruiting the RISC complex to its mRNA42. To additionally confirm our hypothesis that Pirh2 augments c-Myc levels through downregulation of HuR we performed RIP assay. We used H1299 cell lines with attenuated expression of either Pirh2 or HuR. H1299 cells with scrambled shRNA were used as control (Fig. 6A). As HuR was reported to preferentially bind 3′-UTRs of its target genes we used two pairs of primers for RT-PCR analysis specific for the coding region (CDS) and 3′-UTR of c-myc (Fig. 6B). We reasoned that the suppression of Pirh2 would increase the cellular level of HuR and hence augment the amount of c-Myc mRNA co-precipitated with HuR. In fact KD of Pirh2 promoted the binding of c-Myc mRNA to HuR. Importantly the most pronounced difference in binding was observed in the c-myc 3′-UTR region compared to c-myc CDS (Fig. 6C). These results correlate with the previously published data about the HuR-binding specificity42. We used HuR KD cells as control and demonstrated the decreased amounts of c-Myc mRNA precipitation (Fig. 6C). Interestingly in Pirh2 KD cells we also observed a moderate decrease of HuR mRNA. Thus we confirmed that the effect of Pirh2 on c-Myc expression is mediated via the Pirh2-dependent regulation of HuR.

Pirh2 stimulates proliferation of H1299 cell and cooperates with c-Myc in lung cancer progression

To demonstrate the functional effect of Pirh2-dependent attenuation of HuR we tested the effect of Pirh2 expression on proliferation of H1299 non-small cell lung cancer cells.

To measure the proliferation rate of H1299 cells with different status of Pirh2 we performed real-time monitoring of cell growth using an xCELLigence system (Fig. 7A B). This approach is based on the continuous measurement of the impedance difference of metal bottom of the cell chambers upon the cell growth and spreading. Therefore this system provides the opportunity to monitor the number of cells attached to the bottom well in real time. We noticed that Pirh2 OE increased the proliferation rate of H1299 cells (compare H1299 Pirh2 OE vs. H1299 ctrl) (Fig. 7A). On the contrary KD of Pirh2 retarded the proliferation rate of cells (H1299 Pirh2 KD vs. H1299 scrambled) (Fig. 7B).

As the proliferation activity is one of the major characteristics of cancer cells we examined whether Pirh2 and c-Myc expression levels correlate with survival rates of lung cancer patients. Indeed as shown in Fig. 7C reduced expression of Myc and RCHY1 genes positively correlated with the survival of lung cancer patients. On the contrary high level of HuR (Elavl1) expression within the same GEO dataset correlated with the prolonged survival of cancer patients (Fig. 7D).

Thus we showed that increased levels of Pirh2 and c-Myc displayed the oncogenic effects using both the cellular model of lung cancer and the bioinformatics approach using the patient-derived gene expression data.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwMTQzMDU3MjEwMDIwMTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Luminescent gold nanocluster-decorated polymeric hybrid particles for laser guided therapy,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014305721002019 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwMTQzMDU3MjEwMDIwMTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzE3NTY0NjQ2MjEwMDIyMDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phenolic profiles and biological properties of traditional Phyllanthus amarus aqueous extracts used for diabetes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464621002206 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzE3NTY0NjQ2MjEwMDIyMDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5b25saW5lLmNvbS9zaW5nYXBvcmUvbmV3LWNvdmlkLTE5LWNhc2VzLWp1bmUtNS0yMS1iYXJiZXItc2hvcC1iZWRvay1jbHVzdGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Covid-19 cluster linked to barber shop in Bedok as Singapore reports 13 new community cases,"SINGAPORE — Four of the new community cases reported on Saturday (June 5) are linked to a barber shop in Simpang Bedok forming a new cluster the Ministry of Health said.

Four supermarkets have suspended a pig-farming company after The Independent showed them footage revealing horrific neglect and abuse including dying pigs left among the living and workers kicking animals too crippled to stand.

Pigs even turned to cannibalism and sick animals were left without treatment to suffer in squalid conditions at Willerby Wold Piggeries in North Yorkshire.

Morrisons admitted the scenes were “appalling and shameful” and said it was urgently investigating.

Asda said its supplier had dropped the farm and Tesco and Sainsbury who said they bought meat from the company only occasionally also said they were breaking off from it.

One vet said it was some of the worst footage she had ever seen with workers displaying “a monstrous disregard” for the animals – but that it was not unique among UK pig farms.

Red Tractor the scheme that says it certifies only meat from animals that have been well cared for dropped the farm’s membership after The Independent revealed the footage and the farm said it was working with “veterinary advisers to address concerns”.

Morrisons was at the centre of a campaign this week targeted at investors in the supermarket over its animal welfare standards. Activists claimed the chain sells “Frankenchickens” living lives of misery.

Undercover investigators who filmed inside Willerby Wold’s sheds 12 times earlier this year captured footage of pigs with bulging hernias blood on their bodies or painful infected wounds.

This is among some of the most harrowing footage I have seen captured in the UK - the workers display a monstrous disregard for the animals Ex-Red Tractor vet Alice Brough

Many animals are seen in the videos covered in flies and others are left shaking from disease.

Some were so sick their intestines were outside their bodies the footage shows although The Independent is not publishing such scenes.

The footage was handed to the Surge animal rights group which said it identified 15 potential breaches of animal welfare laws.

Dying and dead pigs were left among the living all kept on filthy floors with excrement on the witnesses said.

Some that were lame and too ill to get up were gnawed at by their pen mates out of frustration.

The footage shows one animal that cannot stand forced to drag itself along the ground when a worker kicked it.

Alice Brough a former pig vet who used to carry out welfare checks for Red Tractor’s endorsement scheme said: “This is among some of the most harrowing footage I have seen captured in the UK.

“Crippling lameness and longstanding infections can be seen in abundance exacerbated by the heinous conditions in which the pigs are forced to live. Tails are chewed out of stress despite all pigs having been mutilated at birth to shorten them.

“The stock people display a monstrous disregard for the sentient animals under their care ignoring the sick and dying and kicking paralysed pigs that cannot get away.

“The unit is squalid the pigs riddled with disease and the many dead are left to rot in pens with the living; this is the sort of place that will produce our next pandemic.”

Dr Brough now an animal rights activist added: “Unfortunately the serious health and welfare issues on this farm are not unique and reflect much wider concerns across the industry.”

Ed Winters cofounder of Surge said: “What investigators documented here is yet another example that animal cruelty is not a rarity on farms but is the norm. Time and time again we are told these investigations are bad apples and don’t represent the reality of animal farming but by now undercover investigations have exposed cruelty on countless farms that are Red Tractor-certified.”

A Morrisons spokesperson said: “The footage we have seen is appalling and shameful. We are urgently investigating and have immediately suspended Willerby Wold as a supplier.”

Tesco said although the farm did not regularly supply the chain it had suspended supply from Willerby Wold.

Sainsbury’s said it also suspended the company as a supplier while the findings were investigated saying it had no direct relationship with the farm but it was possible a tiny amount of product was temporarily sourced from Willerby Wold by a supplier this year.

The farm was a back-up one and any it uses are “all required to meet our high welfare standards” the company said. “The health and welfare of our animals is extremely important” Sainsbury’s added.

An RSPCA spokesperson said: “This footage is very distressing.

“We are concerned that there appears to be violations of the laws in place to protect animal welfare on farms. It appears to show disturbing scenes where sick dying and dead animals are worried at by other pigs and a lack of enrichment and bedding.

“We were not contacted about this via our cruelty line but as soon as we received the footage we contacted the Animal Plant and Health Agency (APHA) to urge them to look into this as soon as possible and take action.”

A statement on behalf of Willerby Wold Piggeries Ltd read: “The welfare of our animals has been the most important consideration for Willerby Wold Piggeries and continues to be so.

“Recent questions relating to our animal welfare have been raised and we take this very seriously.

“In addition to routine and spot audits we are currently working with assurance professionals and veterinary advisers to address any concerns or issues that have been raised.”

An Asda spokesman said the chain had comprehensive animal-welfare policies and its supplier was investigating the issues seen in the footage adding: “Our priority is to source from producers accredited to Red Tractor or RSPCA Assured standards.”

A Red Tractor spokesperson said: “We were shocked by the footage filmed at Willerby Wold Piggeries. Based on evidence from our own investigation and the undercover footage this farm’s membership of our scheme has been terminated.”

Willerby Wold Piggeries which houses up to 7000 pigs at once received nearly £300000 in subsidy payments under the EU Common Agricultural Policy from October 2019 to October 2020 government figures show.

Peter Andrews of the British Retail Consortium also speaking for Aldi said: “Our members take their responsibilities to animal welfare very seriously and are appalled by the uncovered footage. This will be investigated and swift action will be taken against any breaches to the high animal welfare standards our members uphold.”

On the chicken welfare campaign a Morrisons spokesperson said all the chain’s regular chicken is raised to above Red Tractor standards adding: “We also actively monitor for any malpractice in our supply chain; we will never tolerate it or look the other way.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZXhjZWxzaW9yLmNvbS92aWxsYWdlLXBhZGRhbC1iZWluZy1wcm92aWRlZC1kcmlua2luZy13YXRlci1ieS10cmFjdG9yLXRhbmtlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New scheme announced for villages facing water crisis in Jammu and Kashmir's Samba,"SAMBA: Deputy Commissioner Samba Anuradha Gupta today informed that habitants of village Paddal of Samba district are being provided drinking water through a regular supply of water tanker while new water supply scheme from an independent source has also been envisaged under Jal Shakti Mission for the area.

Everything Travelers Need to Know,"We know the content for Angola is out of date but have no fear! We are currently refreshing all of our travel safety content so please check back soon for a newer version.

If you're looking for a crime-free trip you're coming to the wrong place. While you can definitely minimize your chances of becoming a victim crimes of various kinds run rampant through Angola. As with many places much of the crime happens between Angolans but foreigners have been expressly targeted in recent years. Rapes robberies and murders involving tourists have occurred in the northern province of Cabinda including the January 2010 triple murder of members of the Togolese football team. Kidnappings are also a possibility.

Luanda is one of the top areas where crime can occur in Angola and it's also one of the spots most frequented by travellers since it's the capital city. Street crime is a large threat here and petty offenses like pick pocketing and theft from vehicles and homes are frequent. These incidences can turn violent when perpetrated by armed criminals who attack their victims while riding scooters. There are particular places to avoid in Luanda such as the Roque Santeiro market and Rocha Pinto and in between bars and restaurants on the Ilha do Cabo.

Do not walk on the ""Serpentine Road"" in front of the U.S. Embassy either. In addition to the petty crime serious offenses like rape also occur in the bar and club areas. Women should not travel alone at night. Really everyone should avoid the streets of Luanda after dark.

It's been noted by several government and travel sites that police in Angola may not always respond to crimes in a timely manner or follow up on reports. You will have more luck by contacting the Rapid Intervention Police (PIR) unit which is trained to respond to more serious criminal incidents.

Other precautions centre on avoiding pulling over on roadways as thieves may use this tactic to rob you especially in rural areas. Car jackings are also possible. If travelling anywhere outside Luanda bring an experienced individual or go with a group that knows its way around.

Be mindful of your belongings at Luanda airport whose personnel in the past have been known to commit fraud. It's possible someone might slip drugs or other items into baggage and carry-on luggage as airport workers do search through bags. These occurrences are especially likely on flights to South Africa. Anything suspect should be reported to airport police as soon as possible.

Immigration and customs officials have been known to detain travellers for no apparent reason and demand bribes. This can occur upon entry to or exit from the country. Some passengers without a document proving inoculation against yellow fever may be forced to pay for a vaccination at the airport. Refusal will most likely result in your immediate forced departure from Angola.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbmx0aW1lcy5ubC8yMDIxLzA2LzA1L3NjaGlwaG9sLXNheXMtYWlycG9ydC1jcm93ZHMtd2lsbC1tYW5hZ2VhYmxlLXN1bW1lctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Schiphol says airport crowds will be manageable this summer,"Schiphol Airport said it does not expect the additional time needed to review Covid-19 vaccination status and coronavirus test documentation to cause any major delays this summer.

Checking the documents will require extra work but this should not cause any significant problems as long as people arrive prepared a spokesperson from Schiphol said to the ANP. “Make sure you have the correct documents with you. See what else is required per country. And keep in mind that it may take a bit longer” the Schiphol spokesperson said.

The spokesperson did admit “The crowds will take some getting used to.”

Ideally a digital coronavirus passport will be introduced by July 1. However it has become increasingly difficult for officials to meet that deadline.

As long as there is no digital certification travelers will have to bring their printed-out vaccination papers or a negative PCR test certificate with them. Airline companies fear the hassle of paper documents will cause chaos to ensue the Telegraaf reported.

This will not be the case according to Schiphol. The airport advised travelers to arrive three hours ahead of time for intercontinental flights and two hours prior to departure for flights within Europe.

Schiphol expects trips to peak in August due to people postponing their vacation as far as possible in hopes that coronavirus restrictions will be loosened. The number of travelers is still anticipated to be significantly lower than before the pandemic. Schiphol said they predict around 160 thousand passengers on their busiest days this year. Prior to the crisis Schiphol processed up to 235 thousand passengers daily during peak seasons.

Schiphol said that they expect to have sufficient staff ready to accommodate any extra measures that need to be taken.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVyaW5kaWEuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzE1MjA1LWJpcmQtZ3JvdXAtYW5ub3VuY2VzLXRoZS11bmV4cGVjdGVkLXBhc3Npbmctb2YtaXRzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1kaXJlY3Rvci1hbmt1ci1iaGF0aWHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bird Group announces the demise of Executive Director- Ankur Bhatia,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.hotelierindia.com/business/15205-bird-group-announces-the-unexpected-passing-of-its-executive-director-ankur-bhatia on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVyaW5kaWEuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzE1MjA1LWJpcmQtZ3JvdXAtYW5ub3VuY2VzLXRoZS11bmV4cGVjdGVkLXBhc3Npbmctb2YtaXRzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1kaXJlY3Rvci1hbmt1ci1iaGF0aWHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

ABB Construction LLC which does business as Accelerated Construction Services and Biafora Holding Limited Liability Company LLC filed the suit against Truist Bank which acquired Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB&T) through mergers and acquisitions.

Accelerated does not have an account at BB&T and the checks of which 27 are attached as exhibits are not endorsed by the company the suit states. None of the check endorsements are clearly readable as a name. The largest check is for $543600 from Cranberry Real Estate to Accelerated Construction Services.

BB&T violated West Virginia law and numerous internal controls protocols rules and best practices in accepting checks for deposit and crediting checks to customer’s accounts according to the suit.

It claims there were at least seven violations of BB&T internal protocols when each of the checks meant for Accelerated was accepted and there were 189 total violations.

“In other words BB&T had 189 opportunities to catch their mistake and prevent the harm to the plaintiffs but failed each time” the suit states.

Multiple clients of Accelerated are also named as defendants in the suit including Little Village LLC Cranberry Real Estate Mount Morris Gospel Tabernacle Tuscan Sun Holdings and Caribba Foods doing business as Crab Shack.

According to the suit none of the clients notified their banks there was fraudulent endorsements on checks they issued. It states the clients can request their bank refund the money BB&T allowed transferred from their checks and have it directed to Accelerated.

In addition to the $3409520.39 the suit claims BB&T wrongfully took the suit seeks $20.5 million in compensatory damages plus punitive damages interests and attorney’s fees.

Truist Bank filed a standard first response in which it denies the allegations or states there is not enough information to speak on them and offers several defenses.

Max Fried stifled the Dodgers through six innings allowing only a run while striking out four and keeping the ball mostly on the infield with 10 groundouts. The supposedly shaky Atlanta bullpen proved anything but over the last two days of the series. After four scoreless frames on Saturday three Braves relievers combined to allow only one run in the series finale.

The Dodgers scored eight runs in the fifth inning on Friday and since then scored seven runs in 22 innings.

Albert Pujols drove in both Dodgers runs on Sunday with a single in the fourth off Fried then a solo home run off Will Smith in the ninth. Pujols since joining the Dodgers is 10-for-28 (.357) with three home runs and two doubles against left-handed pitchers.

The home run for Pujols was his 671st and it gave him 5980 total bases in his career passing Barry Bonds for fourth all-time.

It was a heavy traffic day for Atlanta against Trevor Bauer whose six hits allowed were his most this season while also walking four for the third time in his last four starts. In that respect things could have been worse since Bauer limited the damage to single runs in the second third and sixth innings.

The Braves were just 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position against Bauer who struck out seven giving him 103 strikeouts on the season one behind Max Scherzer for the National League lead.

Bauer also allowed a pair of RBI doubles on his four-seam fastball which had its lowest average spin rate (2612 rpm) in his last 29 starts and down 223 rpm from his average fastball in 2021. But more on that later.

It was still a winnable game with Bauer allowing three runs in six innings the Dodgers’ 35th quality start of the season seven more than any other team.

Painful weekend

Three different Dodgers suffered leg injuries during the series. First was Max Muncy who left Friday’s game with a mild ankle sprain. He didn’t play on Saturday and was limited to pinch-hitting duty on Sunday flying out with the tying runs on base to end the seventh.

Dave Roberts said before the game he’s “hopeful” Muncy will be able to start when the Dodgers next play on Tuesday in Pittsburgh.

On Saturday it was Austin Barnes who suffered the mild ankle sprain at first base. He remained in the game behind the plate and even batted again but didn’t play on Sunday. Roberts said Barnes would be available to catch in an emergency on both Sunday and Tuesday but the ankle bothers Barnes while hitting.

In the series finale on Sunday Chris Taylor fouled a ball directly off his left knee in the fourth inning but stayed in the game after a long consultation with trainer Yosuke Nakajima. Taylor was called out on strikes on an inside pitch much to his chagrin to end that at-bat then he grounded out in the sixth and flew out to deep center in the eighth.

Back-to-back wins over Clayton Kershaw and Trevor Bauer may help make that point.

Fried outpitched Bauer and the Braves beat Los Angeles 4-2 on Sunday to take two of three in the first meeting of the teams since the Dodgers rallied to win last year's NL Championship Series.

Atlanta beat Kershaw 6-4 on Saturday.

“I just felt like we played really good baseball complete offense defense pitching” Fried said. “We were able to put it all together. ... This is obviously the type of baseball we feel we can play and we can build off that.”

Albert Pujols hit his 671st home run and had two hits and two RBIs for the Dodgers. He homered leading off the ninth against closer Will Smith who regrouped to get his 11th save in 11 chances.

Ender Inciarte had a hit and drove in two runs for the Braves (28-29) who have won three consecutive NL East titles but have been under .500 all season.

Braves manager Brian Snitker said his team “played a pretty good series against the World Champions. It should show those guys we’re as good as anybody out there when we play the way we’re capable of playing.”

Atlanta led the NL Championship Series 3-1 last October before Los Angeles came back to win the pennant and then beat Tampa Bay for its first World Series title since 1988.

Fried lost Game 6 by 3-1 allowing first-inning home runs to Corey Seager and Justin Turner.

This time Fried (3-3) allowed one run and six hits in six innings and walked none for the first time in nine starts. He threw 65 of 92 pitches for strikes but said this was no retribution for last season.

“This is a whole different year"" Fried said.

Bauer (6-4) allowed three runs and six hits in six innings and matched his season high of four walks for the fourth time. Two of the batters who reached on walks later scored.

“I felt fine” Bauer said. “Just missing some pitches.”

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Bauer “did a nice job.”

“I’m not worried about Trevor” Roberts said. “It could have easily been six innings one run or two runs.”

Dansby Swanson who had his career-best 12-game hitting streak end in Friday hit cleanup for the first time in his big league career. He led off the second with a single to left and scored on Abraham Almonte's double to the wall in center field.

Bauer walked Freddie Freeman with two outs in the third and Ozzie Albies followed with a run-scoring double past Cody Bellinger in center.

Almonte walked opening the sixth took third on Ehire Adrianza’s single and scored on Inciarte’s single. Inciarte's bases-loaded fly ball to left field off David Price in the eighth drove in Atlanta's fourth run.

Justin Turner hit a one-out double in the fourth for the Dodgers' first hit and Pujols' bloop opposite-field single to right drove in Turner.

Pujols hit an inning-ending popout in the sixth that stranded runners on second and third.

TRAINER’S ROOM

Dodgers: C Austin Barnes and IF Max Muncy were held out of the lineup with sore ankles. Roberts said before the game he was “hopeful but not necessarily confident” Muncy who popped out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh won't miss another start. Roberts said Barnes was “sore as expected” and had “some swelling” after twisting his ankle in Saturday's game. Barnes was available to catch only in an emergency.

Braves: RHP Shane Greene was recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett. Greene 32 allowed one run in 4 1/3 innings with Gwinnett after re-signing with Atlanta on May 9. RHP Jacob Webb was optioned to Gwinnett only one day after his recall.

PUJOLS MOVES UP TO FOURTH IN TOTAL BASES

Pujols passed Barry Bonds for fourth all-time in total bases (5980). He is fifth on the home run list behind Bonds (762) Hank Aaron (755) Babe Ruth (714) and Alex Rodriguez (696).

LOOKING FOR OFFENSE

Roberts said the Dodgers need more consistent offensive production. Pujols' homer was the Dodgers' first of the series. Entering the series the Dodgers had hit homers in 13 consecutive games.

“I think the pitching has been really good consistently” Roberts said. “... I think offensively we just need to take more good at-bats and be more consistent on that side.”

The company is partnering with Marathon Health to pilot seven “Bright Blue” health centers near production facilities. Tyson employees and their family members will have access to the free health clinics.

“We’re piloting these health centers to promote a culture of health and wellness in our company that results in a healthier workforce” said Dr. Claudia Coplein chief medical officer for Tyson Foods. “Some of our front-line team members aren’t using their health plan benefits and others don’t seek care until there’s a crisis. We want to change that by providing access to care that can help detect health conditions early and promote healthy habits.”

Marathon Health operates the health centers which provide primary and preventive healthcare including screenings lifestyle coaching and health education.

The first facility to open on April 28 was in Dyersburg Tenn. near the Tyson plant in Newbern Tenn. Lisa Davis a Tyson employee was the first team member to visit the clinic.

“We have three-year old twins and are often at the doctor for regular check-ups and runny noses” Davis said. “My daughter Rylee has Down syndrome and is in speech therapy so communication can sometimes be difficult. The staff was patient and we had an amazing experience. We’ll definitely be back.”

The seven pilot locations will serve nearly 38000 Tyson employees and their families. Spouses and dependents age 2 and older who are covered by the Tyson insurance plan will be eligible. The clinics will serve employees in multiple languages.

In addition to the Tennessee location health centers will open in Green Forest Ark. on May 12; in Lexington Neb. on May 12; in Wilkesboro NC and Center Texas on May 19; in Storm Lake Iowa on May 26; and the location in Garden City Kan. will open sometime this summer.

“Partnering with Tyson to improve the health and wellbeing of their employees and families is an honor for Marathon Health” said Jeff Wells chief executive officer of Marathon Health. “We offer care that often looks beyond the symptoms and helps people take new actions around their own health. We are excited to see the profound changes in the lives of the people we will serve at the Tyson health centers.”

The pilot health center project is the next step in the company’s “We Care” workplace safety program to prioritize employee health and wellness.

JOHN DICKERSON: We turn now to the state of our economy with Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. Good morning.

CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF BANK OF AMERICA BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Good morning JOHN. How are you?

JOHN DICKERSON: I want to start- very well thank you. I want to start with the question of cyber-attacks. There have been a whole recent number of them and we've seen the way in which these ransomware attacks can affect the economy. How much time are you spending on this and has your approach to it become- have the stakes increased based on these new recent attacks?

MOYNIHAN: Well the financial services industry this has been an issue for many years and so I- I spent time on it. But frankly the good news is we have a great team and our spending a year has gone from maybe four or five hundred million dollars a year when I first became CEO a little over a decade ago to a billion dollars a year 2000 plus people work on it. We work in deep cooperation with the rest of the institutions in our industry. But there's more that can be done and there are suggestions and proposals that are coming out to do more sharing of information cooperation speed and- and things like that which I think need to be looked at by the administration and Congress and pushed through in order to protect more people.

JOHN DICKERSON: Tell me a little bit about that. Speed in particular seems to me to be crucial in one of these instances. What more needs to be done?

MOYNIHAN: We were able to create a group called the ARC. Now it was called FSARC before but that's a group of many companies that- that are inside the- the tent so to speak sharing information with people with the right clearances. And that allows us to move quickly when one person is seeing something and share it with others. And I think that kind of cooperation is in the most critical industries but needs to continue to be moved to more and more industries over time.

JOHN DICKERSON: Let's switch now to the health of the economy. The jobs report for May was good but not great. What do you see? You have a special window in on- on people spending and their consumer habits and economic activity. What are you seeing from your vantage point?

MOYNIHAN: Well a couple of key points about the economy. One is it's predicted to grow the US economy is predicted to grow at 7% this year and 5.5% next year by our team. If you think about that the economy is now as big as it was pre-pandemic roughly predicted to grow at two to three times the rate over the next couple of years. Our consumers have lots of money in their checking accounts. We think they spent about 65 or they have not spent about 65-70% of the last couple of rounds of stimulus. Loans are starting to pick up and there's plenty of borrowing capacity. Companies have unused lines. And the spending by our consumer which is a trillion and four so far this year is up 20% over '19 and obviously a lot over '20. And what that really tells you is that you're seeing a 10% growth rate which is a faster growth rate on a bigger amount. So the US economy is really set to go with a couple of key risks. One is supply chain dynamics that you I'm sure you've talked about in your show. And the other is people getting workers. And that bodes well for the unemployment figure which is starting to drop. And we predict to get in the low to mid 4s by year end which is a pretty strong recovery engineered by the work of the fiscal side the monetary side and frankly private industry.

JOHN DICKERSON: When you- focusing on that 20% over '19 as you mentioned '19 was not a pandemic year. So the spending appears to be- one of the things that we saw during the pandemic is people were paying down their credit card saving money. So do you attribute that 20% to essentially what some people call revenge spending or the sort of pent up consumer demand that was out there?

MOYNIHAN: I think a lot of it has to do with- and what you're seeing happen is really reopening across the board and- and so while certain places because the infection rates were different and reopened faster you've got a pretty universal application now. So even here in Massachusetts where I live you're seeing people be able to move about. So you're seeing the spending move to domestic travel spending is up dramatically. Car rentals hotels for leisure travel not business travel yet that will probably be late this fall is strong. Theme park bookings and things like that. Those are all very good signs. And by the way it's shifting from buying food in the store to more people going to sit-down restaurants even over quick-service restaurants. So you're seeing that natural behavior which is I can go out I can do things and I can sit down and eat dinner. Because frankly way back when I was first talking to MARGARET on this question it's a war against a virus and America is starting to win through all the great vaccination work that's going on. We're starting to win the war and it's not over yet. We've got to be careful to get it done. But we're starting to win the war and that's allowing the economy to reopen and that's allowing the spending to take place.

JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about small business. Bank of America is the largest lender to small business. More than 400000 closed during the pandemic. What are you seeing on the small business front and what kinds of businesses are borrowing and starting to take risks again?

MOYNIHAN: Well the- the good news is you're starting to see our in- our smallest businesses which is companies up to five million in revenue we're seeing the originations actually exceed what they were in 2019 for the month of May. They're a little bit up in April. They're basically flattish in March. So you're seeing it come on. And that's really the reopening in those economies. The businesses that are doing the best are the service side businesses like doctors lawyers and things like that really recover quickly. But now we've seen the supply chain the people supply in the industry et cetera growing faster. One of the things we got to work on is continue the supply chain. And I think that's- when we asked our small business what's on your mind in the fall it was all about the pandemic. In the spring survey we do which is millions of businesses we asked the question to it's all about getting workers and getting their supplies so they have things to sell and manufacture to sell to their customers. And that's something that's straightening out but will take a little time.

JOHN DICKERSON: And do you worry about the backlog of people paying their mortgages? Those who couldn't during the pandemic what happens when they lose government assistance? Will they be able to pay those mortgages?

MOYNIHAN: Well the good news at Bank of America it's really a thing of the past. At the high point we had given customers two million customers the right not to pay. We're down to a fraction of that now and it's going through the system. So I think at the- even in all mortgages you come down. So I think there's a little bit of the world has largely recovered but there's- there's a pockets of things that just have to be dealt with. And I'm sure the companies will deal with them fairly.

JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We've run out of time. Thank you so much Brian Moynihan for being with us. And we'll be right back.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rc2RrLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYnVzaW5lc3Mtam91cm5hbC9uZWlsLXJpY2hhcmRzb24tc2xkYy1zdC1sb3Vpcy10aXNoYXVyYS1qb25lcy82My1kMzFkN2Y4Ny01MDM5LTQ2ZmUtOGI4Mi1mYThkYzIwNzRjZDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Louis mayor nominates new development director,"Otis Williams longtime head of SLDC is retiring this month and Neil Richardson will begin as SLDC executive director June 28 a Jones spokesman said.

ST. LOUIS — St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones said Thursday she's nominating Neal Richardson a longtime U.S. Bank executive to lead the city's development agency St. Louis Development Corp.

Richardson had been one of three final candidates for the job identified by the Business Journal last week.

SLDC's board is expected to OK the appointment Thursday afternoon.

Jones said in a statement that she knows Richardson ""will encourage forward-thinking holistic development"" while Richardson said he would look to ""work together to address the historical barriers that have created gaps in wealth and opportunity for all to have ownership in our collective future.""

Otis Williams longtime head of SLDC is retiring this month and Richardson will begin as SLDC executive director June 28 a Jones spokesman said.

Richardson most recently served as director of the Business Impact Group for U.S. Bank where he said he focused ""on closing economic gaps and developing strategies creating more equitable access to capital for women people of color and low-income communities.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpZXIub3JnL2FydGljbGUvaXMtdGhlLWZlZC1wYXlpbmctYmFua3Mtbm90LXRvLWxlbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is the Fed Paying Banks Not to Lend?,"The Federal Reserve has added $2.6 trillion to the US economy since the start of 2020. These actions along with recent fiscal spending programs have caused many economists to worry about the risks of price level inflation and overheating of the economy potentially sowing the seeds of future economic collapse.

The Fed conducted a similar expansion after the 2008 financial crisis. From 2008 through 2015 the Fed increased the supply of base money by $3 trillion through its repeated quantitative easing (QE) programs. Yet despite this massive expansion the rates of inflation and GDP growth consistently undershot the Fed’s target for more than a decade.

One potential reason for the lack of economic activity is that the Fed is preventing economic growth by paying banks not to lend. Since late 2008 the Fed has paid interest on the excess reserves that banks hold at the Fed. If the Fed pays a high enough rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER) then banks may choose to hold the newly-created money as excess reserves rather than lending it out into the economy.

Economists remain highly divided about the economic effects of IOER. I examined the evidence in a recent paper published in the Journal of Macroeconomics (available for free download until July 14th). I found that the Fed’s IOER policy accounts for the majority of the decline in bank lending in the decade following the financial crisis.

The Fed’s new operating system

At the peak of the financial crisis in late 2008 the Fed witnessed collapses in both the banking system and the broader economy. Despite access to emergency liquidity from the Fed many banks stood on the brink of failure. Emergency lending had vastly increased the supply of money in the economy as would the Fed’s upcoming large scale asset purchases. The Fed wanted a way to sterilize these monetary injections to minimize future inflation.

To address these problems in October of 2008 the Fed started paying interest to banks on their excess reserves.

With this policy the Fed saw a way to prevent bank failures and limit inflation effectively killing two birds with one stone. First the Fed was fortifying bank balance sheets by buying their risky mortgage-backed securities and replacing them with safe liquid reserves. Second paying IOER effectively sterilized the monetary injections from Fed’s emergency lending and QE programs. By paying banks to hold more reserves the Fed could prevent the newly-created money from spreading to the rest of the economy and inflating the price level.

IOER and bank reserves

In some ways the IOER policy worked as expected. Banks massively increased their reserve holdings. Figure 1 shows the total excess reserves held at the Fed which increased from close to zero in early 2008 to more than $2.5 trillion by 2014. With each round of QE the majority of funds were absorbed as excess reserves effectively sterilizing these injections from affecting spending or inflation.

Figure 1. Excess reserves in the banking system

Some effects of IOER however were not as expected. The rate of IOER was expected to act as a floor or lower bound for the federal funds rate and other short-term risk-free interest rates. But as soon as IOER was introduced the fed funds rate and other short-term rates fell through this supposed floor. Rather than cutting the IOER rate to match market interest rates the Fed made this policy official by adopting a new target range for the fed funds rate with the rate of IOER being the upper bound of the range. In other words the Fed began paying a rate of IOER that was higher rather than equal to short-term market interest rates.

Another effect that remains controversial is the relationship between excess reserves and bank loans. In theory if the Fed pays a rate of IOER that is equal to short-term market interest rates then banks should be indifferent between these assets. In this case IOER would have no effect on bank balance sheet allocations. However since the Fed was paying IOER that was higher than comparable market rates banks used the new reserves as substitutes for other assets.

Some economists predicted that the banks would accumulate excess reserves in place of other short-term liquid assets like fed funds or US Treasuries. But the high rate of IOER made excess reserves more attractive even relative to other assets like bank loans. Figure 2 shows that the decline in loans as percentages of bank assets was almost fully offset by an increase in excess reserves.

Figure 2. Loans and excess reserves as percentages of bank assets

IOER and bank lending

It seems clear from Figure 2 that bank loans and reserves were inversely related. As banks’ reserve holdings increased after 2008 their loan holdings went down. But how much of this shift was caused by the rate of IOER compared to other factors like banks’ need for safe assets or the lack of loan demand?

My recent paper “Bank lending and interest on excess reserves: An empirical investigation” seeks to address this question. I used data on US banks from 2000 through 2018 to test how lending responded to changes in the rate of IOER. Accounting for other factors such as changes in regulation loan demand and economic activity I found the higher rates of IOER have strong negative effects on banks’ loan allocations.

Using these results I was able to estimate how much banks would have allocated to loans if the Fed had not paid high rates of IOER. If the rate of IOER had been left at zero I estimate that lending would have declined slightly in 2009 but it would have recovered more quickly thereafter. In total the results indicate that the Fed’s IOER policy accounts for 63.9 percent or more of the decline in bank lending after the financial crisis.

The evidence shows that banks treated excess reserves as a profitable alternative to loans. High rates of IOER caused them to increase reserve holdings and decrease their loan allocations. The Fed was indeed paying banks not to lend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvbW92ZXMtbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXktaGlyZXMtZXgtYm9mYS1iYW5rZXItcml6em8tZHJpdmUtZXVyb3BlYW4tY2xpZW50LXB1c2gtMjAyMS0wNi0wNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MOVES Morgan Stanley hires ex BofA banker Rizzo to drive European client push - sources,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/moves-morgan-stanley-hires-ex-bofa-banker-rizzo-drive-european-client-push-2021-06-05/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvbW92ZXMtbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXktaGlyZXMtZXgtYm9mYS1iYW5rZXItcml6em8tZHJpdmUtZXVyb3BlYW4tY2xpZW50LXB1c2gtMjAyMS0wNi0wNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGVlcGRpdmUuY2EvZmJpLW9wZW5zLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24taW50by1vbmx5ZmFucy1maW5hbmNpYWwtYWN0aXZpdHktb3Zlci1wb3RlbnRpYWwtY3JpbWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FBI Opens Investigation Into OnlyFans Financial Activity Over Potential Crimes,"OnlyFans the adult subscription company that has gained significant popularity amid the pandemic is allegedly being investigated by the FBI following numerous reports of money laundering suspicious transactions and underage users.

According to various Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed by banks in the US and elsewhere and originally published by Forensic News back in March 2021 Leonid Radvinsky the owner of OnlyFans and MFCXY Inc which operates MyFreeCams has been flagged on countless occasions over alleged suspicious transactions as well as providing platforms to “underage children and other vulnerable individuals [who] might be forced to provide services.”

Previously OnlyFans’ CEO Tim Stokely revealed that the adult social media platform had made revenues of $2 billion last year with profits totaling over $300 million. Despite such eye-popping figures Radvinsky has for the most part been able to avoid the public limelight. In contrast US banks as well as the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) have long been aware of Radvinsky’s questionable business dealings for a number of years and has flagged more than $1 billion worth of potentially suspicious financial activity related to his companies.

Among the most blatantly suspicious activity noted in the SARs a banking expert has revealed to Forensic News that Radvinsky had transferred millions of dollars between his accounts without providing an adequate explanation to the banks. This has supposedly given the appearance of laying which is a practice used to hide the source of illegal activity and make it more difficult to track.

Then in another series of SARs banks have warned that Radvinsky’s other company MFCXY “may be operating in areas where underage children and other vulnerable individuals might be forced to provide services.” Although the banks did not outline specific instances of underage activity they did highlight that money was being transferred to “high-risk” regions including Columbia Romania Poland Bulgaria Ukraine Lithuania the Philippines and Russia.

Now according to Forensic News journalist Scott Stedman all of these previously reported allegations have caught the attention of the FBI which has allegedly opened a “sprawling” investigation concerning the financial activity of OnlyFans and its owner.

The intoxicated East Harlem resident identified by sources as Ahmed Rahat and his girlfriend were in the backseat of the for-hire Chevy Suburban when the man began punching the driver around 4 a.m.

The driver 38-year-old Pinto Soyall of Jamaica stopped the vehicle on East 38th Street and Second Avenue — and the scuffle spilled out onto the street sources said.

The boozed-up passenger hit Soyall with his belt — with the driver allegedly hitting him back so hard Rahat’s head whacked the pavement sources said.

Cab drivers forced ride hailing apps out of the city in 2019 — this time keeping the upper hand could be harder

Two years ago when Uber and Cabify suspended their services in Barcelona following a string of new regulations brought about by a week-long taxi strike ride hailing companies conceded defeat.

""Taxis have won"" said Josep Maria Goñi the then-president of the Unauto VTC association.

But in March 2019 barely a month after saying it would leave Barcelona the Spanish company Cabify resumed its services promising it would abide by the new legal conditions while continuing to provide its own fleet of cars and operate under VTC licenses.

In March 2021 it was Uber’s turn to come back. But the US-based company took a different approach: instead of hiring its own drivers it would let taxis use its software at no cost in a show of ""good faith"".

With the two companies back in operation and the vaccination campaign stoking hopes of a return to normality the taxi sector resumed mobilizations against the ride hailing apps which they describe as an ""existential threat"".

Later in March hundreds of cab drivers protested in a slow drive through the city which taxi associations described as ""historic"" and even ""more massive than the 2019 strike."" They repeated the action on May 20 disrupting traffic in the center of Barcelona to then meet with local authorities at the city hall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvdWJlci1lYXRzLWRyaXZlci1jcmllcy1sb3ctdGlwLXRpa3Rvay_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWRvdC5jb20vaXJsL3ViZXItZWF0cy1kcml2ZXItY3JpZXMtbG93LXRpcC10aWt0b2svP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Why does the burden always fall on the consumers instead of these corporations?’ Uber Eats driver cries after getting low tip in viral TikTok,"An Uber Eats driver posted an emotional video to TikTok where he revealed how little a customer had tipped after driving an hour to get their food.

In the video user deliveryguy100 starts by saying he wishes people knew what it was like to deliver for Uber Eats and similar apps. He talks while seated in his car with a face mask hanging on his ear and visibly crying.

“I just spent an hour driving around for $1.19 tip” he says wiping his tears away. “Would it hurt y’all to tip us? Throw us $5?”

He says Uber Eats meanwhile only paid him $2 to make the delivery.

“That’s not even enough to cover gas!” he exclaims.

The now-viral video seems to resonate with several commenters on TikTok.

“Say it with me: PEOPLE DESERVE LIVABLE WAGES & DON’T ORDER IF YOU CAN’T TIP” one person wrote.

Others though took the opportunity to slam Uber Eats. Some argued it wasn’t the customer’s job to tip—but rather the onus is on the company to make sure it’s paying its drivers living wages.

“Hate seeing u cry” someone said. “I always tip but y’all gotta turn that energy to DoorDash.”

“Why does the burden always fall on the consumers instead of these corporations?” another wrote. “I really don’t get America’s culture.”

Of course this isn’t the first time a food delivery driver has complained about paltry tips. Earlier in 2021 a second Uber Eats driver posted a similar TikTok saying he was close to homelessness. He later received thousands of dollars in donations.

Here are products safe to use this summer.,"STATEN ISLAND N.Y. — Make sure you’re using a safe sunscreen this summer.

A new study by Valisure LLC examined sunscreen and after-sun care products and found that 78 of them contained high levels of benzene a known human carcinogen — which means it is known to cause cancer in humans.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) benzene is a chemical that is a colorless or light yellow liquid at room temperature with a sweet odor and is highly flammable. People can be exposed through inhalation skin absorption ingestion skin and/or eye contact.

The company analyzed 294 unique batches from 69 brands of sunscreen and after-sun care products. These included different types of products like sprays gels and lotions with both chemical and mineral-based formulations Valisure said.

According to Valisure 27% of samples tested contained detectable benzene and some batches contained up to three times the conditionally restrict FDA concentration limit of 2 parts per million.

“The presence of this known human carcinogen in products widely recommended for the prevention of skin cancer and that are regularly used by adults and children is very troubling” said David Light founder and CEO of Valisure.

It found 78 product batches had detectable levels of benzene. Go here for the 14 product batches with the highest levels of benzene.

But Valisure also released a list of safe sunscreens and after-sun care products that didn’t contain benzene.

It includes name brands like Neutrogena Equate La Roche-Posay Up & Up Revlon Banana Boat CVS Health Hawaiian Tropic Coppertone Sun Bum and Australian Gold.

Here’s a look at some of those sunscreens and after-sun products that are safe to use.

The alternative crypto which describes itself as “the leading 18+ NFT platform for adult creators” rose from $0.06 to $0.28 on Saturday following the tech billionaire’s apparent endorsement.

The use of the splash and rocket emoji is commonly used by CumRocket’s fans online while the inclusion of a moon emoji signified that its price was heading “to the moon”.

Mr Musk’s latest post on Twitter follows a similarly cryptic message on Friday in which he simply wrote: “Canada USA Mexico.”

The acronym produced by these three countries combined with a flurry of other crypto-related tweets meant that it was widely interpreted as an endorsement of semen-themed cryptocurrencies.

The SpaceX CEO also changed his Twitter profile photo to an anime image featuring the bitcoin logo with the character sporting “laser eyes” - a symbol used by cryptocurrency enthusiasts that signifies their hope that bitcoin will hit $100000.

The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $36000 having fallen from an all-time high above $64000 in mid April.

CumRocket responded to Mr Musk’s tweet with a mocked-up version of SpaceX’s Starship rocket featuring the cryptocurrency’s logo.

“What do you think @elonmusk? We’ll even pay for the paint” they wrote.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently shared a message warning of the risks involved in following investment advice from celebrities.

“It is never a good idea to make an investment decision just because someone famous says a product or service is a good investment” the advice stated.

“Never make an investment decision based solely on a celebrity endorsement or other information you receive through social media investment newsletters online advertisements email investment research websites internet chat rooms direct mail newspapers magazines television or radio.”

The SEC is reportedly investigating Mr Musk over his endorsement of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency dogecoin which has seen huge fluctuations in 2021 based on his tweets and public comments.

Like many things the coronavirus pandemic took a mostly negative toll on this year’s Fortune 500. As the world locked down hitting pause on the global economy the overall profits of Fortune 500 companies dropped from $1.24 trillion to $859 billion. More than 70 percent of Fortune 500 sectors saw a decline in profits. A few sectors saw increases the list notes including technology and household products the latter of which reported a 106 percent increase in profits.

Women hit some big milestones on this year’s list. The number of women running businesses on the Fortune 500 hit an all-time record of 41; and for the first time ever two Black women are running Fortune 500 businesses (Roz Brewer of No. 16 Walgreens Boots Alliance and Thasunda Brown Duckett of No. 79 TIAA).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8wNi9jaGluYXMtZHJpdmUtdG8tY29tcGV0ZS1hZ2FpbnN0LXN0YXJsaW5rLWZvci10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLW9yYml0YWwtaW50ZXJuZXQv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzA2L2NoaW5hcy1kcml2ZS10by1jb21wZXRlLWFnYWluc3Qtc3RhcmxpbmstZm9yLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2Ytb3JiaXRhbC1pbnRlcm5ldC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China’s drive to compete against Starlink for the future of orbital internet,"China’s drive to compete against Starlink for the future of orbital internet The country is heavily investing in its own low-Earth orbit satellite constellations

There has been a wave of businesses over the past several years hoping to offer broadband internet delivered from thousands of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) providing coverage of most of the earth’s surface.

This isn’t the first time we’ve seen excitement in the category. Companies and people that you have heard of — Bill Gates and Motorola to name a few — invested billions of dollars into this business model two decades ago in an adventure that ended in many bankruptcies and very few people connected to the internet from low-Earth orbit. Yet here we are 20 years later witnessing billionaires from Elon Musk to Jeff Bezos and entities from SoftBank to the United Kingdom investing billions into broadband from space in a gold rush that began around 2015 and has only accelerated since the beginning of 2020.

During that same period we have seen a parallel ascendance of China’s space capabilities. In tandem with the accelerated deployment of SpaceX’s Starlink constellation in 2020 China has rapidly responded in terms of policy financing and technology including most notably the creation of a “Chinese answer to Starlink” namely constellation operating company China SatNet and the associated GuoWang (国网 or National Net(work)) constellation.

While still in early development SatNet and GuoWang are likely to compete in certain markets with Starlink and others while also fulfilling what may be a similar strategic purpose from a government perspective. With considerable backing from very high-level actors we are likely to see the rollout of a Red Star(link) over China (and the rest of the world) over the coming several years.

The rapid rise of Starlink

China’s LEO constellation plans cannot be understood in a vacuum. Like many other areas of high-tech investment China’s actions here are partially reactive to developments in the West. The acceleration and expansion of Western LEO constellations in recent years — most notably Starlink — has been an accelerant to China’s own plans.

As recently as mid-2019 there were only a handful of LEO broadband satellites in orbit most of them being early OneWeb satellite launches or the handful of Starlink test satellites. Plans had been announced for constellations of thousands or tens of thousands of satellites but no company was capable of manufacturing or launching so many satellites.

The past 18 months have seen a dramatic transformation. Starlink has launched more than 1700 satellites as of late May making the organization the largest satellite operator in the world by number of satellites in orbit. That rapid rollout has also allowed the company to begin testing its communication capabilities with entities such as the U.S. Air Force and the Defense Department’s Space Development Agency (SDA). Meanwhile in July 2020 Amazon pledged an investment of $10 billion into its Kuiper constellation of more than 3000 satellites.

In short we have seen a rapid acceleration of the LEO constellation business model since late 2019/early 2020 with several very well-funded companies doubling down on their LEO plans. The business model still remains highly uncertain — and remember all first-generation LEO constellations declared bankruptcy or otherwise failed to launch — but we have undeniably seen major progress. All the while China has been conducting the delicate balancing act of building its own constellation.

LEO broadband with Chinese characteristics

Building a LEO broadband constellation is a complicated proposition in China a country where the space and telecommunications industries are both heavily regulated and dominated by massive state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with significant monopoly (or at best oligopoly) power.

In short then no fewer than five major satellite factories have been commissioned or completed in China over the past 18 months.

Despite the complications the Chinese government has moved decisively passing regulations that have accelerated the buildout of an industrial base. This has included regulations in regard to satellite internet satellite manufacturing and launch services with most of these regulations having been passed since the beginning of 2020.

Prior to the recent acceleration China’s LEO broadband constellation plans were more modest. The first major LEO broadband constellation project to be announced was the Hongyan (鸿雁) constellation of some 320 satellites to be manufactured and launched by Chinese space industry goliath China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). The Hongyan constellation plan was soon followed by the similarly named Hongyun (虹云) a broadband constellation to be deployed by CASC’s longtime rival the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC).

Both constellations were announced around 2017 and both had received significant funding commitments from their parent companies. However as 2018 and 2019 passed the two companies launched only a few satellites between the two of them and offered limited updates.

Accelerating at China speed

As SpaceX began routinely lofting clusters of 60 Starlink satellites into orbit every two weeks around late 2019 we began to see more activity in the Chinese LEO broadband space.

Arguably the first major sign was the April 2020 announcement by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) that it had added “satellite internet” to a list of “New Infrastructures” (新基建). The New Infrastructures list refers to a handful of digital technologies that are being prioritized for development in China over the coming years with buzz phrases such as 5G and IoT appearing on the list alongside satellite internet. The New Infrastructures list is a pretty big deal — for example Chinese tech giant Tencent pledged in early 2020 to invest ¥500 billion (roughly $70 billion) into New Infrastructures.

About two weeks after the commission’s announcement China Unicom one of the big three mobile network operators revealed plans to develop satellite internet services for maritime in-flight connectivity and other verticals while explicitly mentioning the NDRC announcement.

Then in May 2020 Chinese commercial satellite manufacturer Commsat announced a ¥270 million (about $40 million) round of funding with the money earmarked toward building a factory in Tangshan Hebei Province that would have an annual capacity of 100 small satellites per year highlighting the NDRC ruling in the funding round announcement. Later in November commercial satellite manufacturer Galaxy Space raised a new round of funding (amount undisclosed) at a valuation of ¥8 billion ($1.25 billion) making the company the first “unicorn” in Chinese commercial space. If the trend is not clear by now the funding was earmarked for building the company’s “satellite superfactory” in Nantong Jiangsu Province with the factory aiming for an eventual production capacity of 300-500 satellites per year. Unsurprisingly Galaxy Space also referred to the NDRC ruling in its funding round.

At the same time CASIC designed and built a satellite factory in Wuhan a process that apparently took 429 days with around 60 of those days taking place during the very tight lockdown that was placed on the city during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. With an eventual manufacturing capacity of 240 satellites per year the factory was completed in January 2021 and produced its first satellite in May.

Not to be outdone CASC has also been improving its mass-manufacturing capabilities via new factories in Tianjin and Chongqing albeit in a far less public way than CASIC or any of the commercial players. The space industry incumbent will allegedly have production capacity of more than 100 satellites per year in Tianjin with the Chongqing facilities not yet specified.

In short then no fewer than five major satellite factories have been commissioned or completed in China over the past 18 months.

The dawn of GuoWang and SatNet

Discerning readers may have done some back-of-the-envelope math with the above numbers and thought “huh.” Hongyan and Hongyun have plans for a few hundred satellites and by the sound of it China is developing capacity for potentially more than 1000 satellites per year. There seems to be a supply-demand mismatch — what is the country going to do with all that spare capacity?

The answer came to us in two parts. First throughout 2020 whispers began appearing in Chinese circles about a “GuoWang” or “National Net(work)” that represented a larger more comprehensive LEO broadband constellation. The rumors of GuoWang began to dovetail very nicely with filings made by China in 2019 and 2020 with a prefix “GW” to the International Telecommunication Union for constellations of many hundreds to more than 1000 satellites. The total number of satellites specified by these filings was just under 13000 — indicating a much bigger plan than Hongyan or Hongyun individually.

Second in April 2021 we saw the creation of China Satellite Network Group Limited (中国卫星网络集团有限公司) a state-owned enterprise that will act as the operating company for China’s GuoWang constellation.

This seems to represent a major change in thinking by the Chinese government about constellations. Prior to the creation of SatNet China’s constellation plans were small and disparate. Hongyan was a CASC project meaning that all else being equal it was very likely that when buying satellites and launch services Hongyan would buy satellites and rockets from CASC or its subsidiaries. Similarly Hongyun would have likely preferred to buy from CASIC. Following the announcement of SatNet we saw the President of China Satcom — the state-owned satellite operator and CASC subsidiary — tell state media that Hongyan and Hongyun would be “undergoing major changes” implying that they would be rolled into SatNet.

By making SatNet a centrally controlled SOE — directly under the state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) — the powers that be have effectively allowed SatNet to source from anyone and to compete with anyone. SatNet has been brought into the world at the same level of the SOE hierarchy as not only CASC and CASIC but also China Telecom China Unicom and China Mobile.

It is hard to overstate the importance of this development because essentially the Chinese government has elected to draft from scratch an all-star team of leaders from many different backgrounds to head up a broadband network from space. This is likely preferable to the old way of doing things namely trying to get state-owned enterprises like CASC and CASIC to compete with one another. Now the government will let CASC and CASIC compete to supply an independent equally ranked operating company with satellites rockets and the like and in theory that operating company can also buy products from commercial companies too (great news for Commsat). SatNet is an experiment in disruptive innovation in a startup environment with Chinese SOE characteristics and its structure certainly took this correspondent by surprise.

In the month or so since the establishment of SatNet we have seen several leadership appointments including a chairman from the China Electronics and Technology Corp (CETC) with a background in electronic equipment a general director from CASC with a background in satellite manufacturing and board members from CASIC CNSA and other established players. The CFO was recruited from the CNSA an organization known in China for its financial honesty. The leaders of SatNet have already met with the city government of Chongqing to discuss developing satellite manufacturing applications and related capabilities in the city and appear to have significant political clout to build out the network as they see fit.

More recently the State Administration for Science Technology and Industry for the National Defense (SASTIND) published regulations in mid-May on the “orderly development of the small-sat manufacturing industry.” While still quite vague the document provides some guidelines for companies aiming to manufacture satellites that are less than 1000 kg (effectively all LEO broadband satellites would be within this mass range).

So what now?

China’s efforts to roll out its own satellite broadband constellation remain far behind Starlink OneWeb and other Western constellations. However much of the required infrastructure on the ground has been built with multiple satellite factories significant launch capabilities and a plethora of companies developing different applications and related technologies.

Moving forward we may see SatNet start to award contracts for batches of satellites to different manufacturers in an attempt to gauge competencies and test different technologies. At the same time we may start to see state media discuss SatNet in the context of the Belt and Road Spatial Information Corridor a space-based infrastructure project that aims to roll out among other things a global constellation of communications satellites.

From a more high-level perspective we may start to see GuoWang integrated with other elements of the Chinese tech stack. For instance Huawei builds a 4G or 5G network in a rural country? Connect the most hard-to-reach places via satellite. Baidu tries to roll out its Apollo autonomous vehicle on roads in far-off places? It’s conceivable that it would be connected via GuoWang. Dozens and dozens of Chinese state-owned enterprises engaged in activities such as mining road-building and other projects in remote parts of the world? One could imagine they would be connected to GuoWang too.

Ultimately we remain in the early days of the LEO broadband race. With multiple Western companies having raised money from some of the world’s wealthiest investors we are almost certain to see the deployment of multiple LEO broadband constellations with more or less global coverage over the coming several years. For its part China is unlikely to take the lead in this race anytime soon but if recent developments are any indication the People’s Republic has certainly picked up significant speed and may be coming to connect a remote area near you before too long.",,,,,,

Archivo particular.

A pesar de no que no se venderán boletas el partido de Colombia contra Argentina a celebrarse el próximo martes 8 de junio en el Estadio Metropolitano de Barranquilla sí dejará ganancias para la cantidad del Atlántico. Al menos así lo prevé la Cámara de Comercio de esa ciudad que ya hizo las estimaciones en términos de ocupación hotelera y consumo en sectores como el comercio los restaurantes los bares y el transporte interno.

Según reportó la entidad la ciudad recibiría aproximadamente unos $2.800 millones. Los cálculos se basan actualizando al presente en cuanto a inflación y aforo (que es del 25 por ciento) el impacto económico de cada partido de la eliminatoria al Mundial de Rusia 2018.

En ese sentido la Cámara completó el ejercicio calculando las ganancias si el aforo se llevara al 50 por ciento de la capacidad del escenario determinando que los ingresos por cada partido serían de $4.700 millones mientras que con el 100 por ciento de ocupación subirían a $9.500 millones. En todos los casos dicen los estimativos excluyen los ingresos del Distrito que corresponden al 10 por ciento del valor de la boletería que debe pagar el promotor por el impuesto de espectáculos públicos.

Para los presidentes ejecutivos de la Cámara de Comercio de Barranquilla Manuel Fernández Ariza y del Comité Intergremial del Atlántico Efraín Cepeda Tarud la realización del partido entre Colombia y Argentina es entonces un indispensable no solo por las ganancias que implica sino por lo que significa para continuar posicionando a la ‘Puerta de Oro de Colombia’ internacionalmente como destino de eventos.

En palabras de Ariza “la experiencia de Barranquilla como sede de la selección en los últimos años nos demuestra el efecto positivo que tienen los partidos de las eliminatorias en todas las actividades de la economía formal e informal vinculadas a este tipo de espectáculos. Si en situación normal eso tiene un alto significado en las circunstancias actuales es mayor aún. Necesitamos impulsar la economía local recuperar la confianza colectiva e incentivar el consumo y este juego contra Argentina es un excelente punto de partida para ello”

Por su parte Cepeda Tarud destacó que “las condiciones están dadas para acelerar la recuperación de todos los sectores productivos y especialmente de los más afectados como el comercio los hoteles los restaurantes bares y las actividades deportivas y artísticas que son justamente los más beneficiados con la fiesta del fútbol siempre cumpliendo los protocolos de bioseguridad y manteniendo el autocuidado. Que avancemos seguros en la apertura plena de la economía preservando la vida es responsabilidad de todos y de cada uno de nosotros. Tenemos que hacerlo posible”.

Al respecto también se pronunciaron Mario Muvdi presidente de Cotelco Atlántico y Magni Montero directora ejecutiva de Acodrés quienes advirtieron la importancia que el encuentro deportivo tendría para sus respectivas industrias. En ese sentido el primero calculó que la ocupación de los hoteles afiliados a ese gremio en la ciudad ascendería al 35 por ciento en junio cuando en mayo solo llegó al 22 por ciento.

Por si parte Montero describió el hecho como un motivo de ilusión para los trabajadores de la industria gastronómica que esperan mejorar sus ventas con la presencia en los restaurantes y hoteles de los asistentes al partido Colombia-Argentina. “En mayo las ventas de los restaurantes solo llegaron al 40 por ciento. No obstante haber tenido cuatro fines de semana de celebración del día de las madres que es la fecha insignia de este sector. Por eso esperamos que el juego de este martes 8 de junio nos permita continuar con la recuperación que necesitamos” señaló la dirigente gremial.

El club rojiblanco registró en mayo un incremento de ventas del 120% en sus tiendas oficiales respecto al mes de abril y algunos de sus socios comerciales también observan los beneficios del título. El undécimo campeonato liguero de la historia del conjunto rojiblanco comienza a arrojar impactos positivos a la entidad rojiblanca.

Tanto es así que en el mes de mayo la cifra global de ventas de artículos del Atlético en sus tiendas subió un 120% respecto a la de abril; y solo contando las compras a través de la tienda digital del conjunto rojiblanco el incremento sube al 150% según detallaron a EFE fuentes del club.

El domingo 23 el día posterior a la consecución de LaLiga Santander y en el que se produjo la entrega del trofeo en el estadio Wanda Metropolitano fue el día de más compras por parte de los seguidores colchoneros de las cuales un 60% correspondieron a la camiseta conmemorativa por el éxito liguero y a la camiseta oficial de juego. Hasta en tres ocasiones las tiendas rojiblancas han tenido que pedir más camisetas y bufandas conmemorativas.

La ilusión de los seguidores colchoneros se ha traspasado también a las redes donde el conjunto rojiblanco tiene más de 37 millones de seguidores y en las que el vídeo 'ATM Insider' que recoge la intimidad de la celebración de los futbolistas en Valladolid el regreso a Madrid y la entrega del trofeo al día siguiente ha superado los 70 millones de audiencia según aseguró esta semana el consejero delegado Miguel Ángel Gil Marín en el foro 'Pro'.

Este tipo de vídeos forman parte de una estrategia incipiente del conjunto rojiblanco que ha puesto en marcha una marca de generación de contenidos en vídeo denominada 'Atleti Studios' con la que pretenden tanto ofrecer contenido a los aficionados como generar oportunidades de cara a patrocinadores y socios comerciales. ""Hemos generado tres patrocinios importantes gracias a Atleti Studios"" aseguró el máximo accionista de la entidad.

Ganar LaLiga Santander no provoca que inmediatamente llamen a las puertas de la entidad nuevos socios comerciales pero sí genera ""un impacto muy positivo"" en conversaciones que ya estaban abiertas o ayuda a cerrar acuerdos reconocen a EFE fuentes de la entidad rojiblanca. ""Es un empujón importante"" añaden.

El impacto se traslada también a los patrocinadores actuales que han vivido en las dos últimas temporadas el impacto de la pandemia a la hora de la explotación de sus derechos tocados por no contar con la oportunidad de activar esos compromisos al no haber público en los estadios.

Entre ellos está la compañía que figura en el frontal de la camiseta del club rojiblanco la empresa israelí de inversiones financieras Plus500 que también patrocina al Atalanta italiano el Legia Varsovia polaco el Young Boys suizo o el Plus 500 Brumbies de rugby australiano.

""El éxito del Atlético de Madrid demuestra el beneficio de nuestra inversión en patrocinios deportivos que complementan nuestras iniciativas de tecnología de marketing"" asegura a EFE el consejero delegado de esta compañía David Zruia que destaca que durante el año 2020 sus ingresos crecieron un 146% respecto a 2019.

También en la camiseta pero en la parte posterior está la compañía estadounidense de transferencias internacionales Ria Money Transfer presente en 150 países y que firmó con el Atlético a finales de 2019 por lo que la explotación del acuerdo se ha visto ""considerablemente afectada por la pandemia"" explican a EFE desde la compañía.

No obstante la empresa valora el ""significativo impacto"" de sus campañas como el cortometraje 'Para todos los soñadores del mundo' que contaba la historia del peluquero dominicano Archibardo Hernández que tiene como clientes a varios futbolistas y en el que aparecían el uruguayo Luis Suárez el franceses Thomas Lemar y Geoffrey Kondogbia y el mexicano Héctor Herrera.

""Dicho cortometraje que narra la realidad de millones de inmigrantes en el mundo que dejan sus países de origen y familias para hacer posible sus sueños y los de sus seres queridos a través del envío de remesas ha logrado llegar a más de 200 millones de personas en más de 35 países"" aseguran desde Ria.

Un patrocinador habitual de los clubes de fútbol españoles la entidad financiera Caixabank explica que su estrategia con los equipos va ""más allá de éxitos y fracasos deportivos"" ya que su objetivo es ser ""el banco de referencia"" para las aficiones.

Con esta estrategia que incluye a una treintena de clubes entre las dos principales categorías del fútbol español fuentes de Caixabank aseguran a EFE que han comercializado 200.000 tarjetas bancarias y pulseras de pago sin contacto así como 30.000 personas han decidido cobrar su nómina a través de su entidad y han financiado 75.000 abonos de aficionados de clubes españoles.

También con una amplia experiencia apoyando a los clubes de fútbol para la empresa cervecera Mahou la celebración del título por parte de los aficionados rojiblancos es ""una ocasión muy especial de encuentro"" que quieren acompañar con sus productos.

""El hecho de mantener una relación con el Atlético de Madrid desde hace años nos aporta notoriedad y credibilidad dos cualidades ganadas a lo largo del tiempo para acompañar a los aficionados con unos valores que además compartimos ambas entidades a la vez que fomentamos que se generen encuentros entre personas que son esenciales para vivir mejor""

Uno de los últimos socios del Atlético de Madrid es la empresa de equipamiento para gimnasios BH Fitness proveedor oficial del club en sus instalaciones y las de su cantera. Aun llevando muy poco tiempo de relación desde febrero de 2021 la compañía vitoriana ya ha obtenido réditos de la relación: asegura que sus ventas en entornos deportivos han crecido un 400% desde el acuerdo con el Atlético un impacto que generó un negocio de unos 800.000 euros.

""La colaboración con el Atlético es muy positiva para BH Fitness en lo cualitativo y cuantitativo. Si un equipo así los elige para ser su socio de equipamiento deportivo es por la confianza que les genera el conocimiento que tienen tanto a nivel tecnológico y de prestaciones como de diseño. Esa reputación es uno de los grandes activos que caracterizan a la marca desde los años 80"" explica a EFE el director general de la empresa Pablo Pérez de Lazarraga.

La compañía alavesa asegura que el retorno obtenido ""multiplica por cinco en valor"" a la inversión en patrocinio y esto también se traduce en su expansión internacional especialmente en zonas geográficas como Asia y el Golfo Pérsico.

""El hecho de trabajar con el campeón de Liga es sin duda un aliciente y un reclamo para nuestra actividad. Durante el próximo año seguiremos ahondando en nuestra línea de trabajo y desarrollaremos proyectos internacionales en Asia y Norteamérica"" añade el ejecutivo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL25vdGljaWVyb3MudGVsZXZpc2EuY29tL3VsdGltYXMtbm90aWNpYXMvcGFwZWxlcmlhLXJlZ2lzdHJhbi1iYWphcy12ZW50YXMtcHJldmlvLWFsLXJlZ3Jlc28tYS1jbGFzZXMtcHJlc2VuY2lhbC1lbi1sYS1jaXVkYWQtZGUtbWV4aWNvL9IBjwFodHRwczovL25vdGljaWVyb3MudGVsZXZpc2EuY29tL3VsdGltYXMtbm90aWNpYXMvcGFwZWxlcmlhLXJlZ2lzdHJhbi1iYWphcy12ZW50YXMtcHJldmlvLWFsLXJlZ3Jlc28tYS1jbGFzZXMtcHJlc2VuY2lhbC1lbi1sYS1jaXVkYWQtZGUtbWV4aWNvLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Papelerías registran bajas ventas previo al regreso a clases presencial en la Ciudad de México,"Faltan sólo unos días para el regreso a clases presencial en la Ciudad de México pero eso no ha mejorado las ventas en las papelerías del Centro Histórico; la Plaza Mesones es a donde típicamente miles de padres acuden para surtir sus listas escolares está prácticamente vacía.

Te recomendamos: Regreso a clases el 7 de junio también en talleres casas de cultura y guarderías en CDMX

“¿Los papás están viniendo a surtir útiles para el regreso a clases del 7 de junio? Realmente no están viniendo los papás a comprar” Edgar Jiménez Comerciante de Plaza Mesones.

Según los comerciantes de la plaza las ventas han bajado 80% en la pandemia. Y aseguran que la afluencia de clientes no tiene comparación alguna con la que se registraba en los días previos al regreso a clases tradicional.

“No esto estaba pero si a reventar lleno todo alrededor de aquí lleno no se podía ni caminar ahorita te vuelvo a repetir el 30% y eso es mucho como por el 20% si tú ves la plaza está vacía” Marco Antonio Herrera Comerciante de Plaza Mesones:

Y es que el regreso a clases del 7 de junio es realmente atípico.

“Es voluntario en ningún momento se está ahora sí que obligando a nadie es un proceso voluntario” Delfina Gómez Secretaria de Educación Pública Federal.

Además solo abarca un mes de clases presenciales.

“Está muy muy escaso el dinero yo creo ahorita. ¿Y cómo para comprar útiles para 1 mes? Pues menos menos todavía ¿no?” Javier Jiménez Comerciante de artículos de Papelería. “El problema aquí de los papás es tanto económico por lo de la pandemia no tienen el presupuesto” Marco Antonio Herrera Comerciante de Plaza Mesones.

Por ello muchos de los pasillos de la Plaza Mesones están desiertos los caminan los propios comerciantes algunos trabajadores y muy pocos clientes.

“¿Quiénes vienen entonces a comprar? Papeleras ahora sí que los que tienen papelerías externas pequeñas las colonias. Exactamente vienen y nada más dicen que para rellenar lo mínimo así es para tener por si llegan a pedir el producto pero una o dos piezas por producto” Martha González Comerciante de artículos escolares.

Aun así la Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico de la Ciudad de México confía en que el regreso a clases con muchos o pocos alumnos ayudará a la reactivación económica especialmente en las zonas cercanas a los planteles escolares.

“Esto implicará una reactivación económica importante de todos los negocios que giran alrededor de los planteles escolares tanto preescolar como primaria y secundaria. Sigámonos cuidando y participemos en esta acción con todas las medidas sanitarias correspondientes” Fadlala Akabani Secretario de Desarrollo Económico CDMX.

Por lo pronto y a diferencia de lo que ocurría antes de la pandemia en Mesones siguen sin darse las compras masivas previas al regreso a clases.

En relación a las cifras de Vivienda de Interés Social (VIS) se lograron ventas de 10.862 unidades lo que representa el mejor resultado para el mes en el segmento según los registros de Galería Inmobiliaria. Además si bien mayo de 2020 fue uno de los meses más golpeados por la pandemia si se comparan los resultados para este año casi duplicaron a los del año pasado cuando solo se pudieron vender 6.500 casas y apartamentos de interés social.



En el segmento No VIS en el que se comercializaron 4.221 unidades se alcanzó el mejor mayo en ventas desde 2017.



A pesar de que desde octubre del año pasado el sector ha venido presentando cifras históricas dentro de los datos del portal la cartera sostuvo que “los bloqueos restaron dinamismo a la comercialización que decrece frente a los cuatro primeros meses del año”.



De acuerdo con el ministerio el leve declive en mayo no afecta las expectativas positivas y se espera “un excelente resto de 2021” en el que se espera superar las 200.000 unidades comercializadas.



“A pesar de los bloqueos y restricciones los colombianos siguen comprando vivienda en niveles sin precedentes. El de 2021 es el mejor mayo de la historia de Colombia en compra de vivienda con más de 15.000 unidades comercializadas"" precisó Jonathan Malagón ministro de Vivienda.

90.951 unidades de vivienda se han vendido entre enero y mayo de 2021. iStock

El Ministerio destacó también que de los 200.000 subsidios que se lanzaron el año pasado ya han sido entregados 74.000 y que si se compara el resultado de los primeros 5 meses del año 2021 con el mismo periodo de 2020 se aprecia un crecimiento de 62% con 90.951 unidades vendidas entre enero y mayo de 2021.



VISIÓN DEL MERCADO



El dinamismo de los últimos meses en las ventas de vivienda no ha pasado desapercibido para el mercado y los analistas. En el último reporte de la Asociación Nacional de Instituciones Financieras (Anif) para el sector constructor Rasec la entidad destacó que los indicadores de oferta de vivienda del componente de edificaciones del PIB del sector comienzan a reflejar los efectos positivos del paquete de subsidios VIS y No VIS y que si bien a finales del año pasado solo se observaban los estímulos en el segmento social los cuales entraron antes en vigencia para este año se ha logrado mayor dinamismo en el primer semestre.

74 mil subsidios de vivienda han sido entregados de los 200 mil que se lanzaron el año pasado.

Según Anif “el mayor dinamismo de la demanda y la oferta junto con los pocos lanzamientos de nuevos proyectos en 2020 han llevado a una disminución importante en los inventarios de vivienda” lo que se puede relacionar también con las ventas de lo que va del año.



Por otro lado si se revisa el indicador de confianza del consumidor de Fedesarrollo la disposición a comprar bienes durables como vivienda mejoró para los meses de febrero y marzo de este año aunque en abril el indicador de percepción volvió a deteriorarse en todos los niveles socioeconómicos.

Según advierten desde Twitter “ante falsas noticias hay que estar informados”. El mensaje remite a una publicación en Facebook que por su interés replicamos íntegramente.

CADECA aclara sobre venta de Tarjetas en Moneda Libremente Convertible (MLC) a la población

Aparece en varios perfiles de dudosa procedencia una falsa noticia sobre Cadeca y la venta de Tarjetas en Moneda Libremente Convertible (MLC) a la población. Cubanos ¿piensa alguien que en Cuba se emiten dólares? ¿De dónde podría salir esa MLC para vender tarjetas?

Si Cadeca contara con ese respaldo en MLC se pondría a disposición del país para satisfacer las necesidades de la economía que no es otra cosa que satisfacer necesidades de la población (hospitales medicamentos insumos para la industria y la agricultura energéticos etc.) donde se multiplicarían mucho más en beneficio de toda la población.

Si alguien trata de desvirtuar lo que hace Cuba es que vamos por el camino correcto y #VamosPorMas.

No nos dejemos engañar utilicemos la inteligencia educación y unidad que caracteriza al pueblo cubano.

Cualquier información se emitirá por los medios oficiales de la entidad.

Las informaciones que salgan respecto al tema será con un trasfondo que intenta confundir.

TARJETAS PREPAGO USD PARA USO EN CUBA

La explicación hace alusión a las tarjetas prepago en dólares americanos que se emitirán próximamente.

Lo que no aclara CADECA es que fueron precisamente sus funcionarios quienes informaron sobre este nuevo servicio sin ofrecer más detalles al respecto.

Cuando Fincimex compartió la información del Vicepresidente de CADECA el pasado 29 de mayo ninguna de las instituciones ni el directivo respondieron a las dudas de las personas que se interesaron por conocer más sobre las tarjetas prepago USD de uso exclusivo en Cuba.

Desde Twitter incluso se explicó a un seguidor que en los próximos días se daría la información pertinente.

Es lógico asumir por la nueva publicación de CADECA que las tarjetas prepago USD se emitirán para quienes visiten Cuba principalmente desde Estados Unidos.

Recordemos que la mayoría de las tarjetas de los bancos norteamericanos no funcionan en la isla debido al bloqueo.

En Cuba es necesario tener tarjetas MLC para poder pagar por bienes y servicios en los comercios que expenden en divisa extranjera. No se permite pagar en efectivo para evitar la circulación de los dólares y su reventa en el mercado negro."

How does this work for consumers?,"Eyal Goldshmid

Special to TCPalm

Q: For people that use Yahoo! or AOL email what happens to their accounts now that Verizon has sold these assets? Will they need to seek out new providers? How does this work for consumers?

— Connie G. Hobe Sound

A: In May 2021 Verizon sold its equity share in both AOL and Yahoo! to Apollo Global Management for approximately $5 billion. In addition to the main brands involved the sale also included entities like TechCrunch and Engadget as well as a number of AOL and Yahoo! subproperties such as Yahoo! Mail AOL Mail Yahoo! Mobile Yahoo! Finance Yahoo! News Yahoo! Sports and Yahoo! Fantasy.

According to reports Verizon originally purchased AOL and Yahoo! so it could compete for advertising revenue with Facebook and Google but failing that it decided to sell most of its media-based entities so could now focus more on technology-based ventures (though specifics as to what those might be have not been revealed yet).

What does this mean for current AOL Mail and Yahoo! Mail users? In the short term not much.

According to research currently there are more than 24 million active Yahoo! mail accounts and several million of those also subscribe to subproperties like Yahoo! Finance Yahoo! News Yahoo! Sports and Yahoo! Fantasy.

AOL Free Email has a similar number of active accounts it should be added though only around 1.5 to 2 million of those hold some sort of AOL subscription whether it be AOL Gold or Premium plans or even dial-up services. AOL states that several thousand people still use this once dominant dial-up service believe it or not.

Shutting all those accounts down quickly and without notice would most likely cause much uproar especially given the number of accounts involved and in all likelihood all these accounts should remain as is for the foreseeable future.

If or when anything happens expect to receive several notifications from Yahoo! AOL or Verizon prior to execution detailing what will happen why it's happening when it will happen and what options you might have should you choose to part ways with one or both of the services.

The only concern presented at the moment might be for those with active AOL subscriptions. The number of these accounts has been declining in recent years and given that one would think that these would be the first to go if it came down to that.

But again this is all speculation — nothing official has been released yet nor have any firm plans been issued.

Nevertheless if you have any concerns or additional questions then your best source for answers at this point will be AOL Customer Support which can be contacted via the information at this URL: https://help.aol.com/contact.

Both of these phone companies are giving away free iPhones for customers who commit to them for the long run.

They’re giving their biggest discounts in years giving some consumers brand-new devices for no money down or small monthly payments spread out over several months.

Customers must commit to long-term contracts which provides carriers with the stability they need to convince investors while they ramp up spending on 5G network improvements.

In October AT&T started the trend by giving away high-end cellphones like the iPhone 12 for free with a qualifying trade-in device. Its discount was eventually reduced to $700 which covers the whole cost of an iPhone 12 Mini and the majority of the cost of a normal iPhone 12 among other devices.

On Tuesday Verizon followed AT&T by offering $700 in trade-in credits for new iPhones and $800 in trade-in credits for high-end Android phones.

Customers must commit to an unlimited data plan for a certain period of time in order to take advantage of the most generous deals from both businesses.

Over a decade ago wireless carriers used to offer free cell phones by getting customers to subscriber to monthly phone plans.

This began to change in about 2013 when carriers began promoting no-contract wireless services to customers who purchased their own devices.

AT&T and Verizon are now bearing the majority or all of those bills in exchange for consistent revenue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Rpc25leS1wbHVzLXZzLW5ldGZsaXgtMTA1MjYzNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney Plus vs Netflix: Which streaming service should you choose?,"While Disney Plus might not have nearly the volume of content as you’ll find with Netflix a surprising number of people are actually ditching the established king of streaming for Disney’s new service. Until 2019 Disney actually worked with Netflix giving the company the rights to stream a selection of its recent movies. Disney also launched a number of original shows on Netflix including many Marvel TV series that are still available for streaming on Netflix.

That era is over. The team behind Disney Plus hopes its deep family-friendly library of content will draw many people away from Netflix. In addition Disney Plus has a small lineup of original shows and movies. That includes the Star Wars action series The Mandalorian. Even more content is coming to the service including new Star Wars Marvel and Pixar based shows. Read more: What’s new on Disney Plus

So in the battle between Disney Plus vs Netflix which one should you pick if you had to only subscribe to one? We will give you our opinion but ultimately it’s up to you to decide which service will be streamed on your set-top box smartphone tablet game console or smart TV.

Disney Plus vs Netflix: Price

Disney Plus currently costs $7.99 a month. Disney is also offering an annual subscription that’s priced at $79.99 a year. There is also a bundle deal that allows buyers to get Disney Plus Hulu (with ads) and ESPN Plus for $13.99 a month. That cuts the price of an individual Disney Plus subscription to $4.33 a month. You can get the same bundle but with no ads on Hulu for $19.99 a month. Finally Verizon Wireless unlimited customers can get either six months or one year of Disney Plus for free. That offer extends to Verizon’s Fios and 5G home internet subscribers.

Netflix is more expensive. Its lowest price tier for most territories is $8.99 a month which supports one concurrent stream and 480p video resolution. The second tier costs $13.99 a month with two concurrent streams and 1080p resolution. The third tier costs $17.99 a month with four streams at the same time and 4K resolution support. Netflix recently did away with its long-running 30-day free trial offer for new subscribers in the US.

To be fair Netflix is experimenting with “mobile only” subscriptions in certain markets. The price for that tier which is only for smartphones and tablets is less than $5 a month where it is available. However Netflix has not made it available in most of its countries. Even though it doesn’t have a free trial anymore Disney Plus wins the price war at least for now.

Disney Plus vs Netflix: Platforms

Disney Plus apps are available for Android and iOS mobile devices. It also supports Chromecast devices as well as TVs with built-in Chromecast capabilities. It’s also available for Android TV televisions and set-top boxes like the NVIDIA Shield.

Disney Plus can be streamed on a PC on web browsers but specifics have not been revealed. Disney Plus apps are available for Microsoft’s Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 4 and 5 consoles too. It’s also on Roku TVs streaming sticks and set-top boxes Amazon Fire TV sticks and televisions. Android TV devices Vizio smart TVs and Samsung and LG smart TVs have their own Disney Plus apps. There’s been no confirmation of a Disney Plus app for the Nintendo Switch even though a slide from Disney’s 2019 investor day event showed the app running on the Switch.

As far as Netflix is concerned in terms of availability the question is what devices don’t support it. It’s available for iOS and Android smartphones and tablets and it supports Roku and Amazon Fire TV-based devices Chromecast devices and TVs with built-in Chromecast. It also supports Android TV-based televisions and set-top boxes. Of course Netflix is available via a variety of web browsers for PC laptops and desktops.

Netflix is also available on a ton of game consoles. That includes Microsoft’s Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S Sony’s PlayStation 4 and 5 and even Nintendo’s Wii U and 3DS. Apps are available for a variety of smart TVs cable boxes and even Blu-Ray players.

It looks like Netflix wins the platform category at least during the launch although Disney Plus could catch up later.

Disney Plus vs Netflix: Availability

This category is pretty easy to give to Netflix considering Netflix has had a huge head start on Disney Plus. It’s currently in about 190 countries and territories. Only four countries don’t have Netflix: China North Korea Crimea and Syria.

By contrast Disney Plus launched in the US Canada Netherlands Australia and New Zealand. It expanded to other territories in Europe including the UK Ireland Germany Italy Spain Austria and Switzerland along with India in March 2020.

It added France in April 2020 and Japan in June 2020. It launched in Belgium Portugal Luxembourg and the Nordics in September 2020. It launched in Latin America in November 2020. Eastern Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific might have to wait until 2021 for the service to launch in those territories.

Netflix content library

Netflix also has a huge head start on Disney Plus in terms of its library. It has a massive selection of older TV shows and movies and a huge library of original content that’s growing almost daily. Netflix may be losing some of that content in the future content to rivals like HBO Max Hulu and Peacock. However it’s also spending lots of money to fill up its service with tons of exclusive shows and movies.

In 2019 Netflix premiered movies like The Irishman the long-awaited new gangster movie from director Martin Scorsese. The service also launched the first season of the fantasy series The Witcher in late 2019. Let’s not forget about 6 Underground the latest big-budget action flick from director Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds. In 2020 it launched even more new shows and movies including Space Force Da 5 Bloods Extraction The Queen’s Gambit Bridgerton and many more. Plus you can go back and check out older originals like Stranger Things Black Mirror Russian Doll and much much more.

Keep in mind that Netflix has content both classic and exclusive for all ages and audiences.

Disney Plus content library

Unlike another rival service that launched in November 2019 Apple TV Plus Disney Plus does not have an issue with a lack of content. It draws upon its vast library of content from its Disney Marvel Star Wars and National Geographic divisions. It even has some movies and shows it acquired from its purchase of 20th Century Fox. That’s thousands of TV episodes and movies to stream.

Disney Plus also has a selection of original content as well. That includes the hit Star Wars live-action show The Mandalorian. There are also a number of original movies you can stream including some that were originally set for a theatrical release such as Artemis Fowl and Soul. The service also has a lot of original reality competition shows and documentaries to stream. In September Disney Plus subscribers could watch the long-awaited live-action version of its animated movie Mulan. However subscribers had to pay an additional $29.99 on top of the $6.99 a month fee to purchase the movie at least at first. The service did the same thing in March 2021 with the release of the animated movie Raya and the Last Dragon and in May 2021 with Cruella. It will use the same business model for two more movies: Black Widow and Jungle Cruise.

While the number of original shows and movies on Disney Plus is currently low compared to Netflix that will change over the next 12 to 18 months. It will be the exclusive home for a number of other original movies and TV shows. They will include new Star Wars live-action series. There are also 12 live-action TV series set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that will be streamed on Disney Plus. It started in 2021 with WandaVision and continued with The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and more recently Loki.

In many international markets Disney Plus has added a new section Star that included more mature content mostly from its 20th Century Fox content library. The US will not see that happen on Disney Plus as the company plans to keep that kind of content on its separate Hulu service. The Mandalorian is about as “adult” as you can expect from a series from Disney Plus in the US.

If you really want more hard-hitting content and you live in the US your best bet is Netflix. However Disney Plus plans to offer more mature content in other markets via Star in the near future.

Other features

Both services don’t feature any ads or commercials while using them. Both Disney Plus and Netflix support downloading of content for offline viewing. Both will also support streaming shows and movies at 4K resolution but you have to pay a lot more for that privilege on Netflix. Disney Plus will support streaming for up to 10 devices at once with up to four concurrent streams at once. Netflix’s limit is four people for each account. Again though you have to pay extra for that support.

Disney Plus has support for up to seven custom individual profiles per account. Kids can see the shows and movies they are interested in while their older parents can see their preferred content. Netflix only supports up to five profiles per account.

Disney Plus also has a Kids Mode. It includes parental controls so moms and days can keep their kids from seeing content that’s out of their age group. Netflix also has parental controls that let parents restrict the content that their kids can watch as well. We prefer the parental controls on Netflix as they give you more freedom to block out selected content.

And the winner is…

Obviously if you are not in one of the countries where Disney’s service is available this battle of Disney Plus vs Netflix goes to Netflix. If you are lucky enough to be in one of the Disney Plus territories you have an interesting choice to make. Disney Plus has a much lower price but its library of content while pretty large doesn’t compare to Netflix. Also Netflix has it beat with the number of its original TV shows and movies and that will be the case for years to come. Finally Disney Plus is currently targeting kids and families with its content. If you are looking for content that’s more adult and edgier in the US Netflix wins hands down.

On the other hand if you do have kids or just love watching classic and current movies and TV shows from Disney it’s hard to ignore Disney Plus. Star Wars fans can now watch all the films plus new content in 2020. Marvel fans can watch most of the MCU movies immediately and more importantly a ton of original shows in 2020 and 2021. Pixar fans now have all of the films to binge-watch right off the bat. If all of that appeals to you then Disney Plus is likely the winner.

In the end it’s likely that many people will buy subscriptions to both Disney Plus and Netflix at least for the time being. Disney Plus also has the option of a cheaper (per month) yearly subscription something that Netflix for unknown reasons has never offered its customers. Only time will tell if Disney Plus’ mix of classic content and exclusive series and movies will put a dent in Netflix’s subscriber numbers long-term but so far Disney Plus has certainly made a big splash.

Who would you pick in the battle of Netflix vs Disney Plus?

One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Vertex Pharmaceuticals is 33.8% which ranks better than 81% of the companies in Biotechnology industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 201.7% which ranks better than 100% of the companies in Biotechnology industry.

One can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months Vertex Pharmaceuticals's ROIC is 66.71 while its WACC came in at 5.06. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Vertex Pharmaceuticals is shown below:

IACS-6274 a selective glutaminase-1 inhibitor appeared safe and demonstrated antitumor activity among patients with biomarker-selected advanced solid tumors according to phase 1 study results presented at the virtual ASCO Annual Meeting.

Glutaminase (GLS1) plays a key role in the dysregulated cellular metabolism that occurs in many cancers. Researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center discovered and developed IACS-6274 a GLS1 inhibitor and found it had excellent pharmacokinetics and conferred antitumor activity in biomarker-defined preclinical models.

Data were derived from Yap TA et al. Abstract 3001. Presented at: ASCO Annual Meeting (virtual meeting); June 4-8 2021.

“By understanding the underlying biology of different cancers we were able to identify molecular predictive biomarkers to target tumors with critical dependencies on GLS1 (ie ‘Achilles heels’) so as to enrich our patient population with those who will respond to and benefit from IACS-6274 for example in targeting patients who have cancers with KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutations asparagine synthetase (ASNS)-low tumors and immune checkpoint inhibitor-resistant cancers” Timothy A. Yap MBBS PhD associate professor of investigational cancer therapeutics and medical director of the Institute for Applied Cancer Science at MD Anderson told Healio. “Importantly these are patient populations that respond poorly to current available targeted and immunotherapy agents and so represent really important areas of clinical unmet need.”

Timothy A. Yap

Yap and colleagues jointly conducted a first-in-human trial with Ipsen of IACS-6274 (also called IPN60090) among 22 patients (median age 63.5 years; 73% women) with advanced ovarian cancer (n = 8) non-small cell lung cancer (n = 7) melanoma (n = 2) and leiomyosarcoma gastric cancer anal cancer endometrial cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (all n = 1). The cohort included patients with ASNS loss (n = 6) and STK11 (n = 5) KEAP1 (n = 5) NFE2L2 (n = 4) and NF1 (n = 1) mutations. Twelve patients had received two to four prior lines of therapy and 10 had received five or more lines of therapy.

Researchers administered escalating twice-daily doses of IACS-6274 using a Bayesian optimal interval design in which one patient each received 20 mg 40 mg and 80 mg four patients received 120 mg 11 patients received 180 mg and four patients received 240 mg.

Researchers conducted pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in serial tumor and blood samples and they assessed peripheral glutamine metabolism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

They found that IACS-6274 had a half-life of 7.56 hours with plasma exposure showing a dose-dependent increased across the dosage cohorts. Researchers also observed a “robust” pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship across doses and patients (P < .001).

Patients who received 180 mg — which researchers recommended as the phase 2 dose — displayed steady-state exposures at day 14 with a maximum concentration of 45.8 M (± 18.6 M) and an average area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours of 382.48 M per hour (± 159.27 M per hour).

At day 14 glutamate-to-glutamine ratios decreased 82.5% compared with baseline among patients who received 120 mg 83.9% among patients who received 180 mg and 85.3% among patients who received 240 mg (all P < .0001) all crossing the 80% threshold of inhibition used to determine maximally efficacious dosage used in preclinical models Yap said during his presentation.

Seventeen of 20 evaluable patients achieved stable disease as best response per RECIST version 1.1 with that response persisting for 6 months or longer with or without tumor regression among two patients with ASNS-loss advanced ovarian cancer two patients with PD-1/PD-L1-exposed melanoma — one of whom is still on the trial at 15 months — one patient with NF1-mutated leiomyosarcoma and one patient with STK11-mutated advanced NSCLC.

The disease control rate at 12 weeks was 60%.

“This was a phase 1 clinical trial that included a heavily pretreated patient population with a diverse range of very advanced cancers that were refractory to available existing therapies known to provide clinical benefit for their condition” Yap told Healio. “Most of our patients had progressed on multiple lines of prior therapies including chemotherapy immunotherapy and/or targeted agents. Therefore to see a disease control rate at 12 weeks of 60% in this heavily pretreated and resistant population of [patients with advanced cancer] is certainly notable.”

Common adverse events related to treatment with IACS-6274 included grade 1 to grade 2 photopsia (n = 7) photophobia (n = 7) increased creatinine (n = 4) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (n = 4). Among patients who received the 180 mg and 240 mg doses three experienced grade 3 reversible nausea and two experienced grade 2 vomiting and fatigue. One patient who received 240 mg experienced grade 3 acute renal failure and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome which researchers noted fully resolved.

Researchers are planning future studies of IACS-6274 in combination with immunotherapy other targeted therapies and chemotherapy among molecularly selected patients.",,,,,,,,,

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of VICI Properties is 57.4% which ranks better than 97% of the companies in REITs industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 92.3% which ranks better than 98% of the companies in REITs industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders.

The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) has issued Department Order No. 221 s. 2021 (“DO No. 221 s. 2021“) or the Revised Rules and Regulations for the Issuance of Employment Permits to Foreign Nationals (access here). Companies that will be applying for or renewing alien employment permits (AEP) for their foreign employees will have to comply with the new requirements under DO No. 221 s. 2021

Key Takeaways

The salient points of DO No. 221 s. 2021 are as follows:

AEP applications must be filed prior to the commencement of employment or within 10 working days from the date of the signing of employment contract.

New requirements for an AEP application include: (i) a certified true copy (CTC) of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) certificate if applicable; (ii) proof of the required job vacancy’s publication; and (iii) an affidavit stating that no applications were received or no Filipino applicant was considered for the position.

A police report is now required for the replacement of AEP cards due to loss.

At least 15 calendar days prior to the application for AEP the employer must publish the job vacancy being applied for by the foreign nationals in a newspaper of general circulation. The DOLE Regional Office (DOLE RO) must conduct a labor market test (LMT) within two working days from receipt of the AEP application.

New AEP applications shall be processed within five working days after publication. Renewal AEP applications shall be processed and issued within five working days after submission of documentary requirements and payment of fines if any.

AEP cards must be claimed within 10 working days from notification failure of which is a ground for revocation of the application.

The AEP shall remain valid in case the foreign national is transferred or assigned to related companies in another region. However the employer must publish the position as described above when filing for renewal. The employer must notify the DOLE RO within 10 working days from the date of transfer or reassignment.

The employer must submit a quarterly report on foreign nationals employed. It must also notify the DOLE-RO of any changes in the employer’s information such as name address and contact number.

Foreign nationals working without valid (e.g. expired) AEPs and their employers shall be barred from filing AEP applications for five years. On the other hand foreign nationals working with fraudulent AEPs and their employers shall be barred from filing AEP applications indefinitely.

Certificates of Exemption or Exclusion are available for certain foreign nationals.

Accreditation is now required for authorized representatives who will process AEP applications.

In more detail

Filing of new and renewal AEP applications

The process for filing new AEP applications is as follows:

Prior to the filing of the AEP application the employer must secure all relevant permits and authorities including: (i) a special temporary permit in case of practice of a regulated profession (e.g. accountancy architecture or engineering); (ii) authority to employ alien issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ) or proof of application in case the employer is covered by the Anti-Dummy Law (e.g. engaged in a nationalized industry); and (iii) authority to hire foreign national from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) or proof of application in case the employer is engaged in mining. At least 15 calendar days prior to the filing of the AEP application the employer must post a job vacancy for the position in a newspaper of general circulation. New requirements for the AEP application include: (i) a CTC of the PEZA certificate if applicable; (ii) proof of the aforementioned publication; and (iii) an affidavit stating that no applications were received or no Filipino applicant was considered for the position. Within 10 days from the signing of the contract or prior to the commencement of employment the employer must file the application for issuance or renewal of AEP submitting all the documentary requirements including the permits described above. Within two days from the receipt of the AEP application the DOLE will perform the LMT. For a period of 30 days the DOLE-RO will post the new AEP application on their website and the Public Employment Service Office job boards. Within five days after the lapse of the period for publication the DOLE will process the AEP application. The AEP must be claimed within 10 days from notice of issuance except if the employer requests that the AEP be sent through courier service providers failure of which is a ground for revocation.

The process for filing renewal AEP applications is as follows:

Prior to the filing of the AEP application the employer must secure all relevant permits and authorities including: (i) a special temporary permit in case of practice of a regulated profession (e.g. accountancy architecture or engineering); (ii) authority to employ alien issued by the DOJ or proof of application in case the employer is covered by the Anti-Dummy Law (e.g. engaged in a nationalized industry); and (iii) authority to hire foreign national from the DENR or proof of application in case the employer is engaged in mining. If the foreign national was transferred or assigned to another region within 15 calendar days from the filing of the AEP application the employer must post a job vacancy for the position in a newspaper of general circulation. As early as 60 days before the expiration of the AEP the employer must file the application for issuance or renewal of AEP submitting all the documentary requirements including the permits described above. Within five days from receipt of complete documents the DOLE will process the AEP renewal application. The AEP must be claimed within 10 days from notice of issuance except if the employer requests that the AEP be sent through courier service providers failure of which is a ground for revocation.

Additional position

Section 5 of DO No. 221 provides that an LMT is required in cases where the foreign national is assigned an additional position during the effectivity of an AEP. They must file an AEP application with the DOLE-RO within 15 working days from the date of appointment.

Transfer of employees

Section 8 of DO No. 221 provides that the AEP shall remain valid until it expires even if the company transfers to another location or the foreign national is transferred or subsequently assigned to related companies in another region. The employer must notify the DOLE-RO of any transfer or re-assignment within 10 days from effectivity.

However if a foreign national is transferred when the AEP is renewed the employer must comply with the required publication as described above.

Penalties for working without valid/with fraudulent AEP

Section 10 of DO No. 221 provides that foreign nationals working without valid AEPs and their employers shall be barred from filing AEP applications for five years.

On the other hand foreign nationals working with fraudulent AEPs and their employers shall be barred from filing AEP applications indefinitely.

In addition a fine of PHP 10000 for every year shall be imposed on both the foreign national and employers if a foreign national is hired without a valid or with a fraudulent AEP. The same fine shall be imposed for filing late AEP application (e.g. beyond 10 days from the signing of the contract or after commencement of employment).

Certificate of exemption

Certificates of exemption are issued to foreign nationals who while covered under Article 40 of the Labor Code are exempted from securing AEP under relevant rules and regulations.

The following foreign nationals may apply for certificates of exemption from securing AEP:

Saved by the Bell which ran on NBC from 1989 to 1993 seemed to transcend screens fostering a generation of fans who loyally trailed Zack (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) Kelly (Tiffani Thiessen) Slater (Mario Lopez) Jessie (Elizabeth Berkley Lauren) Screech (Dustin Diamond) and Lisa (Lark Voorhies) from high school to college a wacky vacation in Hawaii and that long-awaited wedding in Las Vegas.

One of those Bayside superfans was Emmy-winning 30 Rock writer Tracey Wigfield. “I have a crazy amount of fondness and nostalgia for Saved by the Bell and I know I’m not alone” she says. “It was a funny and kind of weird sanitized and cartoony version of what high school is but it really struck a chord in my generation.”

In reimagining the property for Peacock three decades after its original run Wigfield knew she could take the loyal followers of the sitcom through the motions of some later-in-life shenanigans of the old gang — she just didn’t want to. “Reboots are obviously not a new idea and taking a show that people loved and just making more of it didn’t seem like such a novel or honestly exciting concept for me” says Wigfield. “The thing that I had never seen done before and what seemed really exciting was: Can you take this multicam teen sitcom that we all remember and turn it into a completely different genre of comedy?”

Wigfield’s idea involved getting the original crew on board with poking fun at their iconic characters a proposition that initially made her nervous. “I have a fifth grader inside of me who’s in love with Zack Morris and Slater so for me it was like ‘I hope they like me and this weird idea I have’ ” she says. “There was definitely a fear of ‘What if none of them have a sense of humor?’ But they all got it right away and were excited to come back and be these characters again.”

At modern-day Bayside High the hallways look like time stood still but within those corridors is a whole new world. Edgier far more self-aware and single-cam the latest outing at this fictitious school delivers those much-anticipated check-ins — Zack and Kelly are still married! Jessie still can’t touch caffeine! Slater teaches gym and is still in love with Jessie natch! — but it also introduces viewers to a whole new set of characters who weren’t even alive when posters of their senior castmates lined the walls of tween rooms across the United States.

To really evoke a sense of the original Wigfield populated Bayside High with characters who suffered from some of the — let’s be honest — tone-deafness of Zack and the gang. “I wanted to make Bayside a real place that existed in 2021 but you still had characters that acted like the characters in the original show kind of thoughtless a little privileged. Kids who get into high jinks but their high school experience really doesn’t go any deeper than pranking their principal and their actions don’t have any real consequences” says Wigfield.

The real transformation to this beloved property was juxtaposing the Bayside kids with a crop of students who thanks to Zack Morris’ poor budgeting and leadership skills as the governor of California end up attending Bayside High when their own school is shuttered. “What happens if you take kids whose lives do have consequences whose day-to-day is a little scarier for a bunch of different reasons and what if they came into this environment and are like ‘What the fuck is going on?'” Wigfield says. “It’s a comedically fruitful premise but also in L.A. right now schools are very segregated and it felt like it was an interesting conversation to have.”

The biggest challenge says Wigfield became nailing the tone of a comedy that not only delivers on the nostalgia front but also tackles social injustice and gets the laughs. “Making sure that everything we were saying we were saying exactly right and not falling into weird stereotypes was tricky” says Wigfield. “I think it was hard even for me to exactly pinpoint what tone I wanted.”

By the third episode ­— in which the A-story deals with a student from the underfunded school being accused of stealing electronic equipment and the B-story tackles two Bayside boys pursuing the same girl without being able to figure out that they like the same person ­— Wigfield was confident that Saved by the Bell 2.0 had found its footing. “It felt like this is exactly the note we want to hit with the simplicity of stories on the old show rubbing up against heavier real high school stories” she says. “It feels kind of weird but maybe that’s exactly the weird that the show wants to be.”

Bayside High Gets an Expansion

Production designer Joseph Lucky did not have access to Ken Johnson’s original designs which meant he had to familiarize himself with the world of the original in order to bring Bayside and hangout The Max into the new millennium.

From the very beginning production designer Joseph Lucky knew he was performing an upgrade to the school. “That hallway and staircase that you see in every opening scene of the original and the red lockers and orange classroom doors I maintained throughout the new design” he says. “We also kept Belding’s office very much the same for Principal Toddman with some of the same furniture elements. It felt like it was such an original nostalgic part of the original series and funny in he might be [like] ‘Hey how come I never got upgraded?’

“A lot of the banners I re-created from the original series” Lucky continues. “They’re all hand-painted on butcher paper because it kind of feels like high schools would do that. We had guys painting those banners for weeks.”

Lucky says that the original series’ design was inconsistent and so he created a color scheme for the school. “The Bayside logo is sort of that burgundy color and that became a jumping-off point: We’ll go with red lockers and orange doors and that brings some of the original look into the new look.”

Lucky was also tasked with adding scope. “I always want them to be able to do multiple scenes and multiple walk-and-talks” he explains. “You can walk that school forever and never hit a wall. And the sight lines are never-ending. I kind of pride myself on that.” The stairs also go up to another level. “There isn’t much depth beyond there but there is definitely room for expansion if we wanted to play.”

“My biggest challenge was keeping the entryway the booths and the proscenium identical to keep the integrity of the original series and trying to figure out what the rest of it would look like to blend in” Lucky says of the iconic hangout spot for Bayside’s students. “The Max is based on a Memphis design from the ’80s which is based on a postmodern design movement. I pulled inspiration from pop art periods and the art deco age and I wanted to maintain the bold shapes and colors.”

Diehard fans of the original will no doubt recognize much of The Max in the reboot. “There’s a lot of the little details that make The Max complete: Some of those cutout shapes you see on the walls the counter that the waitress would work off also has an interesting design” Lucky says. “The big trusses throughout The Max that were in the original I tried to duplicate. Even the menu boards … I think every part of The Max has a design element to it. That was the most fun about that set.”

Lucky admits he didn’t feel too limited in his design task which required those nostalgic elements while also making it clear that this Max exists in our present day. “I think things blend into the original design while still giving it a very fresh modern and relevant look for the expansion that we created” he says. “Even though I had to inherit a look it was just a very small part of what I had to do. I accepted the original designs knowing that what I was going to do after that was to become much bigger than what there was.”

The Fortune 500 list for 2021 is an historic one.

The annual list of the 500 largest American companies by total revenue features two Black female CEO’s on the same list for the first time ever according to ABC News.

The 67th edition of Fortune 500 features Rosalind “Roz” Brewer the CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance and Thasunda Brown Duckett the CEO of TIAA.

The pharmaceutical retailer Walgreens ranked 16th on the list after delivering more than $139 billion in revenues in its most recent fiscal year. TIAA a financial service organization ranked 79th with more than $41 billion in revenues.

Citing Equal Employment Opportunity Commission data CNN reports the two women are in rare company on Wall Street as Black people make up just 3.3% of senior and executive leaders presently working in corporate America.

Brewer a former Starbucks executive was appointed CEO of Walgreens in March according to theGrio.

Brown Duckett took over TIAA as CEO in February as reported by theGrio. Prior to that she was CEO of Chase Consumer Banking. She replaced another Black CEO in Roger W. Ferguson Jr. who retired from his post.

TIAA CEO Thasunda Brown Duckett (via LinkedIn)

TIAA is the only Fortune 500 company to have two consecutive Black CEOs.

“It does not escape me that I am standing on the shoulders of giants including the cooks and janitors and others who look like me and were first to enter corporate America” Brown Duckett said told ABC. “They created the space for me to have this opportunity. My hope is that corporate America realizes that talent is created equally but opportunity is not and we all acknowledge that there’s still more work to be done.”

Brewer and Brown Duckett follow in the footsteps of Ursula Burns the first Black female CEO of a Fortune 500 firm. She ran Xerox from 2009 to 2016 according to the Harvard Business Review.

Additionally the 2021 Fortune 500 lists the most female CEO’s in history with 41 total. The highest ranking of the 41 is Karen S. Lynch who leads pharmacy and health company CVS Health. The retailer made over $268 billion in revenue in its latest fiscal year.

Walmart led the list with more than $559 billion on the top line. The retail conglomerate has topped the list every year since 2013 according to Fortune.

The companies on the 2021 Fortune 500 combine for a grand total of $13.8 trillion in revenues. Black Enterprise reports that the companies accounted for around two-thirds of the U.S. economy.

Instead they found a line – mostly middle-age and young men – extending from the front door almost to a pine belt separating the parking lot from the Isle of Palms Connector.

“It was like Black Friday” a Target manager said.

Sports card collectors found out the night before that a new shipment was going on the shelves. They poured in. They jostled as they grabbed single packs and whole boxes of the various brands of freshly printed baseball football and basketball cards.

There were similar scenes three miles away inside the Walmart store at Mount Pleasant’s Wando Crossing shopping center.

“They come in and they just swarm the cards” said Missy a Walmart manager.

A sports card boom featuring off-the-charts demand led to violence outside a Target store in Brookfield Wis. on May 7 when a man reportedly pulled a gun during a parking lot argument with fellow collectors.

The draw: relatively inexpensive packs of Bowman Topps Donruss and Panini cards that can be purchased at big-box retail stores for $9.99 and immediately listed on eBay for $40.

Or better yet boxes of cards sold for $25 and quickly “flipped” for $45. Profits are higher for elite “pulls” – individual star player specialty or autographed cards pulled from within the packs.

And you thought college football was going through major changes.

These aren’t the old-school bubble gum and baseball card trading days. Hey how ‘bout two 1988 Dale Murphys for a 1969 Willie McCovey?

Not when you walk into Target and see a sign put up since just after the Wisconsin incident: “To ensure the safety of our guests and team members effective May 14th MLB NFL NBA and Pokemon Trading Cards will no longer be sold in stores until further notice.”

Walmart has also pulled those cards from its shelves as retailers collectors and card companies adjust to a zany market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydXNzdmlsbGV0cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzA2L3Jld2FyZHMtb2ZmZXJlZC1hZnRlci13YWxtYXJ0LWZpcmVzLWluLWFsYWJhbWEtbWlzc2lzc2lwcGkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rewards offered after Walmart fires in Alabama Mississippi,"MOBILE Ala.

Williams entered the Walmart off Eau Gallie Boulevard at about 11 a.m. Thursday shoved a shopping cart into a pallet of supplies a Walmart employee was pushing then struck her in the shoulder and hand with his elbows before continuing further into the store Melbourne police said.

Williams armed himself with a shovel as he walked through the store police said. A manager told police he saw Williams swinging the shovel above his head and speaking in an unusual manner which made him concerned for his employees and customers.

While the manager called 911 Williams beat the shovel against a plastic divider at the pharmacy and struck a customer in the face according to the police report.

The manager tried to confront him and Williams began swinging the shovel at him. The manager told police he backed away and Williams continued toward the garden section smashing the shovel against every sign he passed on his way.

When police arrived at Walmart and seized Williams they found he was also carrying a kitchen knife in a sheath concealed inside the waistband of his pants. Police said they knew of no prior personal conflict between Williams and anyone in the store as a reason for his behavior.

Williams was released from police custody Friday and is awaiting trial July 6."

It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher.

GF Value for The Walt Disney Co is shown in the chart below.

Because The Walt Disney Co is significantly overvalued the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth which averaged 1.2% over the past three years and is estimated to grow 8.60% annually over the next three to five years.

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. The Walt Disney Co's 3-year average revenue growth rate is in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Media - Diversified. The Walt Disney Co's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -35.5% which ranks worse than 86% of the companies in the industry of Media - Diversified.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months The Walt Disney Co's return on invested capital is 0.70 and its cost of capital is 8.16. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of The Walt Disney Co is shown below:

The City of Long Beach has taken full control of the Queen Mary with the tourist landmark facing an extended closure for what could be millions of dollars of needed repairs.

Long Beach bought the retired ocean liner in 1967 converting it into a tourist attraction and hotel. Various lease holders - including The Walt Disney Company - have operated the ship since then with the latest Urban Commons Queensway LLC surrendering the lease this week. The subsidiary that Urban Commons created to run the Queen Mary Eagle Hospitality Trust has filed for bankruptcy as legal battles continue over the deteriorating condition of the ship.

The city council on Tuesday will consider spending $500000 to begin testing and design work on emergency repairs which are estimated to cost at least $5 million. The ship will remain closed to the public while repairs are completed.

The Queen Mary has played an important role in the theme park industry. Disney assumed control of the ship in 1988 when it bought the Wrather Corporation to get the Disneyland Hotel which Jack Wrather - a friend of Walt Disney - had built and owned. Wrather's Queen Mary lease came along in the deal.

The Disneyland Resort was working on plans for a second gate at the time and Walt Disney Imagineering worked up plans for a Port Disney development around the Queen Mary including a theme park called DisneySea which would become the second gate to the original Disneyland.

A cynic might suggest that Disney just used the Long Beach proposal as leverage to extract a better deal from the City of Anaheim. When Anaheim came through with the deal that created the Anaheim Resort District paving the way for what is now Disney California Adventure Disney gave up the Queen Mary lease to a foundation run by the person who had managed the ship for Wrather.

WDI held on to the Long Beach plans though then plussed them for the Oriental Land Co. which made Tokyo DisneySea the second gate to Tokyo Disneyland in 2001. Tokyo DisneySea even includes a sort-of replica of the Queen Mary with the S.S. Columbia that is moored in the park's American Waterfront port.



Tokyo DisneySea's S.S. Columbia

So it's not at all a stretch to suggest that if it were not for the Queen Mary theme park fans would not have the award-winning Tokyo DisneySea park to enjoy today.

The Queen Mary has hosted its share of themed entertainment attractions over the years from interactive theater shows to the annual Dark Harbor Halloween event. As perhaps the best surviving examples of a pre-jet-age trans-Atlantic ocean liner the Queen Mary retains immense potential as a themed entertainment venue. The City of Long Beach said that it is prepared to extend a contract with Evolution Hospitality which has been operating the hotel on the Queen Mary. But its future as a tourist attraction beyond that remains uncertain at the moment as city examines what need to be done to save the ship and identifies funding sources to pay for those repairs.

But what about Disney World? Well we know there will never be anything like Avengers Campus at Disney World anytime soon but you can still find a Marvel presence there.

WAY before Disney ever bought Marvel the comic book group made an agreement with the owners of the Universal Studios theme parks for the use of Marvel characters there. The contract though stipulated that no other theme parks could use Marvel characters currently in use at Universal Parks east of the Mississippi River. Yeah it was that specific.

That’s why Disney World can’t use Spider-Man the Hulk and characters currently at Universal Studios. The west though has free reign to use those characters and that’s how we got Avengers Campus at Disneyland in California.

But you can still find Marvel at Disney World — if you know where to look. We’re breaking it down.

Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind

But wait you might say how can Disney World have a Guardians of the Galaxy attraction? Here’s the thing — the Guardians are not being used at Universal Studios (remember the contract only covers characters currently represented at Universal). So now we have a brand new epic roller coaster at EPCOT!

Although the initial plan was to have the ride opening in time for Disney World’s 50th anniversary celebrations the pandemic delayed construction on the project but we had remained updated on the construction progress. And then the ride officially opened on May 27th 2022 and we were able to ride it as part of a preview event!

Super Hero Headquarters

Did you know there’s a Marvel Store at Disney Springs? It’s called Super Hero Headquarters and it’s where you can go to get some great Marvel gear. You can find it on the West Side of Disney Springs between Star Wars Galactic Outpost and Candy Cauldron.

You can get everything from Marvel clothing to action figures to Marvel toys here — the store is small but it’s chock full of Marvel goodies.

Marvel Merchandise In Other Shops at Disney World

If you can’t make it out to Super Hero Headquarters though there are plenty of other shops at Disney World that carry Marvel merchandise. At Disney Springs the LEGO Store has a lot of great Marvel sets. We’ve also seen a lot of Marvel apparel and accessories at The Dress Shop at Disney Springs Legends of Hollywood at Disney’s Hollywood Studios and Uptown Jewelers at Magic Kingdom.

Keystone Clothiers at Hollywood Studios is pretty much now half Marvel merchandise and half Star Wars merchandise. So you’ll be able to find all kinds of Marvel stuff all over Disney World if you’re looking for it.

Marvel Promotions

You can also see a variety of Marvel promotions around the parks particularly right before a big movie release or the premiere of a Marvel TV show. We’ve seen everything from WandaVision cakes to a Disney bus covered entirely in WandaVision.

We’ve also seen a lot of promotional snacks billboards and even cakes for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Not to mention all the promo stuff we’ve recently seen for Moon Knight and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.

So although Disney World may never get a Marvel-themed land there are still plenty of opportunities to celebrate your Marvel obsession there.

Medill Reports

Fireworks. Sugar. A Ferris wheel. An escape from reality.

Sounds like a day at a theme park. It’s also a day at a Minor League Baseball park an experience that has finally returned after a canceled 2020 season.

Unlike Major League Baseball minor league ballclubs do not have control over the personnel on the field. Their job is instead focused on entertainment and customer service and clubs mimic a well-known corporation when doing so.

“The Disney way is a really great classic business model to follow” said Sam Bernabe president and general manager of the Iowa Cubs Chicago’s Triple-A affiliate. “They’ll tell you they don’t care how many people are walking into the park they just want to make sure that everybody there is not finding the gum wrapper laying in the corner of the sidewalk or there’s nothing blowing around. Everything’s perfect.”

The Walt Disney Company which operates six resorts and 12 theme parks across the world is known for safety cleanliness and going above and beyond when it comes to customer service.

In addition to not selling gum in the parks cast members clean the sidewalks every night. Disney has a utilidor system used for moving trash around underground so it doesn’t ruin the park-goer’s experience. And they have a patent on the safety system employed in the “Dinosaur” ride at Animal Kingdom.

“Everything we do we do with the guest and cast experience in mind” said Faron Kelley vice president of Disney Sports. “Whether that be incorporating new technologies expanding entertainment and themed offerings or improving current services our goal is to create a more enjoyable and welcoming experience for everyone who visits.”

A near-perfect appearance is what Bernabe says he and his team strive for at Principal Park.

“We don’t have anything to do with player development” Bernabe said. “We don’t have anything to do with where the players are at or what they do. But it’s our job to make sure that the grass is green and the locker rooms are clean.”

“The fields the players in the game are still important when it comes to the way we entertain but it all comes back to making sure that your park is safe and fun” said Randy Wehofer vice president and assistant general manager of the team.

The Iowa Cubs have fireworks every Friday night have dog nights and sometimes allow kids to play t-ball in the outfield.

Dave Heller the CEO of Main Street Baseball and majority owner and managing partner of three minor league teams including the Quad Cities River Bandits values safety cleanliness and also has fireworks every Friday night but claims to take the Disney model up a notch and was heavily influenced by the corporation.

Located in Davenport Iowa Modern Woodmen Park the High-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals is home to both the River Bandits and eight rides that make up a mini-amusement park including a 105-foot-tall Ferris wheel sometimes used for speed-dating a video game room and the only double-decker carousel between Chicago’s Navy Pier and Kansas City.

“I had this idea this vision of creating a park within a park and that was the inspiration for a giant Ferris wheel” Heller said.

Heller’s vision he said was directly inspired by Disney.

“How can we take the core Disney philosophy and mold that into something that fits with who we are?”

Heller was so impressed with Disney that he traveled to Orlando and hired someone that was working for the company at the time to assist with the creation of the River Bandits’ stadium.

“I wanted not just to have rides but I wanted to bring the whole Disney culture” Heller said.

The rides are not the only excitement not related directly to baseball. Heller has had an event called the “candy drop” where a helicopter rains candy down on the children. As they pick up their treats the helicopter circles back dropping marshmallows on its final lap.

The parallels to Disney are obvious. A theme park candy everywhere and a place that allows anyone who walks through its doors the opportunity to forget what is happening in their lives.

“Young people can come here and no matter what else is going on in their lives they can have two or three hours of just uninterrupted fun” Heller said. “That’s my vision.”

The Cedar Rapids Kernels provide an escape for fans as well one which is very welcomed given the year the town has had.

In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted the entire country a derecho storm moved through the city in August 2020 causing millions of dollars’ worth of damage to Cedar Rapids including $1.3 million to Veterans Memorial Stadium home of the Kernels the Minnesota Twins High-A affiliate.

The damage in Cedar Rapids is still widespread as only 11% of the city’s zones have been completely cleaned up according to the city’s website.

Like Disney Kernels games provide that escape from reality.

“People understand that it’s not just about the baseball out there” said Bob Teig a Cedar Rapids resident whose son Jon has been the Kernels bat boy since 2001. “It’s a great outdoor facility a place for interaction. The baseball is a plus.”

At the highest levels of minor league baseball the Disney way is always something being considered.

“I think everybody’s well aware that Disney sets the standard” said Jeff Lantz the senior director of communications for MiLB. “They’re kind of the entertainment organization that everyone tries to emulate when it comes to customer service. I mean they have a full program dedicated to it so that tells you how much they care about it.”

Each of these teams – the perfect-facility-focused Cubs the River Bandits’ theme park and the Cedar Rapids escape from reality that provides a gathering place for old friends – may have slightly different approaches to keep fans walking through their gates each spring and summer but one theme remains constant.

What seems to matter most at the end of the day is the community and the camaraderie.

“I’ve seen people 100 years old come off that Ferris wheel and I’ve seen babies three months old come off that Ferris wheel and every age in between” Heller said. “And the one thing they all have in common? They’re all smiling. They all have a great time. And boy that means the world.”

Discovery’s New Logo Slogan,"John Oliver took yet another jab at his new corporate bosses on Sunday’s episode of Last Week Tonight.

In his opening segment Oliver addressed the United Kingdom’s plans to fully reopen this month despite warnings from experts that a third wave of COVID-19 may be underway.

He showed a clip of a former chief adviser to the prime minister warning that there is “no plan” in place to deal with the crisis and quoting another expert as saying “I think we are absolutely fucked.”

“Wow. ‘There is no plan we’re in huge trouble I think we’re absolutely fucked.’ You do not expect to hear an assessment that grim unless it’s from the team behind the Fyre Festival or Warner Bros. Discovery” Oliver said showing the new Warner Bros. Discovery logo which features the slogan ‘The stuff that dreams are made of.'”

He then addressed his new corporate parent directly — calling it as he did previously with AT&T “Business Daddy.”

“Hi there new Business Daddy” he said. “Just checking in to say I absolutely love the corporate logo you dropped this week. It looks like the opening title of The Simpsons if the fonts were not found.”

He continued: “‘The stuff that dreams are made of’ is a quote from The Maltese Falcon about how the thing that seemed like a priceless treasure was actually worthless garbage that brought chaos and despair to everyone around it. Anyway good luck with the merger I’m sure everything’s gonna go great.”

Here’s the new logo for Warner Bros. Discovery per a press release that just went out. pic.twitter.com/3mbgFUvQb5 — Alex Weprin (@alexweprin) June 1 2021

Two weeks ago Oliver in his opening credits took another shot at the folks in charge of the newly formed company. The credits showed the AT&T logo exploding into a ball of fire with the words: “I Hope The New Different Rich Idiots Don’t Fuck This Up” and “Corporate Parent” underneath that.

Over the years Oliver has taken several shots at HBO parent company AT&T which he condescendingly refers to as “Business Daddy” and has frequently mocked what he calls its “terrible” service.

He also took jabs at AT&T during a segment about robocalls and went on a rant over the company’s support of “white nationalist” Steve King.

AT&T and Discovery Inc. recently unveiled their plan to merge their media and entertainment assets in a deal that will bring together cable networks including CNN TBS TNT HGTV Food Network and Discovery Channel; the Warner Bros. film studio; and streaming services HBO Max and Discovery+. Discovery chief executive David Zaslav will lead the merged company as CEO.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL2JvdW5kaW5naW50b2NvbWljcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8wNi93YXJuZXJtZWRpYS12cC1jYWxscy1tb3J0YWwta29tYmF0LWEtdG9wLWFzc2V0LWZvci1oYm8tbWF4LWNsYWltcy1maWxtLXBlcmZvcm1lZC1iZXlvbmQtZXhwZWN0YXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WarnerMedia VP Calls Mortal Kombat A “Top Asset” for HBO Max Claims Film Performed Beyond Expectations,"WarnerMedia VP Calls Mortal Kombat A “Top Asset” for HBO Max Claims Film Performed Beyond Expectations

Source: Mortal Kombat (2021) HBO Max

In light of its reportedly impressive viewing numbers and the announced plans to spin the bloody fighting game property into a film trilogy for a new generation of fans it should come as no big shock that WarnerMedia has big content plans for the future of the Mortal Kombat franchise.

However now that the merger with Discovery is on the horizon plans could naturally see a shift as one regime exits and another enters power.

This luckily is not the perspective of WarnerMedia Vice President Brad Wilson at least in the short term whole told IGN that the company is thrilled in regards “to the Warner Bros. premieres that come in on the exact same days as theatrical [releases].”

Beginning with Wonder Woman 1984 last Christmas WarnerMedia’s simultaneous streaming-and-theater-premiere strategy has thus far been a success with Mortal Kombat having played a big part in those results.

Furthermore the video game adaptation enjoyed greater success than the Patty Jenkins directed DC film leaving WW84 in the dust concerning the number of households it reached in its few few days of release.

According to Samba TV nearly 3.8 million US homes streamed MK during its opening weekend compared to the estimated 2.2M that watched WW84 over the December holiday.

As such Wilson described Mortal Kombat a “top asset” for HBO Max and asserted that it outdid expectations.

“Mortal Kombat was an interesting title for us because I will say that while we expected it to do well we did not expect it to do as well as it did” he said. “It’s been one of our top assets on the platform.”

He was asked “When you’re looking at how well something like Mortal Kombat performs how does that impact conversations you might have with the content licensing and acquisitions teams?” [Emphasis added]

Wilson was then asked a pair of questions by IGN first “When you’re looking at how well something like Mortal Kombat performs how does that impact conversations you might have with the content licensing and acquisitions teams? [emphasis added]” and second “When you’re looking at these kinds of figures how does that impact how you’re thinking about future IP and actively developing more of that specifically for Max?”

In reply Wilson explained “We believe that we’re here to share and tell stories and create meaningful enduring connections.”

“That is a lens by which we start” he continued. “Do we use that data to inform future programming decisions? The answer is yes.”

He added “We partner very frequently with Meredith Gertler (manager of content strategy and planning at HBO Max) and her team to talk through what that looks like from all the lanes — kids and family to young adult to scripted and unscripted. These are early days.”

“We’re all sort of figuring out the art and science that we lead against” he further noted. “But we’re also trying not to deviate from a formula that we know it’s been really successful with all original programming in the past.”

So while nothing is guaranteed further Mortal Kombat content for HBO Max sounds like it’s not only on the table but under serious consideration.

After all Mortal Kombat (2021) director Simon McQuoid is looking forward to creating a sequel where he can finally introduce Kitana and there have been rumblings of an all-female spinoff.

Sequel or spinoff the one hope we all have is that the actual tournament will finally be the focus of the story.

Should this aggressive design be made?

2020 marks the beginning of the 8th generation for the Corvette and is its largest leap yet in its slow up until now progression towards supercar status. The mid-engine design not only allowed but actually in a way forced Chevy into an aggressive design that has just as much in common with a Lamborghini or Ferrari as it does with previous generation Corvettes.

Image Via Xeigen

Despite the welcoming reception from Corvette enthusiasts and critics alike there are still some that think that the new design fell a bit flat and could definitely be improved upon. While this kind of mixed-emotion attention is nothing new for the Corvette historically there have not been many radical aftermarket fixes for the consumer grievances in the past. However the C8 is in almost every way a new beast that has drawn a new crowd of enthusiasts that are not afraid to deep dive into one of the most costly and difficult style upgrades for a car - the widebody kit.

ADVERTISEMENT

For the C8 owner left wanting more from the Corvettes newly found body lines there have been very limited options thus far which is not all that surprising. What’s also not surprising is that most of these kits push the looks of the car even further toward a European inspired design and away from the Corvette’s heritage.

Image Via Xeigen

However there is one company that has developed renderings that seem to draw a lot of inspiration from John Greenwood’s design from the 1970s. From the pictures Xeigen’s widebody kit appears to feature a hood very similar to an L88 style hood a wider stance and a steeper angled front end. The company even went as far as to draw up one rendering that shows the planned wide-body Corvette proudly displaying patriotism with a red white and blue paint scheme even more reminiscent of one of Greenwood’s C3 Corvettes.

The habitability of our planet is at stake.

In 2012 the University of California Sustainable Practices Policy ambitiously set a target of zero waste defined as a waste diversion rate of at least 95% by 2020. However according to the 2020 UC Sustainability Annual Report UCLA only had around a 50% waste diversion rate in 2020.

A lack of recycling infrastructure institutional purchasing practices and challenges with environmental literacy has contributed to that shortcoming said Deputy Chief Sustainability Officer Bonny Bentzin in an emailed statement.

Despite this shortfall the critical need for better waste management means that the project can’t be abandoned – it just needs to be reimagined.

The UC Zero Waste Working Group has redefined a new zero waste goal that focuses on both waste diversion and reduction. These targets include a 25% reduction of waste per person from fiscal year 2016 levels by 2025 a 50% reduction of waste per person from fiscal year 2016 levels by 2030 and a 90% solid waste diversion rate from the landfill according to Bentzin’s emailed statement.

But adding nuance to sustainability targets just isn’t enough. Instead UCLA must increase its campus community’s environmental consciousness by facilitating waste literacy promoting environmental education programs and encouraging small-scale efforts from students. The combined force of such initiatives will help create a more environmentally friendly campus.

Bentzin said in the emailed statement that UCLA Sustainability has attempted to increase its educational outreach through social media waste training for staff and resources on waste sorting.

With an ever-changing student body however these programs are often more effective in theory than in practice.

“With new students always coming in it’s always a constant battle to educate the whole student body” said Jack Miller a UCLA alumnus and former Zero Waste Ambassador. “And (for) a lot of international students (recycling programs) are just not uniform across the whole globe so there’s a lot of barriers that have to be worked around.”

For starters UCLA should make sustainability programs more accessible and work with student organizations that play a key role in fostering waste literacy.

Greening the Greeks at UCLA is one such organization. Armed with a resource guidebook and presentations the organization hopes to improve student understanding on the proper disposal of electronic-waste recycling and food waste. It serves the entire UCLA Greek community which consists of 66 organizations.

It is essential for the university to provide increased support through funding or other forms of partnership  for these environment-focused student organizations. However waste sustainability also requires individual motivation.

CJ Johnson a second-year atmospheric and oceanic sciences student and the director of education for Greening the Greeks said students have to be genuinely interested in sustainability for educational efforts to be successful.

That means UCLA’s new programs need to be optional and tailored to students’ interests especially as students return to campus in the fall. The rapid influx of people and the trash produced by additional people highlights the need for UCLA Sustainability to accelerate its campus efforts to meet its 2025 goal.

And if history shows us anything it’s that goals are particularly hard to meet.

Based on its zero waste trajectory in 2019 UCLA has fallen short. In 2018 UCLA diverted 11330 tons of waste from landfills which was 6540 tons short of the UC zero waste benchmark. Its 2019 diversion rate of 57% was also significantly less than the ambitious 2020 90% diversion target.

Guest speakers campuswide events and eye-opening modules can all help to generate student buy-in on pressing sustainability issues. The sustainability office could also set up an “eco rep” or sustainability ambassador program to help bridge the gap between Bruins and the sustainability task force. Other methods of student engagement include integrating environmental volunteer work into general education classes and providing well-advertised internship opportunities in the UCLA Sustainability office.

It is also critical that students understand how seemingly small efforts can be extremely impactful.

Simple habits such as properly disposing of waste holding peers accountable for actions and reducing meat consumption can generate large-scale impacts when taken up by the entire Bruin community.

Despite shortcomings it is important to acknowledge that UCLA’s previous zero waste target may have already increased environmental consciousness among students and faculty.

Thomas Gillespie a UCLA geography professor said that even though a lot of ambitious environmental targets are rarely met they often result in some levels of progress.

Regardless of whether the initial launch of the zero waste goal spurred some progress it is important for UCLA to actually realize its new zero waste target by 2025.

It’s causing open flooding and providing convenient breeding grounds for mosquito and water-borne diseases as water becomes trapped in plastic. Plastic also degrades over time releasing smaller particles called microplastics posing a significant risk to humans and ecosystems. And who among us hasn’t seen the heartbreaking pictures of dolphins turtles whales and birds harmed – and their lives cut short – by plastic pollution? It’s clear that urgent action is needed to save our environment.

In Dhaka city alone plastic waste has gone up more than 3.5 times from 178 tons per day in 2005 to 646 tons per day in 2020 . Of that 646 tons only 37 percent is recycled and mostly by the informal sector. Landfills are most often found filled with single-use plastics such as thin shopping bags.

More than a year ago when I visited the remote Katka beach in the majestic Sunderbans forest we picked about two cubic meters of plastic waste on our walk around the beach. And this beach is not even a crowded tourist hub like Cox’s Bazar.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated plastic pollution. Not only is the pandemic bringing human tragedy and loss but is also leading to greater environmental crisis-- a surge in the use and improper disposal of plastic waste . The Environmental Sciences and Technology journal estimates that globally more than 129 billion disposable masks and 65 billion throw-away gloves are used every month — most ending up in our rivers and oceans.

We must act now. If we don’t solid waste generation in South Asia already at 334 million tons annually is estimated to double by 2050 and costs to the environment biodiversity communities livelihoods and possibly our health will be huge. We can’t let that happen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3BsYXRpbnVtLWVxdWl0eS10by1hY3F1aXJlLWdsb2JhbC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudGFsLXNlcnZpY2VzLWJ1c2luZXNzLXVyYmFzZXItZnJvbS1jaGluYS10aWFueWluZy1mb3ItNC0yLWJpbGxpb24tMzAxMzA2NTIxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Platinum Equity To Acquire Global Environmental Services Business Urbaser From China Tianying For $4.2 Billion,"LOS ANGELES and MADRID June 6 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Platinum Equity today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Urbaser one of the world's largest providers of environmental services from China Tianying Inc. for an enterprise value of approximately $4.2 billion (€3.5 billion).

The unique partnership brings the international company and technological non-profit together behind a clear objective: to stem the tide of plastic pollution entering the world’s oceans by first intercepting waste in rivers.

Partnering Coca-Cola’s scale and global network with The Ocean Cleanup’s technology and data solutions the initiative will help to expedite the deployment of cleanup systems across fifteen rivers around the world over the next 18 months including the introduction and implementation of The Ocean Cleanup’s semi-autonomous solar-powered Interceptor™ river cleanup solutions. It also aims to engage and mobilize both industry and individuals around the world to address plastic pollution eliminating plastic waste entering the world’s oceans and supporting ecosystems species and water resources.

“The Ocean Cleanup’s mission is to rid the oceans of plastic” said Boyan Slat Founder and CEO The Ocean Cleanup. “With 1000 rivers emitting nearly 80% of river-carried plastic into oceans this massive problem grows by the day which is why we are always looking to accelerate our progress. Among the waste we collect with our cleanup systems we find many plastic bottles including Coca-Cola packaging so I applaud them for being the first in the industry to join our mission as part of their wider actions to make a positive impact on worldwide plastic pollution. Our clear intent is to take our learnings from this partnership which has the potential to evolve in the future and continue to scale rapidly. That’s why I believe this is good news for our oceans.”

The Interceptor Solution

The Interceptor was unveiled in 2019 and is the first scalable solution to prevent plastic from entering the world’s oceans from rivers. It is 100% solar-powered extracts trash autonomously and is capable of operating in the majority of the world’s most polluting rivers.

Through the partnership The Ocean Cleanup together with Coca-Cola will tackle fifteen rivers by the end of 2022 with the two organizations working collaboratively towards their shared goal of eliminating waste. Two Interceptors included in this partnership have already been installed by The Ocean Cleanup in Santo Domingo the Dominican Republic and Can Tho Vietnam. For these rivers the partnership will help provide support in the development of waste management solutions for collected trash and the organizations plan to extend the footprint of the project across thirteen additional rivers.

The Ocean Cleanup brings demonstrated know-how with the experience and proven expertise in plastic-collecting technologies their deployment the issue and science of plastic pollution the data from their deployments and how to address it. Coca-Cola will support The Ocean Cleanup through its global network which includes operations in more than 200 countries and territories. It will provide support on the ground for the local community engagement needed to deploy new Interceptors as well as in the subsequent processing of the collected plastic via waste management expertise in support of a circular economy. The Ocean Cleanup and Coca-Cola will work together to secure the new partners and investment needed to continue to scale the enterprise through the roll-out of additional Interceptor solutions as well as to secure licensing support and deploy River Monitoring System (RMS) cameras to conduct further analysis of river pollution.

A World Without Waste

“As a global business we are working to ensure that all of the material we use in our packaging is collected and recycled so that none of it ends up as waste” said James Quincey Chairman and CEO The Coca-Cola Company. “We support The Ocean Cleanup teams and technologies that are working to protect ocean ecosystems in the journey to safeguard our waterways.”

The Coca-Cola Company is taking holistic actions to tackle the issue of plastic waste through its vision for a World Without Waste. There are three fundamental global goals: (1) make 100% of our packaging recyclable globally by 2025—and use at least 50% recycled material in packaging by 2030; (2) collect and recycle a bottle or can for each one sold by 2030; and (3) work together to support a healthy debris-free environment. Going further and faster where possible Coca-Cola is also investing in new technologies packaging materials and package-less innovations including new enhanced recycling ultra-light-weighting technologies and plant-based technologies as well as dispensed solutions. It recently set a goal that by 2025 depending on business growth it would use approximately 20% less virgin plastic derived from fossil fuels worldwide than it does today.

Tackling plastic waste requires action and thinking from the best and the brightest including civil society industry peers and the public sector. Accordingly The Coca-Cola Company has helped to establish or has joined global partnerships that will help to realize the vision for a World Without Waste. The collective goal is to encourage more people to recycle and reuse and more organizations to invest in the circular economy in which products and materials at the end of their useful life retain their value and are returned to the manufacturing process as part of a closed loop in which little if anything is wasted.

Brian Smith President and Chief Operating Officer The Coca-Cola Company said: “The Ocean Cleanup has a clear vision and proven technologies to support its goal to rid the world’s oceans of plastic. At Coca-Cola we have teams on the ground who will support the deployment of new Interceptors in rivers around the world as well as the processing and recycling of the waste collected. Working together we believe we can have real impact. That’s exciting: it’s something we know our employees in every corner of the world will get behind by helping to support the local implementation work and as ambassadors for the wider mission.”

About The Ocean Cleanup

The Ocean Cleanup develops advanced technologies to rid the world’s oceans of plastic. They aim to achieve this goal by taking a two-pronged approach: stemming the inflow via rivers and cleaning up what has already accumulated in the ocean. For the latter The Ocean Cleanup is developing large scale systems to efficiently concentrate the plastic for periodic removal. This plastic will then be used to create durable products and fund continued cleanup making cleanup itself circular. In 2019 the organization launched the other half of their solution the Interceptor™ to extract plastic in rivers before reaching the ocean. Founded in 2013 by Boyan Slat The Ocean Cleanup now employs approximately 95 engineers and researchers. The foundation is headquartered in Rotterdam the Netherlands.

Commercial scallops from Victorian waters. Fisheries Research and Development Corporation ""These are our best pies yet!"" announces Apollo Bay Bakery owner Sally Cannon as she bites into pastry filled with piping-hot Lakes Entrance scallops. The owner of the Great Ocean Road bakery first put scallops in a pie when she bought the business with her sister Jane Johnston in 2011. While famous for its curried and mornay variety scallop pies that once featured in The New York Times travel pages it was not until last week that Apollo Bay Bakery could use Victorian scallops. Cannon has previously relied on Chinese-grown scallops and Tasmanian catch of the bottom-dwelling bivalve. Head baker of Apollo Bay Bakery James Crump with the first batch of Victorian scallop pies.

Victorian scallops have been available but scarce since the closure of the Port Phillip Bay scallop fishery and the establishment of a strict quota system in the late 1990s. However the discovery of a massive new scallop bed off the shores of Lakes Entrance in East Gippsland will lead to a fresh wave of Victorian scallops hitting shops restaurants and bakeries when commercial harvest starts shortly. ""We aim to take the scallop pie crown off the bakeries of Tasmania and make Victoria the capital of the scallop pie"" says Victorian Fisheries Authority (VFA) director Dallas D'Silva. Rumour of a large untouched scallop bed near Bass Strait oil rigs has circulated Lakes Entrance in the past few years. In December a survey boat contracted by the VFA confirmed its existence. A huge swath of seabed is estimated to hold nearly 8000 tonnes of scallops within 20 nautical miles of the coast. Apollo Bay Bakery curried Victorian scallop pie. Richard Cornish As a result the VFA in consultation with industry bodies increased the total allowable catch for commercial scallop fishers from 135 tonnes to 879 tonnes per annum across the state.

Many of the scallops will land in Lakes Entrance to be processed and shipped to markets around the nation. Lakes Entrance fisher Andy Watts expressed the town's excitement. ""The fleet is ready to rock and roll and head out fishing early next week"" he says. With the scallop bed four times closer to shore than the Commonwealth fishery off Tasmania – roughly 80 nautical miles south of Lakes Entrance – the savings in fuel for local fishers will be massive. The annual harvest of scallops will be only 12 per cent of the total population with remaining stocks left intact to repopulate the bed. Watts says it is a good time of the year for scallops as colder months cause the bivalves to fatten up. ""This is great news"" says chef Nick Mahlook from Lakes Entrance restaurant Sodafish. ""We are going to have better fresher scallops for longer."" Mahlook is known for a dish of gently roasted scallops flavoured with rosemary and guanciale (cured pork jowl).

Cannon says the quality of the Victorian scallops is outstanding. Imported scallops once used by Apollo Bay Bakery were processed to absorb water that would increase their weight. Liquid would ooze from the scallops once they had thawed and continue to exude as the pies baked creating hot watery juices that ended up on customers. ""But these local scallops hold onto their juice so well"" says Cannon. The state government hopes the Victorian food industry will embrace this injection of local scallops onto the market. ""We want to see Victorian scallop pies on the menu of every bakery in Victoria"" says Fishing and Boating Minister Melissa Horne. ""There really is no equal to Victorian scallops for quality and freshness."" With Tasmania notionally the scallop pie capital of the world the minister's words could ruffle a few feathers on the other side of Bass Strait.

However the sisters at Apollo Bay Bakery say they want no part in a ""scallop pie war"". ""We respect there is a history of scallop pies in Tasmania"" says Jane Johnston. ""But we use our grandmother's recipe made by her family on the banks of the Moyne in Port Fairy. It's a proud family tradition."" Sally Cannon butts in: ""Although our customers do tell us our scallop pies are as good as the Tasmanian ones."" Johnston quickly adds ""if not better.""

Fishermen head up the Caroni River on Saturday. - SUREASH CHOLAI

The disaster management units at various regional corporations across the country were out in full force on Saturday afternoon pumping flood waters from homes and clearing debris.

Reports from the Ministry of Rural Development and Local Government stated there were fallen trees in San Juan Arima the Lady Young Road and Caura after prolonged showers in several parts of the country.

Heavy street and flash flooding occurred in areas such Rock Road in the vicinity of Scott’s Road and in Morne Diablo Road Waterloo/Perseverance Egypt Guapo parts of Spring Trace and parts of Cap-de-ville and Bamboo it said.

The report also said there were no cases of injuries to people or animals but indicated that several roofs were blown off and there were minor landslips.

The Met Office on Friday issued a yellow-level adverse weather alert which it said was expected to last until Sunday.

It warned that “river levels are currently near threshold values in some parts especially along the Caroni River basin.”

On Saturday morning the meteorological office warned public to steer clear of rivers as they were reaching overflow threshold.

Met officer on duty Kiran Seedoo said the Caroni River overflow threshold was 7.67 metres and overspill onto the roadway is 8.24 metres. The high tides he added will hinder the outflow of water.

He added that similar situations were expected at major rivers such as South Oropouche River Caparo River North Oropouche River South Oropouche River Guapo River and others.

Reports stated that Cipero River was 65 per cent capacity Guaracara and Vistabella Rivers were 40 per cent capacity on Saturday afternoon.

Councillor for Cashew Gardens/St Mary’s Vishan Mohammed said streets within Housing Development Corporation (HDC) settlement in Cashew Gardens were impassable around midday.

He said the development usually floods because of a lack drainage and infrastructure in the housing development.

“This has been happening since 2017 because HDC has not adequately provided infrastructure to deal with situations like this. They are usually reactive rather than proactive.

“We try at the corporation to assist but the HDC is responsible for the housing development. Luckily water did not enter into properties.”

Sunday Newsday was also told that a similar situation occurred in Bamboo #3 Valsayn. Councillor Seema Ramsaran said some homes were flooded but the damage was not as bad as before.

“The pump is working but not at full capacity. If things escalate overnight the village would be in serious danger. The drainage superintendent said they would try to get another one (pump) but we have not received any updates.”",,,

Whether it’s going to the movies dancing at a concert or watching the Sixers in person at a crowded Wells Fargo Center the region is back baby — sort of.

As of Wednesday Philadelphia joined the rest of the commonwealth in dropping venue capacity limits the outdoor mask mandate and physical distancing rules. But while some people are eager to avoid having to buy hard-boiled eggs to get a drink at the bar others say they’re not ready for hugs and handshakes again.

Collin Sundt for example just became fully vaccinated against COVID-19 — as in he got his shots and waited the required two weeks — on Saturday. On his first day of “freedom” he made the trip with friends to the Philadelphia Flower Show which is outdoors for the first time as a pandemic precaution.

As a writer Sundt said he’s used to working from home but he looks forward to breaking up the monotony now that he’s protected against the virus.

“I’m not sure about being out amongst people again but being able to go places … being able to just be out and not feel so anxious about that” he said adding he looks forward to taking the train out to New York City and checking out some museums the way he used to do pre-pandemic.

Playing in the postseason for the first time in his career Young enjoyed shushing New York Knicks fans at Madison Square Garden and taking on the identity of becoming the bad guy.

“I don’t know if I’m embracing the villain role"" Young said this week. ""I’m just having fun."" Young has never been the type of player to come off as cocky on the floor but the NBA saw a new side of him as he dominated the Knicks.

While he didn't enter the postseason with the idea of becoming the villain type the hostile crowd in New York City inspired the guard as he wanted to have just as much fun as Knicks fans were having in the stands.

Now that the Hawks-Knicks series is in the bag Young enters a new challenge. Playing the top-seeded Philadelphia 76ers in the first round Young will now play in front of a sold-out crowd at the Wells Fargo Center in Philly.

“I don’t know [what to expect]"" Young said on Friday. ""I’m sure it’s not going to be a welcoming one. Obviously they’re going to be cheering for their team and trying to do whatever they can to help their team win and that’s what a fan base is supposed to do. It’s going to be a fun environment and I look forward to meeting some Philly fans getting out there and enjoying it and having a fun series.”

The road won't get any easier for Young. While MSG is certainly a tough environment to show up and show out in the crowd at the Wells Fargo Center has helped the Sixers maintain the best home record over the last two seasons.

Following a practice session Friday 76ers veteran center Dwight Howard had a message to the young All-Star as he anticipates his first playoff game in Philly.

“He don’t want no smoke with these ones"" Howard said. ""Not no Philly fans! We for real about our team over here. We for real."" While Howard made his comments in a joking manner his message paints the right picture for Young. It will be a tough two games to start the series and it should be another fun one for the NBA's new villain.

A scribe like myself would loosen up the old ivory-ticklers and lather up the home crowd with one-liners like “Trae Young isn’t allowed to ride an escalator unattended” or “Trae Young has to jump around in the shower just to get wet” or “Trae Young is a factory outlet Curry.” And then everybody would laugh. And if they didn’t it wouldn’t matter. Because we worked for monopolies and they were pretty much stuck with us.

Times have changed of course. Subtle acts of dehumanization aren’t as socially acceptable as they once were. These days you can’t even throw a water bottle at an athlete without people calling you a criminal. Forget about dumping a beer on them. The other day I heard that the Knicks banned one of their own fans for life just for spitting on Young. Here in Philly we used to call that cooling someone down with your mouth.

It’s a shame too. With the Hawks coming to town to face the Sixers in the Eastern Conference semis Young would have an opportunity to turn himself into a civic legend over the next couple of weeks. Granted it would have come with the risk of spending the rest of his life in therapy if therapy wasn’t also something we made fun of back then. But it would have been great entertainment!

I’m kidding of course. The columnist wars always felt somewhat contrived and they weren’t always the most responsible of endeavors. Besides Young doesn’t need my help to become one of those postseason villains who carves out a place in Philadelphia lore. In fact he’s got all of the characteristics to become one of this city’s all-time great antagonists.

He’s got the bravado. You saw it after the Hawks eliminated the Knicks when Young celebrated the Game 5 victory by taking a dramatic bow to the crowd at Madison Square Garden. Was it Reggie Miller giving Spike Lee the choke sign? Of course not. Was it a cliche? Sure. Did it come after a game in which Young shot 10-for-28 from the field and 3-for-11 from three-point range? You bet it did. Still it takes a certain kind of person to do that kind of thing.

You saw it with the Saints a few years ago with their ski masks and their postgame appropriation of “Dreams and Nightmares.” You’ve seen it from countless Philly heels: Matthew Barnaby jumping Garth Snow smirking at the crowd Warren Sapp and Jeremy Shockey running their mouths Tie Domi spraying a water bottle at the crowd Jared Dudley taunting Ben Simmons.

Young embraced his moment in the New York spotlight. At the Wells Fargo Center he’ll again be center stage.

“They’re going to do whatever they can do to help their team win and that’s what a fan base is supposed to do” Young said Friday. “It’s going to be a fun environment. I’m looking forward to meeting some Philly fans.”

In addition to the personality Young’s got the game. He’s just good enough to get under your skin and just bad enough to hold it over his head. This is a key element of being a heel. A crowd needs to be able to chant expletives at you without sounding ridiculous. Barnaby Dudley Scott Stevens Cody Ross Jonathan Broxton. They were all good enough to warrant the spotlight and inspire varying levels of torment but they all had the sorts of games that fans could mock with a straight face.

Young is very much the same. Is he difficult to contain? Sure. But so are Internet memes. Young is both a volume shooter and a volume misser. He was one of 39 players to attempt at least 375 three-pointers this season and the only one who did not make at least 140 of them. His .343 three-point percentage ranked 131st among the 155 players who qualified for the scoring title. Eight different centers shot better.

No doubt the Sixers will have their hands full as their head coach acknowledged Friday.

“I’ve always said about great scorers if you could slow them down that easy they wouldn’t be great scorers” Doc Rivers said.

But Young will also have his hands full at the Wells Fargo Center. Not just because of his swagger and his style. The third-year guard has another critical element of your classic playoff villain. He’s got the face.

Think about it. Barnaby. Dudley. Shockey. Stevens. Jonathan Sanchez. Put Young in that lineup and he’d fit right in. There’s a Snidely Whiplash element present in each of them a cartoonish sinister quality just begging for caricature.

Combine all of these things and you’ve got the potential for the birth of a new antihero.

“I love it” said Dwight Howard who has spent most of the season egging on the crowd from the bench. “I think the going back and forth with the fans having a good time it’s entertainment. This is why the fans are back. They want to see a good show. Him playing him going at the crowd – but now we got the Philly crowd. And you know what time it is Philly.”

Get your popcorn ready. Just don’t throw it.

The key to meeting these challenges will be continued advances in chemistry chemical engineering and materials science and engineering. Their products are ubiquitous in our daily lives – from pharma and biomedical technologies to electronics and communications to transportation and infrastructure. As discoveries continue to be made and technologies advance how do we ensure the health and well-being of our people and the planet for generations to come?

Increasingly the grand challenges identified in the 2016 United Nations report are driving new research initiatives. Reports such as that recently released from the 2016 NSF Workshop related to polymer science and engineering discuss those challenges within the context of a somewhat more focused discipline. Note one of the grand challenges identified in that report: “Achieve accessible scalable polymers that match or exceed the property matrix of existing materials yet have a green life-cycle.” The authors go further to point out the importance of life-cycle thinking.

To continue to grow and support our economy the chemical enterprise needs an agile flexible workforce that thinks ‘systems and sustainability’. Quite simply global regulations require businesses/ industries to adopt practices that support a circular economy. In a 2016 briefing the European Parliamentary Research Service discussed “opportunities and challenges” for moving towards a circular economy. One of the four identified challenges was the need for technical skills “which are currently not present in the workforce”; namely skills for scientists and engineers that would enable them to design products with circularity in mind. It emphasises that the lack of such skills would be particularly problematic for scientists mathematicians and engineers. Thus the roles and responsibilities of chemists chemical engineers and materials scientists and engineers extend not only to the life of products in the market but importantly to the “end of life” and environmental fate of those products.

Leading chemical and pharma companies or company associations have established sustainability programs to assess their products and manufacturing processes. In some cases they have developed their own special toolboxes while in others they have utilized existing tools and databases. Table 1 presents a handful of examples that have been reported recently. All are used to assess the sustainability of existing products manufacturing processes and services as well as ideas in the early stages of research and development.

The American Chemical Society (ACS) Green Chemistry Institute (GCI) and a group of major pharma companies founded the GCI Pharmaceutical Roundtable in 2005 with the goal of promoting green and sustainable chemistry and chemical engineering believing that green chemistry and engineering are imperative and the Roundtable is pursuing the implementation of green chemistry and engineering into all facets of drug production from discovery and development to manufacturing. In a paper titled ‘Expanding the Boundaries: Developing a Streamlined Tool for Eco-Footprinting of Pharmaceuticals’ authors describe the development of “a streamlined Process Mass Intensity (PMI) and Live Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool” for use by chemists and chemical engineers in discovery and process development stages in pharmaceutical and chemical industries. The PMI is the quantitative measure of the mass of raw materials solvents catalysts reagents water and anything else that is used for producing a specific amount of a target compound.

Alternatively quantification of all the materials involved in the synthesis of a specific amount of material could also be achieved by capturing all these quantities in a spreadsheet and determining the fate of all materials after the separation of the target compound. The same approach could be applied to scale up and pilot plant operations. The resulting intensity numbers (mass solvent water waste etc.) identify the ‘hotspots’ in the synthesis or process and provide opportunities for environmental and economical improvements. The mass intensities can be calculated for each step of a multistep synthesis or a manufacturing process.

The PMI tool was used by the Roundtable members for assessing synthetic and manufacturing processes and “internal benchmarking” and for collaborating with other companies and suppliers throughout the supply chain. This very valuable tool is available on the ACSGCI website (https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/research-innovation/tools-forgreen-chemistry.html ).

LCA quantifies the environmental impacts of a product or manufacturing process and also identifies the environmental ‘hotspots’ and opportunities for rendering the process more sustainable. As indicated in Table 1 leading chemical and pharma companies have developed their own tools for life cycle assessment of their products and manufacturing processes and expect such data from their suppliers throughout their supply chain. For example pharma products are delivered to consumers in a wide range of materials including plastics. Although plastics have provided safe delivery of pharma products to the market their persistence in the environment is a major concern. Search for biodegradable materials for safe delivery of pharma products has been underway for a few decades. The desired materials should meet a complex set of specification in addition to biodegradability and the search for biodegradable plastics to replace existing products continues. At the same time major efforts are directed at recycling waste plastics into economically viable valuable products. For either case it is necessary to apply cradle to cradle (CtC) life cycle assessment to better understand the environmental footprints and overall sustainability of these products.

In 2005 the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies released a report detailing eight grand challenges that must be addressed to secure a long term sustainable future; and the broad concept of sustainability has caught the attention of many leaders in the scientific engineering industrial and regulatory communities. Sustainability education which was called out as one of the eight grand challenges in the 2006 National Academies report is of paramount importance to instilling ‘life-cycle thinking” into product and process design and development. Examples of how one might implement sustainability within science and engineering curricula are beginning to emerge. In 2009 Murphy et.al. reported the results of their benchmarking studies on the incorporation of principles of green engineering into engineering curricula across the US. Allen and Shonnard provided a perspective on the knowledge base required for chemical engineering education. As the American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute (ACS GCI) Roadmap vision statement aptly pointed out “the practice of chemistry should change from chemistry focused on academic and economic value with minimal regard for environmental safety or health impacts; to process and product design to minimize adverse environmental health and safety impacts while enhancing desired performance throughout the product life cycle.” To continue to grow and support our economy the chemical enterprise needs an agile flexible workforce that thinks ‘systems and sustainability’.

Quite simply global regulations require businesses/ industries to adopt practices that support a circular economy. In a 2016 briefing the European Parliamentary Research Service discussed “opportunities and challenges” for moving towards a circular economy. One of the four identified challenges was the need for technical skills “which are currently not present in the workforce”; namely skills for scientists and engineers that would enable them to design products with circularity in mind. It emphasises that the lack of such skills would be particularly problematic for scientists mathematicians and engineers. Thus the roles and responsibilities of chemists chemical engineers and materials scientists and engineers extend not only to the life of products in the market but importantly to the “end of life” and environmental fate of those products.

Motivated by the recognised societal need for the design and development of sustainable chemical pharmaceutical and materials technologies coupled with the need for scientists and engineers to be educated in life cycle thinking we developed a course entitled “Fundamentals & Challenges of a Sustainable Chemical Enterprise”. It was first introduced in Spring 2015 at the Chemical Engineering Department of Louisiana State University and since 2017 at the School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In 2018 this course was added to the Professional Masters in Manufacturing Leadership program at Georgia Institute of Technology which is offered to industry professionals as an emerging process in chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

The new Samsung PM1731a SSD is a ZNS or Zoned Namespace SSD. The promise of ZNS is the ability to maximize endurance while removing the need for overprovisioning.

Samsung PM1731a ZNS SSD

The Samsung PM1731a ZNS SSD utilizes QLC NAND. This is actually a major feature since it lowers the cost per GB stored. The initial capacities will be in 2TB and 4TB form factors. This continues a trend toward larger minimum capacities for SSDs. Even 960GB-1TB models are going to start coming under pressure soon outside of markets such as boot devices.

ZNS standards actually started with the SMR hard drive models that were the topic of WD Red SMR vs CMR Tested Avoid Red SMR. The model allows a SSD to be partitioned into “zones.” Then each zone is sequentially written. As a result the SSD’s controller does not have to manage random writes which can involve copying data to memory erasing blocks and then re-distributing data often.

The impact of ZNS is that the technology can handle higher queue depth writes without having to re-order writes on the SSD for efficient placement on NAND. The overall solution by sequentially writing data instead of having to re-place data in cells means that write amplification is minimized in the SSDs. Unlike HDD host-managed SMR technology read access is easier since the device is still a SSD rather than rotating media.

As one may infer there is certainly a software lift to make this work but the industry is getting behind it since vendors claim about a 3-4x reduction in write amplification while increasing capacity and lowering the need for onboard DRAM capacity.

Final Words

Samsung says it plans to go into mass production with the PM1731a ZNS SSD in the second half of 2021. The company has recently been pre-announcing products well ahead of actual availability. As an example the recent Samsung CXL Memory Expander with DDR5 Launched well before systems could support such a product. This seems to be a trend. Still with the recent NVMe 2.0 spec ZNS SSD support is coming to the market and Samsung is getting ahead of that trend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYWJsb29tcy5jb20vbmV3cy1kZXRhaWxzL04vNzI3NzEvamFtbXUtYW5kLWthc2htaXItbml0LXNyaW5hZ2FyLWhvc3RzLXZpcnR1YWwtbGVjdHVyZS1vbi1yb2xlLW9mLWRhdGEtYW5hbHl0aWNzLWluLW1hcmtldGluZy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jammu and Kashmir: NIT Srinagar hosts virtual lecture on 'Role of data analytics in marketing' | Indiablooms - First ...,"Srinagar: Department of Humanities Social Science and Management (HSS &M) National Institute of Technology (NIT) Srinagar on Friday organised virtual lecture on ‘Role of data analytics in marketing’ and it was hosted by Khalid Wani Director Western Digital (WD) leading global data storage brand in India.

Last June social media feeds became flooded with corporate statements about how companies would promote racial equity within and beyond their workforce. The commitments came after the police murder of George Floyd sparked protests around the country. One year after those initial statements many tech companies seem to have met several of their initial goals while promising to expand their commitments to diversity and inclusion efforts and racial justice causes. Here's how some of tech's biggest players stacked up:

The company also said that by the end of 2021 20% of its board of directors and executive team collectively would be made up of people of color. By the end of 2025 Airbnb said its goal is to have 20% of U.S. employees be underrepresented minorities and for 50% of global employees who identify in the gender binary to be women. Airbnb also said each member of its executive team would create and share a detailed plan to meet those goals with their teams. 2021 progress: Airbnb said it's donated $1 million over the last year to organizations including its $500000 commitment to the NAACP and the Black Lives Matter Foundation.

Example video title will go here for this video

MINNEAPOLIS — With all of these record-breaking hot temperatures we checked in with air conditioning technicians and the folks at Xcel Energy on the best way to hold onto our cool air without running up a high electric bill.

As it turns out there are many practical tips that will keep you from overworking your AC system during the heat wave and save you money in the long run.

Closing drapes and blinds during the heat of the day

Opening interior doors to improve the circulation of cool air inside

Using ceiling fans to help circulate cool air through the home

Using a whole-house or attic fan to draw in cool nighttime air and push out hot air during the day

Changing air conditioning filters

Installing a programmable thermostat that raises the setting when the house is empty and lowers it to a comfortable level when everyone comes home

John Marshall of Xcel Energy also recommended against using major household appliances during the hottest part of the day both because of the heat they generate and the energy load.

""If you have appliances – dishwasher washing machine dryer -- only run them with full loads and run them at night when that heat has dissipated"" Marshall told KARE.

He said those who don't have a smart thermostat yet should aim for the mid 70's on their traditional thermostats or higher if they can tolerate the heat. For a full list of tips and information on rebates available for adopting energy efficient technology go to this page on Xcel Energy's website.

Marshall said that Xcel is ready for the heat wave.

""We’re prepared to keep energy flowing to those customers throughout the heat wave again these are the times of year we prepare for – we ramp up crews prepare for any storms that might roll in that we’re not forecasting"" Marshall said.

He said there may be spot outages but not necessarily caused by peak demand for electricity. Customers can use the website or smart phone apps to report outages and see the map of outages in their area.

Tyler Unger of Genz-Ryan also strongly recommended cleaning the outer fins on air conditioning condensers to keep them working at peak efficiency. It's especially important during this time of year in the Midwest when cottonwood tree seeds are drifting through the air and getting into those outdoor units.

""The fins on the outside are the outside filter essentially. So keeping that clean will help you to remove more heat from the home"" Unger told KARE.

""Remember air conditioning isn't adding cool air as much as it's removing hot air and humidity.""

Some people use vacuum cleaners to pull out the debris but Unger personally prefers washing it with a hose without using too much force.

Those of us who grew up with window unit air conditioners also can recall cleaning the fins in those as well. Again the concept is to clean off the dirt and seeds using a minimal amount of force so the fins aren't smashed down.

As far as the indoor filters go Unger recommends pleated paper ones. He said it's important that you don't use one that's so sophisticated at trapping particles that it keeps air from making it through the ducts.

""Air flow is one of the biggest names of the game. Some people can get too restrictive of a filter and it’s like putting a piece of plywood in there – it’s not going to pull in the air through it’s going to kill your fan"" Unger explained.

""The other end of the spectrum is people get the filter they can see right through and well now it’s not stopping anything.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpbmtsaXZlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvd2h5LXRoaXMtdGltZS1mZWVscy1kaWZmZXJlbnQtdGhpcy1pc250LXlvdXItb2xkLW1pbm5lc290YS13aWxkLXRlYW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why this time feels different: 'This isn't your old Minnesota Wild team',"In a perfect world for the Wild they would be battling the Colorado Avalanche in the second round of the NHL playoffs right now not talking about this season in the past tense.

After a round of exit interviews earlier this week Wild players and coaches have gone their separate ways with their offseason in full swing much sooner than they expected.

Perhaps coach Dean Evason put it best. While the Wild should feel a lot of pride in what they accomplished this season they should also be feeling immense disappointment that they are watching the rest of the playoffs from the discomfort of their couch.

After finishing 35-16-5 in the regular season third in the West division the Wild lost in seven games to Vegas in the opening round of the playoffs.

“Every season when we go in our goal is to win the Stanley Cup so in that sense it was a failure” Evason said. “But we had a good regular season and we can build on that. We are looking forward to that next season.”

If it feels different heading into this offseason from a fan’s perspective just know the Wild are feeling that too. There’s an overarching sense of optimism surrounding this core and its potential to become a legitimate Stanley Cup contender in the future.

With star rookie Kirill Kaprizov leading the way and other highly skilled players taking the next step the Wild established themselves among the most exciting teams in the league this season. Let’s just say the high-octane offense is nothing like the Jacques Lemaire-coached teams of the past that used to win by lulling opponents to sleep.

“It’s felt different” defenseman Matt Dumba said. “’This isn’t your old Minnesota Wild team.”

That has to be music to the ears of general manager Bill Guerin. He has been trying to change the culture of the franchise ever since he took over 22 months ago and he finally started to see the fruits of his labor this season.

Just look at the way the Wild battled tooth and nail with the Golden Knights in the playoffs. After falling behind 3-1 in the series the Wild battled back to tie the series with back-to-back victories before ultimately running out of gas in Game 7.

“If we’re going to go out that’s the way to go out” Guerin said. “I’m proud of our players and I’m proud of our coaching staff. I feel like there’s a lot of buzz in the market for our team and for good reason.”

Though the Wild would have loved to make a deeper run at the Stanley Cup this season that seemed like a long shot. This was always going to be a transitional year for the Wild and they exceeded expectations every step of the way.

Whether it was Kaprizov taking the league by storm dynamic winger Kevin Fiala continuing his ascension two-way center Joel Eriksson Ek taking a gigantic leap or various other players stepping up the Wild have a lot to feel good about moving forward.

“I think the steps that our players took as individuals and the steps that we took as a team were big” Guerin said. “The process that we’re going through to try to build a championship team is good. I really do feel that we took steps in the regular season. And in the playoffs. It was disappointing to go out in the first round but the signs I see in my seat as a general manager were positive.”

Maybe the biggest step forward for the Wild came off the ice. There was a close-knit vibe in the locker room this season with captain Jared Spurgeon in charge. While playing in the middle of a pandemic could have pulled the team apart Spurgeon made sure it brought the team together.

“Just being happy for each other and supporting each other is a big thing” Spurgeon said. “Everyone was happy for each other whether they were scoring goals making plays or getting that recognition. I think that’s huge.”

Added Fiala: “I feel that our team is like a family. There’s something special in this team. Everybody wants to win and wants to do everything for each other. We had some up and downs all season but we always stuck together. That’s why I love this team.”

What’s the next step for the Wild?

“We just need to continue to grow” Evason said. “We’ve seen the individual growth in so many players. That just has to continue to get better and better. The way we played as a group and as a team on a nightly basis with a team-first mentality was very exciting to us as a coaching staff and as a franchise. We just want to continue to build on that.”

As for Guerin while he admitted the Wild are maybe a little further along than he expected at this point he isn’t satisfied with where they are.

“It’s going in the right direction” Guerin said. “Can I say we’re ahead of schedule? Not really because we got knocked out in the first round and that’s not good enough. There are some signs from this team that I’m extremely happy with. We made some really good steps this year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNrb3Jub3J0aC5jb20vd2lsZC1jYXB0YWluLWphcmVkLXNwdXJnZW9uLW5hbWVkLWEtZmluYWxpc3QtZm9yLWxhZHktYnluZy1hd2FyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wild captain Jared Spurgeon named a finalist for Lady Byng award – SKOR North,"May 20 2021; Saint Paul Minnesota USA; Minnesota Wild defenseman Jared Spurgeon (46) looks on during the third period in game three of the first round of the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs against the Vegas Golden Knights at Xcel Energy Center.

Jared Spurgeon became only the second player in Wild history to be named a finalist for the Lady Byng award when it was announced Saturday that the Minnesota defenseman Toronto center Auston Matthews and Carolina defenseman Jaccob Slavin were up for the honor that goes to the player judged to have shown sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.

Former Wild forward Mikael Granlund finished third in the voting in 2016-17.

Spurgeon who is listed at 5-9 167 pounds had seven goals and 25 points in 54 games this season and three assists in seven playoff games. His 18 assists and points led Wild defensemen. Spurgeon who was named the Wild captain before the season led the team in blocked shots (102) was third in power-play points (nine) and fourth in shots (94). Spurgeon only took six minutes in penalties during the season.

Matthews who was second in Lady Byng voting last season led the NHL with 41 goals in 52 games and was called for 10 minutes in penalties. Slavin took only one minor penalty all season in 52 games and that was for flipping the puck over the glass. He had three goals and 12 assists.

Just being a finalist is an accomplishment for Spurgeon and Slavin.

The Lady Byng has been won by one defenseman since 1954 — Brian Campbell of the Florida Panthers in 2012. Three other defenseman Campbell Brian Leetch and Nicklas Lidstrom have been named finalists for the honor in the past 65 years.

Spurgeon joins Kirill Kaprizov as Wild players nominated for NHL awards this week. Kaprizov is a finalist for the Calder Trophy which goes to the league’s rookie of the year. The winner of the awards will be revealed during the Stanley Cup semifinals and Stanley Cup Final with exact dates format and times to be announced.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vam91cm5hbG9mbXVzaWMuY29tL2xpc3RpbmcvMDUtMDYtMjEvYmlsbGllLWVpbGlzaC1zbW9vdGhpZS1raW5nLWNlbnRlci1uZXctb3JsZWFucy1sYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billie Eilish @ Smoothie King Center New Orleans LA,"Following the release of her latest single ‘Your Power’ and ahead of the July 30 release of her forthcoming album ‘Happier Than Ever’ Darkroom/Interscope Records artist Billie Eilish has announced the first leg of her Happier Than Ever The World Tour set to commence in February 2022.

The tech is based on an acquisition McDonald’s made in 2019 of voice-tech company Apprente. Through it intelligent systems rather than human beings take the drive-thru customer’s order and send it to the kitchen for fulfillment. At an investor conference last week McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said the company is seeing 85 percent accuracy on orders with only about 20 percent of orders across the 10 stores requiring human intervention.

While Kempczinski is confident we’ll see voice-ordering at all McDonald’s drive-thrus in the next five years he added that consumers shouldn’t expect to see it widespread as soon as next year. “There is a big leap between going from 10 restaurants in Chicago to 14000 restaurants across the U.S. with an infinite number of promo permutations menu permutations dialect permutations weather — I mean on and on and on and on” he said at the conference.

Separate from the technical feats the system must accomplish there is also a huge number of franchisees to consider in the process of a wide-scale implementation. There are currently 38000 McDonald’s operating across roughly 115 countries. The majority — 93 percent — are franchisees. Getting them onboard may be no small feat either.

Disputes over technology have created tension between McDonald’s and its franchisees for years now — going all the way back to when some franchisees argued against having to offer Uber Eats to customers. The latest disagreement between the two groups concerns a $423-per-month fee corporate has been charging franchisees to cover a $70 million lag in outstanding technology fees. The National Owners Association (NOA) a group of McDonald’s franchises that formed a few years back has gone as far as suggesting it create a technology cooperative to give owners more control over technology-related decisions. Ernst & Young is currently conducting a third-party audit of the fees in question.

All of which is to say now may not be a great time to attempt a major rollout of what will probably be a costly system. How costly voice ordering will be for franchisees is unclear just yet but it would presumably require setup and maintenance costs at the very least. And as we saw with McDonald’s Dynamic Yield acquisition implementation and eventual downgrade not all new tech brings a justifiable amount of return on investment for franchisees.

Labor also presents some urgent items to consider.

While automating drive-thru ordering via a system like Apprente’s could aid in the current struggle against the current labor shortage franchisees will still have to spend time and money training their employees to use the tech and work alongside it. In many cases that means training them to learn when to not get involved.

At the investor conference Kempczinski said one learning from the existing 10 implementations of the new tech was training crew to “not want to jump in” as soon as there is a question or pause from the system. “We’ve had to do a little bit of training of ‘just keep your hands off the steering wheel let the computer do its work’” he told investors adding that it took time for crew members to learn to “trust” the technology.

While McDonald’s hasn’t officially confirmed this it’s likely franchisees would be in charge of training for the above. That in turn would mean operators and manages must first get comfortable with the tech themselves. And given the high rate of turnover in QSRs this could potentially eat up a lot of time if a manager were continually having to train new hires.

Many see the digitization of the drive-thru as essential. The drive-thru lane has become progressively slower over the years. The pandemic didn’t help that latter point since lockdowns turned the drive-thru into one of the main order channels for restaurants making overall wait times even longer. Other QSRs including Chipotle KFC and Burger King have all announced plans to make their drive-thrus more high tech to speed up wait times and improve order accuracy. Clearly McDonald’s needs to compete. This time around though it also needs to make sure it thoroughly considers its franchisees’ needs in the process.
