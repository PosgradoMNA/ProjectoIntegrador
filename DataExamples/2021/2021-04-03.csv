3M will pay $12.5 million toward building and operating a new treatment facility to remove chemicals known as PFAS or per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances.

The city discovered elevated levels of PFAS in its wells in 2016. It’s believed that the source of the contamination was firefighting foam used during training at the regional airport which is located near the wells.

3M manufactured PFAS used in aqueous film-forming foam used for suppressing fires for decades.

PFAS is a broad category of man-made compounds sometimes known as “forever chemicals” because of their tendency not to break down in the environment. Some PFAS have been linked to negative health effects including low birth weight kidney and thyroid problems and some cancers.

The agreement was a “long time coming” city manager Nate Mathews said. He said there was a lot of anxiety in the community when the PFAS were discovered.

""I think people in Bemidji are feeling a good sense of relief that we addressed the issue” Mathews said. “It was a big complicated project and a long long process and it's good to get some conclusion to that.""

The city started the first phase of the $16 million project last year and it’s expected to be online within the next couple of weeks Mathews said. It will use granular activated carbon to capture and remove PFAS from the water supply.

Construction on the second phase which will allow the city to treat more water will start this summer or fall and take about two years to construct.

Bemidji also received about $10.1 million state bonding money last year for the project.

Cities across the United States are dealing with similar contamination from firefighting foam or other sources of PFAS including industrial plants and landfills.

In 2018 3M agreed to pay the state of Minnesota $850 million over PFAS contamination in the east Twin Cities metro area.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwMzg3MTY2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Elizabeth 'Lanny' Stratton,"Stratton Elizabeth ""Lanny"" set aside her knitting needles Tuesday March 16 2021 in Stillwater MN after more than 76 marvelous years.

I’m a math teacher who loves baseball and although the games aren’t played on paper I always like to dive into the schedule to see the lay of the land for the Twins season. I’ve taken the Las Vegas total win over/under for each of the Twins opponents and converted it into a winning percentage. I then used that data to analyze many different splits throughout the season. This is my third year doing such an activity although last year's exercises ended up being pretty meaningless and like I’ve done in the past I’ll give a quick synopsis of how each month looks.

April (11 home 15 away 4 off)

Although they will spend half the month on the road from a project opponent win percentage perspective the Twins should end up looking pretty by the end of April. Their projected opponent win percentage is 47.46% and have 10 games against the Tigers Mariners Pirates and Royals who are all projected for less than 74 wins on the year. Heck outside of the opening series against the Brewers the other 13 games are against teams who are expected to hover around .500 for the year. Although it’s only April it will be important the Twins end the month above .500 as the White Sox have an even easier start to the season based on projections.

May (18 home 10 away 3 off)

The Twins are fortunate their busiest month of the year is also the month they will spend the most time at home AND has the lowest projected winning percentage. Again it will still be considered early but it will be vitally important that the Twins beat up on Royals (5 gms) Rangers (4 gms) Tigers (3 gms) and Orioles (4 gms) at the beginning and end of the month. The middle of the month will feature their first tough stretch of the year with nine consecutive games against the Athletics and White Sox. Similarly the White Sox start and end May against weaker teams but they have their own tough stretch in the middle with games against the Twins (6 gms) Yankees (3 gms) and Cardinals (3 gms). This is a really good opportunity for the Twins to put get an early lead on the division over the White Sox especially facing them six times in the month.

June (12 home 15 away 3 off)

As the weather starts to warm up so does the Twins schedule who will face the Yankees (3 gms) Astros (3 gms) and White Sox (3 gms) who are all teams favored to win their respective divisions. This is where we will get our first real glimpse of how we stack up against teams that we could end up facing in the playoffs although we are fortunate to be the home team for six out of those nine games. Outside of that we’ll have the opportunity to beat up on the Orioles (2 gms) Royals (4 gms) Rangers (3 gms) and Mariners (3 gms) again while seeing the Reds for the first time. The White Sox will also have their hands full with games against the Blue Jays Rays Astros and Twins.

July (14 home 12 away 5 off) and August (13 home 14 away 4 off)

You’ll see why I grouped these two months together. The Twins will enter the All-Star Break with a projected opponent winning percentage of 47.97% which would be the equivalent of a record of about 48-44 record. Compare that to after the All-Star break where the Twins projected opponent win percentage is 50.65%.

After the All-Star break the Twins will face the toughest stretch of their schedule aside from six games against the Tigers. This stretch will take us through the end of August where the Twins will have a thirty game stretch of facing teams who are projected to finish the season above .500. This includes finishing their season series with six games against the White Sox three games at Busch Stadium three games at Yankee Stadium and hosting the Rays and Brewers for three games apiece. It also includes the longest road trip and homestand off the season which are nine games apiece back-to-back.

The timing of this stretch of games will be interesting as the Twins should have an even better idea of how they stack up against the best teams in baseball as the trade deadline comes and goes although their schedule for the two months after the deadline is tougher than any other two month stretch they face. The White Sox schedule for these two months isn’t quite as tough as the Twins which is why it will be important for the Twins to build an early division lead. Let's hope the Twins get some rest over the break are healthy and can finish around .500 during July and August.

September/October (13 home 15 away 5 off)

After a grueling stretch the Twins won’t get much of a reprieve with games against the Rays (3) and Blue Jays (6) but they also get to face the Royals and Tigers a combined nine times including the last six games of the season. Remember rosters no longer expand on september 1st so even games against the Indians (6) and Cubs (3) which may typically feature multiple prospects getting their first cup of coffee in the bigs aren’t going to be quite so simple. Meanwhile the White Sox toughest competition will be three games apiece against the A’s and Angels in the middle of the month. At this point Twins fans may decide to look back to April and May to see the importance of those early season games as the season comes to an end.

I didn’t do a deep dive on the White Sox schedule like I did with the Twins but just at a quick glance their schedule is a little easier in the sense that their tough games are more spread out throughout the season. Of course teams from the same division play the same schedule but that thirty game stretch between July and August is going to be brutal for the Twins. Keep that in mind as we try and minimize the importance of games in April and May!

People with diabetes could be seeing a turning point in ease of obtaining supplies for continuous glucose monitors as more of these products make their way into local pharmacies. While CGMs have traditionally only been available direct from the manufacturer or third-party supply distributors they’re now finally making their way onto the shelves of local pharmacies and even Costco stores around the country. For example the Dexcom G6 receivers transmitters and sensors are sold at discounted prices in Costco Pharmacies for the bulk chain’s member customers. Opinions may vary on just how good those discounts are but another big benefit for customers is that instead of waiting weeks for supplies to arrive in the mail you may be able to walk out the door of your local pharmacy in a day or two with everything you need. Along with Dexcom the Abbott FreeStyle Libre system supplies are also available at pharmacies and CGM maker Medtronic Diabetes is exploring pharmacy availability too. The takeaway is that lower-cost and more readily accessible purchase options are a must for any company wanting to succeed in the growing CGM market — that’s set to expand broadly to consumers even beyond those with diabetes.

How much do CGMs cost at the pharmacy? As always insurance coverage varies by type so the cost to each individual will depend on whether one even has pharmacy coverage for CGMs and what copays or deductibles may apply. To keep it simple here are the retail cash prices of the two systems currently available in pharmacies: Dexcom Users are thrilled to see the leading CGM on the market becoming more ubiquitously available. At local pharmacies: Around the United States in CVS Walgreens and many other retailers cash prices vary but most locations we queried quoted the price for a G6 transmitter at just under $300 while a three-pack box of G6 sensors runs ~$400. Remember too: Insurance may cover CGM supplies as a pharmacy benefit meaning you could find these available at local or mail-order pharmacies for a flat copay or with varying coinsurance and deductible amounts applied. At Costco: To get the Costco pricing you of course need to be a Costco member ($60) and also sign up for their free pharmacy program. As of April 2021 the Costco Pharmacy membership cash prices are as follows based on the latest company info online: G6 transmitter: $277.62 each (or membership discount price: $132.24)

Box of G6 sensors (three pack): $384.60 (or $303.74 membership discount price)

G6 receiver: $417.92 each (or $203.29 membership discount price) Note that you may see online search results showing varying price points based on an older Costco Pharmacy deal. That earlier discount was dramatically lower: a G6 transmitter only cost $28.88 and a G6 touchscreen receiver cost $35.96! Since Costco discount prices are periodically adjusted be sure to check in advance of driving to the store to purchase. These Costco prices are self-pay only as insurance isn’t applicable there (also not Medicare or Medicaid). So for anyone who may have a lower insurance copay or deductible requirement they may be better off sticking with their traditional purchase channels. Share on Pinterest Photo: DiabetesMine Caution: Unfortunately lots of patients and even many Costco pharmacy folks are unaware of this savings program. So if asked Costco employees may quote much higher prices up to $1100 for a single box of sensors — ugh! We’re also hearing that some Costco pharmacists have been insisting that they must check insurance and that this G6 discount only applies if you’ve already been denied insurance coverage which is NOT TRUE as we have confirmed with Costco corporate contacts. Be sure to be insistent if you encounter this barrier. Freestyle Libre The Abbott Freestyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) system is not (yet) what many consider to be a full-featured CGM with real-time glucose alerts for High and Low readings but it does qualify as a continuous sensor and is growing in popularity. This system has been available through national pharmacies like Costco CVS Kroger Walgreens and Rite Aid since it launched in late 2017. Senior public affairs manager Jennifer Heth at Abbott tells us that a majority of their 500000 users in the United States are already getting their Libre 14-day-wear sensors through retail pharmacies. Notably Abbott says the Libre costs 70 percent less than the list price of other CGM systems currently available. Here are the approximate prices for the Libre system in pharmacies: List price of $54 per sensor according to Abbott (though retail pharmacies like Costco and Walgreens quote prices of $58–69)

With commercial insurance most patients pay between $10 and $75 per month for Libre 14-day sensors at participating pharmacies

Handheld reader: $70 (though the separate receiver isn’t required as users can opt to use the FreeStyle LibreLink mobile app for iOS or Android for no charge) Abbott tells us that building out their pharmacy purchase channel is an “area of focus” for the company that started in 2020. “Pharmacists play a central role in patient care and are valued for their impact on improving outcomes for people living with diabetes” Heth says. “Abbott is dedicated to providing education on the rapidly evolving diabetes technology… Abbott has provided educational grant support for pharmacist continuing education programs with the American Pharmacists Association Pharmacy Times among others.” Heth also tells us that in addition to national and online programs Abbott provides live peer-to-peer training sessions for pharmacists and webinars on the clinical application of FreeStyle Libre and CGM report interpretation using the Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) a standardized one-page report that visually summarizes glucose trend data. Medtronic and Eversense CGMs: Not in pharmacies Sorry friends. Medtronic confirms that it will be a while before their CGM supplies hit the pharmacy channel. Spokeswoman Pam Reese director of global communications for Medtronic Diabetes tells us: “We are currently exploring pharmacy options for our CGM. We have some pharmacy access already and are continuing to build our own internal pharmacy operations. In addition we are exploring a retail pharmacy strategy.” It makes sense that the fourth CGM sensor on the market the implantable Eversense from Senseonics would not be available in pharmacies. This sensor must be implanted under the skin via a minimal surgical incision procedure by a qualified doctor. Still we asked the company about any plans to sell supplies (replacement transmitters or charging cords) in pharmacies. Senseonics’ director of global PR and brand marketing Karen Hynes says no explaining: “If Eversense is covered under someone’s pharmacy benefit it would be mail ordered and shipped directly to the healthcare provider who is placing the sensor. Otherwise it would go through the DME (durable medical equipment) channel and would be shipped to the healthcare provider.”

Why is CGM access in pharmacies taking so long? The effort to make CGM supplies more readily available for retail purchase began back in 2015 when a half-dozen or more insurance plans began covering CGM supplies in a different way than they traditionally had. They recategorized these devices as a “pharmacy benefit” rather than the traditional classification as “durable medical equipment” (DME). This meant people with certain plans would no longer be bound to buying supplies from designated third-party medical equipment suppliers or directly from the manufacturer but rather could purchase them wherever medications are sold. Anthem and UnitedHealthcare (UHC) were among the big insurance carriers taking that important first step toward eventual over-the-counter access to CGM supplies in local pharmacy chains like CVS or Walgreens. Other insurers have moved in this direction over time. Even with some insurers now classifying CGM as a pharmacy benefit it remains a “Your Insurance Coverage May Vary” situation in terms of how much any individual might pay for supplies — some plans require only a low fixed copay applied to all pharmacy benefit items while others require coinsurance where you pay a percentage of the actual cost of the item. Still other plans require that you meet an annual deductible before any copay or coinsurance kicks in. It all varies. Currently most CGM users are still purchasing their supplies from designated third-party medical equipment vendors or directly from the manufacturer. Per Dexcom’s talking points pharmacy distribution allows for “a more seamless experience for physicians and patients changing the once eight-step month-long distribution process into four simple steps that enable a patient to get their Dexcom device in as few as 1–2 days through their pharmacist.” When Dexcom began planning for pharmacy availability several years ago (during the early G5 model days) it pushed for access by mail-order as well as in retail pharmacies — including “drop shipments” of orders prepared for pickup 24 hours in advance. Presumably that “just in time” shipping policy was meant to avoid pharmacies stockpiling expired sensors that they can’t sell or running out of supplies. Going into 2020 Dexcom is pushing for an increase in its CGM business going through pharmacy channels by as much as 70 percent of their sensor business to be exact. After 2019 the CGM manufacturer says it has now crossed the threshold of supplying more than 50 percent of its CGM supplies through pharmacies.

Walgreens makes CGM history Walgreens made headlines in 2019 with its pharmacy expansion for the Dexcom G6 especially for Medicare beneficiaries who can now obtain their CGM supplies within that local pharmacy. Many Dexcom customers who use Walgreens have also started receiving automated emails and messages about syncing pharmacy and CGM accounts for more efficiency. In fact Walgreens’ Find Care marketplace introduced a program in 2019 in which interested people with diabetes can proactively request a prescription for the Dexcom G6. They simply complete a questionnaire that is sent to their healthcare provider for review and potential prescription. No doubt as the next-generation Dexcom-Verily G7 product (designed to be more consumer friendly fully disposable and lower cost) moves forward and launches in 2021 we will see more big pharmacy chains adding CGM tech to their shelves. Still overall use of CGMs among people with type 1 diabetes remains low at about 35 percent. This is attributed in part to provider reluctance to prescribe the system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbHRhLW9wdGltaXN0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbW11bml0eS1jb21tZW50LXRoZS1wcm9ibGVtLWlzbnQtdGhlLXR1bm5lbC1pdHMtdGhlLXRyYWZmaWMtMzU5NDg3ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Community Comment: The problem isn't the tunnel it's the traffic,"I have to share the sentiment of my colleague Ingrid Abbott; driving through the tunnel is like driving onto a television set lights fully ablaze.

I have to share the sentiment of my colleague Ingrid Abbott; driving through the tunnel is like driving onto a television set lights fully ablaze.

Something is better than nothing and that’s a whole lot of something especially early in the morning. Who needs coffee when the bright lights of our beloved commute shine through? Does this signal the delay of an upgraded crossing? Time will tell.

If the pandemic has a silver lining it’s less traffic but that won’t last forever. The tunnel was a bottleneck of epic proportions and needs to be addressed. Eventually the traffic will return.

I dread the day they start construction of anything around that section of road. It is going to be a gong show. Just like the challenges commuters faced when the new Port Mann Bridge was built. Take the worst crossing and throw in more delays. Wonderful.

But does twinning or replacing the tunnel with a bridge solve the problem? I guess it all depends on what you define the problem being.

If you see the problem as the tunnel being too old and needing to be replaced then replace it…and deal with the short-term outcome of immense traffic tie-ups as it is being constructed…unless you can still work from home.

But if you see the problem being not enough capacity to get people across the Fraser River then go about solving that problem which may or may not include work around the tunnel.

The real problem is a single accident paralyses traffic in Richmond and Delta because we have limited crossings. If we are serious about solving that problem then another crossing is the solution.

Connect it to Highway 17 over the river to Richmond and the East-West Connector and continue on to Boundary Road. Build it without impacting traffic open it when it’s done. No traffic tie-up no more arguing about too many cars heading to the Oak Street Bridge. Probably cheaper than renovating as anyone who renovates a house knows and a blessed new option should one route be impacted not just to Delta but to Richmond as well. Free up some space on the Knight and Oak bridges while you’re at it.

It’s not a new idea Vicki Huntington our former MLA suggested this in 2019 but felt the politicians in Vancouver Richmond and Burnaby wouldn’t like it.

For anyone who has used Highway 17 to meet up with Highway 1 or get to the Patullo the SFPR has been a godsend. It was built with little disruption. It was wonderful.

The problem isn’t the tunnel. The problem is the lack of ability to get across the river efficiently. That’s the problem that needs solving.

You come from a humble background and you used to farm as a boy. How was life going to farm in those days?

Then it was not fun because I thought I was doing too much. Every child actually wants to relax and play by staying at home and not going to farm. But again that was the kind of training that became useful for us till today. At that time we never saw it as fun but hard life. But again looking back now it now turned to fun. During the holidays we would go and live in the farm because we could not afford leaving home for the farm every day. So during the long holiday we stayed in the farm eating fresh food pounded yam; there was no food rationing. This is just to let you know that farm then was not dangerous; as young as I was I could go to the farm alone and come back alone without any problem.

Can you remember some pranks played during those days on the farm?

Yes I did play some pranks. You’ve got to tell lies to get yourself out of some troubles. I think there was one that my young nephew and I played. We were going to the farm that day and we went to go and look at something. So that made us to get to the farm later than our father did. So we had to play a prank. I told him to pretend as if he was having stomach ache (laughs) and for this he did not work in the farm. I had to do both his work and mine (laughs).

There was discipline then unlike now that you cannot beat your children. Then for punishment one could get a slap beaten with a stick on the back and the flat side of the cutlass. Looking back now those are the kinds of things that put us in check and prepared us for who we are today.

How?

Those things have helped me to appreciate the grace of God for whatever I have today. When we were growing up then I could count six months or more that one cannot even ride in a car; but now I ride a car every day. Then one was always singing to the plane whenever one saw it in the sky. But today I have travelled to so many countries. So it reminds one of the good old days. I also recall that we would eat plenty eba without meat. But now I am served with several pieces of meat daily. So it allows one to appreciate where one is coming from because it was not rosy though we were not the poorest of the poor.

Really?

Yes. It was not rosy but despite that it was not difficult for me to pay school fees because I was the last born of the family and my siblings and others were all working. So they suffered for their period. At my own time I did not experience such. By the time I got to the university it was pleasant because I could call any of them for my needs. I think I used to be more brilliant than now. From my primary three onwards and even at the university I don’t think my position had gone below first position despite the fact that I came from the village. I think I was the second best student overall in my department and even in my faculty. This was borne out of the fact that you cannot be lazy with my father because he was hardworking and so it is expected of you to be hardworking too.

Your dad must be tough then.

Ah yes. He was a disciplinarian. I still remember the day I was leaving home on February 6 1994 to join my uncle in Minna. There was an offence I had committed and he was already growing old then. So he could not beat as much as before but he made sure I was punished for that offence. So when my brother who used to discipline us came he told him ‘this guy is traveling but there is one offence he has committed and I want him to be beaten for it.’ So I was beaten to the extent that I still have the scar on my body. So would I call that wickedness? No because that prepared me.

What exactly did you do?

I think I was rude to an elderly man. So he thought I should not have done that. And again that prepared me that I should never be rude to anyone. Then even after my secondary school education in 1993 I could not have a girlfriend because there was no way I could bring a girl home. Which house do you want to bring her to? I was so sure me and that girlfriend would be beaten blue black (laughs). So this gives us a kind of discipline in the world where there is immorality now. It allows one to self-discipline.

Was it difficult meeting your wife because of your low social life?

Well it didn’t affect me. Yes growing up in a remote village affected my social life but attending secondary school and mixing with other people upgraded my social life. However I had a standard in marrying my wife. I did not want to marry someone who is too flashy and flamboyant. So one of the things that made me to marry my wife is the simplicity even though she is very beautiful. Everything about her was natural. I just like people being natural.

How did you meet her?

I met my wife through a younger friend Michael in Ibadan. So after my universi ty days my uncle moved to Ibadan and I also followed him since we were living together in Minna. She was undergoing a computer training course with Michael. One day Michael told me that he had one beautiful young girl in that training school that he would love me to meet so that he could learn from me as he didn’t know how to ‘toast’ a woman (laughs). So I said okay let us go there so that you can learn from me how to woo a lady (laughs). So when I got there I told him I actually love this woman. And again one thing led to the other. I toasted her in front of him but she did not agree. But we became friends for six years.

Question: Really? For six years?

Yeah. Then we were sending e-mails to each other. I was in Abuja while she was in Ibadan. So we used to communicate by e-mails. Then again she came from a very good Christian family. So these were some of the things that got me interested. And it was not easy because I remember when she said yes to me she told me I needed to meet her dad. Meeting her dad was another story because he was a disciplinarian. So I had to do an interview just as you are interviewing me now. I did an interview for three hours. After about a week he told me I passed the interview (laughs).

Was there anything she complained to you about?

There are lots of things my wife used to complain about when we first got married. But now she is used to some because of my work. For instance when we first got married I was working in Kuwait then. So we got married and moved to Kuwait. So whenever I come back from work as a consultant I would pick up my laptop and start working again especially after taking my dinner.

I did not know I was hurting her so much until she now voiced out and said “the computer has arrived and she would be at home from morning till night and when I come back I would still go to my computer.”

I had to work on that and prioritise things. But she got used to it. So she has changed me in a lot of ways. I think one of the things she still complains about is the fact that I don’t compliment her. Probably she would make her hair; I would see it and not say anything. So my wife would complain that ‘oh I make this hair and you would not compliment me.’ Honestly I had complimented her deep within me. So I think it has to do with my background as a village boy (laughs). But again I do notice now. So I learnt a lot from that; that it is important to appreciate people. We should not only appreciate people in our minds but there must be outward words of affirmation.

What are your indelible memories?

One of the experiences is that I lost some sisters and brothers growing up that I would have wished were alive today. It is an experience that does not make me happy whenever I remember it. But there are lots of happy situations as well. During exams I would come first and get accolades amongst my peers. Also I used to be an altar boy in the Catholic Church. I think some of the morals I have now were got from the Catholic Church. As Catholic Church altar boy you have to be disciplined. So I think the totality of what I went though actually prepared me for who I am today. That is why you see that I am not flamboyant maybe because I am a local boy. I am contented with what I have.

Let me tell you a story. When I got married there was a time I travelled but I did not tell my wife the time I would come back. So I now said I wanted to eat swallow. She said there was no stew. I was surprised and said: ‘you mean you don’t have stew?’ She now said what she meant was that there was no meat because she was not expecting me. So I said I would eat it like that. My wife could not believe it because she did not have the kind of background that I had (laughs). So I ate the food without any meat and told her that while we were growing up we often eat without meat. She was surprised.

Adobe acquired $540 million for TubeMogul a video adtech company that buys ads for brands programmatically and competed with Google Amazon The Trade Desk and MediaMath.

At the time Brad Rencher then-EVP and general manager of Adobe's digital experience business unit and a key player in the TubeMogul integration promised the deal would create a ""'one-stop shop' for video advertising providing even more strategic value for our Adobe Marketing Cloud customers.""

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The deal would set Adobe apart from other cloud giants including Salesforce and Oracle that invested in marketing tech but not the actual ad buying.

""Adobe traditionally has been known for having a marketing cloud that primarily helped advertisers measure interactions with their audience and data"" former TubeMogul CEO Brett Wilson told Insider in 2017. ""Advertisers usually have totally separate media execution software. Adobe is the first marketing cloud to have a fully executable advertising layer riding the gap between martech and adtech.""

But last summer Adobe shut down a big part of its TubeMogul acquisition closing its advanced TV business that sold linear TV ads and political advertising to advertisers. Adobe kept its self-serve advertising arm where marketers can buy search digital and OTT ads.

Advertising has remained a tiny part of the company comprising 4% of its non-subscription revenue in 2020 down from 7% in 2018. Adobe also has a small amount of ad revenue that's part of its subscription revenue.

Insider spoke with five former Adobe ad executives as well as analysts and ad buyers about what happened to Adobe's advertising ambitions. The former execs' identities are known to Insider but they spoke on the condition of background out of concern for their career prospects.

They said Adobe struggled to fit advertising into its bigger subscription-based model and to pitch advertisers new ways of buying ads. Adobe also felt the pinch of adtech industry consolidation and the pandemic.

Finally sources blamed Adobe leadership saying it got increasingly hands-on with its newly acquired advertising business and squelched TubeMogul's high-energy startup culture. One former employee said that Adobe changed the management of the ad business several times after the TubeMogul acquisition.

""They didn't understand exactly how media works but they are very good on the marketing and creative sides"" said a second former Adobe ad exec.

Asked to comment for this article an Adobe spokesperson sent a statement saying that the pandemic played a role in its decision to axe part of its advertising business.

""Given Covid-19 has further slowed the adoption of a data-driven business model in the TV industry Adobe announced in Q3 2020 that it will focus its Ad Cloud strategy on its software solution for search display video audio and connected TV advertising as well as new integrations between Ad Cloud and other areas of Experience Cloud"" said the spokesperson. ""With this shift we were able to increase our investments in other strategic growth initiatives to serve our customers' evolving needs. We decided to no longer invest in our managed service transaction-based product for programmatic TV advertising and fully align the business with our Experience Cloud software-based go-to-market strategy.""

The ad business model clashed with Adobe's subscription business

Like most ad sellers TubeMogul charged advertisers based on how much they spend on advertising. Adobe meanwhile had a software as a service model that charges clients like Ben & Jerry's and Sprint monthly fees to use its analytics e-commerce and design software tools.

""Selling something on a percentage of media is completely foreign to a company that transacts everything on a software subscription model"" said a former Adobe ad exec. ""Adobe was never able to wrap its head around how we made money and was constantly forcing Ad Cloud as a round peg into a square hole of financial accounting and credit.""

""No one is a pure SaaS business model the way Adobe is"" said another former Adobe employee.

Adobe itself suggested that it wasn't interested in chasing advertising budgets that can fluctuate widely but wanted to sell advertising as part of its subscription-based model.

""I think the decision to be made associated with reducing our focus on the transaction-based advertising revenue … if you look at everything that's happening associated with that business there are other companies in that space. I think that was a good way to do it"" CEO Shantanu Narayen said during Adobe's first-quarter 2021 earnings call of Adobe's decision to axe part of its ad business.

When it did that Adobe reassigned its ad sales team to high-growth areas like Signs and Document Cloud. Top ad talent and longtime TubeMogul staffers left including global head of agency partnerships Nick Reid; director and general manager of programmatic TV Todd Gordon; and North American ad sales lead Jeremy Bloom. One former employee said around that time the last set of the vesting periods for TubeMogul's executives ended.

Adobe struggled to crack the TV advertising market

TV advertisers still buy most of their ads directly from TV networks spending the rest of their budgets throughout the year.

Adobe meanwhile wanted to sell traditional TV advertising through annual commitments which made it hard to make inroads with TV ad buyers and strained its relationship with ad agencies former Adobe ad execs said.

""Adobe is in the software business they're not in the media business"" said a second former employee. ""I honestly think that they shut down the business for Adobe reasons — not industry reasons.""

Adobe's marketing tech clients tended to focus on harder metrics like sales and lead generations which made traditional TV advertising with its focus on softer metrics like awareness a tough sell a third former exec said.

""The TV story wasn't resonating with them because that wasn't the plan with their marketing stack"" said the second former Adobe exec.

Adobe also faced growing competition from adtech companies including Simulmedia Tatari The Trade Desk and Comcast-owned FreeWheel that were also trying to shake up how TV ads are sold.

Since shutting down its TV business Adobe has focused on its existing clients limiting the number of advertisers it can pitch said one former executive.

Adobe's ad revenue dropped in early 2020 as advertisers cut spending in the pandemic the final nail in the coffin for its advanced TV ambitions two former Adobe executives said.

Adobe faced tough competition for ad dollars

As Adobe tried to figure out the digital ad business advertisers were consolidating their spending with giants like Google Amazon and The Trade Desk.

Adobe ranked No. 5 behind Amazon Google Verizon and The Trade Desk in a recent poll by research firm Advertiser Perceptions asking advertisers which demand-side platforms they consider the most for OTT ads. About one-fourth of ad buyers used Adobe's DSP followed by Roku Amobee MediaMath and AT&T's Xandr.

When it came to self-serve ad tools only 16% of ad buyers used Adobe's platform putting it in sixth place behind companies including Google Amazon Verizon and AT&T's Xandr.

Advertiser Perceptions

Adobe's return to martech has its own risks

Adobe's return to marketing tech could actually position it better by making it less reliant on ad targeting and measuring methods that Google and Apple are making obsolete.

Andrew Frank VP and a distinguished analyst at research firm Gartner said that advertisers are clamoring for tools like Adobe's to figure out what people buy and what they do online.

But brands may be wary of going all-in on one company for all of their data needs said Amanda Martin VP of enterprise partnerships at independent ad agency Goodway Group.

""If [brands] have all eggs in one basket does that help or hinder you?"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY3J1bW9ycy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8wNC9hZG9iZS1pbGx1c3RyYXRvci1hcHBsZS1zaWxpY29uLWJldGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Illustrator Now Available for Apple Silicon in Beta,"Less than a month after releasing Adobe Photoshop for Apple silicon and more than three months after releasing Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Rush and Audition for Apple silicon in beta Adobe has begun testing Illustrator on Apple's latest chip architecture.

The handy new tool which is now available in Camera Raw 13.2 and will be landing soon on Lightroom and Lightroom Classic has a simple claim – to be able to double the resolution of your photos using machine learning while improving their quality.

This is a big deal for most photographers particularly those of us who remember the early days of the megapixel wars. Back in the day (we’re old okay?) you couldn’t go near a camera launch without the megapixel count of a camera being thrust at you.

(Image credit: Adobe)

Four megapixels. Eight. 12. 18. We remember when the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV with its 30.4MP sensor arrived – that was it the end of the resolution wars. From that point on virtually any camera you could buy would offer enough resolution to do virtually anything with the images you wanted.

That’s doubly true in the age of Instagram. Actually it’s 25 times more true in the age of Instagram as in most cases you only ever need to upload a 1080 x 1080 image – just 1.2MP’s worth of photography.

Adobe doesn’t think resolution worries have gone away though which is why its new Super Resolution has made its way to Adobe Camera Raw. It advertises something simple – it will take an image (JPGs and raws are both supported) and doubles the number of pixels along the horizontal and vertical edges.

Sceptics will be reaching for their “but it already does that” comments as we speak but Super Resolution uses machine learning theoretically allowing it to produce superior-quality results. But does it? We ran it through some tests to find out.

How to use Adobe's Super Resolution mode

Using the tool is simple. Use Adobe Bridge and open an image in Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) then right-click your image and click Enhance – or use CMD-Shift-D if you’re in a rush.

(Image credit: Future)

The Super Resolution tool itself is a simple one – a lonesome checkbox marked Super Resolution and the ability to click and hold on your image preview to see what ACR is going to do.

(Image credit: Future)

Click Enhance (it's good to see Adobe finally embracing the terminology of late-90s classic Enemy of the State) and your computer will whir away for a bit. Super Resolution is heavily dependent on your system’s GPU so the more you spent on that the faster your results will come.

How long does Super Resolution take and is it worth it?

Of course Photoshop Bridge and Lightroom (other photo editors are available) have offered image upscaling for years so what advantages does Super Resolution offer? Having read some breathlessly enthusiastic experiences we eagerly set up a few comparisons and…results were variable to put it mildly.

If all you want is to create a supersize version of a decent un-cropped image you can save substantial amounts of time – and even image quality – using Photoshop’s bog standard image resize.

We tried a few images – opening them resizing them to 200% their original linear dimensions and then layering an 'enhanced' resize on top. While there was always a difference between the two the difference was rarely in Super Resolution’s favor.

The results

1.) The robin test

A good example of the limitations of Photoshop's Super Resolution mode is this frame of a robin. On the left is what the original image (which you can see here) looks like resized to twice its original dimensions using Photoshop’s basic image re-sizer with resampling set to automatic. You can see the full-size version here.

And the version on the right (which you can see in full-size here) is what it looks like after being 'enhanced'. Can you tell the difference? Us neither although with Super Resolution producing an enormous DNG file each time you use it our hard disk certainly could.

Also zooming into 100% showed a problem. The difference is almost unbearably slight but the basic resize (left) shows more sharpness and fine detail than the far more processor and hard disk intensive Super Resolution file on the right. That makes the score '1-0' in favor of doing things the old fashioned way.

2.) The rhino test

Next up we tried comparing the two techniques on this photo of a rhino. This time we’ll skip straight to the side-by-side comparison as there’s no way you’ll spot the difference otherwise.

This time our subject does show a slight improvement in texture and sharpness where we’ve used Super Resolution (right) versus using the basic resize tool (left). You can see the full-size version here.

Basic image upscaling (left) vs Super Resolution (right) (Image credit: Future)

However it’s also mis-colored our image dropping in some violet aberrations that now need fixing. Even if these weren’t here we’d still wonder whether Adobe’s new AI-powered tool was worth it.

Resizing an image using Photoshop’s bargain-basement re-sizer – in these first two examples – produced similar or better results and was ridiculously fast (about 22 seconds versus over 54 seconds) compared to the Super Resolution tool.

3.) The Porto redemption

It’s not all doom and gloom for Super Resolution though – our experiments suggest there will be times when the feature is worth its weight in if not gold at least something reasonably heavy-duty.

For example here’s a picture of the bank-side in photo-friendly Porto.

And below is a super-aggressive crop of the same image. After the crop we were left with an image just 2733 x 1822 pixels which is pretty tight if you’re looking to print.

We resized the image using Photoshop’s old-style re-sizer and the Super Resolution tool and the results are actually pretty striking. For a closer look check out the full-size version.

Basic image upscaling (left) vs Super Resolution (right) (Image credit: Future)

You still need to be paying attention but the basic-resize version (left) is way softer than the Super Resolution version on the right.

There’s more detail sharpness and although the trained eye will pick up a slightly raised amount of chromatic aberration (purple and green fringing) it’s barely worth mentioning.

4.) The tiger test

Our last Super Resolution test was this photo of a tiger which is cropped down from this original snap.

And after upscaling using both Super Resolution and Photoshop’s old-school image re-sizer here’s the side-by-side comparison of the results. Or you can get a closer look by checking out the full-size version here.

Basic image upscaling (left) vs Super Resolution (right) (Image credit: Future)

At this point we began to question our eyes our sanity our reason for being. The basic resize – which took seconds – is visibly appreciably sharper than the Super Resolution version on the right.

The verdict

All of this leaves us struggling to make a call. There isn’t really a buying decision as such – if you have a Creative Cloud subscription that includes Photoshop you already have Super Resolution so the question is if it’s worth the extra time.

In some cases appreciably yes – you’ll be able to enlarge images preserving or even creating extra sharpness as you go. In other cases appreciably no – your images could very well end up slightly softer and in either case you’ll be splitting hairs between getting Photoshop to do a basic up-rezzing job or spending more time having Adobe Camera Raw doing its 'Enhance' job.

The alternative: Gigapixel

All of which is before you consider Topaz’ popular Gigapixel AI software. It’s long-winded and expensive at $99.99 but given our crop of Porto to work on it produced a visibly stronger image than either of Photoshop’s efforts. This is particularly noticeable in the full-size image.

Then we tried using Gigapixel on our robin image – just as a sanity check you see – and the whole thing fell apart again with our Gigapixel image introducing a load of previously-absent noise mottling the fine detail of our bird.

If ever there was a topic of image editing that deserved the deployment of the shrug emoji image resizing appears to be it. Get a closer look with the full-size version of the below comparison.

Adobe Super Resolution (left) vs Gigapixel AI (right) (Image credit: Future)

Still despite these mixed results the writing’s certainly on the wall for image editing – AI and cloud-based edits are going to be the way of the future. Has Adobe cracked it?

Super Resolution is an interesting but irritatingly inconsistent way of up-rezzing images particularly compared to some excellent third party software. But if you’re unwilling to spend the money for Gigapixel if you find yourself frustrated with how Photoshop upscales using its traditional tools we’d give the cloud a try."

For the 2021 SAG Awards the actress not only lived up to the high standards set by her previous looks of the season — she exceeded them.

""Anya's wearing custom Vera Wang"" her stylist for the evening Law Roach told InStyle over the phone. The lace-trimmed minidress toes the line between edgy and elegant and according to Roach it was inspired by the glamour of vintage nightgowns: ""Her look feels very high-end nighttime dressing gown. It almost feels like an underpinning but the silhouette of it is very much a cocktail dress.""

Roach paired the pink and black number with $800000 worth of mixed-cut diamonds from Tiffany & Co (yes you read that right). ""I wanted her look to feel a bit retro but at the same time sexy"" he said.

Two farmers have created a service that allows you to receive produce on-demand and help reduce food waste.

In 2011 amid Spain’s economic crisis brothers Gabriel and Gonzalo Úrculo quit their jobs to return to the beautiful orange grove in Valencia where they had grown up to revive the family fruit business.

But they soon encountered problems. The low prices paid by supermarkets and other intermediaries made it almost impossible to make a living. On top of that part of the harvest would always go to waste because they couldn’t sell it.

So in a bid to disrupt what they saw as an inefficient and opaque food supply chain they came up with an idea to cut out the middleman and harvest fruit “on demand” for individual customers.

The brothers put their trees up for “adoption” allowing people to pay for each tree’s care in return for receiving the harvest when it was ready. The customers knew they were getting good fruit from a small farm using sustainable methods. The farmers got a guaranteed price for a certain amount of fruit in advance of the season allowing them to plan better and reduce waste.

In 2017 they expanded the idea outside of their own orange grove and launched CrowdFarming.com - a platform that works a bit like Airbnb for agriculture. Customers can log on read about a farm who runs it and the methods they use. They can then adopt a plant or part of a field to receive the harvest - whether it’s avocados from Spain or potatoes from Germany or even wine from France. If there’s any leftover customers can also order boxes of surplus food.

The team work together with farmers to sell their produce direct to customers. Crowdfarming

The platform had been slowly growing in popularity but last year’s lockdowns gave it a massive boost. More people were turning to online grocery shopping or looking for new ways to make sure they could access fresh food. Sales tripled and the number of farmers signed on to the scheme also doubled. CrowdFarming says it is now serving 200000 households across Europe - particularly in Germany Austria France and the Nordic countries.

“Europeans have been demanding more organic and sustainable products for years and the pandemic has only accelerated this shift in consumer behaviour” says co-founder Gonzalo Úrculo.

As for farmers “many have seen their traditional sales channels collapse because of the coronavirus crisis.”

How does it shorten food supply chains?

CrowdFarming is ambitious. In its marketing materials it insists it is “not trying to digitalise the traditional food supply chain. We are not an online supermarket. We are building technology for a new food supply chain that allows new experiences for consumers stable income for farmers and that rethinks the whole cultivation harvest and logistic process.”

It’s one of a spate of initiatives that have sprung up in recent years to “shorten” the food supply chain offering customers more transparency about where their food is coming from and giving farmers respite from the pressures of supplying supermarkets.

These kinds of innovations were being developed pre-pandemic but the need for farmers and food businesses to pivot is increasing their spread. Danielle Nierenberg President of the Food Tank

Emerging models include community supported agriculture (CSA) where residents share the risks and rewards of the harvest with a local farmer through arrangements such as co-ownership or investment in a farm; and online farmers’ markets. It usually involves a distributor working with local farms to bundle items for the consumer.

CrowdFarming involves elements of both. “I think these hybrid models are becoming more popular” says Danielle Nierenberg president of the Food Tank a think tank focused on fixing the food system “whether it’s preventing food waste or supporting regional food systems.”

“These kinds of innovations were being developed pre-pandemic but the need for farmers and food businesses to pivot is increasing their spread.”

Ordering in bulk requires ‘a mindset shift’

Operating across Europe CrowdFarming offers a far bigger network than most online farmers’ markets or CSA models. Customers also don’t have to rely on options available in their local area. But there is no middleman to “bundle” items together - central to the goal of reducing inefficiencies is that customers buy directly from the farmers. That typically means buying in bulk.

“It requires a mindset shift on the part of the consumer” says Abigail 38 who works in tech in the U.K and has used CrowdFarming to adopt a sheep (receiving the cheese from its milk in return) an orange tree and a walnut tree.

“It was intimidating at the start… but it pushed me to think and research the ways in which people traditionally manage large harvests” she says. While things like cheese and nuts can last a long time she has had to learn how to dry pickle and candy citrus fruit to preserve parts of her orders - skills she thinks others may have learned during lockdown too.

Oranges are not easy to keep long term but preservation methods and sharing with neighbours can help reduce waste. CrowdFarming

For Abigail the past year increased the appeal of options like CrowdFarming because access to fresh food hasn’t felt so reliable. “I think understanding how much we rely on for example mainland Europe for our fresh fruit has expanded and people want to explore ways they can take responsibility for their own food” she says.

A relative newcomer to the idea 44-year-old Karin Gstöttmayr who lives with her family in Switzerland recently made her first order of a 4kg box of avocados. They came with storage instructions to help the fruit ripen gradually.

“It worked out perfectly” she says. “We were able to stretch the consumption to almost three weeks. They were flawless and delicious.” Some customers also split large deliveries with friends and neighbours.

Karin puts the platform’s surging popularity down to a growing desire to make consumption “more conscious to tackle climate change and to feel independent from the ‘big evil corporations’.” CrowdFarming has a “very personal set-up” which fits this perfectly she says.

What are the environmental benefits?

These social and environmental benefits are at the heart of what CrowdFarming claims to be doing. All the farms it lists are organic and have to meet certain sustainability requirements in terms of their production methods packaging and working conditions.

Pandemic permitting adopters can even visit the farms to check it out for themselves. The idea is that transparency incentivizes sustainable practices and farmers can invest more in it because they are receiving a higher price for their produce.

Marco Jostmeier a potato farmer in Germany who sells through CrowdFarming notes that this level of transparency and personalization comes with “a huge amount of extra work” for the farmer. But for his team being able to set their own price for their product and have a more personal relationship with customers means “we are happy to do it.”

“We believe that the bond between producer and consumer will strengthen in the future and that more consumers want to know where their food comes from” Jostmeier says. “CrowdFarming is not the only way but... it is one good way.”

The online platform is much less local than many sustainable food models. Still Úrculo argues that it is far more environmentally-friendly for European customers to buy avocados or mangoes from Spain than from South America or Asia where these products would typically be shipped from.

Spanish bio-mango farmer Maria Martinez Hijano is part of the scheme. CrowdFarming

“Transportation represents 6 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions in EU food-chains” he says. “The most important factor is what we cultivate and how we do it.

“A short fast and efficient supply-chain reduces energy consumption and thus CO2 emissions.”

While the social and environmental impacts can be hard to unpick Karin and Abigail say they hope they are contributing to a positive change - even if in a small way.

“Eating oranges thousands of miles from their origin is always going to come at some cost ... but what I've read and experienced is sufficient to suggest to me that I am making reasonable enough choices” says Abigail.

Karin agrees. The social and environmental benefit “is important to me” she says. “I hope I am supporting a good cause here enjoying guacamole.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXJrc2hpcmVlYWdsZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9vbi1zaG9ydC10ZXJtLXJlbnRhbHMtc3RvY2ticmlkZ2Utc2Vlcy13aW5kb3ctb2Ytb3Bwb3J0dW5pdHktdG8tY3JhZnQtcmVndWxhdG9yeS1ieWxhdy9hcnRpY2xlXzM3ZjZlMTEwLTkzMTktMTFlYi1hNmMyLTk3Y2Y4ZWJiMTE2ZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,On short-term rentals Stockbridge sees window of opportunity to craft regulatory bylaw,The Henderson House at 39 Main St. in Stockbridge is among about 100 properties in town that offer short-term rentals.

ALB,Albemarle Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvY2tzL3dvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LWxpdGhpdW0tcHJvZHVjZXItZ2V0LXJlYWR5LWZvci1hLW1lZ2EtcmFsbHktMTAzMDI3Mjg5MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World's Largest Lithium Producer: Get Ready For A Mega-Rally,"Several months ago Chile’s second-largest lithium producer Albemarle Corp. (NYSE:ALB) warned that global supplies of lithium were on course for a major shortfall in a few years’ time if prices fail to reflect the costs of funding massive expansions amid the EV boom. Specifically ALB highlighted the chasm between discount-hunting EV manufacturers and lithium producers who were unable to meet growing demand at persistently low prices.

But maybe Eric Norris operations manager for Albemarle’s lithium business rushed his fences: Lithium carbonate prices have nearly tripled after sinking to multi-year lows of $29800 per ton in July 2020. Lithium carbonate is a critical ingredient in the manufacture of Lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles.

And now another giant lithium producer is dancing to the same tune.

Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium the world’s largest lithium mining company with a market capitalization of $19 billion says that lithium prices will continue to rally as lithium production struggles to keep up with the massive demand for EVs. The Chinese company has some decent credibility--after all it counts leading EV makers such as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY) among its customers.

Ganfeng Lithium reported net income of 1.025-billion yuan ($156-million) in 2020 a huge improvement on 2019 partly due to gains on the fair value of financial assets such as equities but also due to strong demand for battery-grade lithium.

Mega rally

Investors started pouring into lithium years ago anticipating the very same supply crunch that Ganfeng Lithium and Albemarle are warning is now looming. They jumped the gun then partly out of poorly timed over-enthusiasm and partly because the logic ran like this: Any new lithium mines that could contribute to the EV battery onslaught would take years to bring online from scratch--so best to get started in advance.

Now with the EV boom squarely in the front view mirror and with battery gigafactories promising to be heavy-hitting purchasers we can finally see the much-anticipated supply crunch forming.

Battery-grade lithium carbonate prices started to buck a three-year downturn during the second half of 2020 thanks to robust EV demand roared back from the coronavirus. Lithium carbonate prices have gained 67% so far in 2021 and 224%r the past 12 months.

That’s mainly thanks to the postponement of lithium project expansions in South America--due to previous demand forecasts as well as the impact of the pandemic. This is expected to slow down the short-term supply of the lithium compound and improve pricing according to Ganfeng.

Source: Trading Economics

Ganfeng expects its massive Cauchari-Olaroz lithium salt lake project in Argentina to produce 40000 tonnes per year of lithium carbonate when it comes online in the first half of 2022.

Ganseng current boasts an annual capacity of just over 120 000 tonnes.

Looking further ahead the company hopes to establish a lithium salt capacity of at least 600000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) annually good for a 400% increase.

That alone should give you an idea of how bullish these companies are on lithium thanks to the global EV and electrification drive.

Commodity rally

But lithium producers such as Ganfeng Albermale and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) can also thank another potent force working in their favor--a global commodity bull market.

Bloomberg Commodity Index

A cross-section of Wall Street luminaries from Pimco to Point 72 have predicted a broad commodity rally thanks to the so-called reflation trade. Indeed Wall Street is predicting a new commodity bull market that will rival the oil price spikes of the 1970s or the China-driven boom of the 2000s. Market experts including Goldman Sachs believe the commodity boom could rival the last “supercycle” in the early 2000s that powered emerging BRIC economies (Brazil Russia India and China).

Iron ore and copper prices are already trading at multi-year highs while global oil prices have rebounded strongly from historical lows.

Lithium oil and copper are expected to be among the biggest beneficiaries of the new commodity bull market.

(WMTV) - Since February thousands of people have passed through Blackhawk Technical College which transformed a campus into a regional hub for vaccine distribution.

The state’s first community vaccine clinic is housed in a student center at the school’s central campus. Operated by an independent healthcare company called AMI the clinic is currently giving 2500 shots per week according to college and local health officials.

“Wisconsin’s technological college system is rooted in workforce and economic development. There’s nothing more important for workforce and economic development than our people’s health” Dr. Tracy Pierner president of Blackhawk Tech said.

While the pandemic has kept many students learning from home Dr. Pierner said he saw opportunities there. For example freer parking lots have allowed community testing to occur since October according to a spokesperson. Dr. Pierner said testing grew out of talks with local health officials and more conversations led to his campus getting tapped by the state to host the vaccine clinic.

When Gov. Tony Evers announced the creation of the Rock Co. clinic in February he said it would “start with the ability to vaccinate up to 250 individuals daily.” According to Rick Wietersen an environmental health director for the Rock Co. Health Department vaccine operations are looking to ramp up and vaccinate up to 5000 people per week.

Wietersen said the facility has been critical in the public health response to the pandemic.

“This offers an opportunity for those that don’t have a medical home or don’t have ready access to places like pharmacies” Wietersen said.

According to Dr. Pierner Blackhawk Tech isn’t getting paid for hosting the vaccine service. “But our tax payers are supporting this facility” he added.

In neighboring Dane County Alliant Energy Center serves as another large testing and vaccination site. The county’s public health department runs operations here giving more than a thousand vaccine shots a day.

Brent McHenry the center’s executive director said “This is the nature of our facility. We are designed and operated to provide support at all levels during an emergency but also positive happy exciting events.”

McHenry told NBC15 the center is getting reimbursed for things like utilities but not gaining revenue.

Starting April 5 Wisconsin’s vaccine eligibility will expand to include anyone 16 years or older but those planning to get vaccinated at Blackhawk Tech must be 18 years or older. A school spokesperson said the clinic uses the Moderna vaccine which is only approved for the slightly older age group.

It's called Sandbox (or as it's styled internally Sandbox@Alphabet) and it's exploring ""the intersection of physics and AI.""

Sources familiar with the project say the team works in the same building as Alphabet's moonshots division X and is made up largely of former X employees — but X says Sandbox operates as a separate group.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Sandbox is also independent from Google's better-known Quantum AI team in Santa Barbara which in 2019 claimed to reach ""quantum supremacy"" by having a quantum computer solve a problem exponentially faster than a classical computer. IBM disputed the claim leading to a public sparring match between quantum computing experts.

But in early 2020 Wired first reported on the existence of a second quantum effort happening inside X. A spokesperson at the time also said that the group was separate from X. An Alphabet spokesperson told Insider that the project had been in the works for three years though it has only recently become public.

Since 2020 the group has started to pull back the curtain on their work. Several employees have also updated their LinkedIn profiles in recent weeks to reveal that they now work as Sandbox.

Many of them said they officially became Sandbox employees this year according to LinkedIn and several previously had roles working on quantum research inside X.

Sources say Sandbox is partly detached from X

The Sandbox group is led by Jack Hidary a tech entrepreneur and author of the book ""Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach."" He reports to X head Astro Teller sources say.

Hidary previously described himself as ""Senior Advisor to X Labs the advanced innovation lab of Alphabet/Google"" on his own website. That was recently changed to ""Director of Quantum and AI at Alphabet.""

""Sandbox is a small team at Alphabet home to researchers exploring the intersection of physics and artificial intelligence in areas such as high performance computing"" an Alphabet spokesperson told Insider. ""Sandbox collaborates and shares technical learnings across Alphabet including with Google's quantum and AI and Cloud teams and with various Other Bets.""

They added that the team is researching how to use physics and AI methods to find hybrid solutions that do not require quantum computers to work.

The spokesperson declined to make Hidary or any other members of the Sandbox team available for interview. They added that the group has been named Sandbox since its inception three years ago. However it appears that the name has only been used publicly in recent months.

Last July Guillaume Verdon a research scientist on the team was introduced in an interview as a resident of X. In more recent appearances he's been referred to as a member of Sandbox@Alphabet.

A spokesperson for the X labs said the Sandbox was ""not at X"" but said Sandbox does work closely with the teams there.

""I think the reason to keep it this way is to make sure there is some way for the project to prosper without being too tied down to Google or X"" said one current X employee familiar with the arrangement.

We're starting to find out what Sandbox is working on

Over the past few weeks more details about Sandbox's work have started to emerge.

VentureBeat spotted a livestream from the Sandbox team held back in February where the team revealed they were building tools that would let developers take Tensor Processing Units – Google's chips built for machine learning – to simulate quantum computing workloads.

Companies including Amazon and Microsoft also have quantum simulators but Sandbox believes that using these TPUs will give it the edge in terms of efficiency.

""I think the hope is that by using TPUs they can expand the number of useful qubits which means you can do more powerful computations"" Brian Hopkins a quantum analyst at Forrester told Insider.

Qubits or quantum bits are the basic units of data in quantum computing. Whereas traditional computers encode information into ones and zeroes quantum bits can be in two states at once.

It's not clear yet what the long-term plan for Sandbox is or how closely it works with the team in Santa Barbara. ""I would think they're quite joined at the hip"" Hopkins said.

One source familiar with the group said Sandbox is exploring ideas such as how to use use quantum calculations to read signals from the body over traditional methods such as electrocardiograms. They also said that the Sandbox team is currently hiring with plans to grow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3Mvam9obi1rcmFmY2lrLXdheW1vLWNlby1zdGVwcy1kb3duLWdvb2dsZS1zZWxmLWRyaXZpbmctY2FyL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2pvaG4ta3JhZmNpay13YXltby1jZW8tc3RlcHMtZG93bi1nb29nbGUtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLWNhci8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Krafcik CEO of Google self-driving car spinoff Waymo is stepping down,"The executive who steered the transformation of Google's self-driving car project into a separate company worth billions of dollars is stepping down after more than five years on the job.

John Krafcik announced his departure as CEO of Waymo a company spun out from Google in a Friday blog post that cited his desire to enjoy life as the world emerges from the pandemic.

""I'm looking forward to a refresh period reconnecting with old friends and family and discovering new parts of the world"" Krafcik 59 wrote.

Two of Krafcik's top lieutenants will replace him as co-CEOs. Dmitri Dolgov who has been working on self-driving cars since Waymo began within Google in 2009 will focus on the technology for the autonomous vehicles. Tekedra Mawakana a lawyer who had been Waymo's chief operating officer will handle the business side of the operation.

""My time leading Waymo has been the capstone of my career"" Krafcik wrote. ""Together we've achieved remarkable firsts as we develop deploy and commercialize our fully autonomous Waymo Driver and work to make our roads safer and mobility more accessible.""

Krafcik will remain an adviser to Waymo a company that established itself as the clear leader in autonomous driving since Google hired him in 2015. Not long after that Google's self-driving division morphed into Waymo a company owned by Alphabet which is also Google's parent.

Under Krafcik's leadership Waymo forged partnerships with several major automakers and launched the first ride-hailing service to pick up passengers without a driver or anyone else in the vehicles. That service called Waymo One only operates in the Phoenix metropolitan area but Waymo plans to expand into other markets as the company continues to refine a technology that is expected to transform the auto industry.

Slow ride

Waymo's inroads have left it with an estimated market value of about $30 billion based on analyst estimates made last year after the company raised $2.25 billion in its first round of investments from outside Alphabet. But that valuation was down dramatically from 2018 when a Morgan Stanley research report estimated Waymo was worth about $175 billion.

The huge swing reflects the challenges of building self-driving cars that can navigate the roads safely while still dealing with traditional vehicles under the control of humans. That task has proven far more difficult than Waymo and dozens of other companies working on self-driving technology envisioned five or six years ago.

For all its progress in autonomous driving Waymo isn't believed to have ever made money during Krafcik's reign. Waymo doesn't disclose its financial results. It operates within a segment of Alphabet called ""Other Bets"" that includes several other far-flung projects financed by the huge profits generated from Google's digital advertising empire.

Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" have lost nearly $13 billion during the past three years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHRpdi1wbGMtc3RvY2stYXBwZWFycy1zaWduaWZpY2FudGx5LTA5MTI0MjcxNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aptiv PLC Stock Appears To Be Significantly Overvalued,"- By GF Value

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. Aptiv PLC's 3-year average revenue growth rate is in the middle range of the companies in Vehicles & Parts industry. Aptiv PLC's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 13.7% which ranks better than 80% of the companies in Vehicles & Parts industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Aptiv PLC's return on invested capital is 7.43 and its cost of capital is 12.17. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Aptiv PLC is shown below:

Aptiv PLC Stock Appears To Be Significantly Overvalued

In summary Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV 30-year Financials) stock appears to be significantly overvalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 80% of the companies in Vehicles & Parts industry. To learn more about Aptiv PLC stock you can check out its 30-year Financials here.

Krafcik took the reins in 2015 and in 2016 he led Waymo to join an industry consortium to speed up self-driving cars. The Alphabet company became a founding member of the group called Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets which included Argo AI Aurora Cruise Ford Uber Volvo and Zoox.

In 2020 he got the more than 10-year-old company its first outside funding round — a $2.25 billion funding round led by Silicon Valley investment firms including Silver Lake. Then it raised another $750 million. He also oversaw the launch of a local delivery service with freight partners dubbed Waymo Via and recently started its first fully-self-driving car service that some residents can order in Phoenix Arizona.

Abuelsamid said Krafcik's connections and experience within the automotive industry — he was formerly president and CEO of Hyundai Motor America — helped Waymo strike critical partnerships with automakers including Fiat Chrysler and Volvo.

""If you look at the past year and a half — there's been a growing realization within almost all the companies in autonomous vehicle development that this is a much harder problem than we thought"" Sam Abuelsamid principal analyst at Guidehouse Insights told CNBC Friday.

Under Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" umbrella the company has been consistently bleeding money which is less accepted since Ruth Porat joined then company as CFO and tightened the purse strings. The Other Bets segment showed an operating loss of $4.48 billion in 2020. That was up from $2.03 billion in 2019. Covid has also taken a toll on operations as CNBC recently found Waymo wasn't sure it could afford to keep paying some workers amid the pandemic.

Krafcik's departure comes ahead of expected federal regulations in the U.S. around self driving cars.

The National Transportation Safety Board recently called on its sister agency the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to impose stricter standards on automated vehicle tech. NHTSA solicited comments from the public in advance of proposed rule-making and closed the comments period on April 1.

Krafcik's aware of what's at stake.

Krafcik said in 2017 that it wouldn't need to wait until 2020 ⁠— when analysts expected self-driving cars to go fully autonomous ⁠— but that it would give riders the ability within ""months.""

""Fully self-driving cars are here"" Krafcik said at the 2017 Web Summit in Lisbon where he presented a video of a man who fell asleep in one of the Waymo vehicles. ""It's not happening in 2020 it's happening today.""

In recent years the company began dialing back its enthusiastic tone as it fell behind its original timeline for getting fully self-driving cars on the road.

In 2019 CNBC reporting found that Waymo still largely relied on human safety drivers and still required a decent amount of community buy-in. Shortly after Morgan Stanley cut its valuation on Waymo by 40% from $175 billion to $105 billion saying that it underestimated the heavy reliance the company still had on human drivers.

In 2019 Waymo's chief operating officer and now incoming CEO Tekedra Mawakana said at a conference that the hype around its self-driving cars became ""unmanageable.""

With more than 20 million miles driven on public roads and 20 billion miles driven in simulation Waymo leads other companies in self-driving technology. But it still has a long road ahead if it wants to scale even if Krafcik helped move it further along.

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Dropbox is 17.9% which ranks better than 76% of the companies in Software industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 57.6% which ranks better than 91% of the companies in Software industry.

One can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months Dropbox's ROIC is 5.45 while its WACC came in at 6.40. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Dropbox is shown below:

Google's parent company Alphabet has a secretive team working on the future of quantum technologies and it's finally starting to come out of the woodwork.

It's called Sandbox (or as it's styled internally Sandbox@Alphabet) and it's exploring ""the intersection of physics and AI.""

Sources familiar with the project say the team works in the same building as Alphabet's moonshots division X and is made up largely of former X employees — but X says Sandbox operates as a separate group.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Sandbox is also independent from Google's better-known Quantum AI team in Santa Barbara which in 2019 claimed to reach ""quantum supremacy"" by having a quantum computer solve a problem exponentially faster than a classical computer. IBM disputed the claim leading to a public sparring match between quantum computing experts.

But in early 2020 Wired first reported on the existence of a second quantum effort happening inside X. A spokesperson at the time also said that the group was separate from X. An Alphabet spokesperson told Insider that the project had been in the works for three years though it has only recently become public.

Since 2020 the group has started to pull back the curtain on their work. Several employees have also updated their LinkedIn profiles in recent weeks to reveal that they now work as Sandbox.

Many of them said they officially became Sandbox employees this year according to LinkedIn and several previously had roles working on quantum research inside X.

Sources say Sandbox is partly detached from X

The Sandbox group is led by Jack Hidary a tech entrepreneur and author of the book ""Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach."" He reports to X head Astro Teller sources say.

Hidary previously described himself as ""Senior Advisor to X Labs the advanced innovation lab of Alphabet/Google"" on his own website. That was recently changed to ""Director of Quantum and AI at Alphabet.""

""Sandbox is a small team at Alphabet home to researchers exploring the intersection of physics and artificial intelligence in areas such as high performance computing"" an Alphabet spokesperson told Insider. ""Sandbox collaborates and shares technical learnings across Alphabet including with Google's quantum and AI and Cloud teams and with various Other Bets.""

They added that the team is researching how to use physics and AI methods to find hybrid solutions that do not require quantum computers to work.

The spokesperson declined to make Hidary or any other members of the Sandbox team available for interview. They added that the group has been named Sandbox since its inception three years ago. However it appears that the name has only been used publicly in recent months.

Last July Guillaume Verdon a research scientist on the team was introduced in an interview as a resident of X. In more recent appearances he's been referred to as a member of Sandbox@Alphabet.

A spokesperson for the X labs said the Sandbox was ""not at X"" but said Sandbox does work closely with the teams there.

""I think the reason to keep it this way is to make sure there is some way for the project to prosper without being too tied down to Google or X"" said one current X employee familiar with the arrangement.

We're starting to find out what Sandbox is working on

Over the past few weeks more details about Sandbox's work have started to emerge.

VentureBeat spotted a livestream from the Sandbox team held back in February where the team revealed they were building tools that would let developers take Tensor Processing Units – Google's chips built for machine learning – to simulate quantum computing workloads.

Companies including Amazon and Microsoft also have quantum simulators but Sandbox believes that using these TPUs will give it the edge in terms of efficiency.

""I think the hope is that by using TPUs they can expand the number of useful qubits which means you can do more powerful computations"" Brian Hopkins a quantum analyst at Forrester told Insider.

Qubits or quantum bits are the basic units of data in quantum computing. Whereas traditional computers encode information into ones and zeroes quantum bits can be in two states at once.

It's not clear yet what the long-term plan for Sandbox is or how closely it works with the team in Santa Barbara. ""I would think they're quite joined at the hip"" Hopkins said.

One source familiar with the group said Sandbox is exploring ideas such as how to use use quantum calculations to read signals from the body over traditional methods such as electrocardiograms. They also said that the Sandbox team is currently hiring with plans to grow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3Mvam9obi1rcmFmY2lrLXdheW1vLWNlby1zdGVwcy1kb3duLWdvb2dsZS1zZWxmLWRyaXZpbmctY2FyL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2pvaG4ta3JhZmNpay13YXltby1jZW8tc3RlcHMtZG93bi1nb29nbGUtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLWNhci8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Krafcik CEO of Google self-driving car spinoff Waymo is stepping down,"The executive who steered the transformation of Google's self-driving car project into a separate company worth billions of dollars is stepping down after more than five years on the job.

John Krafcik announced his departure as CEO of Waymo a company spun out from Google in a Friday blog post that cited his desire to enjoy life as the world emerges from the pandemic.

""I'm looking forward to a refresh period reconnecting with old friends and family and discovering new parts of the world"" Krafcik 59 wrote.

Two of Krafcik's top lieutenants will replace him as co-CEOs. Dmitri Dolgov who has been working on self-driving cars since Waymo began within Google in 2009 will focus on the technology for the autonomous vehicles. Tekedra Mawakana a lawyer who had been Waymo's chief operating officer will handle the business side of the operation.

""My time leading Waymo has been the capstone of my career"" Krafcik wrote. ""Together we've achieved remarkable firsts as we develop deploy and commercialize our fully autonomous Waymo Driver and work to make our roads safer and mobility more accessible.""

Krafcik will remain an adviser to Waymo a company that established itself as the clear leader in autonomous driving since Google hired him in 2015. Not long after that Google's self-driving division morphed into Waymo a company owned by Alphabet which is also Google's parent.

Under Krafcik's leadership Waymo forged partnerships with several major automakers and launched the first ride-hailing service to pick up passengers without a driver or anyone else in the vehicles. That service called Waymo One only operates in the Phoenix metropolitan area but Waymo plans to expand into other markets as the company continues to refine a technology that is expected to transform the auto industry.

Slow ride

Waymo's inroads have left it with an estimated market value of about $30 billion based on analyst estimates made last year after the company raised $2.25 billion in its first round of investments from outside Alphabet. But that valuation was down dramatically from 2018 when a Morgan Stanley research report estimated Waymo was worth about $175 billion.

The huge swing reflects the challenges of building self-driving cars that can navigate the roads safely while still dealing with traditional vehicles under the control of humans. That task has proven far more difficult than Waymo and dozens of other companies working on self-driving technology envisioned five or six years ago.

For all its progress in autonomous driving Waymo isn't believed to have ever made money during Krafcik's reign. Waymo doesn't disclose its financial results. It operates within a segment of Alphabet called ""Other Bets"" that includes several other far-flung projects financed by the huge profits generated from Google's digital advertising empire.

Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" have lost nearly $13 billion during the past three years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHRpdi1wbGMtc3RvY2stYXBwZWFycy1zaWduaWZpY2FudGx5LTA5MTI0MjcxNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aptiv PLC Stock Appears To Be Significantly Overvalued,"- By GF Value

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. Aptiv PLC's 3-year average revenue growth rate is in the middle range of the companies in Vehicles & Parts industry. Aptiv PLC's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 13.7% which ranks better than 80% of the companies in Vehicles & Parts industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Aptiv PLC's return on invested capital is 7.43 and its cost of capital is 12.17. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Aptiv PLC is shown below:

Aptiv PLC Stock Appears To Be Significantly Overvalued

In summary Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV 30-year Financials) stock appears to be significantly overvalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 80% of the companies in Vehicles & Parts industry. To learn more about Aptiv PLC stock you can check out its 30-year Financials here.

Typically a company with high profit margins offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. Dropbox has been profitable 0 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months the company had revenues of $1.9 billion and loss of $0.63 a share. Its operating margin of 6.33% in the middle range of the companies in Software industry. Overall GuruFocus ranks Dropbox's profitability as poor. This is the revenue and net income of Dropbox over the past years:

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Dropbox is 17.9% which ranks better than 76% of the companies in Software industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 57.6% which ranks better than 91% of the companies in Software industry.

Story continues

One can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months Dropbox's ROIC is 5.45 while its WACC came in at 6.40. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Dropbox is shown below:

""You don't really believe the peeing in bottles thing do you? If that were true nobody would work for us"" the company had said in that original March 24 tweet which was a response to a tweet from Rep. Mark Pocan. Pocan's tweet had said ""Paying workers $15/hr doesn't make you a 'progressive workplace' when you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles.""

After being called out about its original tweet Amazon recanted it late Friday saying in a blog post that the tweet was ""incorrect"" and that it owed an apology to Pocan.

""We know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes"" the company said in the post ""and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed.""

The apology could signal that the company is having second thoughts about a spate of unusually aggressive tweets it fired off last month. Amazon made headlines in March with snarky tweets directed at Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. After Vermont's Sanders said he'd travel to Alabama in the final days of a union vote at an Amazon warehouse there the company's chief of consumer operations fired back on Twitter.

""I welcome @SenSanders to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace"" Amazon exec Dave Clark tweeted on March 24. ""I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers but that's not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace.""

The testy tweets appeared as lawmakers in the US and elsewhere are investigating Amazon and other Big Tech firms over what critics have charged are anticompetitive practices. The companies face potential regulation that could force them to break up their businesses or otherwise weaken their power. Amazon is also facing the prospect of a unionized workforce amid accusations that it mistreats its workers. And critics have said Amazon doesn't pay enough taxes despite the fact that its founder Jeff Bezos  is one of the richest people in the world.

In its apology Friday Amazon said the bathroom-break problem affects drivers for other delivery services too as well as drivers for ride-hailing companies. ""Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide we would like to solve it. We don't yet know how but will look for solutions"" Amazon said in its post.

The company has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and others this year over AI-equipped cameras installed in Amazon vans to monitor drivers and confirm their identities. A company program for disciplining delivery drivers which surfaced around the time Amazon's plans for the cameras emerged reportedly mentioned ""public urination"" among actionable offenses. Some drivers have said they worry the camera program will increase pressure on them to work even faster and lead to punishment for behaviors that are hard to avoid under intense time constraints. Amazon has said the cameras are meant solely as a safety measure with tests showing significant decreases in things like accidents and distracted driving.

In its apology post Friday Amazon also said the original tweet ""wrongly focused only on our fulfillment centers."" In 2018 an author went undercover at an Amazon fulfillment center in Britain and alleged that workers there urinated in bottles for fear that regular bathroom breaks might cost them their job. Amazon disputed that claim. In its Friday post the company said fulfillment center workers can take bathroom breaks whenever they need to.

""A typical Amazon fulfillment center has dozens of restrooms and employees are able to step away from their work station at any time"" the company said in the post. ""If any employee in a fulfillment center has a different experience we encourage them to speak to their manager and we'll work to fix it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYW1hem9uLWFkbWl0cy1wZWVpbmctaW4tYm90dGxlcy1wcm9ibGVt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon admits the 'peeing in bottles thing' is real and promptly deflects blame,"Amazon admits that its truck drivers do have a bathroom break problem. Credit: dpa/picture alliance via Getty I

After almost two weeks of saying ""No our workers definitely do NOT have to pee in bottles while at work!"" Amazon has admitted that sometimes its workers do have to pee in bottles.

The company's original claim was a sassy reply to U.S. Representative Mark Pocan on Twitter who had tweeted criticism about Amazon calling itself ""progressive"" when it is famously anti-union and amidst workers' complaints about insufficient bathroom breaks.

On April 2 Amazon published a blog post apologizing to Pocan and called its tweet reply an ""own-goal"" and saying ""we're unhappy about it.""

The blog post goes on to acknowledge that the tweet was incorrect because the company had not accounted for its driver population who may have a hard time getting to a bathroom because of rural routes or closed public restrooms due to COVID-19.

While the company acknowledged that insufficient bathroom breaks are a problem for their drivers it also emphasized that it's not just Amazon drivers. Rather it's a ""longstanding industry-wide issue.""

Firsthand accounts from Amazon workers however tell a different story. ""We’re pressured to get these routes done before night time and having to find a restroom would mean driving an extra 10 minutes off path to find one"" an unnamed Amazon worker told Vice. Another worker told Vice that there's incentive to cut corners and be faster since the most productive drivers get more hours.

Amazon insists that workers at fulfillment centers have ample bathrooms available and are allowed to step away from their work stations at any time. But again posts on social media have shown otherwise.

As for Rep. Pocan's reaction to the apology he's unimpressed. Pocan tweeted his response asking Amazon to prioritize its workers dignity.

In terms of acknowledgment Amazon admitting it was wrong and part of the ""industry problem"" is a step in the right direction but the company also undermined its own admission by overtly trying to both minimize the scope of the problem and deflect some blame. So yes the company has a long way to go before it can truly be as progressive as it claims.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzQvMy8yMjM2NTMzMC9hbWF6b24tYXBvbG9neS1wZWUtYm90dGxlcy13b3JrZXItd2FyZWhvdXNlLXVuaW9uLXBvY2Fu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon apologizes for lying about pee — and attempts to shift the blame,"On Wednesday last week the @amazonnews Twitter account tweeted the following back to Representative Mark Pocan:

This was an own-goal we’re unhappy about it and we owe an apology to Representative Pocan.

First the tweet was incorrect. It did not contemplate our large driver population and instead wrongly focused only on our fulfillment centers. A typical Amazon fulfillment center has dozens of restrooms and employees are able to step away from their work station at any time. If any employee in a fulfillment center has a different experience we encourage them to speak to their manager and we’ll work to fix it.

Second our process was flawed. The tweet did not receive proper scrutiny. We need to hold ourselves to an extremely high accuracy bar at all times and that is especially so when we are criticizing the comments of others.

Third we know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed.

This is a long-standing industry-wide issue and is not specific to Amazon. We’ve included just a few links below that discuss the issue.

Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide we would like to solve it. We don’t yet know how but will look for solutions.

We will continue to speak out when misrepresented but we will also work hard to always be accurate.

We apologize to Representative Pocan."

Dell and American Airlines specifically called out Texas Senate Bill 7 and its version in the House House Bill 6 while AT &T took a broader look at the complexity of elections the responsibility of lawmakers and a broader ""responsibility to engage.""

""Instead of seeking to limit access governments should provide innovative pathways for citizens to have their voices heard. Legislation like HB6 does the opposite and we are opposed to it"" a statement from Dell that added that voting rights had been especially ""hard-earned"" by ""women and communities of color"" said.

State Senate Republicans advanced SB7 in the early hours of Thursday morning. The legislation proposes changing existing voting rules including shortening early voting hours and banning drive-through voting which was popular among heavily populated diverse areas when voters cast ballots in November.

The Senate bill also prohibits election officials from sending out mail voting applications to voters if they did not individually request the forms and requires disabled voters to provide specific proof of disability from the federal government or a physician.

That same day the Texas House Elections Committee heard testimonies about their chamber's version of the bill. While HB6 echoed the Senate bill's provisions regarding mail ballot solicitation it also included new rules for how voters could be assisted with filling out their ballots and expanded the access poll-watchers could have within polling places.

American Airlines directed its statement at the Senate bill saying it included ""provisions that limit voting access.""

""To make American's stance clear: We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it. As a Texas-based business we must stand up for the rights of our team members and customers who call Texas home and honor the sacrifices made by generations of Americans to protect and expand the right to vote"" the statement said.

Although none of the companies explicitly indicated an intent to explore economic ramifications against the state or its Republican lawmakers if the bills were made into law their statements were a signal that some of the biggest corporate stakeholders -- and employers -- in Texas are keeping track of the bills.

In a statement issued on the heels of American Airlines' comment Texas Lieutenant Gov. Dan Patrick alleged the airline giant's government relations representative called his office minutes before and ""admitted that neither he nor the American Airlines CEO had actually read the legislation.""

""Texans are fed up with corporations that don't share our values trying to dictate public policy. The majority of Texans support maintaining the integrity of our elections which is why I made it a priority this legislative session"" Patrick said.

The Republican-led focus on ""election integrity"" comes just months after voter turnout reached new heights across the Lone Star State in the lead-up to the pandemic-era 2020 election -- and after Texas Democrats laid out their roadmap for flipping the state blue in coming years.

Texas-based voting rights advocates decried the efforts as being especially detrimental to voter groups that traditionally make up Democrats' base.

""These bills if passed are going to make it harder [to vote] and aim specifically to suppress minority voter turnout. They would undermine the ability of local election officials to encourage voter participation and they create new barriers for voters themselves"" U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey a Democrat from Texas said of the bills on a press call with reporters.

Meanwhile some disability advocates say the parameters set by SB7 would make disabled voters face an equivalent of a poll tax given that not every disabled person who is eligible to vote is also able to present an official documented diagnosis like the legislation demands.

With high political stakes on the line Charlie Bonner a spokesperson for the grassroots group MOVE Texas suggested the legislative push could ultimately backfire on Republicans.

""I think what we've seen time and time again is Texans hate a cheater. They see what's happening now -- that Gov. (Greg) Abbott and his cronies in the House and Senate can't win on the issue so they're trying to change the rules. People see that and they understand what's happening"" Bonner told reporters during a recent call.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zcGlyaXQtZWN1YWRvci1hbWVyaWNhbi1qZXRibHVlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spirit Cites Ecuador Routes In Complaint Against American-JetBlue Alliance,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zcGlyaXQtZWN1YWRvci1hbWVyaWNhbi1qZXRibHVlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbWlsbGlvbnMtYWlybGluZS1taWxlcy1jcmVkaXRzLXRvLWV4cGlyZS1ob3ctdG8tc2F2ZdIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbWlsbGlvbnMtYWlybGluZS1taWxlcy1jcmVkaXRzLXRvLWV4cGlyZS1ob3ctdG8tc2F2ZS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of airline miles credits set to expire: How to save them,"The vaccine rollout is creating a post-pandemic travel boom and many people are finding the more than yearlong lockdown has left them with flight miles and credits on the verge of expiring.

An estimated 20 million vouchers are available and “those are adding up to an estimated $10 billion in future airline credits now set to expire” he warned.

Southwest Airlines on the other hand will extend credits to September 7 2022 but only for flights planned from March 1 through Sept. 7 of last year. The downside is ""once you rebook it it's going to reset the clock and that's going to expire a lot sooner"" Knutsson said.

To prevent losing your airline credits and track the money owed to you from the airlines Knutsson offers some advice.

How to save your airline credits

1. Check the fine print of credits and vouchers

The expiration date is usually the day it was ticketed not the day you were set to fly.

2. Screenshot the credit from the airline site for your records

Save a picture of the credit so it's easily accessible for future use.

3. Add the expiration date to a calendar reminder

Save the date and set a reminder for 30 days before the credit is set to expire. You can add your screenshot to the calendar reminder as well.

Knutsson also shares a few resources for customers who are ready to start traveling again and want to save money as demand picks up.

U.S. corporations face growing pressure and threats of boycotts to publicly oppose Republican-backed election legislation in Georgia and other states that critics say harm the voting rights of Black Americans.

The opposition intensified on Friday when Major League Baseball announced it would no longer hold the 2021 All-Star Game in Atlanta this summer with commissioner Robert Manfred saying the league ""fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box.""

GOP Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp last week signed an election overhaul bill into law that adds new identification requirements for absentee voting while giving the state legislature increased oversight on how elections are run.

The legislation prohibits third-party groups from giving food or water to voters who are waiting in line and places strict guidelines on the availability and location of ballot drop boxes. It also mandates two Saturdays of early voting leading up to general elections. Only one day was previously required.

Civil rights groups and activists have pressured some of Georgia's biggest corporations including Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola  to oppose the law. Coke and Delta did not vocally oppose the legislation prior to its passage but their CEOs have since condemned the law.

Following the bill's passage pressure on companies started to increase after Merck CEO Ken Frazier and other Black executives organized a public campaign to urge firms to call out the legislation. Many companies had taken broad stances in support of voting rights but sought to avoid taking specific positions on the Georgia law.

It's unclear whether a business community backlash will change the outcome in Georgia where the law has been passed. Civil rights groups have challenged it in court and President Joe Biden said the U.S. Justice Department would examine the law which he called an ""atrocity.""

Coke CEO James Quincey told CNBC on Wednesday the company had ""always opposed this legislation"" and called it ""wrong.""

""Now that it's passed we're coming out more publicly"" Quincey said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL3Jldmlldy11bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtNzg3LTgtcG9sYXJpcy1idXNpbmVzcy1jbGFzcy0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: United Airlines 787-8 Polaris Business Class [2021],"In February I traveled to London on United Airlines to attend a funeral. My outbound journey was via Chicago O’Hare and inbound journey via Washington Dulles. Both flights were on a 787-8 though I had the old configuration on the outbound flight to London Heathrow and new configuration on the inbound flight to Washington Dulles. Rather than write two separate reports I will consolidate both United Airlines flights into this single 787-8 business class review.

United Airlines 787-8 Polaris Review

Outbound: UA931 – United Airlines 787-8 Polaris Business Class Chicago to London (Old Configuration)

My trip was on Sunday February 7th. After arriving from Los Angeles I crossed the very crowded neon-lit underground walkway to my gate to London.

The gate area was practically empty at boarding time with less than 10 passengers waiting to board. Up until departure I was the only passenger in business class. At the last minute one other passenger upgraded or purchased a ticket.

That meant two passengers in business class and 12 in economy class…on a 787-8 aircraft with 36 seats in business class and 183 seats in economy class.

United is in the process of retrofitting its 787-8 fleet but work is not complete. This flight featured United’s old Rockwell Collins (B/E) Diamond business class seat configured in a 2-2-2 configuration. The business class cabin was divided in half with three rows (18 seats) in the front cabin and three rows in the rear. A galley and lavatories separate the two cabins.

I chose seat 3L the window seat in row three. The other passenger chose seat 1A. I could have moved to the rear cabin and had totally to myself but there was really no need…I could not even see the other passegner.

The crew was London-based and most had British or European accents. Gun the purser welcomed me onboard and took wonderful care of me during the flight. She deserves a post of her own so stay tuned for that. The entire crew was lovely and attentive (though that was to be expected in a 36-seat cabin with only two passengers).

As we took off from Chicago I explored the in-flight-entertainment options. Along with noise-cancelling headphones there was a selection of movies and TV shows. My objective however was to eat and then sleep so I did not partake in any viewing.

Amenity kits were present at each seat but I did not bother to open mine and left it behind…I’ve got more than enough at home. Contents include Sunday Riley lip balm and skin cream toothbrush toothpaste pen ear plugs socks and eyeshade.

Dinner choices were salmon beef or pasta. No menus were distributed. I chose salmon and it turned out to the same dish I had from San Francisco to Sydney in late 2019 served with Thai coconut risotto. Packaged bread mixed nuts and a salad were also served with mango ice cream for dessert.

After dinner I changed into my pajamas (I usually won’t do that for a short transatlantic flight but since I knew there would be no wait for the lavatory prior to landing decided to change) and then went to sleep.

United offers Saks Fifth Avenue bedding including a plush pillow cooling gel pillow and soft duvet. Slippers were proactively offered and a mattress pad is available upon request. For this flight I grabbed an extra pillow from the seat next to me and really made myself a cocoon.

Highlight of the flight: I slept until 36 minutes prior to landing. Gun then gently nudged me awake and served breakfast. Talk about personalized service! I’ve been on far too many flights where the pre-arrival service begins 90 minutes prior to landing which may be necessary when the cabin is full but robs you off a lot of sleep on a short 7.5-hour flight.

Breakfast choices were an egg and leek quiche in a tortilla cup with mushrooms and sausage or French Toast. I had both! Coffee was strong and served in a nifty to-go cup. I skipped the fruit cup yogurt and croissant. United please bring back fresh fruit! Still it was a nice breakfast.

We landed in London before the sun rose and I was soon on my way down to Winchester for my funeral.

Note: the arrivals lounge was closed.

Inbound: UA919 – United Airlines 787-8 Polaris Business Class London to Washington (New Configuration)

The following day I headed back home…yes it was a very short trip but I was honored to be part of the funeral for a very special man. My original plan was to fly via Newark onboard the 777-300ER and then connect to LAX on the 787-10 but I opted to sleep in instead have breakfast with my family then take the later flight to Washington Dulles even though it meant a 737 from Dulles to Los Angeles without lie-flat beds.

It was snowing outside! First time I’ve ever seen snow in London…

I took the Tube to the airport which was a painless ride and I had the carriage to myself for most of the journey.

I did not leave much time which turned out to be a good thing. Arriving at T2 I presented my negative COVID-19 test at the check-in counter obtained my boarding pass and passed thru security with bolding set to commence only minutes later.

Although its website indicated the Lufthansa Lounge was open it was actually closed. The only lounge in the terminal that was open was the Plaza Premium Lounge which I have reviewed in the past.

Today I had no time and proceeded directly to my gate where boarding had not only commenced but was complete. The door shut behind me as I walked onboard.

This flight featured United’s new business class onboard the 787-8 with 28 seats in Polaris business class (seven rows in a staggered 1-2-1 configuration) as well as a 21 Premium Plus (premium economy) seats and 194 seats in economy class. Yes United has squeezed a lot more seats in its retrofitted 787-8s at the expense of business class and EconomyPlus (extra legroom economy).

I find the new Polaris seats much more comfortable (and obviously more private) than the older seats. I settled into my seat took my shoes off put my slippers on and sat back.

Prior to takeoff the aircraft was de-iced which took over 40 minutes. It seems they are not used to this at LHR!

During that time I browsed the IFE library which included an updated interface compared to my outbound journey and a more responsive system. The movie and TV selection was the same.

Once again the flight featured a London-based crew though these were all Americans (based upon accent). Not that it mattered…they provided excellent service as well.

I was up late and up early to get my work done prior to the flight so again the goal was to maximize sleep on this flight.

After takeoff lunch was served. I ordered beef which is usually very good out of London (and very bad out of other European stations). The meal arrived covered on one tray with mixed nuts a salad packaged bread roll and the main course with carrots potatoes and parsnips.

The cabin went out about half full. I was still hungry and asked if I could have a pasta too and was cheerfully obliged. It was cheese ravioli with tomato sauce and asparagus.

The vanilla ice cream for dessert was very good and frankly far better than the old ice cream sundae service (better quality ice cream).

Inflight wi-fi was available though I did not need to connect. A flight pass without data cap cost $31.99.

After using the lavatory I slept for the next several hours.

Prior to landing a light meal was served with a choice between hamburger Wellington or vegetables with couscous and pesto sauce. I had not seen the vegetables on the menu before and ordered that. It was delicious! A perfect simple light heathly dish.

I left the muffin but ate the banana. This new dish is a winner.

I noticed that United has installed permanent hand-sanitizer stations in its cabin. Expect these onboard all flights eventually.

We landed in Washington Dulles on time and another United trip across the pond and back was in the bag.

CONCLUSION

Although the meals are not nicely presented this was a really nice trip on United. The crews were fabulous the food tasty and I slept like a baby on both flights. It’s a great time to fly internationally. The 787-8 in either configuration is recommended though if traveling solo you’ll appreciate the retrofitted cabin much more."

The Englishman was an emissary of the Dutch and had been dispatched to chart a new passage to Asia where the Dutch West India Company wanted to expand its trade. Hudson ultimately failed at that task but his journey laid the groundwork for the Dutch colonization of New York.

""It would have been so beautiful"" said Eric Sanderson a landscape ecologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York. ""From the water Manhattan would have been this long thin wooded island with sandy beaches on the shore growing up to taller hills and cliffs on the West Side. You probably would have seen a little bit of smoke from the Lenape people in lower Manhattan."" In the autumn you might have spotted hawks migrating down the Hudson River whose waters would have held an abundance of porpoises and whales Sanderson told Live Science. Sanderson is known for his work combining historical accounts with maps of New York City to build up detailed pictures of the metropolis's historically lush landscape before colonists arrived.

Also abundant in 17th-century New York were beavers — a fact that Hudson would have conveyed to his Dutch colleagues. That precipitated the arrival of thousands of people from Holland who called their new home “New Amsterdam” and set in motion a fur trade of epic proportions. At the time beavers' velvety pelts were valued in Holland for the production of hats: the lucrative trade became the basis of an ongoing relationship between the Dutch and the region's Indigenous inhabitants — among them the Lenape and Mahican peoples — wherein hundreds of thousands of pelts were provided by hunters in exchange for metal cloth and other valuable items from the Dutch.

But in the following decades accounts emerged of a different trade that went far beyond beaver skins and ultimately shaped the history of New York. In 1626 the story goes Indigenous inhabitants sold off the entire island of Manhattan to the Dutch for a tiny sum: just $24 worth of beads and ""trinkets."" This nugget of history took on such huge significance in the following centuries that it served as ""the birth certificate for New York City"" Paul Otto a professor of history at George Fox University in Oregon wrote in a 2015 essay on the subject.

Yet the details remain slim on exactly how this momentous exchange occurred and why the people who had inhabited the land for centuries gave it up so easily. Today the question remains: Is this all-important piece of history even true?

Related: Why was whaling so big in the 19th century?

Where's the evidence?

The first known mention of the historic sale comes from a 1626 letter penned by a Dutch merchant named Pieter Schagen  who wrote that a man named Peter Minuit had purchased Manhattan for 60 guilders the Dutch currency at the time. This information fits within a crucial period of New York's history.

During this time the Dutch — growing rich off the beaver trade and dependent on the Native Americans to propel their industry — were trying to secure their dominance in the New World against other European competitors. This motivated them to secure territory far and wide across Manhattan Brooklyn Governors Island and Staten Island.

Some accounts of the sale suggest that the individuals who sold Manhattan were Munsees a subtribe of the Lenape people — though that's not confirmed. This marks just the first of several uncertainties about the information in Schagen's letter. Most notably it isn't primary evidence; Schagen's text discusses the sale of Manhattan but there's no known paper record of the exchange. Schagen himself had never even been to New York said Johanna Gorelick manager of the education department at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. ""[Schagen's letter] is the only piece of evidence we have — the only document. Whether you call it a piece of evidence is questionable.""

The letter contains no details of the individuals involved in the sale nor the precise date of the exchange. ""We don't really know what happened"" Gorelick said. Even the one detailed piece of information — the 60-guilder value of the trade — has been warped through time and misinterpretation into $24. That figure was taken from a history book published in 1846 and has somehow remained unchanged since then. Adjusted to present-day value 60 guilders would be the equivalent of more than $1000 today. Furthermore there's no indication of what that money represented in terms of traded goods though many accounts have perpetuated the questionable idea that native people sold their homelands for little more than a few ""trinkets.""

The absence of evidence doesn't mean the exchange didn't occur however. Trading land was actually common during this period; there are many cases in which there is much more convincing evidence that land was exchanged in some way between Native Americans and the Dutch. For instance there are several formal land deeds signed by Native American sellers and Dutch buyers for the purchase of Staten Island in 1630 for parts of Long Island in 1639 and also for Manhattan again in 1649.

But considering that it's become the defining symbol of New York City's ""origins"" that first purported 1626 sale ironically seems to be the least reliable account we have. Even assuming the historic transaction did go ahead there are other factors that make it unlikely that Manhattan was traded so straightforwardly as the story suggests.

What counts as a ""sale""?

Historians have dissected the various accounts of land sales across 17th-century New Amsterdam and have concluded that broad cultural differences in the understanding of property rights and ownership would have muddied what it really meant to ""sell"" land.

Some historians have noted that land trading and ideas of private landownership were not uncommon features in the economies of native people . But as well as that land was more commonly understood as a space to be shared among different groups or in some cases leased between them. Less common was the idea that land might be sold and permanently relinquished to another group — which was the driving principle behind European ideas of property and ownership.

""The Dutch came with a certain idea about property that was not the idea of the Indigenous people"" Sanderson said. ""And yet those agreements that were struck in those early years in the 17th century are still the agreements that underlie all the titles in New York City today.""

To the Native Americans who signed title deeds it's likely that the documents represented an agreement that the Dutch could share the land or lease it for a limited period — which might also explain why the modest payment doesn't match the magnitude of what was seemingly being acquired by the Dutch. The trade may also have represented a guarantee of safe passage for the Dutch through the area. What's less likely is that Indigenous Manhattanites knowingly engaged in the irrevocable sale of their ancestral home.

In this light the real question becomes not so much whether the 1626 sale happened but rather what it signified — and for that matter the significance of any sale that took place in 17th-century New York. ""I don't think the exchange itself is in question. I think the meaning of that exchange is in question"" Gorelick said. This raises the question of whether the purported ""sale"" of New York would even be legal in today's terms.

Historic accounts also suggest that the effects of land sales in New Amsterdam rarely resulted in the direct short-term removal of Native Americans from the land who in many instances occupied the land alongside the Dutch for a while. But these sales likely did create an ideological shift in colonists' minds over who was really in control . That served the Dutch for 40 years until 1664 when they were finally edged out of New Amsterdam by the English who moved in and named it New York. Battles over landownership grew more complex and intensified across the landscape and over the following decades many Native Americans were gradually displaced.

The magnitude of the myth

The account of Manhattan's founding sale is it would seem more falsehood than truth. Why then has the story persisted for so long? Like any good legend its colorful details — the $24 worth of trinkets and beads — have kept people captivated over the centuries. These details have also had a troubling effect on how the story has been interpreted.

The misleading $24 figure makes the payment seem pitiably small. Over numerous recountings and as shown in dozens of paintings  there's been an emphasis on the idea that ""trinkets"" were all that native people received in return for their ancestral home. That has created an impression of Manhattan's Indigenous inhabitants as guileless unsophisticated people who were oblivious to the value of what they had Gorelick said — an offensive interpretation that couldn't be further from the truth.

""Native people were extremely extremely scrupulous traders"" she said. ""They didn't just take what was offered to them. There are great accounts from Europeans at the time which said 'This color cloth is not desired by native people. They would prefer this other color cloth.' [Native people] were very much orchestrating how and what was traded in those early years.""

By perpetuating the misconception that Manhattan was so easily and willingly let go the story might have served another purpose: to help justify why things are as they are today — why some people and not others find themselves in positions of power Sanderson believes.

""I think the myth of the purchase of Manhattan served the powers that be for so long and that's why it persisted and that's why people kept telling it"" Sanderson said. But 2024 will mark the 400th anniversary of New York's official colonization by the Dutch in 1624 and Sanderson thinks this might prompt a reckoning over the real facts of Manhattan's ""sale.""

""It's one of these founding myths that people took very seriously in the 19th century and started to make fun of in the 20th century"" Sanderson said. ""I think in the 21st century we're going to see a full repudiation of that story.""

The New York Times has examined and annotated the law identifying 16 provisions that hamper the right to vote for some Georgians or strip power from state and local elections officials and give it to legislators.

Republicans passed and signed the 98-page voting law last week following the first Democratic victories in presidential and Senate elections in Georgia in a generation. President Biden won the state by just 11779 votes out of nearly five million cast. The new law will in particular curtail ballot access for voters in booming urban and suburban counties home to many Democrats. Another provision makes it a crime to offer water to voters waiting in lines which tend to be longer in densely populated communities.

Below is The Times’s analysis of the law including the specific provisions and some struck-through language from the state’s previous voting legislation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMS8wNC8wMy9hd2Vzb21lbHktd2VpcmQtYWxpYmFiYS1ldi1vZi10aGUtd2Vlay0yMDAwLWVsZWN0cmljLWhvcnNlbGVzcy1jYXJyaWFnZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Awesomely Weird Alibaba EV of the Week: $2000 electric horseless carriage,"Electric vehicles aren’t exactly new technology – they’ve been around essentially since as long as cars have been around. So I guess I shouldn’t be that surprised to find what appears to be a Victorian horseless carriage with a hidden EV drivetrain.

What does surprise me is just how cheap it can be. But of course that’s a running theme on Alibaba the internet’s backroom storage unit. And with a vehicle this out of the ordinary you better believe it’s making my Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week series this week!

While it seems a bit silly at first I think our friends over at Xuchang Hengyisheng Commercial Co. Ltd may be on to something here with this dandiest of urban runabouts.

They realized that if carriages were grand enough 150 years ago who says they can’t work today?

To be fair we’ve got everything we need here that you’d find in a modern electric car. There’s seating for four passengers plus a driver independent suspension there’s a steering wheel an optional convertible top and even a hand brake to match that hydraulic foot brake.

This probably wouldn’t be my first choice for an electric drifting vehicle from Alibaba but it’s nice to know they give you the option with a hand brake!

Okay so perhaps it’s a bit spartan compared to a Tesla but at least this carriage more closely matches something that good ol’ Nikola would have ridden in himself!

The top speed of 30 km/h (18 mph) may not scream performance car but that 2000W motor is going to be spinning its copper guts out just to get those giant wheels rolling. And to be frank I’m not sure I want to go much faster than that – partly to give people ample time to check me out and also because I don’t want to find out what happens when the wheels come off at high speed and turn this thing into Santa’s sled instead.











By today’s standards the five bricks of 12V 80Ah lead acid batteries may sound quaint. But that nearly 5 kWh battery pack would have been delightful back when a dapper carriage like this would have rolled off the lot.

Folks if we’re not looking at the absolute peak in mid-19th century vehicular design then I don’t know what else it could be.

The clean white paint job is even nicely embellished with those gold accents to carry Cinderella to the ball in style. Though my publisher is taking bets on whether the gold foil will last all the way to her pickup at midnight.

And if the open top breezy carriage isn’t your style the vendor has you set with Cinderella’s own enclosed carriage.





Pricing varies based on the exact style of carriage you’re interested in but starts at a surprisingly reasonable $2000.

If you’re wondering how they get your new carriage to you it actually seems to box up nicely.

Or they could put it on a flatbed truck which creates one of the funniest juxtapositions I’ve seen in a long time.







Wait a second before you click that ‘Buy now’ button

As much as I love window shopping on Alibaba and her sister site AliExpress take a pause here before you start loosening those purse strings.

I’ve made plenty of purchases on Alibaba before but I always advise fellow shoppers to take their time and communicate clearly with vendors. You want to make sure you know exactly what you’re getting. It’d be a shame if your new carriage turned into a pumpkin before you received it.

And of course be prepared for surprises along the journey. Not only could there be unforseen fees during the shipping process but you could face longer wait times than you expected.

From supply chain issues to some of the largest ships in the world trying to perform a K turn in the middle of the Suez Canal expect the unexpected.

But if you’re a brave lad and fancy taking a risk I’ll spend my three fairytale wishes on sending you good luck. Don’t worry about it I’m happy to help. You can simply repay my kindness by being my fairy godmother and sending me my own carriage too!

And if anyone should get sucked down the Alibaba rabbit hole like I do and find their own awesomely weird electric vehicle on the site feel free to send me a link – I might just feature it in one of my weekly columns! You can find my contact info in my author bio below.

The effort led by Kenneth Chenault a former chief executive of American Express and Kenneth Frazier the chief executive of Merck is a response to the swift passage of a Georgia law that they contend makes it harder for Black people to vote. As the debate about that bill raged in recent weeks most major corporations — including those with headquarters in Atlanta — did not take a position on the legislation.

Combining South Korea’s gastronomic heritage with the cook’s international experiences Meta has distinguished itself as Asia’s most up-and-coming restaurant winning the American Express One To Watch Award as part of Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants 2021. This is its story

The cliché that reading a book can change your life is as old as the invention of printing. But had Sun Kim not picked up a copy of Tetsuya in the late noughties the South Korean-born chef would never have moved from Seoul to Sydney at the age of 26 unable to speak English but determined to bag a job at Tetsuya Wakuda’s world-famous restaurant.

And if Wakuda hadn’t eventually given Kim an interview after he’d fired off 20 job applications the young chef would likely have returned to South Korea to restart a career cooking Italian food. Instead today Kim’s Singapore restaurant Meta is picking up the American Express One to Watch Award for Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants 2021 sponsored by S.Pellegrino & Acqua Panna ahead of the list’s announcement on March 25.



Meta's South Korean-inspired dishes: jeju abalone (left) and cabbage chawanmushi (right)



The restaurant’s name is an abbreviation of ‘metamorphosis’ and Kim’s culinary journey has been nothing if not transformative. He caught the chef bug watching his mother cook in the Korean restaurant she owned in Seoul. When the time came to don his own chef whites Kim was drawn to the simplicity of Mediterranean food and was making a name for himself in some of Seoul’s smartest Italian restaurants until his encounter with that copy of Tetsuya.

“I first saw Tetsuya’s cookbook in 2008” says the cook. “The idea of a Japanese chef cooking modern Australian cuisine was completely new to me and something that that I wanted to learn. I read the book every day until I got to the point where the only way I could learn more was to move to Sydney and work with Tetsuya himself. That was my dream job.”

He worked at Tetsuya’s for two years as a junior sous chef before taking on the same role when Wakuda launched Waku Ghin in Singapore in 2010. “Tetsuya is still my mentor and my biggest inspiration” says Kim. “I worked alongside him in Sydney and Singapore and I was inspired by how he blends Asian and Western technique. The most important thing I learned from him was to focus on the flavour and to always use fresh ingredients which is what I wanted to do when I opened my own restaurant.”



Chef Sun Kim at his restaurant Meta



The Korean cook was offered the executive chef job when Meta launched in 2015 after the chef the restaurant’s investors had lined up couldn’t get his work permit sorted. He had a month to recruit his kitchen brigade as well as get his head around what to put on the menu. “It wasn’t easy and I wasn’t ready” he admits.

Early reviews of the restaurant while by no means terrible picked up on the ambivalence of a chef who had yet to commit to the food he cooked. Gradually however Kim began to look for inspiration in the dishes he had watched his mother prepare back in Seoul and grafting them on to the contemporary technique has had been taught at Tetsuya’s. He had learned English to communicate in an Australian kitchen. To find his voice at Meta the chef returned to his Korean roots. As Kim’s cooking became more confident so the reviews became ever-more glowing.

The chef describes his style of cooking today as “based on French technique with Asian passion from Korea”. He also describes it as “hearty”. This might come as a surprise to anyone who has tried his refined take on East-meets-West cuisine. But when Kim says hearty he means from the heart – and his heart is in Korea.



Kim's barbecue shortrib dish



“We’re introducing Korean elements to dishes rather than serving kimchi with everything” he explains. “It’s more about promoting Korean flavours.” Take for instance a dish of barbecue Wagyu beef short rib with clay pot rice which Kim says is beef done the Korean way.

“Some Korean ingredients like gochujang and kimchi are overpoweringly spicy and sour” he explains. “I try to balance the flavour and keep the textures. We slow cook the beef short rib for 30 hours with soy sauce and a bit of onion and garlic. Then we barbecue the beef with a sauce made with pear garlic soy sauce and apple. We serve the rice on the side with a chive and garlic crumble to give a crunchy texture.”

Kim’s other signature dish at Meta is a Korean take on chawanmushi a Japanese savoury egg custard. “We purée cabbage and blend it with an egg mixture to make a custard. On top of that we have pork trotter jus which we mix with our homemade kimchi. Then we put fresh uni [sea urchin] on top and a bit of condiment such as a truffle lime zest and finger lime from Australia.”



Meta's home at 1 Keong Saik Road



Meta moved to its current site in 2018 in part because the previous premises focused on a long eating counter were too narrow to be conducive to five- and seven-course tasting menus which change every three months. When number one Keong Saik Road – the premier address on Singapore’s most prestigious restaurant row – became available Kim finally had the opportunity to craft every aspect of the Meta experience.

The chef had a big hand in the design of the airy dining room where warm woods on the walls and floors offset the sombre grey-leather seating. “There is also a lot of natural light” he says. “Whenever I walk into the restaurant it feels like home.” The dining room accommodates 25 diners with a further six seats for customers who want to get up close and personal with the team of 10 chefs in the open kitchen.

Kim admits that pivoting to takeaway during Singapore’s three-month lockdown in 2020 was an even greater challenge than opening Meta and that winning the American Express One to Watch Award this year means even more to him because of the challenges of operating in the current climate. Having closed his causal spin off Kimme when coronavirus hit in 2020 would he consider growing the Meta brand?

Boy Was I Wrong.,"Other communities of color other historically marginalized groups have made meaningful gains and long-lasting progress after vocally challenging the status quo. Asian Americans must do the same.

Georgia the state where my family runs their chicken farm and calls home has been ground zero for an AAPI awakening—one that started even before the Atlanta shootings and which helped Joe Biden win the state. But even so amassing real political power has proven difficult. The political parties still don’t perceive the AAPI community as having as strong a pipeline of political talent or as much influence as other groups. That’s despite in the last election record AAPI turnout record AAPI elected officials and surrogates record fundraising and engagement. At the highest levels of government we are still unseen—without a single executive department head.

Amassing power is risky. It involves the kind of public conflict that many of us have been taught to avoid. But it’s also the only real way to change the political and bureaucratic structures that don’t take us seriously.

In my own life this was a long and painful realization learned after years of trying to climb the ladders of U.S. policy and global politics. It didn’t matter what grades I got; what prestigious internships fellowships or jobs I held; the personal and familial sacrifices I made for the team the organization and the mission. I found myself stuck unable to reach the leadership roles others were promoted into. I wasn’t on a ladder. I was on a treadmill working hard but going nowhere. Like the broader AAPI community I was hiding within structures that weren’t working for me—that didn’t take me seriously. The challenge for me—and for the wider political community I’m part of—is figuring out when and how to say “enough” and to fight those structures instead.



***

My first memory of politics was watching the1992 presidential debate between President George H.W. Bush Bill Clinton and Ross Perot with my mom. I was enthralled. So often I would hear talk about the future first Black Latino or woman president. But never once had I heard chatter about an Asian president. I asked my mom whether I could run for president one day. She paused and whispered to me “Being in politics is dangerous. And they don’t think we’re American. Just focus on school.”

I assumed she was exaggerating about the danger but I soon learned she was right about the rest. The next month I thought about running for fifth-grade class president at my suburban elementary school. When I told one of my classmates he tersely explained that “no one would vote for someone who eats dog.” Later I found a drawing on my desk of me devouring a four-legged furry friend. Kids erupted in laughter. I cried in the bathroom by myself until someone asked me if it was because of my math scores.

I never ran for public office. But I still wanted to get involved in public service. I thought that representing our country overseas as the son of refugee chicken farmers would best capture what makes America so special—the American dream. In 2004 I got my first big internship at the State Department in the Bureau of Public Affairs. The weekly intern brown bag lunches were the highlight of the experience where we got to meet senior officials and political appointees. Our speakers would go around and ask us what we did. I was often the only minority there and when they got to me without fail they asked what part of Asia I worked on. I got the message loud and clear: the broader reaches of foreign policy and statecraft were not for people like me.

Recent reporting about the State Department’slack of diversity shows that progress hasn’t been made since. In fact it’s gotten worse. Today only 13 percent of the senior executive service comes from communities of color. For those who make it in the door assumptions can cut both ways: Representative Andy Kim (D-N.J.) recently said that when he was at State he was banned from working on issues related to the Korean Peninsula. Can you imagine if the State Department banned its large proportion of employees with European descent from working on European affairs? Or assumed that any white employees must clearly specialize in Europe?

Personally I came to a conclusion I know many peers reached as well: If I wanted to succeed in public service in the United States I needed not just to distance myself from my Vietnamese American background but to actively run away from it.

My winding career then took me to Capitol Hill the United Nations international aid work in Afghanistan and several global nonprofits. In these jobs I noticed three trends. First every boss I had was white. Second many minority peers ended up leaving because they didn’t think there was a promotion in their future. Third there were zero mentorship opportunities for me. Being Asian American in this line of work was incredibly lonely.

Congress was particularly challenging. While 2021 has historic diversity among its elected ranks the senior staffstill lags in diversity. Asian American staffers report difficulty in securing promotions because of “perceived meekness.”

In 2014 I moved to Sacramento to work in external and cabinet affairs for California Governor Jerry Brown. Overseeing a portfolio of policy matters and departments was challenging and fulfilling work in a state that has 40 million residents and the world’s fifth-largest economy. But I also took a lot of meetings with unhappy organizations and associations ornery lobbyists and neglected elected officials and staffers. I found early on that many parties tried to take advantage of me. Perhaps it was because I was new to state politics. Or maybe they thought an Asian would be more likely to cave. Many times the promises we agreed on were broken. The meetings were often hostile and sometimes threatening.

That might just sound like hardball politics but it was more than that. I know because I eventually instituted a buddy system. I started taking meetings with a non-Asian colleague sitting alongside me. It paid off. The meetings became less adversarial and agreements were respected. The people I met with were usually surprised that I was of equal rank to my colleagues or that I was the lead on the given issue. I once told a retired elected official about my rules of engagement and she nodded in familiarity and grinned in resignation: I was doing exactly what women like her had done in the 1980s when they recruited men to accompany them to meetings as backup.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmljaWoub3JnL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL3BhbmFtYS1wYXBlcnMvZml2ZS15ZWFycy1sYXRlci1wYW5hbWEtcGFwZXJzLXN0aWxsLWhhdmluZy1hLWJpZy1pbXBhY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five years later Panama Papers still having a big impact,"Five years ago today the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and more than 100 media partners around the globe began publishing an investigation that would become a byword for exposing financial chicanery and political corruption: The Panama Papers.

Citizens hit the streets in protest. They threw bananas and yogurt in Iceland and rocks in Pakistan. Governments fell. Authorities launched hundreds of tax probes and criminal investigations.

“This is an earthquake” CNN columnist Frida Ghitis said at the time. “The aftershocks will continue for months even years to come.”

She was right.

Half a decade later the Panama Papers’ revelations about how the offshore financial system enables greed and treachery continue to roil political and economic systems worldwide.

In just the past month alone more than 300 news articles in 14 languages referenced the Panama Papers as authorities continue to pursue investigations and push for reforms a search of the Nexis news database shows.

Among the Panama Papers-related developments in the month of March:

In Malta authorities charged Keith Schembri former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s chief of staff with money laundering and fraud as a result of an investigation sparked in part by the Panama Papers — and a court heard more testimony about the car-bomb assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia a Maltese journalist who used evidence from the trove of documents in her exposés of high-ranking government officials.

In Peru Rafael López Aliaga a presidential candidate came up empty in his push to get a court to halt a continuing investigation of his role in a Panama Papers-related money laundering case.

In Denmark the country’s tax minister cited the Panama Papers to justify hiring hundreds of new employees to bolster the fight against tax fraud.

In the U.S. prosecutors revealed the third guilty plea in a tax fraud case that came to light through the Panama Papers and lawmakers cited the Panama Papers to support the push to enact two landmark pieces of legislation now before Congress — the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act and the For the People Act a voting rights bill that’s being called “the boldest democracy reform since Watergate.”

Beyond individual countries the Panama Papers has become a global touchstone of the debate around corruption financial crime and inequality. It is cited in parliaments and courthouses and movie studios.

Just as Watergate became both a landmark in the history of journalism and a shorthand for political tricksterism the Pulitzer Prize-winning Panama Papers investigation has inspired many journalists to embrace a new kind of leading-edge journalism — and its alliterative name has come to serve as a shorthand for financial perfidy by the globe’s ruling elite.

“On a personal level there was a before and after Panama Papers in my journalism career” said Mariel Fitz Patrick an Argentine journalist who worked on the investigation. She was shocked by the number of journalists around the planet — more than 370 from 76 news organizations — who worked in secret on the project for more than a year. In Argentina she told ICIJ recently “that experience would mark a new path for us in the way we do journalism and in our future investigations.”

In the broader world actor Meryl Streep who starred in the Netflix movie “The Laundromat” heads a growing list of popular culture stars who have brought the shadowy mechanics of offshore-enabled financial crime into homes and common parlance through works that reference the Panama Papers — cartoons films quiz shows such as “Jeopardy!” and National Public Radio’s “Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me” and television series such as “Billions” and “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.”

Financial experts meanwhile continue to fret over the risks of “another Panama Papers” or whether a “new Panama Papers” is needed to keep up the fight against dirty money. An anti-corruption consultant advised in December: “High net worth individuals need to take certain proactive steps to avoid being lumped together with Yakuza crime bosses and kleptocrats in the aftermath of the next Panama Papers-type scandal.”

The Panama Papers’ revelations also continue to resonate for transparency advocates around the world according to Lakshmi Kumar policy director at Global Financial Integrity a U.S.-headquartered research and advocacy group.

The crimes and case studies unearthed by the media partnership’s investigation have provided colorful easy-to-explain fodder for groups like hers that work to persuade government authorities to embrace tougher standards for financial accountability and transparency.

“The Panama Papers woke everyone up” Kumar said in an interview this week. “It was the first big thing that everyone remembers … Even five years down the road those examples that the Panama Papers revealed are just as relevant. They haven’t gone out of fashion.”

A massive leak

ICIJ and its partners began publishing their explosive Panama Papers disclosures at 2 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on April 3 2016.

ICIJ McClatchy the Miami Herald German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung and other media partners spent more than a year sifting through 11.5 million leaked files to expose offshore holdings of current and former world leaders and more than 100 other politicians and public officials across the globe.

The files which Süddeutsche Zeitung obtained and shared with ICIJ and other partners came from Mossack Fonseca a little-known but powerful law firm based in Panama with branches in Hong Kong Zurich and dozens of other places.

The law firm’s leaked internal files contained information on 214488 offshore entities connected to people in more than 200 countries and territories. The data included emails financial spreadsheets passports and corporate records revealing the secret owners of bank accounts and companies in 21 outposts in the offshore system from Nevada to the British Virgin Islands to Singapore.

It was in short a treasure trove for investigative reporters — and for anyone interested in knowing how the rich and famous and corrupt and criminal play with their money offshore. Former South African President Thabo Mbeki called the revelations “a massive blow to financial secrecy.”

“Panama Papers” quickly became the No. 1 trending item on Twitter worldwide. In the first several weeks 72 stories and data products produced by ICIJ were visited more than 80 million times by people in more than 200 countries and territories. Media partners’ stories reached an audience that numbered in the hundreds of millions across digital print and broadcast.

A cartoon in the New Yorker magazine showed a businessman looking out of the window of his office with his young heir at his side surveying the smokestacks and office towers of his empire: “Son someday soon this will all be exposed in the Panama Papers.” A Sunday edition of the iconic American newspaper comic Doonesbury showed a high-ranking official from the fictitious nation of “Berzerkistan” learning that he’d been exposed in the Panama Papers as having salted away $1.835 billion offshore. “SO THAT’S WHERE I PUT IT!” he exclaims.

Some real-life politicians lost their jobs — even their freedom.

Iceland’s prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned following nationwide protests after revelations that he and his wife owned a company in the British Virgin Islands. Politicians in Mongolia Spain and beyond also fell.

In 2017 Pakistan’s Supreme Court removed from office the country’s longest-serving prime minister Nawaz Sharif as result of the Panama Papers’ revelations about his family’s properties overseas. A year later he was sentenced in the case to 10 years in prison on corruption charges and fined $10.6 million.

Follow the money

From Day 1 of the Panama Papers governments around the world traced whatever previously hidden dollars euros yen and other currencies they could. Countries have recouped more than $1.36 billion in unpaid taxes fines and penalties as a result of inquiries sparked by the Panama Papers according to ICIJ’s latest tally.

In the last two years ten countries including Australia Belgium Denmark Germany and Italy reported recovering more than $185 million in new money as a result of Panama Papers-inspired investigations. Norway for the first time disclosed that it has clawed back almost $34 million. Hundreds of tax probes against individuals and companies remain open according to reporting gathered by ICIJ and its partners.

Parliaments — embarrassed by the revelations or seeking to harness public outrage to plug fiscal holes in budgets drained by tax evasion — have enacted new laws.

The government of Panama which initially denounced the Panama Papers as a campaign to “distort the facts and tarnish the reputation of the country” ultimately signed a multilateral convention to share foreign taxpayers’ information with other nations. New Zealand tightened its trust laws to prevent further abuses by foreigners attracted by the country’s once pristine reputation. Since then the number of so-called foreign trusts in New Zealand has plummeted 75%.

In the United Kingdom members of parliament repeatedly referenced the Panama Papers when passing legislation in 2017 that created the country’s first criminal offense for lawyers who do not report clients’ tax evasion. Last September Ghana’s registrar general said that the Panama Papers was instrumental in his government passing a new law that required owners of companies in Ghana to identify themselves. Ghana is now one of 81 countries to approve such laws — more than double the number since 2018.

In the U.S. the Panama Papers helped persuade Congress to write and pass the Corporate Transparency Act which requires owners of U.S. companies to disclose their identities to the Treasury Department. The legislation the biggest revision of American anti-money laundering controls since the post-9/11 Patriot Act was signed into law in January.

Gary Kalman the head of Transparency International in the U.S. who lobbied for the bill said that the Panama Papers and the so-called “Emma Watson Effect” were especially useful.

For years opponents of ownership registries argued that celebrities millionaires and other high-profile citizens needed anonymous companies to avoid the paparazzi — or even kidnappers. The example of Watson the Harry Potter film star who the Panama Papers revealed owned an offshore company for what her representatives said were “privacy reasons” helped Kalman give legislators a concrete example of why registries posed no risk to law-abiding citizens.

Under the new U.S. law Kalman said celebrities or high profile people would be confidentially revealed to the U.S. government but their names would not be publicly available. “Bottom line if you are not doing anything illegal there is really no reason to fear a beneficial ownership directory” he said.

Not everyone was happy with the new law.

“Some will say that this all started in 2016 when a Panamanian law firm made headlines” a Forbes contributor wrote in January complaining that the new law had “killed off Incognito Mode” in the world of business. “The information in these documents was so scandalous that ordinarily boring legal documents took on a snappy moniker: ‘the Panama Papers.’”

The moniker has also become a catchword beyond the realm of politics and government.

I think it is fair to say that the Panama Papers project introduced cross-border journalism to the world. — Jóhannes Kr. Kristjánsson Icelandic journalist

The Panama Papers have been referenced in thousands of academic papers including articles such as “Speaking Truth to Power: Twitter Reactions to the Panama Papers” in the Journal of Business Ethics and “Structural studies of the global networks exposed in the Panama Papers” in Applied Network Science.

The Panama Papers even pops up in an August 2016 article in the European Journal of Political Theory titled “Aristotle and the problem of oligarchic harm” and in a 2018 review in an organizational studies journal that explores the “speculative anthropology” of novelist David Foster Wallace.

At least a dozen books have been published about the Panama Papers — including one by Frederik Obermaier and Bastian Obermayer the German journalists who obtained the leaked data and another by former ICIJ journalist Jake Bernstein “Secrecy World” which became the inspiration for filmmaker Steven Soderbergh’s movie “The Laundromat” starring Streep Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas.

At the movie’s September 2019 premiere at the Venice International Film Festival Streep said the film sought to use humor to tell a “very dark black-hearted joke — a joke that’s being played on all of us” by the clients and operatives of the offshore world.

Global journalism

The Panama Papers continues to be cheered too as a pathbreaking model for international reporting and collaborative journalism.

Jóhannes Kr. Kristjánsson an Icelandic journalist who did the digging within and outside the document trove that brought down his country’s prime minister spent almost a year working in his apartment unable to tell anyone else in his small nation what he was doing.

He says his in-laws “really thought I was just a lousy bum or something not working on anything.”

In his lonely striving he leaned on the support of “great journalists all around the world” — project partners who were also secretly sleuthing through the same document set. Some remain his close friends five years later.

One regret with the project is he never got a chance to taste the ice cream flavor — Wintris — that a local shop in Reykjavík named after the offshore company secretly controlled the Panama Papers showed by the prime minister and his wife.

Kristjánsson believes the kind of global collaboration among journalists that made the Panama Papers investigation possible is a crucial weapon in the defense of democracy.

“I think it is fair to say that the Panama Papers project introduced cross-border journalism to the world” Kristjánsson told ICIJ this week. “It is a really powerful tool when journalists in many countries work together on the same story and publish at the same time. This is extremely important for journalists in countries where human rights and press freedom are violated.”

Fitz Patrick one of five Argentine journalists who initially worked on the Panama Papers said the project inspired her to continue to delve into issues related to money laundering and international financial crimes. And she said it inspired the Argentine reportng partners to continue to work across the lines of news outlets’ traditional rivalries — treating each other as allies instead of adversaries.

“Working with a competing media company? That was unthinkable until that moment in Argentina” Fitz Patrick said.

A 2018 article in the International Journal of Communication said that the Panama Papers and ICIJ’s next offshore secrecy investigation — the Paradise Papers — have helped show the way to a new kind of international reporting that wrestles with an increasingly complex and networked world.

Traditionally the article notes international journalism has been “foreign correspondence” which brings back home to a domestic audience news from far-away lands about elections trains crashes and other one-off events.

In contrast the piece says ICIJ’s “global network journalism” goes beyond the “traditional national comfort zone” by bringing together journalists from around the planet to deeply analyze and expose murky transnational systems like the offshore world.

This kind of reporting is vital in an era when dirty money can move halfway around the world with the click of a computer key and offshore operatives are adept at hiding wealth behind Russian doll-like configurations of front men shell companies and trusts.

“My reporting on the Panama Papers and other subsequent leaks has made me realise how broken the international system is” said Jacob Borg a Maltese journalist who has been shoved and insulted while reporting on what he calls the “mafia-like tentacles exposed by the Panama Papers” in his small European country.

Last month — 59 months after the Panama Papers investigation was released — Maltese authorities charged Keith Schembri the powerful chief of staff to the country’s prime minister from 2013 to 2019 with fraud and money laundering. The Panama Papers revealed that Schembri owned two secretive offshore companies. He resigned in 2019 after police questioned him during a probe into the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia who had earlier connected Schembri’s offshore dealings to corruption.

“Whilst dirty money flows easily across borders it often takes local authorities weeks months and years to catch up and gather information about these illicit flows” Borg said. “Collaborative journalism has proven to be a lot more efficient.”

SMP Automotive Systems Alabama plans to add a third facility to its Tuscaloosa County operations.

“Tuscaloosa County is proud to be the home to now three SMP facilities” said Mark Crews the chairman of the Tuscaloosa County Industrial Development Authority. “This project enhances the company’s footprint in our community while enhancing job opportunities and advancements for our citizens.”

The international automotive supplier a subsidiary of Samvardhana Motherson Group produces exterior and interior components for vehicles manufactured at the Mercedes‐Benz U.S. International plant in Vance along with providing logistics and other services. More than 1900 people now work at the company’s two Tuscaloosa County plants.

SMP's third facility will be in the Cedar Cove Technology Park adjacent to the company's first plant Tuscaloosa County plant. The company's second plant is at the Brookwood Parkway.

The new facility will have about 112 employees including at least four new hires. Other positions are expected to be filled by workers who will transfer from the first plant.

Tuscaloosa County Industrial Development Authority on March 30 approved a tax abatement package for SMP's new facility.

According to a news release SMP will receive an abatement of the non‐educational sales and use taxes for purchases of equipment and building materials during the construction phase of the project. SMP will invest $4.195 million in equipment and building materials.

TCIDA officials say the company will be eligible for tax abatements in an estimated amount of $263958. During the first 10 years of operations the project is estimated to contribute almost $200000 in tax revenue in non‐abated taxes including education taxes from initial purchases alone.

In addition TCIDA estimates the project will contribute more than $800000 over the next 20 years in certain taxes generated from the company and direct employee spending identified through TCIDA’s standard evaluation process.

“SMP and the Motherson Group’s continued investment in our community echoes the partnership that was established in 2015 with the company’s first investment” said Danielle Winningham TCIDA executive director. “As our region’s automotive sector grows and advances TCIDA and our many partners continue to work together to support the success of MBUSI and our automotive suppliers while creating new good- paying jobs for our community.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvYXByLzAzL3JhaXNlLW15LXRheGVzLW5vdy10aGUtbWlsbGlvbmFpcmVzLXdoby13YW50LXRvLWdpdmUtaXQtYWxsLWF3YXnSAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL2Fwci8wMy9yYWlzZS1teS10YXhlcy1ub3ctdGhlLW1pbGxpb25haXJlcy13aG8td2FudC10by1naXZlLWl0LWFsbC1hd2F5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Raise my taxes – now!’: the millionaires who want to give it all away,"Abigail Disney has always been very very rich or as she describes it “too rich”. The money came with her name: she is the granddaughter of Roy Disney who with his brother Walt founded the Walt Disney Company in 1923. Disney 61 refuses to say how much she has but acknowledges she would have been a billionaire in her own right had she not realised in her 20s that it was her fortune that was making her miserable and decided to start giving it away.

She has been donating to good causes ever since – $72m (£52m) and counting mostly to groups helping women in prison women living with HIV and victims of domestic violence. But giving it away is no longer enough. She wants the tax collector to take more money not only from her but from “all of the absurdly rich people across the world”.

“We’ve long known that the world is hugely unequal” says Disney. “But now the pandemic has really shown it to all of us and no one in all conscience can continue to ignore it.” Disney is speaking over Zoom from San Francisco. Today she looks more hippy chic than heiress: her light-brown hair falls in long gentle curls and there is a discreet peace dove tattooed on the inside of her wrist.

“It is like when your kids have a bath and you pull the plug out and slowly all the little toys at the bottom are revealed” says Disney. “That is what has happened here: now we all know what is going on under the surface.” As well as killing more than 2.5 million people the pandemic and global lockdown response has plunged some 150 million more into “extreme poverty” according to the World Bank. The Washington-based institution described Covid-19 as “a heat-seeking missile speeding toward the most vulnerable in society”.

“Throughout the pandemic the poorest have been forced to continue going to work risking their lives while the rich stay at home” Disney says. “And those going to work in life-saving essential jobs are paying more [proportionally] in tax than the wealthy who are safe at home.”

Disney worries that society risks slipping back into a “Dickensian world” unless the really rich realise “we are all humans at the end of the day and we need to look after each other. You know these billionaires are modern-day miserly Ebenezer Scrooges. Because they are looking straight at Tiny Tim and saying: ‘No fuck you I won’t pay for your crutches’” she says. “It may sound extreme but they really are.”

Abigail Disney is part of a small but growing group among the super-rich calling for a wealth tax to help fund the recovery from the pandemic. The Patriotic Millionaires movement of which she is a longstanding member and key spokesperson started in 2010 with only a handful of signatures on a 163-word open letter including the musician Moby and Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream co-founder Ben Cohen. It has grown into a global organisation with more than 200 members including Chuck Collins heir to the Oscar Mayer hotdog fortune; Morris Pearl a former managing director at BlackRock; Danish-Iranian billionaire Djaffar Shalchi; and Sir Stephen Tindall the founder of New Zealand’s largest retailer the Warehouse Group. They describe themselves as “proud traitors to their class” united in their concern about the “destabilising concentration of wealth and power”.

These members argue that instead of leaving the super-rich to splash their billions on philanthropic vanity projects such as opera houses and museums higher taxes should be used to fund public services welfare and tackle growing inequality. Disney wants taxes on the super-rich to fund universal medical treatment and education in the US and throughout the world. This week she will help launch the UK and European chapter of Patriotic Millionaires pressuring world governments to “raise taxes on people like us. Immediately. Substantially. Permanently”.

Disney does not have a fixed idea of exactly how a wealth tax should work or at what rate it should be set; she just wants it to start now. “Yesterday is not soon enough” she says as her dog Forkie a morkie (a cross between a Maltese and Yorkshire terrier) crashes into her tablet. (Her other dogs are called Quincy and RBG after Ruth Bader Ginsburg; Disney was a fan of the late supreme court judge who she described as “the soul of social change”.)

Wealth is meant to feel like the magic answer right? But after a certain point it starts not being true

Of the wealth tax Disney says: “I think it should kick in at around $50m [£36m] and up. Something has to say: ‘OK you’re fine. Right now we need to figure out how to help all the people who aren’t fine and your money is going to pay for it.’”

An annual wealth tax of just 2% on those with more than $50m – as proposed by US senator Elizabeth Warren – would raise more than $4tn enough money to overhaul the entire US public education system. Warren amended her plan this month to call for a 3% “Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act” targeting people with more than $1bn to help pay for the economic pain the pandemic has caused. “The ultra-rich and powerful have rigged the rules in their favour so much that the top 0.1% pay a lower effective tax rate than the bottom 99%” Warren said. “And billionaire wealth is 40% higher than before the Covid crisis began.”

Disney says she “loves” Warren and dismisses arguments from those on the right who claim a wealth tax would drive the rich overseas. “It would not prevent anyone from wanting to live in the United States and would not prevent anyone from being wildly more wealthy than anyone ever needs to be.” In her ideal world there would be a cap on personal wealth but even she thinks that is too radical an idea to propose making into law. “I think there is such a thing as too much money” she says. “And I think that’s a billion. In fact I don’t really know how you couldn’t figure out how to live a very nice life on $999m. So anything over a billion feels to me like a mistake.” In Disney’s fantasy universe the world’s billionaires – there are now 2189 according to a report by Swiss investment bank UBS – would be declared “the winners of capitalism” but would not be able to make any more money.

The UBS study shows that billionaires (the top 0.000028%) “did extremely well” during the coronavirus pandemic growing their fortunes to a record high of $10.2tn (£7.8tn) more than three times the annual economic output of the UK. Elon Musk the maverick co-founder of electric car company Tesla who was the 35th richest in the world pre-Covid is now the second-richest person ever to have lived behind Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. Both men have fortunes of more than $180bn each – roughly twice the GDP of Kenya.

Disney realised she had too much money when she was studying first at Yale University and then for a PhD in English literature at New York’s Columbia University in the early 1980s. “Inheriting a fortune can fuck you up it really can” she says. “I spent my 20s and 30s trying to dig out from under the anxiety and guilt that came with it. People don’t like it when wealthy people talk about this because wealth is meant to feel like the magic answer to every question right? ‘If only I had XYZ money everything would be all right’ – and that is true for poor people.

“But after a certain point it starts not being true.” She falters slightly searching for the right words. “Money becomes its own preoccupation. I think of it as like a really fancy dog that you have to constantly be brushing. And so you get sucked into it. From the time I was 21 years old I spent far too much time with accountants lawyers and estate attorneys talking about and thinking about my money: where it was why it was there did it need to change and what the tax implications would be.”

Disney talks about how growing up she and her siblings (she has two brothers and a sister) never had to queue for anything. “You know if you never have to stand in line it makes you act differently” she says. “And you begin to wonder about everything. Are people more interested in what you have to say because of what you have? Are they letting you think you’re funnier than you really are? Having no one who will tell you the truth about yourself… I mean that really corrodes.”

It was around this time that Disney’s family morphed from very rich to uber-rich. Michael Eisner had taken over as chief executive of the Disney company which had been struggling for years after the deaths of Walt and Roy Oliver Disney in 1966 and 1971 respectively. Eisner turned its fortunes around by revitalising its animation division and buying up Marvel Pixar and Lucasfilm. Soon Disney was producing critically acclaimed and money-spinning films: Beauty And The Beast (the first animated film to be nominated for a best picture Oscar) and The Lion King. Disney’s share price soared throwing off huge dividends to Abigail’s father Roy Edward Disney a major shareholder. In 1994 alone Eisner was paid a record-breaking $203m.

Suddenly Abigail says her family changed. Her dad bought a private plane: not a small jet but a Boeing 737 with queen-size beds and an onboard shower. She rebelled by refusing to get on the plane and by starting to give her money away.

Disney lives most of the time in New York with her husband Pierre Hauser. They met at Yale and were married at Columbia University’s St Paul’s Chapel. Their joint charity the Daphne Foundation aims to end poverty in the city. A nameplate on Disney’s desk reads: “Feminist AF”. She also runs the documentary company Fork Films producing or providing funding for films about issues she believes in such as Pray The Devil Back To Hell about a female-led peace movement in Liberia; and Crip Camp about a summer camp for people with disabilities recently nominated for an Oscar. “I’m sort of like a deliberately terrible businesswoman” she says explaining that her loss-making projects are a way of giving money to creative people who need it.

If you’re making more than £200000 a year you should be paying more tax. It is not going to make you poor is it?

As she has grown more confident Disney has begun speaking up against pay inequality at the Walt Disney Company describing then-chief executive Bob Iger’s $65m paycheque in 2018 as “insane”. “If your CEO salary is 700 600 500 times your median workers’ pay there is nobody on earth – Jesus Christ himself isn’t worth 500 times his median workers’ pay” she said at the time. Iger now Disney’s executive chairman actually earned 1424 times the median Disney worker’s pay that year – almost triple Abigail’s guesstimate. He defended it as “a one-time grant” for his role in overseeing Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox and at a Vanity Fair event in 2019 acknowledged that the country needed to address inequality. “I think we have to figure out if there’s a tax plan that makes sense that transfers more wealth from a small set of individuals to a larger set of individuals” he said.

The Walt Disney Company’s lowest-paid staff began seeking Disney out as their potential saviour. One worker whose job was to dress up as Cinderella in the “magic happens” parades wrote that she couldn’t afford to pay her rent and was sleeping in her car. “It kills me” Disney says “because as a child I went there with my grandfather. Now I may have rose-tinted glasses when looking back but there was an almost reverence for him and he had such a rapport with the people who worked there. He would be horrified.” Disney says unskilled labourers like many of the thousands working at Disneyland and Disney World are effectively “endless unnamed interchangeable parts that can be replaced at any time”.

Her activism enraged her parents who worshipped at the shrine of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher’s neoliberal capitalism. Both her parents were alcoholics: Roy Edward died in 2009 and her mother Patricia in 2012. “My parents were quite conservative and so we were in conflict a lot” she says. “I have a brother and a sister who are very very supportive and are right there with me.”

Though Disney doesn’t fly by private jet she still leads a life of unquestioned luxury with a taste for expensive wines at exclusive restaurants (when they’re open) and designer shoes. She says her biggest extravagance is her home in Ireland a 15th-century castle that sleeps 26 people. Soon after we speak Disney Hauser and their dogs embark on a new adventure: driving across the US in a van joining the craze that has exploded in popularity during the pandemic. “Haven’t left the city yet but we are already sacked out and happy. #vanlife” she wrote on Instagram alongside a picture of her and Hauser glued to their phones in the back of the van.

The Patriotic Millionaires group has no membership card or secret handshake but members need assets of at least $5m or an annual income in excess of $1m to join. Founder Erica Payne a political strategist who worked on Bill Clinton’s inaugural committee has said that as well as being rich and progressive the members have another thing in common: they all “hate the name”.

“Every time we have a gathering we have 30 minutes set aside so they can bitch about it” she said last year. “And then at the conclusion of the 30 minutes I tell them we’re not going to change the name.” It was designed to attract attention particularly from those on the right in the US: “You’re patriotic and you’re a millionaire.”

Six British millionaires have so far signed up to the UK chapter demanding that the government urgently address inequality here. They describe “shocking” Office for National Statistics data showing that the richest 1% of Britons hold almost a quarter of the nation’s wealth at a time when poverty is rising. London recently overtook New York as home to the highest concentration of dollar millionaires in the world: about 875000 people or one in 10 while 2.5 million Londoners are classified as living in poverty.

The British members set out their purpose in July last year in an open letter under the banner Millionaires for Humanity with other signatories including the screenwriter and director Richard Curtis: “No we are not the ones caring for the sick in intensive care wards. We are not driving the ambulances that will bring the ill to hospitals. We are not restocking grocery store shelves or delivering food door to door. But we do have money lots of it. Money that is desperately needed now and will continue to be needed in the years ahead as our world recovers from this crisis.”

Among them is Gemma McGough 40 from Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire who made millions from the sale of a startup exploiting wireless technology. When I speak to her over video in her home office she is juggling running a new company with home-schooling three children.

McGough wants the government to tax her – and other high earners – at a rate as high as 75% to help the country’s pandemic-ravaged public finances. “The economy is so damaged from Covid I am happy to pay my share” she says. “If you’re making more than £150000 or £200000 a year you should be paying more. If you’re earning £200000 paying a higher rate of tax on earnings above that is not going to make you poor is it?”

Currently the highest tax rate in the UK is 45% on earnings above £150000. But many of the highest earners also use complex schemes to legally reduce the amount they pay. The chancellor Rishi Sunak used the budget to raise billions of pounds by freezing tax thresholds and thus dragging 1.3 million middle-income earners into higher tax brackets angering backbench MPs. Instead the group argues more should be taken from the super-rich. McGough and the other British Patriotic Millionaires would also like to see a big increase in inheritance tax and capital gains tax plus a new wealth tax.

Three prominent economists recently recommended the introduction of a one-off tax on anyone with more than £500000 in assets including property. The Wealth Tax Commission suggests a 1% tax on those individuals for five years could raise £260bn – enough to fund the NHS for a year. Such taxes are beginning to be introduced in Argentina Bolivia and Morocco to help pay for the recovery. In Norway about 500000 people pay an 0.85% charge on their assets above the value of about £125000. The prospect of such a tax in the UK is rich people’s second-biggest fear after the virus according to Knight Frank’s wealth report. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Sunak have both dismissed the suggestion.

McGough says she finds it hard to understand wealthy people fighting not to pay more tax. “It is an issue of morality: why are we comfortable with the wealthy continuing to get wealthier? If we allow it to go on ultimately there will be civil unrest” she says.

McGough whose mother was a cleaner and father a painter-decorator grew up poor: her family did not have a car until she was 10 and there was no central heating. She shone at school but her parents asked her to get a job to help with the rent rather than go to university. By chance her first job at 16 was in the soon-to-be booming world of radio frequency technologies. “It just really suited me” she says. “I went on to start a business doing it.” Back then her “motivator was to make money” because she desperately wanted to go travelling. Her first big trip was in an overland truck from Victoria Falls on the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia to South Africa.

McGough was so busy building her company which certified new RF technology products that she didn’t get a chance to think about how much money she was making – until advisers kept offering to help her lower her tax bill with creative accounting. “It is quite a toxic environment but you’re busy. It’s only afterwards that you realise it always seemed wrong. There should be pride in being a higher-rate taxpayer. Now my politics are very leftward leaning.”

She says rich people who are known to avoid tax should be seen as “social pariahs … a national disgrace not heroes”. Some of the wealthiest Britons are no longer based in the UK which allows them to make significant tax savings. Sir James Ratcliffe the UK’s richest person and a high-profile Brexiter last year quit Britain for tax-free Monaco. It has been estimated that the move will ultimately save him £4bn in tax payments. Other rich Britons who have moved to Monaco include the former Topshop boss Sir Philip Green and his wife Tina; the property billionaires Simon and David Reuben; John Hargreaves the founder and chairman of Matalan; and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton. In 2019 John Caudwell the billionaire founder of Phones4u vowed to join them in Monaco if Labour was elected and raised taxes.

Like Disney McGough says her parents “struggle” with her views. “They were very excited that I became such a success and very proud of that” she says. “But after I sold the business and became much more socialist they found it hard to understand the shift. When you are poorer the pursuit of money is important and it was seen that I had won the game of life. “Yes you have won but there are still people living on the streets people living in circumstances you can’t imagine across the world” she says. “You can’t consider yourself a winner when losing has such terrible outcomes.” McGough says her parents are slowly coming round. “They are happy that I’m doing what I want but they do find it odd.”

Gary Stevenson 34 is another member of the UK branch of Patriotic Millionaires. He made his first million when he was 24 betting on the outcome of Greece’s financial crisis in 2011. He was a senior economist at Citibank and placed a series of bets that would pay out if global inequality increased. The bets made him he claims the most profitable Citibank trader in the world that year earning it $35m. He made the same bet on yawning inequality in 2012: again it paid out.

“It put me in a weird space” he says wearing a grey hoodie in his minimalist kitchen in Limehouse close to the heart of the City of London. “I was making loads of money from the fact that the world economy is going to be fucked for ever. I rolled it around in my head for a year or two before deciding I had to quit.”

Stevenson says the decision was hard because making a lot of money had been all he wanted to do. “I was quite poor growing up – we lived in a small terrace house by the railway line in Ilford and as a family we couldn’t afford for me to go on school trips and stuff. You get judged on how much money you have so I went out and made it a lot of it.”

After he quit banking Stevenson went on to study economics at the University of Oxford to learn more about what could be done to redress global inequality. He didn’t find the answer among the spires. “It’s just a bunch of posh people in caps worried about continuing to be rich” he says. “Change isn’t going to come from there.” Stevenson believes increasing tax on the wealthy is the only answer. “The problem is that rich people save most of their income so it does not trickle back into the economy. Whereas ordinary people spend most of their income. Companies are only going to expand if they are spending.

I want to live in a world where everyone can help themselves and can get those high-paying jobs like I had

“Tax is the most important thing it’s the only way that poorer people can have a chance of catching up” he says. “I’m not talking about huge taxes on high earners like doctors or lawyers I’m talking about going after the families who have been keeping their money for ever. These families have hundreds of millions of pounds and money makes money so it’s just going up and up. I was paying 45% tax on my earnings but the Duke of Westminster was paying next to nothing on his billions of inheritance.” The heirs of the sixth Duke of Westminster paid no inheritance tax on the bulk of his £8.3bn family fortune after his death in 2016. His son Hugh Grosvenor 30 inherited the title and became one of the world’s richest people as the major shareholder of global property company Grosvenor Estates which owns swathes of properties in the West End Mayfair and Belgravia in London as well as estates in Cheshire Lancashire and Scotland.

Stevenson dismisses arguments that the Patriotic Millionaires could follow the example of people such as Bill Gates or MacKenzie Scott former wife of Jeff Bezos who gave away almost $6bn last year donating through philanthropy rather than higher taxes. He admits he could help his friends from comprehensive school back in Ilford who are working as teachers fashion designers and actors. But he says “helping them individually isn’t enough. I want to live in a world where everyone can help themselves. Where people from poor backgrounds can get those high-paying jobs like I had.”

Stevenson won’t say how much money he has now only that he has “enough to retire and not work again”. He hasn’t given much to charity but says he is using his money to push for economic change. The only way to do this he says will be if the majority of people are told how badly the decks are stacked against them “and they get really fucking angry about it. People don’t realise how rich the rich are and that the rich don’t pay much tax” he says. “People think I’m a billionaire people think I’m like Jay-Z. But I’ve got nothing compared to the truly rich.”

For her part Abigail Disney thinks low-paid workers are already very angry and that change will only come if the rich turn on each other. “My grandfather would never have paid himself over 1000 times what his median worker was being paid” she says. “There were no laws against him doing it it was just not an acceptable thing to do. He certainly wouldn’t have been put on the cover of magazines and told he was a genius.” Iger has graced the cover of Fortune and Time magazine. “This is who we are worshipping now” Disney says. “The norms have shifted and the country will follow the tone set by business – that’s always been the way in American life.”

Disney says more rich and powerful people are joining the movement in spirit if not always formally signing up. “People want to take society back to a fairer time before it’s too late” she says. “But the question is will they have the courage to go up against their own class? That’s the hardest thing in the world to do – for a liberal to criticise liberals for a businessman to criticise businessmen. I know from personal experience; I have made myself very unattractive to the wealthy. But we need them to start calling each other out.”"

Set on a 75-acre patch of land with a cabin and a barn the three-storey Sauna Tower is formed of a concrete sauna that functions as a base for the stacked platforms made of Alaskan yellow cedar.

The wood-burning sauna is reached via a grassy slope with stone-slab steps cut into the hillside. A small porch shelters a log pile next to external furnace doors.

An outdoor lamp lights the doorway and the sauna's chimney extends past the stone roof and up the side of the tower. Inside the sauna is lined with cedar and heated by a Nippa wood-burning stove.

Resting partly on top of the sauna the timber tower has a simple frame with Y-shaped beams supporting two levels of platforms.

Mesh porch screens form a permeable barrier around the middle floor allowing the air in while keeping insects out.

This outdoor living space is furnished with tables and chairs from Meccano Home a furniture collection based on the popular children's mechanical toy.

At the top floor of the tower is a lookout spot with open sides sheltered by a slanting roof. Slim metal railings form understated safety barriers around both levels.

A set of floating stairs made of steel beams with timber treads connects to a metal bridge which leads from the first floor of the tower to a ledge next to the cabin. An internal ladder can be climbed to reach the topmost viewing platform.

BarlisWedlick built Sauna Tower to accompany the sustainable cabin and a barn that the practice had already built on the same site.

""The materiality of the Sauna Tower mimics the fundamental materiality of the cabin"" said BarlisWedlick cofounder Alan Barlis.

""It's a strong foundation with a delicate timber frame structure atop but as a counterpoint to the carefully controlled envelope of the Passive House cabin.""

Sauna Tower was the last of the projects completed on the site.

""We first tackled the barn program by salvaging and relocating a century-old barn from a nearby town"" Barlis told Dezeen. ""We then developed a Passivhaus-certified cabin.""

""And to complement the cabin siting which was nestled within the forest at the top of a ridge we added the tower which reaches up to the tree canopy and offers additional views from the site's highest elevation.""

A century-old section of the Quemahoning Pipeline that has caused problems in the past for the Cambria Somerset Authority caused problems again in February.

At the authority’s March meeting held on Thursday board members discussed the need to find a source of funding and move forward with a plan to slipline the Quemahoning pipeline at the Foustwell Tunnel located about a mile east of Hollsopple.

A large break in the Foustwell Tunnel occurred on Feb. 9 followed by two more breaks in the 2300 foot pipeline. These were the most recent breaks in this pipeline which has been troublesome for about five or six years authority Chairman James Greco said.

“The majority of the breaks in the Que line occur at Foustwell” he said.

Two of the breaks have since been repaired but the third is located at the south end of the tunnel and cannot be safely reached until high water levels in the Stonycreek River subside Greco said.

In addition to the cost of excavation and repairs – which could total nearly $100000 when all the work is completed Greco said – the breaks have caused supply issues with the authority’s largest water customers: CPV Fairview in Jackson Township and North American Hoganas Gautier Steel and Liberty Wire all located in Johnstown.

North American Hoganas’s Johnstown plant was without water for three days at one point while repairs were underway Greco said. The authority has temporarily switched CPV Fairview to access its water from the Hinckston Reservoir while Gautier Steel and Liberty Wire are receiving their water supply through the Border Pipeline until the final repair at Foustwell can be made.

“This is nowhere near ideal for anybody” Greco said as the water quality they receive now is not as good as it was from the Quemahoning Reservoir. For example Gautier Steel has to clean the screens they use in their plant several times a week which affects their maufacturing process and costs them more money he said.

Water supply issues could also cost these businesses money in terms of meeting production quotas and filling customer orders.

“They understand we’re trying” Greco said when asked about their customers’ response to the situation. “We know it impacts water quality and service. We’re trying to do something but we don’t have the money.”

The sliplining project at the Foustwell Tunnel is estimated to cost about $1.5 million. Greco said the authority already operates at a $700000 deficit every year which is covered in equal amounts by loans from the Cambria and Somerset county governments. In addition the authority has another two years of payments to make on a current PennVEST loan.

County commissioners B.J. Smith from Cambria and Colleen Dawson from Somerset who sit on the authority’s board said the six county commissioners should meet and discuss how they can help to move the project forward.

“Maybe it’s time for the counties to get together and maybe apply for funding together” Dawson said. “But I think we should expend all possibilites before we go into additional debt.”

Cambria County already had its grant writer contact the authority to pursue grant options Greco said but they could not find any grants for which the authority could apply.

“Unfortunately the only thing we’ve ever been eligible for is PennVEST (loans)” he said. “I think at this point we’ve looked at every avenue (for grants) and we’re just not eligible.”

Even the PennVEST loan process takes at least a year to go through once an application is submitted Greco said.

A fourth water line break occurred in the Quemahoning Creek area in February and it was repaired authority Manager Earl Waddell said.

The problem with the Foustwell Tunnel also temporarily held up work on the exploratory dig that the authority approved in February to examine the condition of a Y fitting on the Somerset County General Authority’s connection to the Quemahoning Reservoir Waddell said.

In other business Waddell said the authority has received the necessary permits and approvals to proceed with the expansion project inside the Quemahoning Family Recreation Area.

These grant-funded improvements include widening its entrance expanding two of the parking areas inside the recreation area and adding three additional RV camping sites two more rustic cabins an additional shower house and some playground equipment.

This project is being coordinated by Summer’s Best Two Weeks aka SB2W the camp that manages the Quemahoning Family Recreation Area. Jason Smith from SB2W was unable to attend the authority’s meeting but sent an email that said SB2W was planning to start work soon on the additional RV sites and expanded parking areas.

Smith’s email also advised the board that a problem with the reservations page on the Quemahoning Family Recreation Area’s website has been corrected and that reservations are growing for the summer.",,,,,,,,,

Here's how drug firms are trying to fix it,"In his first years as an oncologist Jonathan Drachman treated people with kidney cancer and melanoma. There were few treatment options for them in the 1990s he says and cancer immunotherapy—the manipulation of a person’s immune system to kill off cancer cells—was still new.

In brief Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a potent human protein that can activate and also dampen the body’s immune response. Nearly 30 years after the US Food and Drug Administration first approved IL-2 to treat melanoma and kidney cancer a host of pharma and biotech companies are racing to the clinic with engineered versions of the protein that they hope will be safer and more precise than those in use today. Others are trying to harness IL-2’s immune-suppressive power to treat autoimmune diseases.

But there was a drug called Proleukin that for better or worse gripped his attention. Proleukin also called aldesleukin was a therapeutic version of interleukin-2 (IL-2) a small human protein called a cytokine that could attach to specific kinds of immune cells and stimulate them to grow and divide. Some of these immune cells could kill foreign invaders including cancer cells.

Proleukin was an early cancer immunotherapy and when it worked Drachman says it worked well. About 15% of people treated went into remission he says and of those up to 8% survived for years even decades. Drachman now the CEO of Neoleukin Therapeutics a company developing an IL-2-like therapy says he couldn’t have been more excited.

“It was one of the first immunotherapies that actually worked in anyone” he says.

But there was a catch. Proleukin could be dangerous. At a time when many cancer treatments could be taken without checking into the hospital Drachman says a person on Proleukin had to be admitted to the cancer ward and almost always the intensive care unit. With a half-life so short that it started disappearing almost as soon as the infusion was over the drug had to be given at high doses every few hours for days to be effective.

For many people that high dose induced shakes and chills as their bodies responded to the cytokine Drachman says. Many developed vascular leak syndrome: their blood vessels leaked fluid their bodies swelled their blood pressures dropped quickly and they became confused or lost consciousness altogether. Nearly 75% of patients treated with Proleukin eventually developed antibodies to the drug raising fears that the antibodies would decrease efficacy. Many people couldn’t tolerate the treatment.

For every person seemingly cured Drachman says there were as many who died of their cancers.

But Drachman kept thinking about those 15% of people who went into remission. He and others wondered how many more people IL-2 could successfully treat if researchers could figure out how to engineer out the toxicity. It would be years before technology would catch up—before biology computing and protein chemistry were advanced enough to build a better IL-2.

These new IL-2s have been attracting the drug industry’s attention and companies have inked a flurry of six- and seven-figure deals over the past few years to develop the molecules for the clinic. Many of these molecules aim to rev up the immune system’s cancer response. Others aim to calm the overactive response at the root of autoimmune diseases. But none of these tweaks is a sure shot. A few clinical trials of IL-2 drug candidates have failed or been canceled.

The big deal around IL-2



The IL-2 drug candidates under investigation are new proteins that don’t exist in nature. Some are molecules that resemble IL-2 but have amino acid changes that strengthen some actions and weaken others. Others are IL-2s with antibodies and other chemical compounds attached that thwart some immune interactions and facilitate others.

All are trying to solve therapeutic IL-2’s fundamental problems—a short half-life that requires toxic dosing levels nonspecific binding that stalls efficacy and causes side effects and a tendency to spur the production of antibodies that could affect the efficacy of the drug or native IL-2.

Some scientists say the clinical trials are as much a test of the technologies that have gone into these engineered IL-2s as they are of the candidates’ abilities to successfully treat cancer or autoimmunity.

Traditional IL-2 works says Giovanni Abbadessa an oncologist who leads early clinical development of cancer immunotherapies at Sanofi which paid $2.5 billion for Synthorx a biotechnology firm developing an engineered IL-2. But the cytokine could work better he says. The question is: Which of the many biochemical tweaks or chemical additions will overcome IL-2’s limitations—without creating new ones?

“I think it’s really fascinating to see how different companies have taken different technological strategies and approaches to find different ways to do the same thing” Abbadessa says. “And of course I’m afraid only clinical trials—larger clinical trials—will tell us which one is the better way.”

One molecule two cell fates

About 45 years ago while studying immune cells called T cells researchers working with Robert Gallo at the US National Cancer Institute discovered a molecule that made T cells grow and divide. It was originally called T-cell growth factor and was eventually renamed IL-2.

A few years later while trying to understand how IL-2 stimulates T cells to multiply a team at the National Cancer Institute that included Warren Leonard as well as a team led by eventual Nobel Prize winner Tasuku Honjo discovered a molecule on the surface of T cells to which IL-2 binds.

But when researchers tried to re-create the effect of that binding they couldn’t. IL-2 bound to that molecule (eventually called α) wasn’t enough to get T cells to multiply. It would take years and dozens of scientists to figure out that IL-2 stimulates immune cells in a complicated way using a receptor that can have two prongs β and γ or three α β and γ. It was eye opening that IL-2 uses a multiprong receptor Leonard says but it was even more revelatory when researchers later discovered that the way IL-2 attaches to the receptor is the source of its therapeutic potential.

“It was always in the back of our minds that this could be something of down-the-road therapeutic utility” Leonard says of understanding how IL-2 works. “But at least at the time we were driven by more basic-science considerations.”

IL-2 stimulates many kinds of immune cells including T cells and natural killer (NK) cells says Jamie Spangler a bioengineer at Johns Hopkins University who is developing antibody-coupled IL-2s as possible therapies. T cells can take on special tasks including becoming effectors which drive the immune response or regulatory cells restraining the immune response. Natural IL-2 stimulates both effector and regulatory T cells to multiply providing an army that allows the immune system to do its job but with checks and balances.

Indeed providing checks and balances seems to be IL-2’s most fundamental task Spangler says. During the years of unraveling how the cytokine works came a surprising finding: mice missing the IL-2 gene can still mount an immune response; IL-2 it appears has backups that can take the cytokine’s place. But Spangler says these mice have serious autoimmune problems.

It turns out that IL-2 binds very tightly to the α piece of the receptor which is primarily found on the regulatory T cells which dampen the immune response. And IL-2 binds less tightly to the β and γ pieces which are found on both effector and regulatory T cells. So binding to all three parts of the receptor allows IL-2 to stimulate cells that reduce the immune response. Binding to only β and γ allows IL-2 to ramp up the response.

In those mice that can’t make IL-2 other cytokines spur the multiplying of effector cells and the other immune cells which fight infection or cancer. But those same experiments suggest that IL-2 is critical in keeping the immune response in check.

Up until maybe 10–15 years ago we didn’t have the tools and the wherewithal to actually hone the activities of IL-2 in a targeted way. Jamie Spangler bioengineer Johns Hopkins University

What this means for IL-2 as a therapy is that building an IL-2-like compound that stimulates mainly effector cells to grow could spur a potent anticancer immune response Spangler says. And building an artificial IL-2 to preferentially stimulate regulatory cells could create something that mainly fights autoimmunity.

“It’s a fascinating molecule” she says of IL-2 “because it’s sort of got this two-faced function.”

But only in the past few years has the technology developed to allow scientists to take advantage of IL-2’s two faces Spangler says. “Up until maybe 10–15 years ago we didn’t have the tools and the wherewithal to actually hone the activities of IL-2 in a targeted way” she says. “I think that’s really what’s been a part of this whole renaissance.”

Bulking up a skinny cytokine

Most of the industry effort to modify IL-2 focuses on developing it for cancer immunotherapy says Nikolaos Sgourakis a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who studies the structure of cytokines. The scientists building IL-2 as a cancer agent are trying to make something that won’t bind to the α piece of the receptor or are trying to boost IL-2’s interaction with the β and γ pieces.

But in addition to building something that is specific to effector T cells and other cancer-killing immune cells these scientists have to build something that is long lasting has few side effects and doesn’t inadvertently prompt the antibody-making arm of the immune system to attack it.

Among the scientists working on ways to prevent IL-2 from binding to the α part of the receptor is Spangler. Her lab is developing therapeutic IL-2s that are attached to antibodies. One of these constructs blocks the ability of IL-2 to connect with the α part of the receptor keeping IL-2 from preferentially stimulating regulatory T cells to multiply and potentially spurring cancer-killing effector cells to multiply instead.

Good reception

For several years Roche has likewise sought to turn IL-2 into a therapeutic that can’t bind to the α part of the IL-2 receptor. The company is doing this through muteins—versions of the IL-2 protein with altered or mutated amino acid sequences that change how the molecule interacts with its receptor. Roche calls its IL-2 mutein IL-2v for IL-2 variant.

Pablo Umaña who leads cancer immu­notherapy projects at Roche says the firm’s scientists also tried coupling IL-2v to antibodies that attach to cancer cells that have small immune beacons called tumor antigens on their surfaces. The idea he says was to keep the company’s IL-2 near the tumor so IL-2 could stimulate effector T cells.

The researchers ran into problems. One of their IL-2-antibody constructs became immunogenic—in trials people given the drug developed antibodies against it. Another was well tolerated but didn’t have the cancer-killing effect the company was looking for. The trials were stopped.

Now Umaña says Roche is working on an IL-2-antibody construct that attaches to two points on the same T cell: the β and γ parts of the IL-2 receptor as one point and PD-1 an immune-regulating protein that many cancer immunotherapies attempt to override to make T cells more effective at killing as the other. Umaña hopes the dual-action molecule now in Phase 1 trials will strengthen IL-2’s ability to stimulate effector cells. The idea is that the antibody’s binding to PD-1 will create a strong interaction that helps solidify the weaker IL-2 interaction with its receptor on effector cells urging those cells to divide.

“We call this our third-generation IL-2 variant” he says.

Companies are also trying ways to get IL-2 to stick around longer in the bloodstream so they can reduce the high doses that lead to toxicity and side effects. One strategy is to pegylate the molecule. Attaching polyethylene glycol (PEG) to specific points in the amino acid chain of IL-2 makes the construct bigger lengthening its half-life says Willem Overwijk vice president of oncology research at Nektar Therapeutics.

Nektar’s lead IL-2 candidate bempeg­aldesleukin or bempeg features six strands of PEG attached to lysines on aldesleukin the active ingredient in Proleukin.

Overwijk says the therapy is injectable and doesn’t become active until some of the PEG chains fall off freeing up the part of the protein that binds preferentially to the β and γ pieces on cancer-killing effector T cells and NK cells. Overwijk says people with tumors who have been treated with bempeg have many effector T cells around their tumors and few regulatory cells.

And unlike with Proleukin people treated with bempeg are not likely to require hospitalization.

“That’s a huge difference for the patient. They can go home basically right after; they don’t have to stay in the hospital” Overwijk says. “It’s a totally different drug now.”

Bempeg is in testing as a stand-alone therapy and as a combination with other cancer immunotherapies. In general the trials have been small and Nektar has had to grapple with investors concerned about trial results as well as manufacturing issues that may have affected some early results. Nektar reports that in Phase 2 trials of bempeg combined with Opdivo a checkpoint inhibitor from Bristol Myers Squibb about one-third of the people in its 38-person cohort saw all their cancerous lesions disappear after treatment. Many of the trial participants lived 30 months after treatment started before their cancers started progressing again.

Unearthing unearthly IL-2s

Many researchers trying to bring modified IL-2s to the cancer clinic use aldesleukin which only slightly varies from natural IL-2 as a starting point for mutations or they couple natural IL-2 to another molecule.

But several companies are exploring molecules that act like IL-2 but are completely artificial. Neoleukin’s lead compound does what IL-2 is supposed to do to stimulate effector T cells but it’s smaller and more compact Drachman says.

NL-201 Neoleukin’s IL-2-mimicking compound came out of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington. Carl Walkey an executive at Neoleukin who was previously at the institute says the team used computational biology to envision what an ideal IL-2 would look like as a cancer treatment. Researchers sorted through an astronomical combination of amino acid sequences to understand how altering amino acids in the IL-2 molecule might affect its structure and function Walkey says.

They then made versions of the best candidates and chose NL-201 for its activity. The molecule barely looks like natural IL-2 yet it binds to the β and γ parts of the IL-2 receptor with enough affinity to potentially stimulate effector T cells to divide and kill.

“IL-2 has these funny geometries. It bends and twists in funny ways” because it has so many different jobs across many cell types Walkey says. NL-201 “is much more ideal. It’s straighter. It’s more compact.”

NL-201 is also stabler than the native cytokine he says; it has a rich hydrophobic center and a hydrophilic exterior that makes it soluble. It’s an “idealized protein structure” Walkey says.

The US Food and Drug Administration seems to be moving carefully with what Walkey says is the first completely engineered made-from-scratch protein to approach the clinic. In January FDA officials asked Neoleukin to make some changes to its clinical trial protocols to better measure dosages. Drachman says he hopes to be in trials sometime this year.

For Sanofi IL-2 immunotherapy dreams rest on the unnatural amino acid N 6 -[(2-azidoethoxy)carbonyl]-l-lysine or azidolysine. The novel amino acid was developed by Synthorx cofounder Floyd Romesberg and engineered into an IL-2 candidate called THOR-707. Sanofi now owns Synthorx and THOR-707. This unnatural lysine has a PEG attached to it that blocks the molecule from interacting with the α part of the IL-2 receptor. THOR-707 is in early trials in people with a wide range of tumors.

“I see it as a cleaner approach to try and have a selective drug” Abbadessa says comparing it with other modes of engineering IL-2. “We hope that it will work.”

Then there’s Bright Peak Therapeutics which has taken protein building completely out of cells. Rather than coaxing bacterial or animal cells to spit out modified IL-2s which is the norm Bright Peak’s IL-2-like molecule is made by chemically stitching together small peptides.

Targeting IL-2 Several companies are trying to engineer the interleukin-2 (IL-2) protein to steer its activity toward T cells that kill cancer or T cells that block autoimmune responses. Here are some examples. ▸ Technology: IL-2 with mutations ▸ Goal: Change amino acids to strengthen or weaken interactions between IL-2 and various combinations of its receptors ▸ Companies: Pandion Therapeutics Roche

▸ Technology: IL-2 with nonnatural amino acids ▸ Goal: Strengthen or weaken interactions between IL-2 and various combinations of its receptors; provide anchors to add molecules to influence immune response ▸ Companies: Synthorx Bright Peak Therapeutics

▸ Technology: IL-2 or IL-2 mutants coupled to antibodies ▸ Goal: Improve IL-2’s half-life and steer immune response ▸ Companies: Pandion Therapeutics Roche

▸ Technology: IL-2 or IL-2 mutants bound to polyethylene glycol (PEG) ▸ Goal: Improve IL-2’s half-life by making the molecule inactive until PEG chains fall off ▸ Company: Nektar Therapeutics

▸ Technology: IL-2 mimics ▸ Goal: Re-create IL-2’s function but without half-life and toxicity issues ▸ Company: Neoleukin Therapeutics

Sources: Companies. Note: This list is not exhaustive.

Taking the protein-assembly process out of cells allows the company’s scientists to better understand the growing amino acid chain as it’s assembling and folding says CEO Sef Kurstjens. Company scientists can more easily incorporate things like noncanonical amino acids.

Vijaya Pattabiraman Bright Peak’s cofounder and an organic chemist says the company’s chemists can stitch together a peptide and modify an amino acid on that peptide to improve its half-life. Researchers can build the next section of the protein and if needed modify it.

The scientists can then join these pieces with all the different elements they want to build their perfect molecule and once it’s folded the scientists can add molecules like PEG if that’s what their design calls for. This process doesn’t require microbes or cells that have to determine how to add an artificial amino acid.

“It can be anything that chemists and biologists can think about and dream of” Pattabiraman says of a molecule built using Bright Peak’s technology. “There’s no other way you can really introduce multiple noncanonical amino acids within the protein and get the biology that we want.”

Steering IL-2 toward autoimmunity

For all of IL-2’s potential as a cancer therapeutic Hopkins’s Spangler says we shouldn’t forget its potential as a strong suppressor of the immune response. Because IL-2 binds so strongly to the α part of the receptor low doses can trigger the multiplication of regulatory T cells which dampen the immune response making the cytokine an enticing drug candidate for autoimmune disorders. She is developing an antibody-coupled IL-2 to skew toward activating regulatory T cells.

But modulating IL-2 to activating regulatory T cells is a more nuanced task than treating cancer Penn’s Sgourakis says. T cells aren’t the only cells that express the α part of the IL-2 receptor. Any effort to boost the activity of regulatory T cells could also stimulate nontarget cells. And he says effector cells can start producing that α segment scooping up a therapeutic IL-2 meant to tamp down the immune system.

As IL-2 and its receptor move in space he says there are fleeting conformations—shapes that last just an instant but could mediate some of the most important interactions IL-2 might have with a molecule that affects the immune response. Using nuclear magnetic resonance Sgourakis’s team is trying to capture the fleeting moments to design mutants to mimic those interactions including ones that could lead to IL-2-based autoimmune therapies.

“You really have a much more narrow set of conformations or of IL-2 forms that could be potentially useful for an autoimmune disease treatment” he says. “Trying to make an IL-2 that targets cancer immunotherapies is like hitting a free throw. Trying to make a molecule that targets autoimmunity or dampens a certain set of immunity is like trying to hit a half-court shot.”

Still a few companies are trying. This includes Amgen which is developing its own IL-2 products and Merck & Co. which in February announced it is buying Pandion Therapeutics for $1.85 billion. Pandion’s pipeline includes two IL-2-based molecules plus the technology to deliver those molecules and others to specific tissues.

Pandion cofounder Jo Viney says turning therapeutic IL-2 toward autoimmunity should require lower doses than used in cancer treatment and should thus lower the risk of side effects. But using existing IL-2 is still daunting she says. While a person with cancer would take IL-2 therapy for about a week autoimmune diseases are chronic and IL-2 might have to be given over long periods. IL-2 could activate other immune cells which could counteract the autoimmune effort. And with a short half-life IL-2 would be an almost daily treatment she says.

But on the plus side the use of IL-2 therapies for autoimmunity could unleash a more comprehensive shutdown signal on an overreacting immune system she says; in contrast current autoimmune therapies tend to be molecules and antibodies that target only one component of an autoimmune response.

Pandion and Amgen are using similar technology to build autoimmune-specific IL-2: coupling IL-2 muteins to antibody fragments that extend IL-2’s circulation time.

Making Pandion’s candidate PT101 involved testing many amino acid mutations in the native IL-2 protein Viney says. The firm’s scientists found that acidifying a critical asparagine destabilized IL-2’s binding to the β piece of the receptor. Adding four other amino acids to the IL-2 mutein created a molecule that would preferentially bind to the α piece of the IL-2 receptor favoring the growth of regulatory T cells.

Viney says that because Pandion’s IL-2 is coupled to the antibody fragment the therapy could be given to people every few weeks instead of every day. In a small Phase 1 trial people who received PT101 produced many more regulatory T cells than people who were untreated. The experimental biologic seemed to produce few side effects and no antidrug antibodies. By the end of 2021 Viney says PT101 should be in trials for ulcerative colitis and lupus.

Amgen’s lead IL-2 construct efavaleukin alfa is in testing for lupus and graft-versus-host disease. The company ended a trial of the drug candidate—a fusion of a mutein IL-2 and an antibody—as a “business decision” according to ClinicalTrials.gov. Nektar is also exploring pegylated IL-2 as an autoimmune therapy.

While people wait to see which if any of these novel IL-2s will become the next generation of IL-2 immunotherapy Neoleukin’s Drachman says Proleukin is still in occasional use as a late-stage therapy for people who have not responded to other treatments. He says he recently spoke to a man with melanoma whose doctors pulled him off Proleukin after his heart stopped during treatment. He went on to receive checkpoint inhibitors immunotherapies that block some of the regulatory functions of the immune system and has survived for several years.

He is one of the lucky ones. Even with checkpoint inhibitors Drachman says fewer than half of people with melanoma go into stable remission. Melanoma is a tough cancer to treat. It’s resistant to many drugs Drachman says but not IL-2. This is why developing a safer version is so important he says.

Sgourakis and others believe that the technologies in play in the effort to create a better IL-2 may also lead to other more tolerable and potent cytokines and immune modulators to treat diseases beyond cancer and autoimmunity. What structural and computational biology reveal could guide scientists to molecules that affect a host of immune functions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Each transceiver is able to quickly convert a single-ended I2C dominant signal into a differential dominant signal—and the reverse. Applications for this 400-kb/s device include automotive networking industrial networking and remote sensor interfacing.

The transmitter is a current-regulated driver that generates a differential voltage between the CANxH and CANxL pins as determined by drive current and the equivalent resistive load on the CANx bus. In turn the receiver is a CAN-compatible differential receiver with a wide common-mode range of ±25 V or ±36 V depending on V CC .

In the simplest arrangement with two LT3960 devices the first is connected to the I2C master (likely a microcontroller) while the second LT3960 is connected to the first by two twisted pairs to regenerate the I2C bus locally for one or more I2C slave devices. The LT3960 devices transmit the clock signal only from master to slave while the data signal uses bidirectional transfer.

The LT3960 operates from a 4- to 60-V supply and includes an internal 3.3-V regulator to power both the I2C and I2CAN buses from that single input supply; alternatively it can be powered directly from a 3.3- or 5-V supply. The device priced at $1.89 (1000 pieces) is ESD protected to ±8-kV human-body model (HBM) on its CAN pins and ±2-kV HBM on all of its other pins. It comes in a 10-lead MSOP package; E- and J-Grades are available and the AEC-Q100 qualification is in progress. The 22-page datasheet provides static and dynamic performance specifications graphs of performance vs. temperature and other parameters and operational details.

To speed evaluation and familiarity Analog Devices also offers the DC2686A demonstration circuit ($95) which includes the LT3960 and an LT3967 a 1.3-A eight-switch matrix LED dimmer system (Fig. 2). It connects directly to a LED string and driver demonstration circuit to enable independent dimming control of up to eight channels of LEDs.

SUBSCRIBE From Newton to Matisse Junko Yoshida Colors are light's suffering and joy. ― Johann Wolfgang von Goethe I’ve been in love with Henri Matisse since I was 14. I didn’t then know the artist’s name but I knew what I liked. His contrasting colors inspired me. Take his “View of Collioure” (c.1905). This image evokes the pointillism of Seurat and Signac who often juxtaposed similar hues on the canvas. But they never blended colors. Matisse was much bolder both in brush strokes and color choice. His genius was in creating the sense of a hot day by building up brush strokes of pure color. He often left parts of the canvas white to let light shine through. Neo-impressionist artists sought almost obsessively to infuse air and light into their paintings. We still wonder however how these artists chose colors. Was it merely a matter of whim? Wrong. These artists had an invaluable tool: a color wheel developed by French scientist Michel Chevreul. Matisse became very skilled with Chevreul’s chromatic diagram. Chevreul’s wheel has 72 separate elements offering artists a range of nuance and “complement” – two colors situated opposite from each other. Besides the three primaries — red yellow and blue — Chevreul included mixtures of orange green and violet and six further secondary mixtures. He subdivided the resultant sectors into five zones. All the wheel’s radii separated into 20 segments to accommodate different brightness levels. Color theory dates to the 1660s when English physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton began experimenting with sunlight and prisms. While in quarantine during the Plague Newton held a glass prism in the path of a sunbeam shining through a hole in the blind of his darkened room. He found that white sunlight splits into red orange yellow green cyan and blue. Further he discovered that combining the light bands of his rainbow — red green and blue — regenerates white light. Newton saw color as a scientific measurement. Goethe then went on to connect color science with art. Interested in its physiological effect he postulated color as a subjective experience. Each viewer he said perceives colors differently. Matisse took Goethe to the extreme. In his Red Room for example Matisse thrust his warm red colors forward relegating the cool greens and blues to the background. His colors create a new dimension a visual tension and an intensity that no previous artist had ever achieved. Planet Analog × EE Times Into Analog?

READ LATEST STORIES NOW Chameleons Go to War Anne-Françoise Pelé Chameleons and cephalopods which include octopuses cuttlefish squid and nautiluses are often described as the quick-change artists of the animal kingdom. Their color-changing ability has inspired a literature character in Shakespeare’s Hamlet and movie characters like X-Men’s Mystique. It is now the art of war that is experimenting with colors. A chameleon's color changeability is among the best in nature and the most versatile. Some chameleon species can vary their coloration and patterning through combinations of red orange pink purple blue turquoise yellow green and black. Of course these enigmatic lizards can’t match any background. If a chameleon walks on a chessboard it won’t mimic the black and white sequence! It’s also a common misconception that chameleons change their skin colors to camouflage with their surroundings. They usually do it to regulate their body temperature. A cool chameleon may turn dark to absorb more heat while a warmer chameleon may turn pale to reflect the sun's heat. Back to a serious cause: war. French military vehicles are covered in a black green and brown pattern for camouflage in the wooded landscapes of Europe. Before these tanks trucks and carriers are dispatched in other parts of the world they are immobilized for several days to be repainted in ochre for desert areas or grey for urban operations. The reaction time is dramatically reduced and the range of camouflage patterns available aren’t always discreet. France’s Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) has launched the Caméléon project to develop a dynamic camouflage system for vehicles to adjust to their surroundings in real time. A camera records the environment while an image analysis algorithm identifies the colors and patterns. A spectral reflectivity technology is used to dynamically change the colors of the tiles covering the vehicle to replicate the colors and patterns of the environment. The camouflage system also reduces the infrared signature perceived by enemy cameras. DGA expects to equip life-size vehicles by 2026 and is working to make the technology more flexible so that it can be integrated in the fabric of the military uniform. In 1914 hundreds of thousands of Piou Piou i.e. French young soldiers marched bravely “Pour la France” unaware that their garance-red pants and kepi were flamboyant targets for enemy fire. One century later lessons of the past have inspired progress and invisibility is power. Chameleon troops will soon be deployed incognito to the battlefields. A Paean To a Non-Existent Color Brian Santo Do you remember the spasm of cognitive dissonance you experienced the first time you heard someone insist that brown does not exist? But maybe you haven’t had this discussion yet? Of course brown exists. Maybe you’ve got a brown Kia Sorento sitting in your garage or maybe you’ve got a pair of brown brogues or maybe your hair is brown. Ah but we both know what the visible swath of the electromagnetic spectrum looks like don’t we? And we both know that brown simply ain’t there. But wait — no doubt you learned how to mix paints in grammar school? Mix up blue and yellow and red and you always get some shade of brown or another – QED! Well okay but if brown doesn’t exist in the spectrum did you ever really create brown in any objective sense? Color theory doesn’t provide a definitive answer. First there are multiple theories of color and each has its own distinct explanation of what brown is and isn’t (“It’s a composite color!” “It’s a subtractive color!” “It’s less-saturated orange!”). Which theory makes the most sense can depend on what you’re actually doing. Coloring fabric? Painting? Filming? At a certain point the difference depends on that which is being perceived and — whoops — now you’re obliged to investigate human perception. Go down that rabbit hole and if you’re not careful you may find yourself defending the Hickethier cube against those barbarians who think the ridiculous Munsell sphere is useful or vice versa. Maybe brown is just in our heads but that means it is still in fact somewhere. Sadly brown too often gets disparaged. Crayola had the same 64 colors for years and then the first one they retired? Burnt umber. “Brown-Eyed Girl” is one of the Great All-Time Singles but at least one member of every cover band you will ever meet will admit if pressed that they hate it because they end up getting requests for it four or five times every night. UPS gave up on “What Can Brown Do For You?” in favor of “We ♥ Logistics” (ugh…) and even the Cleveland Browns’ helmets are mostly orange. I find brown can be comforting like the color(s) of earth or satisfying like a rich coffee or soothing tea or as blissful as chocolate. I miss burnt umber crayons. And after I send this I’m going to go listen to “Brown-Eyed Girl” and I plan to bop around my office when I do. Holi: The Festival of Colors Nitin Dahad People of Indian origin around the world last week celebrated the annual festival of colors. Though many consider it a religious festival it’s become a fun occasion where people eat drink and be merry and throw bright colored powders at each other. Putting religion aside as with many celebrations in Hindu philosophy it signifies the triumph of good over evil. Indians always celebrate any festival with good food and Holi is no exception. In addition the throwing of colors is mandatory but something I have never understood why. In the early 1990s I was once in India for a visit which coincided with Holi so I was invited to celebrate the day at the famous Madh Island beach in Mumbai. Though reluctant I agreed to go along since we didn’t really get to experience such festivals on that same grand scale living in the UK. That day I understood the ferocity with which Indian people celebrate Holi. On the drive to and from the beach our car would every now and then be pelted with colors. And on the beach itself everywhere you turn you’d see colors of all sorts flying at you or a pair of hands would be smothering your face and hair. It was like one huge pillow fight with the pillows made from material so thin that they would burst on any swinging movement to release and spray colors in all directions. For several days afterwards despite many showers and hair washing the remnants of the color remained in various shades in my hair. That was the one and only time I experienced Holi in India. Now however you don’t have to be in India to celebrate. Over the last 15 years it’s become a bigger festival among the Indian diaspora around the world. It’s even gone mainstream with the pop band Coldplay playing Holi in their video for the song Hymn for the Weekend. In London the Rajasthani community which I belong to also celebrate it in a big way every year. While it was not possible in 2020 or 2021 because of the pandemic I am sure celebrations will be back with a vengeance for Holi in London in 2022. Enjoying EE Times Weekend?

SUBSCRIBE Tom Shea: ‘Get As Much Practical Business Exposure As You Can’ This weekend we chat to Tom Shea President and CEO of Panasas. Tom has more than 20 years of experience in business and engineering leadership in the storage industry. He has led software and hardware teams in both public and private companies and has managed teams through periods of transition exponential growth and successful public offerings. He joined Panasas in 2014 as chief operating officer and was appointed CEO in 2020. Prior to that Tom was vice president and general manager of software solutions at SanDisk. He also worked as vice president and general manager for WAN optimization at Blue Coat Systems and was president and chief executive officer at Gear6. Tom holds a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California Berkeley. Image: Panasas What personal projects will you be working on this weekend Tom? On weekends I try to take a break from the world of software and hardware. I love any DIY project that allows me to be creative and work with my hands. Mechanical and/or woodworking projects are very satisfying to me. Thinking about design options and finding the right tools for the job are half the fun. And these are usually projects with no deadlines which is a nice change. What are the best and worst things about being a CEO? Our customers in technical computing and HPC are doing amazing things in life sciences manufacturing climate energy scientific research etc. I love being exposed to the work they do and knowing that we can play an important part in the success of their projects. So for me spending time with customers and partners is a highlight. As far as downsides of the role I tend to throw myself into areas that need work problems that need to be solved areas where I can make an impact. It is gratifying work in the long run but on any given day it leaves very little time to think about and enjoy all the things that are going well. Who is your favorite musician writer or artist? I am a big fan of Mark Twain. I love the way that he uses satire and humor to deliver social commentary. I have read and reread many of his original works. That said about 10 years ago University of California released Volume 1 of his autobiography compiled from various essays and writings throughout his life. My daughter gave me a copy for my birthday. It is such a physically large intimidating looking 800 page hardcover book that I must confess I have not gotten around to starting it yet. They have since released Volumes 2 and 3 so now I am really behind the curve. What was your first job in the industry? I spent my time at UC Berkeley preparing to be an ASIC designer. After graduating in 1987 I joined Adaptec in the company’s early days planning to stay on that track. After several months in the role however I got hooked on writing kernel level software to get our systems up and running. Everything I have done in my career since then has been focused on building powerful software and leveraging partnerships for the hardware needed to create amazing system level products. I still love working with hardware but I found system level software to be a different and much better way for me to satisfy that passion. It is great to have a career plan but don’t be afraid to change course as you get more exposure to the outside world. What advice would you give to early-career engineers? It will always be important to build great products but these days it takes much more than that for a company to be successful and win. I would advise engineers to get as much practical business exposure and customer interaction as you can along the way. It will give you invaluable perspective and ultimately benefit your company and your career.

A hospital employee clicks a link embedded in an email that claims to be from a common PPE supplier. They login entering official hospital credentials only to find that they have unwittingly let a cyber criminal into their system via a phishing scam.

The hackers eventually use this information to gain access to the hospital’s VPN where they find the information necessary to access the hospital’s entire network.

The attacker threatens to leak sensitive patient data and shut off life support machines unless the hospital pays the ransom.

Or maybe a hacker breaks into the electrical grid shutting off power to an entire city. Food spoils in fridges leading to cases of food poisoning. People lose the ability to run air conditioners in their homes. Street lights shut off causing accidents.

Desperate city officials give in and respond to the attack with payment in order to keep constituents safe.

These attacks may seem like the stuff of movies but a few recent ransomware attacks indicate that it could soon be a reality. In September of 2020 a German woman died after a ransomware attack on a hospital led to care delays.

This February saw hackers attempt to poison Tampa’s water supply by increasing the amount of lye from about 100 parts per million to 11100 parts per million.

The attack was noticed quickly and public health was never at risk but an increase of this magnitude could have resulted in skin damage hair loss or deadly gastrointestinal symptoms.

“The threat actors in the ransomware world they’re businesses. This is not the caricature of a guy in a basement” said Heather Hughes VP engagement management at Aon Cyber Solutions.

“When any sort of ransom is negotiated during a ransomware event you’re negotiating with threat actors who know exactly what they’re doing and they do cast a wide net.”

As ransomware payments trend downwards hackers may test more extreme methods to get businesses to meet their demands sometimes with dangerous or even deadly ramifications.

With Payments Down Cyber Criminals Up the Stakes

Insurers and government entities have long encouraged businesses not to give in and pay cyber criminals after an attack. In 2020 the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control even went so far as to issue an advisory that states businesses that pay ransomware demands could face fines and other penalties.

The warnings seem to be working — The Coveware Quarterly Ransomware Report found that the average ransomware payment fell 34% in Quarter 4 of 2020 when compared to Q3 though attacks are still increasing in both frequency and severity for the health care sector.

“We’re definitely still seeing a surge in both frequency and severity in the health care sector. The good news is that the amount of ransom demanded has been going down a bit” said Paul Davis area vice president at Gallagher.

“We do not expect this trend of lower payments or frequency of claims to continue” Jeremy Turner Coalition’s head of threat intelligence added.

The argument goes that paying ransomware demands enables and encourages cyber criminals.

While discouraging businesses from paying ransomware demands is a good practice cyber criminals will likely try to up the stakes by threatening data leaks safety and even life if victims don’t meet their demands making hospitals — and their patients — particularly vulnerable.

“They can’t necessarily be down for 48 hours if they have patients who need to access their electronic medical records” Davis said.

One of the ways that attackers may try to force a payout is through exfiltrating the data and threatening to release it unless the ransom is paid.

“At Coalition we’ve seen attack techniques become increasingly severe with more and more threat groups exfiltrating and threatening to expose stolen data. Demands reached into the millions over the past year with the recent Acer demand reported to be $50 million” Turner said.

Health Care Entities and Municipalities Especially Vulnerable

While ransomware attacks occur in all sectors some industries are more vulnerable than others. If attackers are trying to use life or death scenarios as leverage they will go after organizations like hospitals and public entities where they can shut down machines or cause damage to utilities with dangerous or even deadly consequences.

In the case of health care systems hackers have sought to take advantage of the chaos caused by the pandemic in order to break into systems or to secure ransom payments.

Phishing emails related to PPE supplies COVID tests and others related to the pandemic have become commonplace. Cyber experts expect that these types of attacks will continue albeit with a new focus: the much-coveted COVID-19 vaccines.

“This time last year we were seeing a lot of phishing emails about work-from-home or remote access” Hughes said. “Now we’re seeing a lot of phishing emails that are very specific to vaccines like ‘Vaccines available for employees. Click here.’ ”

Attackers are also using the chaos of the pandemic to try to force ransom payments. If a cyber attack causes a power outage at a hospital with 20 people on ventilators officials will be more likely to pay in order to save lives.

It’s not just the pandemic that makes health care entities a popular target for hackers however.

Cyber criminals will try to leverage fears over HIPAA violations to try to force a ransomware payment especially if they’ve exfiltrated the data.

“Obviously if they exfiltrate data then that is a big issue for the health care entities because it could be protected health information. So they have HIPAA issues they have data breach notification issues they have patient confidence issues” Hughes said.

A lack of physical security in addition to aging tech infrastructure makes hospitals an appealing target as well.

“Next time you are in the hospital take note of how many USB ports you could access that are unsecured. Physical security is the first perimeter and often these areas are overlooked” Turner said.

Hospitals utilities public entities and municipalities are at increased risk because of the chaos a hacker could inflict. Public entities also face increased risk however due to out-of-date network systems that are easy access for hackers.

Governments typically have a 33% larger attack surface on average when compared to other organizations usually due to a wide range of public facing applications according to a 2020 report from Corvus.

They’re also slightly less likely to use email authentication schemes a common tool for preventing phishing and ransomware attacks. Only 74% of government entities utilize basic email authentication schemes compared to an 80% average for all organizations.

Utilities like power grids are so vulnerable that the U.S. government has created a subcommittee dedicated to protecting U.S. power grids from cyber attacks which would likely be costly. A study from Lloyd’s and the University of Cambridge found that an attack on a U.S. electrical grid could cost over $1 trillion.

The stakes of locking up a power grid or water treatment plant can also have dangerous or even deadly consequences.

Take the attack on Tampa’s water treatment plant as an example. Though an employee of the plant was able to correct the issue before anyone was hurt a hacker could lock up a system infiltrate a plant with poison and demand a ransom to undo the damages causing injuries or even deaths in the process.

Protecting Your Business from a Cyber Attack

Unfortunately hackers will keep launching ransomware attacks so long as it is profitable for them to do so.

“Until it isn’t lucrative they’re going to continue to do it” said Steve Robinson area president and national cyber practice leader at Risk Placement Services.

Businesses can prepare by having backups of crucial data — either on paper or on another system. They can also prepare by requiring multi-factor authentication on their systems and by educating their employees on how to avoid phishing and other common cyber attacks.

In the event that an attack does occur a cyber insurance policy can help cover losses.

To help make sure that they have coverage that fits their needs health care entities and municipalities should work with brokers that are familiar with their sectors in addition to strong cyber expertise.

Robinson flagged this as being of particular concern for the health care sector due to the unique regulatory consequences they could face in the event of a HIPAA violation.

“It’s important to partner with a broker that’s well versed in cyber specifically for health care” he said. “On the health care side there is the regulatory side of the coverage as well — because we know HIPAA violations and things like that can become very time consuming and costly.”

Rates are increasing on cyber policies though as the market responds to increases in ransomware attacks and some carriers restrict coverage.

“Insurers are really starting to feel the pain and the stress on their overall books of business and their profitability around ransomware” said Matt Chmel senior vice president and team leader at Aon.

“The cyber insurance market is significantly changing and hardening due to ransomware losses. Some carriers are looking to limit their ransomware limits as well as to restrict coverage. So working with an insurance broker to make sure that language restrictions are as narrow as possible is important.” &",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbGxzLmllL3RoZS1yZXdpbmQvMjUteWVhcnMtc2luY2UtdGhpcy1iaXphcnJlLWlyaXNoLWhpdC00NjU0ODnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Song The BBC Banned - It's 25 Years Since This Bizarre Irish Hit,"Aon focal eile?

These were the words used in the chorus of an infamous chart topping Irish hit back in the 1990s. If the penny hasn't dropped it was comedian turned singer/songwriter Richie Kavanagh who used the play on the word 'focal' for comedic effect.

Kavanagh had written the song years previous but hadn't thought of releasing it as a single. ""(It) was a song that I wrote about four or five years ago and I used to sing it as part of my act kinda half ways through my show"" he told RTÉ back in 1997.

""I never intended ever to record it. People would come up to me and say 'That was a great focal song you should record it!'.""

'Aon focal eile' ended up being a huge hit in this country. The song was picked up by several local radio stations before Gerry Ryan eventually used it as a mainstay on his morning 2FM slot. From then on it skyrocketed in popularity.

In 1996 the single spent eight weeks at the top of the Irish Charts. In total Kavanagh's single lasted six months in the charts over here. It's chart success puts it in the Top 20 best selling singles of all-time in Ireland.

Kavanagh earned a chunk of his popularity from air time in the UK and equally had his share of detractors. The single was banned by the BBC for a start.

""It was banned on the BBC yeah. We were just about to get it played and a producer said they didn't want to take early retirement.""

Despite the national broadcasting snub Kavanagh still received huge support for the single overseas. ""It was 44 weeks on number one on Spectrum Radio in London"" he said.

""The reason it was so popular was because it couldn't be played until after 12 O'Clock at night.""

The Army has been trying to procure a 155mm/52-caliber MGS for about 20 years with the first request for proposals (RFP) floated in February 2002. While this did not yield any results the government withdrew the previous RFP and re-issued it more than a decade later in June 2013.

This time again it hit obstacles and the service sought a fresh acceptance-of-necessity (AoN) from the Defense Acquisition Council (DAC) headed by then-Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in 2018.

The latest RFI which has been reviewed by The Eurasian Times calls for vendors to supply 155/52 caliber artillery guns. These are howitzers mounted on a truck for easy transportation. They provide for ‘shoot and scoot’ capability where the guns fire at the enemy from one location and then relocate to another to avoid counter-battery fire and detection from enemy surveillance teams.

They also provide for a very effective boost in the firepower for the infantry columns in different environments. According to the document the MGS will be “employed in plains mountains semi-desert and desert terrain for the execution of Artillery tasks”.

It also requires for the system to be able to fire all types of in-service ammunition and should have an inertial navigation system (INS)-based sight system with the capability to orient and fixing the location of the gun system.

The fire control system (FCS) should be able to provide day-and-night direct and indirect firing. The FCS has to be compatible with Project SHAKTI a computerized combat command and control system to integrate the artillery weapon operations. The vendor would also have to take a 5 percent offset in the deal and the system should have a minimum of 50 percent indigenous content.

The Indian Army’s artillery modernization process had virtually stalled since the acquisition of the Haubitus FH-77 Bofors guns in the 1980s until the government took up the work seriously in the past few years. Private players entered the field and were given more freedom to develop joint production facilities under the ‘Make in India’ initiative.

However the Army is still stuck with testing these systems seldom hampered by faulty ammunition leading to barrel burst incidents. The Bofors guns had proved good during the 1999 Kargil war and subsequently the Army drafted a Field Artillery Rationalisation Plan to acquire around 3000 pieces of 155 mm weaponry including tracked self-propelled guns truck-mounted gun systems towed artillery pieces and wheeled self-propelled guns over next two decades.

Read our ethics policy

A Magsafe wallet placed on top of an iPhone 12 Pro

As a thin wallet fan the idea of ditching my wallet entirely has been appealing for some time. While I don't yet live in that wallet-less utopia Apple's frequently maligned iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe is great despite what you may have heard from critics.

I've been using Apple's MagSafe wallet in combination with the iPhone 12 Pro and Apple's official MagSafe silicon case since they all launched last fall. Depending on the thickness of your cards it can hold two or three — in my case a driver's license a credit card and a New York City MetroCard. Since switching to the Apple MagSafe wallet I've also picked up a money clip for the times when I need cash.

Priced at $59 it's on the pricier side as far as wallets go (as are all official iPhone accessories) but the MSRP is not exorbitant. For example I see a lot of ads on TV for the Ridge wallet a pocket-friendly thin-and-light product that starts at $85.

It's made of ""tanned and finished European leather"" it comes in four colors (I chose ""saddle brown"") it carries a few cards and it sticks to the back of your iPhone 12.

If I replace my paper-thin MetroCard with a third full-thickness card it becomes too difficult to push the cards up and out. As such I've defaulted to two cards since launch and I haven't had any issues.

Since it launched I've seen a number of complaints about Apple's leather wallet with iMore deriding it as ""more of a collector's item than a must-have accessory"" and MacRumors initially declaring it ""kind of a mess"" before their reviewer changed his mind. Suffice to say that if this was an accessory or wallet from any other company there would not be so much criticism let alone revisiting and reassessment.

The MagSafe wallet can be used with or without an iPhone case depending on your personal preference.

I'm not going to try to convince you that you should or should not use the Apple MagSafe wallet as everyone has different needs and this product seems to serve a very specific type of user who appreciates a minimalist wallet. Plus we've already reviewed it. Instead I will refute some of the main criticisms of the product:

Of course it doesn't hold many cards or any cash

Apple's primary interest is in selling you an iPhone (and an Apple Watch) and having you use your Apple Card or other credit cards through Apple Pay. If Tim Cook and Co. had their druthers you wouldn't be using physical cards at all but we still live in a world where cards — and in some cases cash — are necessary.

Apple split the difference by offering a wallet that holds a few cards but no cash intended to be used in tandem with Apple Pay.

Using a MagSafe wallet can seriously cut down the amount you carry.

Consider that the Apple Card offers users 2% cashback on tap-to-pay transactions with Apple Pay but just 1% back on purchases that use the physical titanium card. Apple went out of its way to make a credit card out of titanium and disincentivizes you using it because it wants to make NFC-based payments with Apple Pay the norm.

It should come as no surprise that the company is interested in giving you a jumbo-sized monstrosity of a wallet that hangs onto your phone.

The magnets are fine and work well

I've seen some videos and complaints that the MagSafe wallet doesn't connect straight with users haphazardly slapping it on the back of their phone and showing that it doesn't magically align itself. This seems like a weird complaint to me — do they randomly jab plugs and ports together?

The other complaint is that the magnets aren't strong enough and the wallet falls off. I admittedly don't wear skinny jeans but I have not experienced this issue.

The wallet aligns perfectly with the back of the iPhone when attached.

When I push the wallet and deliberately attempt to lodge it out of place it's more secure when held against Apple's silicon case for the iPhone 12 presumably because the case material provides more friction. The wallet does budge easier when just attached to a naked iPhone 12 which has a smooth glass back but I've never had it dislodge when pulling out of my pocket.

I feel this is a ""be careful what you wish for"" scenario because stronger magnets could make it difficult to detach your wallet from your iPhone which is not a great situation to find yourself in when you're trying to pay for dinner.

The material is nice and looks good

As I said it's made of ""tanned and finished European leather."" Based on the description alone I'm kind of surprised Apple doesn't charge $99 for it.

Apple's pricey accessories have always been an easy target for critics

In the end the criticism directed toward the official iPhone Leather Wallet is more about Apple than it is about the product itself. A $60 leather wallet only compatible with the latest iPhone models is in the grand scheme of a massive corporation the size of Apple a pretty small and inconsequential offering in its sprawling product lineup.

This pointless wailing and gnashing of teeth is nothing new — see the $700 wheels on the Mac Pro the $1000 stand for the Apple Pro Display XDR or the $10000 gold Apple Watch Edition.

The hardware was designed primarily by Steve Wozniak and the case by Steve Jobs who we both know as the founders of Apple. In 1977 there were three machines vying for attention and inclusion in our lives: the Apple II the Commodore PET and the Tandy TRS-80. In the USA the Apple II was adopted and loved by a generation of coders who took their first steps with this great machine.

Emulating an Apple II

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The cost of original Apple II hardware has skyrocketed and so to take our first steps with this great machine we look to emulation via microm8.

1. Download and install microm8 for your operating system.

2. Open the microm8 executable. On first boot it will need to update so be patient.

Once it has finished updating microm8 will restart and present a rather retro 3D menu (see above).

3. Select Applesoft BASIC to open the BASIC interpreter.

BASIC is a general purpose high level language and the original version was designed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz and was released at Dartmouth College in 1964. In basic terms (no pun intended) BASIC is a human readable language that uses words common in the English language.

BASIC is the Python of the 1970s and 80s. Machines such as the Apple II were designed to boot straight into BASIC and from there we can write code and basic file operations.

Creating a Number Guessing Game

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

For our BASIC project we shall create a number guessing game. we have ten chances to guess the correct number before the game ends. If we guess too high the game will tell us so the same is true if we guess too low.

1. Line 10 create a variable N and inside the variable store a random integer between 0 and 50.

10 N = INT(50*RND(1))

2. Lines 20 and 30 write two instructions to the player. The first informs them that they have ten attempts to guess the number and then it asks for their guess.

20 PRINT ""YOU HAVE 10 TRIES TO GUESS THE CORRECT NUMBER"" 30 PRINT ""WHAT IS YOUR GUESS?""

3. Line 40. Create a for loop that will iterate ten times.

40 FOR C = 1 TO 10

4. Line 50. Capture the user's answer into a variable G.

50 INPUT G

5. Lines 60 to 80. Create three conditional tests. Each test will check the value of the user's answer G with the randomly generated answer. If the answer is too high or low then a message is printed to the user. If their guess matches the random value the code jumps out of the for loop.

60 IF G > N THEN PRINT ""TOO HIGH""; 70 IF G < N THEN PRINT ""TOO LOW""; 80 IF G = N THEN GOTO 130

6. Line 90 check the value of the variable C which counts from 1 to 10. If the value of C is not 10 then print “TRY AGAIN” and then for line 100 iterate the for loop by one and the code will loop back to line 50.

90 IF C<>10 THEN PRINT "" TRY AGAIN"" 100 NEXT C

7. Line 110 create a “bad ending” for the game. If the player doesn’t guess the number then lines 110 and 120 will be our game over screen.

110 PRINT "" I'M SORRY YOU FAILED...GAME OVER!"" 120 END

8. Lines 130 and 140 are the “good ending” of the game activated when the player wins the game.

130 PRINT ""YOU GUESSED CORRECTLY"" 140 END

To run the game type RUN and try to guess the correct number.

Playing a Game on the Apple II

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The Apple II had many great games some of which were ports from arcades and other consoles while others were made directly for the Apple II. Luckily for us microM8 comes with an extensive catalogue of games builtin.

1. From the microM8 menu screen press B to open the disk catalog.

2. In the Disk catalog look for “appleii” and double left mouse click to open.

3. Click on the “disk images” folder.

4. Click on Games and then select a letter from the list to show games starting with that letter. Select your game and enjoy!"

Developing new materials and novel processes has continued to change the world. The M3I3 Initiative at KAIST has led to new insights into advancing materials development by implementing breakthroughs in materials imaging that have created a paradigm shift in the discovery of materials. The Initiative features the multiscale modeling and imaging of structure and property relationships and materials hierarchies combined with the latest material-processing data.

The research team led by Professor Seungbum Hong analyzed the materials research projects reported by leading global institutes and research groups and derived a quantitative model using machine learning with a scientific interpretation. This process embodies the research goal of the M3I3: Materials and Molecular Modeling Imaging Informatics and Integration.

The researchers discussed the role of multiscale materials and molecular imaging combined with machine learning and also presented a future outlook for developments and the major challenges of M3I3. By building this model the research team envisions creating desired sets of properties for materials and obtaining the optimum processing recipes to synthesize them.

""The development of various microscopy and diffraction tools with the ability to map the structure property and performance of materials at multiscale levels and in real time enabled us to think that materials imaging could radically accelerate materials discovery and development"" says Professor Hong.

""We plan to build an M3I3 repository of searchable structural and property maps using FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable) principles to standardize best practices as well as streamline the training of early career researchers.""

One of the examples that shows the power of structure-property imaging at the nanoscale is the development of future materials for emerging nonvolatile memory devices. Specifically the research team focused on microscopy using photons electrons and physical probes on the multiscale structural hierarchy as well as structure-property relationships to enhance the performance of memory devices.

""M3I3 is an algorithm for performing the reverse engineering of future materials. Reverse engineering starts by analyzing the structure and composition of cutting-edge materials or products. Once the research team determines the performance of our targeted future materials we need to know the candidate structures and compositions for producing the future materials.""

The research team has built a data-driven experimental design based on traditional NCM (nickel cobalt and manganese) cathode materials. With this the research team expanded their future direction for achieving even higher discharge capacity which can be realized via Li-rich cathodes.

However one of the major challenges was the limitation of available data that describes the Li-rich cathode properties. To mitigate this problem the researchers proposed two solutions: First they should build a machine-learning-guided data generator for data augmentation. Second they would use a machine-learning method based on 'transfer learning.' Since the NCM cathode database shares a common feature with a Li-rich cathode one could consider repurposing the NCM trained model for assisting the Li-rich prediction. With the pretrained model and transfer learning the team expects to achieve outstanding predictions for Li-rich cathodes even with the small data set.

With advances in experimental imaging and the availability of well-resolved information and big data along with significant advances in high-performance computing and a worldwide thrust toward a general collaborative integrative and on-demand research platform there is a clear confluence in the required capabilities of advancing the M3I3 Initiative.

Professor Hong said ""Once we succeed in using the inverse ""property?structure?processing"" solver to develop cathode anode electrolyte and membrane materials for high energy density Li-ion batteries we will expand our scope of materials to battery/fuel cells aerospace automobiles food medicine and cosmetic materials.""

Use of another class of materials polyolefins (POEs) has grown rapidly in the past few years. IHS Markit put the market share of POE encapsulants at 20% last year almost doubling from 11% in 2017. And this share is expected to reach 30% by the end of 2022.

“The main drivers for POE growth will be the strong increase of bifacial glass-glass technology (both p-type and n-type) as well as competitive prices reached by increasing scale in manufacturing” says IHS Markit senior research analyst Karl Melkonyan. “Though EVA will continue to account for most of the market it is not recommended to use for bifacial technology or others such as n-type and thin films.”

The growth of bifacial modules the majority of which use glass front and back raises multiple challenges for encapsulant materials. Despite estimates that they are at least 30% more expensive than EVA module manufacturers are turning to POE-based encapsulants as the most attractive solution. “By its nature EVA has limitations especially when considering 30 or 40 year lifetimes” explains George Touloupas director of technology and quality at CEA. “POE is in principle a better material and it is more stable than EVA. With the scaling up of bifacial modules its share has grown considerably.”

Over time EVA decomposes in field conditions producing acetic acid. In a glass-backsheet stack this acid can permeate through the backsheet and escape the module without causing any harm. For glass-glass modules however acetic acid is trapped and can build up eventually causing corrosion and significant performance loss. This may have motivated some suppliers to investigate POE as an alternative for glass-glass modules. Producers of transparent backsheet materials also cite the ‘breathability’ of their backsheets and the prevention of acetic acid build-up as an advantage for their products over glass-glass in bifacial modules.

The EVA breakdown mechanism however is driven by moisture and glass-glass modules effectively prevent water ingress. “The absence of water combined with EVA stabilizer additives should ensure that glass-glass modules do not suffer from excessive corrosion due to acetic acid formation” explains Touloupas. This has proved sufficient for modules to pass the accelerated testing conducted by manufacturers and in third-party quality assurance. And EVA is still used in glass-glass lamination although often in combination with a POE encapsulant.

Potential-induced degradation

The second challenge for bifacial modules and largest driver for the recent pickup in the use of POE encapsulants relates to the prevention of a new mechanism of potential-induced degradation (PID) affecting the rear side of bifacial modules. A combination of new EVA formulations and frontside cell surface treatments is broadly thought to have “solved” PID issues in monofacial modules. With recent growth in bifacial technology however a new mechanism of PID particularly affecting the rear side of cells has been observed (see pv magazine 02/2021 p.44).

Replacing EVA with a POE-based encapsulant is among the only effective solutions for module manufacturers to secure products against PID risk and related reliability issues. Since it seems the materials in a POE encapsulant are inherently more expensive to produce than EVA and the large modules on the market today require a thicker encapsulant layer as well as having a larger area to cover innovations focused on minimizing the costs are already being seen.

Some module suppliers opt to use the tried and tested EVAs for frontside encapsulation and a single sheet of POE between the cells and the rear glass as a PID prevention strategy. Encapsulant and backsheet manufacturer First Applied Materials – based in Hangzhou China – has patented a coextruded EVA/POE/EVA encapsulant sheet where a thin layer of POE at the center ensures good PID resistance. The lower cost but still reliable EVA makes up the bulk of the encapsulant layer and these coextruded encapsulants increasingly appear on module makers’ roadmaps.

“Coextrusion products not only have the advantages of fast easy processing in lamination with EVA but also retain the strong anti-PID performance of POE” says Kevin Wu First Applied Materials’ overseas marketing director. “The limitation is that the characteristics of both EVA and POE must be understood deeply and it is difficult to control the thickness uniformity of the middle POE layer.”

Processing POE

Aside from the added material cost POEs are also held back from the mainstream by difficulties in their processing. Lower temperature and pressure requirements may be attractive to manufacturers but long cycle times a narrow temperature window and low glass adherence are not. Until these issues are solved manufacturers will likely stick to EVA unless absolutely necessary.

Manufacturing POE encapsulant as a thermoplastic rather than a cross-linked polymer is one way to potentially make the materials easier to process. This is the approach favored by Austrian manufacturer Borealis in its Quentys BPO range of POE-based encapsulants.

“BPO is a tailor-made thermoplastic encapsulant where adhesion functionality is directly incorporated in the polymer chain as opposed to grafted solutions leading to excellent inherent adhesion” said Alper Muraben team leader for solar at Borealis. “In addition the polymer’s high melt temperature and high viscosity eliminates the need for the encapsulant to be cross-linked during module lamination. This significantly simplifies both the resin-to-film extrusion step and module lamination process.”

Muraben further explains that the Quentys encapsulant allows for shorter lamination cycles compared to other POE materials and also processing at lower pressures and temperatures compared to EVA. This in turn reduces stress placed on the cells during lamination. Finally he notes that the high viscosity of the encapsulant minimizes the chance that cells or ribbons can move during the lamination process – relevant for modules utilizing non-soldering interconnection technologies.

First Applied Materials offers both cross-linked and thermoplastic POE products including a range of encapsulants featuring Dow Chemical’s Enlight series of thermoplastic POE products. The company particularly recommends the cross-linked product for modules installed in high-humidity environments and for prolonged PID resistance. For the thermoplastic materials meanwhile “the no cross-linking characteristic can effectively shorten laminating time of PV modules” according to Wu. “And this helps to improve customers’ productivity.”

Italian laminating equipment manufacturer TekniSolar meanwhile has developed tools and processes which it says allow it to work effectively with either encapsulant material as well as others. “The use of one material or the other in our experience depends mostly on the specific module technology” explains TekniSolar CEO Vittore De Leonibus. “Our technology allows any type of panel to be laminated with a very short cycle time thanks to the combination of multi-stage curing a fast vacuum system uniform heat application and a flat press in place of the usual membrane.”

POE prospects

Bifacial is today regarded as a mainstream PV technology and is expected to continue to rapidly grow over the next few years. And this should leave space for POE encapsulants to grow alongside.

Though EVA will likely continue to account for the larger market share in the short to medium term other recent developments in module technology indicate that a slow shift toward POE is underway. Aside from bifacial the gentler processing afforded by POE means it is widely favored for the lamination of heterojunction and TOPCon modules the cells of which are highly sensitive to raised temperatures. Increasing module power ratings as seen with the recent advent of larger wafer modules could also be good news for POE.

“We expect POE to become a more viable option as solar panels increase in power” says De Leonibus. “In other words when the solar panel produces more the cost of producing it will be allowed to exceed ceilings that are set for the most common solar panel types in production up until now.”

With its Quentys Encapsulant Borealis has also been able to demonstrate an increase in module performance compared with modules encapsulated with EVA. In testing conducted by the company at an outdoor site in Abu Dhabi modules encapsulated with Quentys have demonstrated an energy yield more than 2% above reference EVA modules over a 12-month period. Laboratory testing conducted by Fraunhofer ISE has also shown significantly stronger performance from the Quentys-encapsulated moduleswhich were shown to lose 5.5% of their initial power rating after a harsh series of damp heat UV and thermal cycling tests compared to 33.4% for an industry reference EVA. “Another growth path for Quentys is some module makers wanting to replace traditional EVA applications with Quentys thanks to the productivity gains and higher power retention it brings” said Muraben.

Rear-side PID protection has given polyolefins a push into the encapsulant market. And longer lifetime expectations higher power ratings and other developments in module technology mean that manufacturers will have an eye on them. Choice of material is only one piece of the puzzle and quality of the backsheet or glass and of the lamination process itself are equally vital to ensuring that an encapsulant can offer good long-term protection. “The bare truth is that POE is a better material than EVA due to its stability; provided of course that the specific formulations are good and manufacturing is proper” said CEA’s George Touloupas. “POE must reach the same cost and ease of manufacturing of EVA to fully replace it. This is not foreseen to happen soon at least not in the short term.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvYmlvbG9naWNhbC1jaGVtaXN0cnkvdGlzc3VlLWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nL0Jpb21hdGVyaWFscy1lbmdpbmVlci1Nb2xseS1TdGV2ZW5zLWNyZWF0ZXMvOTkvaTEy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biomaterials engineer Molly Stevens creates materials for tissue regeneration and ultrasensitive diagnostics,"Credit: David Vintiner/Imperial College London

Molly Stevens has long been driven by the hope that her research will change people’s lives. Toward the end of her PhD work in single-molecule biophysics she heard a talk by Massachusetts Institute of Technology biomedical engineer Robert Langer on how the lives of young people with organ failure might be saved by future developments in regenerative medicine. That inspired Stevens to take the skills she had developed studying fundamental molecular mechanisms into a more applied direction.

At Imperial College London her large interdisciplinary research group has been working on such bioengineering challenges for the past 15 years. As director of the Smart Materials Hub of the UK Regenerative Medicine Platform a cross-university initiative she is keen on integrating commercial manufacturing and regulatory expertise so that advances in materials technology actually reach patients.

In addition to developing biomaterials Stevens’s group develops low-cost diagnostics for use in resource-limited countries. Rachel Brazil talked to Stevens about her approach to designing biomaterials and what drives her work. This interview was edited for length and clarity.

The painting is “beautiful but also inspirational because of the passion and strength of the artist at a time when women were not as empowered.” ▸ Advice she gives her students: “If you learn something from a failure then it’s not a failure.”

What is unique about your approach to designing biomaterials?

I’m coming at it from being interested in surfaces and how these can be decorated and manipulated which is probably different from how a lot of other biomedical engineers would think about solving problems. We are interested in translation to the clinic but looking into fundamental mechanisms also enables you to really think about how you’re going to design materials to interact with biology. I’ve always been interested in zooming in and understanding what happens at the interface between a material and biomolecules or cells.

Rather than just thinking about matching the bulk properties of a tissue we are also thinking about the ways that you can structure those materials so that they interact with particular proteins or receptors on an individual cell. Our research brings in all sorts of chemistry but also nanostructuring of materials and new ways of thinking about processing materials. It needs an interdisciplinary approach and I am so inspired by my wonderful team.

What’s an example of how you’re designing materials to better interact with cells?

We’ve done a lot of work on structuring of materials to make what we call nanoneedles (ACS Nano 2015 DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.5b01490). They’re really interesting because a cell can attach onto them. It’s like the cell is sitting on a bed of nails and the membrane gets stimulated in a different way than how it would on a flat surface. We’ve found that it changes the way that the cell senses its mechanical environment. The cell membrane retains its integrity but it becomes a bit more permeable so you can start to deliver things across that membrane differently and also measure biochemical processes in the cell. So structuring on the micro- or nanoscale level results in a direct difference in how the cell perceives a material and it can have really important medical applications too.

How are you using materials for tissue repair?

I’ve had an interest in bone for a long time and that has included really thinking about understanding the structure of bone. In my lab we’ve used things like Raman spectroscopy to understand how for example embryonic stem cells mineralize (Nat. Mater. 2009 DOI: 10.1038/nmat2505). Those are fundamental studies that have gone on for a long time. We’ve also used electron microscopy to really zoom in and look at the nanoscale structure of bone (Science 2018 DOI: 10.1126/science.aao2189).

We’re considering combining 3D structuring of materials with interesting chemical signals that you could give to the cells at the surface of the material to try and promote mineralization. Then how do we combine that with a slightly different material so that we can have a tissue adjacent to it that is nonmineralized—for example at a bone-cartilage interface?

I’m very driven by making sure that the things we develop can have an impact on global health and are not so expensive that they can only benefit the developed world.

It’s a very intricate thing; the transition in the body from cartilage to bone happens in a way that’s mechanically very stable. So if you try and engineer that but the whole thing isn’t well integrated then it’s not going to be a successful repair. Getting a tissue that really spans across those two different materials is something that hasn’t yet successfully been re-created artificially. We also have made exciting advances in the cardiac field and in developing biomaterials for delivery of therapeutics.

What is your approach to diagnostics?

I’m very driven by making sure that the things we develop can have an impact on global health and are not so expensive that they can only benefit the developed world. A lot of the work we’ve been doing in diagnostics has been around discovering how we can get fantastic performance out of materials that could be accessible to everyone.

Some of the very exciting things we’ve done have been around particles that can provide an activity—a little bit like how artificial enzymes function—in a way that’s more stable than a normal artificial enzyme would be. So you can think about using these particles within situations where you might have extreme temperatures. We’re using these to develop a lot of different types of biosensing tests but they’re more sensitive than traditional ones would be and can be read by a mobile phone (Nature 2019 DOI: 10.1038/s41586-019-0956-2). For HIV we showed that we could get very very sensitive detection with this sort of approach (ACS Nano 2017 DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.7b06229). We are also looking at this type of test for COVID-19 and for a number of cancer applications and we’re working with industrial partners as well as with collaborators in Africa to take those forward.

We are excited to be working closely with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to make sure that we can develop innovations that will be useful to people in the developing world. I want to make sure that the work we do impacts populations that really need those interventions in a cost-effective and scalable way.",,,,,,

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. Aptiv PLC's 3-year average revenue growth rate is in the middle range of the companies in Vehicles & Parts industry. Aptiv PLC's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 13.7% which ranks better than 80% of the companies in Vehicles & Parts industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Aptiv PLC's return on invested capital is 7.43 and its cost of capital is 12.17. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Aptiv PLC is shown below:

Aptiv PLC Stock Appears To Be Significantly Overvalued

Employees who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 have the option to return with safety protocols in place. The goal is to have all employees back in person no later than July 1 said spokeswoman Jackie Anderson assuming that vaccines continue to be readily available and the company is able to meet current guidelines for safety.

Some staff have been working from home if the nature of their work allows it she said.

""It depends on the location and function"" Anderson said. ""Most colleagues have been working from home but we have had alternating schedules and other arrangements in place for some positions depending on the nature of their work. For example many colleagues working in our (research and development) center require tools and equipment to complete projects surrounding innovation and research for our customers and we’ve made accommodations to allow those employees to work safely in a lab setting in the office during this time.""

While the hope is that most employees will be able to return to the office full time she said if that isn't possible for some the company will work with those individuals if circumstances require flexibility.

""Maintaining continuity in the entire food supply chain is essential now more than ever to ensure people continue to have access to the nutrition they need"" said Anderson said in a statement.

The statement went on to say: ""ADM plays a critical role throughout that supply chain and our front line workers have been working tirelessly to keep operations running throughout this challenging time. We have had a reduced staff model in place at our Decatur office locations for the past year. As vaccines have become more readily available we are giving colleagues who are fully vaccinated the option to return to the office starting April 12. We have strict protocols and procedures in place to ensure a safe working environment once colleagues begin returning to the workplace and are discussing those directly with colleagues. We understand that vaccination is a personal choice and are encouraging colleagues to work directly with their health care provider and manager to determine the best solution for their personal situation.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Electronics Inc will wind down its loss-making mobile division after failing to find a buyer a move that is set to make it the first major smartphone brand to completely withdraw from the market.

Its decision to pull out will leave its 10% share in North America where it is the No. 3 brand to be gobbled up by Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc with its domestic rival expected to have the edge.

""In the United States LG has targeted mid-priced - if not ultra-low - models and that means Samsung which has more mid-priced product lines than Apple will be better able to attract LG users"" said Ko Eui-young an analyst at Hi Investment & Securities.

LG's smartphone division has logged nearly six years of losses totalling some $4.5 billion. Dropping out of the fiercely competitive sector would allow LG to focus on growth areas such as electric vehicle components connected devices and smart homes it said in a statement.

In better times LG was early to market with a number of cell phone innovations including ultra-wide angle cameras and at its peak in 2013 it was the world's third-largest smartphone manufacturer behind Samsung and Apple.

But later its flagship models suffered from both software and hardware mishaps which combined with slower software updates saw the brand steadily slip in favour. Analysts have also criticised the company for lack of expertise in marketing compared to Chinese rivals.

While other well-known mobile brands such as Nokia HTC and Blackberry have also fallen from lofty heights they have yet to disappear completely.

LG's current global share is only about 2%. It shipped 23 million phones last year which compares with 256 million for Samsung according to research provider Counterpoint.

In addition to North America it does have a sizeable presence in Latin America where it ranks as the No. 5 brand.

While rival Chinese brands such as Oppo Vivo and Xiaomi do not have much of a presence in the United States in part due to frosty bilateral relations their and Samsung's low to mid-range product offerings are set to benefit from LG's absence in Latin America analysts said.

LG's smartphone division the smallest of its five divisions accounting for about 7% of revenue is expected to be wound down by July 31.

In South Korea the division's employees will be moved to other LG Electronics businesses and affiliates while elsewhere decisions on employment will be made at the local level.

Analysts said they were told in a conference call that LG plans to retain its 4G and 5G core technology patents as well as core R&D personnel and will continue to develop communication technologies for 6G. It has yet to decide whether to license out such intellectual property in the future they added.

LG will provide service support and software updates for customers of existing mobile products for a period of time which will vary by region it added.

Talks to sell part of the business to Vietnam's Vingroup fell through due to differences about terms sources with knowledge of the matter have said.

LG Elec shares have risen about 7% since a January announcement that it was considering all options for the business.

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Story continues

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

Competition and Market Pressures: The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive with constant pressure from both established players and new entrants. AJG must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share which requires ongoing investment in technology and talent retention.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: AJG has the opportunity to leverage technology data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance client services and internal efficiencies. By investing in technology-based solutions AJG can differentiate itself from competitors and offer value-added services to its clients.

ESG Initiatives: There is a growing emphasis on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world. AJG can capitalize on this trend by integrating ESG considerations into its service offerings and operations potentially attracting clients who prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.

Emerging Markets: AJG can expand its presence in emerging markets where insurance penetration is typically lower and growth prospects are higher. By establishing a foothold in these regions AJG can diversify its revenue base and tap into new client segments.

Threats

Global Economic Volatility: AJG operates in a global environment that is subject to economic and geopolitical volatility. Events such as recessions political unrest or trade wars can disrupt markets and negatively impact AJG's operations and financial performance.

Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated and changes in laws or enforcement policies can have significant implications for AJG's business model. Compliance with new regulations can be costly and time-consuming potentially affecting profitability.

Cybersecurity Risks: As a company that relies on data and technology AJG is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. A significant data breach or cyber-attack could damage the company's reputation result in financial losses and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.

In conclusion Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) exhibits a strong market position with a robust brokerage segment and a strategic approach to acquisitions. However the company must navigate integration risks economic dependencies and competitive pressures. Opportunities in technology ESG initiatives and emerging markets present avenues for growth while global economic volatility regulatory changes and cybersecurity risks pose significant threats.

■ «L’Enfer» sans Mahomet

Le 25 mars dernier marquait le jour de Dante rebaptisé depuis l’an dernier le Dantedi. Cette commémoration était d’autant plus attendue que 2021 marque les 700 ans de la mort du poète italien. Pour autant loin de célébrer l’impact transculturel de son célèbre triptyque La Divine Comédie l’éditeur néerlandais Blossom Books lui a offert une nouvelle traduction de L’Enfer s’assurant d’y effacer le nom de Mahomet «pour ne pas blesser inutilement»… Une justification étonnante quand l’on remarque que le prophète musulman est la seule figure à être exclue Lies Lavrijsen la traductrice ayant fait le choix de conserver papes Judas meurtriers de César et homosexuels dont le destin aux enfers ne pouvait visiblement pas blesser les croyances d’autrui.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbGlicmVvcGluaW9uZ3VpbmVlLmNvbS9uaWdlci1sZS1ub3V2ZWF1LXByZXNpZGVudC1lbHUtbW9oYW1lZC1iYXpvdW0tcHJlbmQtbGEtdGV0ZS1kdS1wYXlzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Niger: le nouveau président élu Mohamed Bazoum prend la tête du pays,"Au terme de ses deux mandats constitutionnels Mahamadou Issoufou a remis ce vendredi matin les clés de la présidence à son successeur Mohamed Bazoum.

Dans son tout premier discours le nouveau président a rendu un hommage appuyé à Mahamadou Issoufou qui passe la main après dix ans de pouvoir. Mohamed Bazoum a parlé longuement de son ami de 30 ans avec qui il a fondé le PNDS le parti au pouvoir en 1990. « L’acte de naissance d’un projet dont la présente cérémonie n’est pas le moindre aboutissement » a-t-il déclaré.

Mohamed Bazoum place clairement son futur mandat dans la continuité de ce qu’a accompli Mahamadou Issoufou. Il reprend donc des thèmes de son prédécesseur : l’amélioration de l’éducation et notamment la scolarité des jeunes filles. La démographie également. Mohamed Bazoum a évoqué le « cercle vicieux » dans lequel le Niger se trouve enfermé. Le nouveau président a aussi promis de prendre à bras le corps la question de la corruption. Plusieurs scandales ont émaillé le mandat de son prédécesseur comme celui des détournements au ministère de la Défense. « Quiconque a une responsabilité dans l’administration répondra de ses actes » a-t-il prévenu.

Fait notable de ce discours cette main tendue à la société civile. Mohamed Bazoum a déclaré qu’il fallait « mettre un terme au malentendu » qui les opposait le nouveau président assurant qu’il consacrerait son mandat à la lutte pour la justice sociale.",,,

On Monday night the Metropolitan Museum of Art will play host to one of the biggest fund-raising events and starriest parties of the year: the annual Costume Institute Benefit or as it’s been known for years the Met Gala.

The event which raises millions of dollars for the museum’s self-funding fashion wing has become known for its audacious red carpet with a highly exclusive guest list handpicked by Anna Wintour the longtime Vogue editor and Condé Nast executive.

But this year’s event has been unusually shadowed by drama. The union representing employees of Condé Nast publications including Bon Appétit GQ Vanity Fair and Vogue escalated the stakes in its long-running contract negotiations on Saturday telling the company in a video posted on X that if management didn’t meet the union at the bargaining table its members would “meet you at the Met.”

But the possibility of a work stoppage and picket line during Vogue’s biggest night was averted early Monday morning when Condé management and the union reached a tentative agreement on the terms of a contract.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hY2N1d2VhdGhlci5jb20vZW4vc2V2ZXJlLXdlYXRoZXIvYXQtbGVhc3QtMS1kZWFkLWh1bmRyZWRzLW9mLXJlc2N1ZXMtYWZ0ZXItZmxvb2RpbmctaW51bmRhdGVzLXNvdXRoZWFzdC10ZXhhcy8xNjQ3MTM00gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFjY3V3ZWF0aGVyLmNvbS9lbi9zZXZlcmUtd2VhdGhlci9hdC1sZWFzdC0xLWRlYWQtaHVuZHJlZHMtb2YtcmVzY3Vlcy1hZnRlci1mbG9vZGluZy1pbnVuZGF0ZXMtc291dGhlYXN0LXRleGFzLzE2NDcxMzQvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At least 1 dead hundreds of rescues after flooding inundates southeast Texas,"At least 1 dead hundreds of rescues after flooding inundates southeast Texas

A 4-year-old boy and his parents got out of a car stuck in floodwaters to try for safe ground but a 911 caller said they were swept away.

Copied

It’s been a rough latter half of the week for the Lone Star State which has dealt with severe storms that brought hail dangerous flash flooding and tornadoes on May 2-3.

The body of a 4-year-old boy was found after flash floods ripped through a suburb of Fort Worth Texas on Sunday. Someone called Johnson County Sheriff's Office dispatchers around 2 a.m. and reported that a family of three was in a car stuck in high water in Burleson about 15 miles north of Fort Worth according to local news affiliate WFAA.

The boy and his parents got out of the car to try for safe ground but the 911 caller said they were swept into the floodwaters.

Rescuers found Aaron and Chelsey Warren later that morning and transported them to the hospital according to the Johnson County Office of Emergency Management. The body of Lucas Warren who would've turned 5 this month was found a few hours later.

Aaron Warren's brother created a GoFundMe on behalf of the Warrens saying ""The accident totaled their only car ruined their phones and swept away their wallets. They are in extreme need and anything y’all can contribute will be used to pay for Lucas’ funeral and help rebuild their lives. This is the hardest thing anyone in my family has ever been through.""

Severe storms unleashed torrential rainfall and caused flooding in southeastern Texas cities from College Station to Houston. After days of nonstop rain hundreds of water rescues occurred across southeast Texas over the weekend. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo told CNN that 153 pets have also been rescued during the deluge.

A police officer responded on a jet ski to a flooded trailer park in Houston. He rescued a man swimming in 10-feet deep waters as well as three dogs spotted while driving through.

Various videos posted to social media show people inadvertently driving into deep floodwaters and in some cases being swept away. Drone footage from Livingston Texas 70 miles northeast of Houston showed cars homes and roads underwater.

The Red Cross is on the ground in southeast Texas spokesperson Stephanie Fox told AccuWeather offering refuge for those who need a safe dry place to stay.

The driver drove through a flooded parking lot and directly into a creek hidden by the water becoming stranded and needing rescue in College Station Texas on May 2.

AccuWeather Flooding Expert Alex Sosnowski put the serious flooding into historical context: “The flooding occurring in parts of Southeast Texas is some of the most significant since Hurricane Harvey affected the region in 2017. This time it is focused over a smaller area and a bit farther to the north when compared to Harvey’s days of tropical rains that dropped upwards of 60 inches in some locations.""

At least one spot bested a record set more than a century ago. According to NOAA's National Water Prediction Service the Navasota River gauge near Easterly Texas set a new record high Thursday night of 30.62 feet beating the previous record of 29 feet set on June 1 1899.

Floods are the most common severe weather emergency in the United States. That’s why it’s important to know what to do if you find yourself driving in one.

The Harris County Sheriff's Office says that while many hazards remain the water is slowly receding for now. However AccuWeather meteorologists urge residents not to let their guard down. When adverse weather conditions last for days people can develop weather fatigue but taking every notification seriously is important. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive watches and warnings keep a close eye on conditions in your area and have a plan in place on where you'll go if floodwaters begin to rise.

AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said there is some good news for the flood-ravaged Texas as any concentrated thunderstorms will remain to the North. ""However there are two concerning timeframes for locally heavy rain"" he said. ""The first will be Thursday as cold slowly drops south. The second is late this weekend into early next week as a stronger front arrives from the northwest.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvamFtZXMtZ3Vubi1zaGFyZXMtZmlyc3QtbG9vay1hdC1kYXZpZC1jb3JlbnN3ZXRzLXN1cGVybWFu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Gunn Shares First Look at David Corenswet's Superman,"DC Studios co-CEO and Superman director James Gunn has shared the first full look at David Corenswet as the Man of Steel.

Revealed on Threads Gunn told fans to ""get ready"" for the July 11 2025 premiere date while fully revealing Corenswet's Superman. The image shows him sitting in what's presumably a Metropolis skyscraper very casually pulling up his boot while an earth shattering event takes places outside.

While this is a fresh new Superman from a fresh new DC Universe the suit itself doesn't appear particularly new as the sacred S symbol and its arms appear dirtied or faded. Though we'd already been shown the logo the new image reveals the rest of the suit and gives fans plenty more to analyze as they try to figure out Gunn's influences ahead of the film's release.

Superman previously Superman: Legacy will be the first film in the rebooted DCU's Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters but it's definitely not an origin story and also features a ton of other DC heroes and villains.

Alongside Corenswet's Superman stands Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane and the film also stars Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho María Gabriela as The Engineer and more. Gunn confirmed these actors will play the roles in other DCU projects too.

Chapter 1 of the DCU also features TV shows and while the exact contents have shuffled a tad since Gunn and co-CEO Peter Safran announced it in 2023 an animated series called Creature Commandos will officially kick off the new universe in late 2024.

Former Kentucky forward Adou Thiero a projected first-round NBA draft pick in 2025 is following John Calipari and will transfer to Arkansas he told ESPN on Monday.

Thiero considered a long list of schools narrowing it down last month to Pitt Kentucky Indiana North Carolina and the Razorbacks.

""I started with Coach Cal and want to see it through with him"" he said. ""Very excited to join the family and ready to get to work.""

A 6-foot-8 forward from Leetsdale Pennsylvania Thiero is ranked No. 27 in ESPN's 2025 NBA draft rankings. He started 19 games this past season for Calipari at Kentucky averaging 7.2 points and 5.0 rebounds in 21.3 minutes. Some of the sophomore's best contributions came in the Wildcats' toughest games putting up 16 points and 13 rebounds against Kansas in the Champions Classic; 15 points 5 boards and 3 blocks against Gonzaga; and 14 points and 8 rebounds in a win over Auburn.

Thiero took a clear step forward from his freshman season when he averaged 2.3 points and 1.9 rebounds in 20 games.

His development under Calipari and familiarity with the Hall of Fame head coach gave Arkansas the edge for his commitment.

""He's known for putting guys in the NBA that also stay in the NBA and coach Kenny Payne who is now with him again was also there for some of those years"" Thiero said. ""After already playing for him and developing after two years I feel that he knows my game and will put me in the right position to succeed and achieve my goals.""

Thiero becomes the fifth player to follow Calipari from Lexington to Fayetteville joining incoming freshmen Boogie Fland Karter Knox and Billy Richmond and rising sophomore center Zvonimir Ivisic. The Razorbacks are also bringing in top-five transfer Johnell Davis from Florida Atlantic and all-SEC big man Jonas Aidoo from Tennessee.

(BAC) is testing March’s 13-year high near 40 thanks to the relentless rise in interest rates and is well-positioned for additional gains following next week’s Q1 2021 earnings release. Investors have taken note lifting accumulation readings to the highest highs of the century confirming renewed optimism that could finally signal a successful assault on 2006’s all-time high in the mid-50s.

Infrastructure Investment Paying Off

The Federal Reserve added to positive sentiment in March announcing that all restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases will end for most firms after June 30. The central bank allowed limited dividends and buybacks in the first quarter as part of the recovery from 2020’s pandemic-driven system shock. Banks have built a sizable cash hoard in the improving economic conditions and could deploy that capital aggressively when the last chains come off.

CEO Brain Moynihan outlined growing tailwinds in a recent interview noting “The key is we’ve been able to invest $3.5 billion a year in technology. We’ve been able to open up branches in many new cities. We’ve been able to raise minimum wages while we’ve kept expenses down. Now that’s the magic in a franchise so when rates rise which they will at some point—and when they did in ’16 and ’17—the earnings rise sharply because we have no more expenses to deploy and all the revenue that comes in from the deposit base.”

Wall Street and Technical Outlook

Wall Street consensus stands at an ‘Overweight’ rating based upon 15 ‘Buy’ 3 ‘Overweight’ and 9 ‘Hold’ recommendations. One analyst now recommends that shareholders close positions and move to the sidelines. Price targets currently range from a low of $30 to a Street-high $45 while the stock closed Friday’s session less than $2 above the median $38 target. Look for ratings and targets to go higher if Bank of America posts strong first quarter results.

The stock fell to a 26-year low in 2009 and turned higher into the new decade stalling in the upper teens in 2010. It finally cleared that resistance level after the 2016 presidential election stalling at the .618 Fibonacci retracement of the 2006 to 2009 decline in October 2019. The March 2020 selloff printed the third higher low since 2009 yielding a breakout that’s now targeting the .786 retracement in the low to mid-40s.

The push to diversify banking from within the industry

The racial reckoning in America calling for diversity has touched every industry including banking.

According to a report from the Committee for Better Banks -- a bank workers' advocacy group -- Black and Latino employees have a significantly smaller chance of holding an executive position in corporate banks in comparison to their white counterparts.

""I heard lots of stories of workers of color who said 'I've applied for 15 jobs 20 jobs never got an interview I always had good performance reviews by my manager ... but never got an interview'"" Nick Weiner the lead author of the CBB report told ABC News.

The report finds that Black and Latino employees at 13 major U.S. banks have a less than 25% chance of being promoted or hired for a senior management or executive position in comparison to their white colleagues. Black and Latinos also have a very high likelihood of being in an entry-level position with limited mobility such as bank teller and call center employees in comparison to their white colleges the report also found.

The study gave the financial industry a ""C"" grade for diversity. African American and Latino representation were given a ""D"" and Asian representation a ""C.""

A lack of diversity in corporate America is nothing new but the impact is even more widespread in banking. African Americans and Hispanics are less likely than their white counterparts to receive home mortgages personal loans and are more likely to lack trust in banking and lack banking access and resources.

Reese Giddins the president of Greenwood Bank who worked in corporate banking for several years before helping to start minority-focused and owned bank Greenwood said the lack of diversity may contribute to the lack of trust in financial institutions from minorities.

""When you don't have people that look like you that can't understand you and can't help you it's hard to build that trust. With Greenwood we're trying to rebuild that trust in our community along with the recirculation of the dollars into the community as well as bringing in that talent"" Giddins told ABC News.

Many banks including those studied in the CBB report released statements following the death of George Floyd promising to diversify and provide racial equity.

However further steps to diversify the industry are needed said Wells Fargo employee Ted Laurel.

""I would say that we would need more change beyond just adding more ranks of minorities into our leadership ... A two-prong approach would definitely help moving the employees up from the bottom that we already have and then also recruiting more diverse talent especially from those minority colleges"" Laurel said.

A number of banks including US Bank and Wells Fargo were given an ""F"" grade in the report. According to the report authors these banks declined to provide its researchers with data on ""the total number of employees within race groups at the company.""

A spokesperson from Wells Fargo told ABC News the company has work to do with improving diversity but is making strides.

""Wells Fargo is committed to doing the work to ensure we provide our employees with an inclusive and respectful workplace where diverse talent flourishes. While we have more work to do we have taken steps that include creating a diverse segments representation and inclusion group reporting directly to the CEO that is accountable for progress and execution of new and existing programs conducting diversity-focused talent reviews and sponsorship programs to help promote underrepresented groups assessing senior leaders on increasing diverse representation at leadership levels and requiring unconscious bias training for all managers. We are committed to sharing results"" Well Fargo told ABC News via a statement.

""In 2020 we broadly disclosed our EEO-1 data for the first time and we intend to publish our 2019 and 2020 Consolidated EEO-1 gender/race employment data in the summer of 2021 as part of our updated ESG reporting process. Wells Fargo values diversity and inclusion not just as a business imperative but because it's the right thing to do"" Wells Fargo senior vice president Kate Pulley also said in a statement to ABC News.

Wells Fargo has also recently hired Kleber Santos in November of 2020 to lead Diverse Segments Representation & Inclusion to improve internal diversity and equity.

US Bank employee Marcus Dodson said transparency is needed to fully see how the issue is being resolved.

""What I would like to see is transparency ... a focus on diversity. From what I've seen we've had these trainings that we take online. I would say that there hasn't been a focus on minority hiring minority issues or having difficult conversations"" Dodson said

US Bank declined ABC News' request for an interview but released the following statement:

""The findings in this report are not accurate and do not reflect information we've released publicly including in our 2020 Environmental Social and Governance Report which is available on our website"" US Bank vice president Lee Henderson said in a statement.

When the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses started last April so many of Southern Bancorp’s customers didn’t qualify for the relief money that the Arkansas bank’s chief executive Darrin Williams turned to donors to raise money for $1000 grants so it wouldn’t have to turn applicants away empty-handed.

The bank made 128 such grants giving more than 100 of them to businesses run by women or minority owners. One let a nail salon owner buy plexiglass so she could reopen. Another allowed a small cafe to buy safety gear for its staff. A day care used the money for the new sanitizing equipment it needed.

Farmer Joe was enticed to take a bath with Claire both of whom developed a connection with each other during their first 24-hour date together.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle.

The cattle and sheep farmer 33 offered another 24-hour date up for grabs with the marketing manager 36 pulling out all the stops to win.

'I saw the bathtub near our tent so yeah I just wanted to set up a little spot for us to share some time together' Claire told producers.

Farmer Wants A Wife Australia fans said they were left 'cringing' away from the TV on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants

However it seemed the plan 'fell flat' when awkward scenes showed the pair stripping down and stepping into the warm bath looking shy in front of the cameras.

The pair appeared uncomfortable sharing affections while in their underwear on TV but did attempt to share a kiss and caress one another in a cringey display.

'I couldn't watch the bath just a bunch of giggling it was so cringe' one person wrote on Facebook.

Another added: 'I know I felt awkward for watching haha not even a conversation going.'

'Yes it was so cringeworthy it was hard to watch' one user commented.

Others noted that it was only awkward because Farmer Joe did not appear to be as interested in Claire as she was him.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle

One wrote: 'To me that date thing that Claire planned for Joe fell flat I honestly don't think he's feeling it for any of the women.'

'No he is not feeling it with any of them but well and truly enjoying the game!' another agreed.

Farmer Joe has formed several connections this season but still hasn't had much luck after Susie walked out on him when she realised farm life was not for her.

If your mother enjoys the outdoors and appreciates the delicate beauty of birds what better gift is there than a bird bath? More specifically a solar-powered bird bath fountain. It only needs a little bit of sun exposure before it begins blasting water into the air giving all of your flying friends a chance to wash off that sky dust.

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

Splish splash they were takin' a bath! Mom will enjoy the feathered fun this bird bath will bring to her garden. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath. I put a half-inch square of electrical tape over one of the solar collectors and wait and watch. If the spray is too strong I put another piece on. it usually takes three pieces.""

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWF0YW5kaHJhLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbmV3cy9kaWQtc2FtYW50aGEtcG9zdC1hLWJhdGhpbmctcGljLWFzLWhlci1pc3RhLXN0b3J5LTEzNzcwNNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vbW9iaS5ncmVhdGFuZGhyYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9kaWQtc2FtYW50aGEtcG9zdC1hLWJhdGhpbmctcGljLWFzLWhlci1pc3RhLXN0b3J5LzEzNzcwNC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Samantha Post a 'bathing' pic as her Ista Story?..,"Samantha's ""Insta Story"" photos have gone viral online.

Warren Buffett still lives in the house he bought for $31500 in 1958. Inflation adjusted to 2021 dollars it cost him $286676 in 1958 buying power. His house is a 6570 square feet stucco house that has 5 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms.

His home is located in a wealthy neighborhood in Omaha Nebraska. It’s now worth an estimated $915000 based on comparative houses in the neighborhood likely driven up by his fame. Buffett once called it the “third-best investment he’s ever made” but later considered how much he would have made if the money he spent on the house would have been used to buy Berkshire-Hathaway stock in 1958 hopefully he was joking.

For one of the richest men in the world this is a very frugal house that is .001% of his total net worth. He could have any house he wanted in the world but prefers the simplicity and loves living in Nebraska where he grew up. He has always been happy there and never saw any reason to move.

In the last decade after a lot of urging he now has fences and security cameras at the property along with a security guard. It is a large home that he finds comfortable and likes to keep things the same like his Cadillac that he will drive for a decade or the same McDonald’s breakfast he eats almost every day.

In all the books about him and interviews I have watched Warren Buffett is not one to indulge in materialism or buying big items. He says he is happiest in his jogging pants eating popcorn and watching a Nebraska college football game or playing bridge very cheap pleasures.

He said his one guilty indulgence is that he loves the convenience of private jets so much that he bought Netjets. He said the reason he doesn’t own a yacht is he would not want to deal with employees and their drama that it would take to operate it or the cost and trouble of maintenance and upkeep of a boat.

He eats standard American foods like burgers and steaks loves Coca Cola and football and lives in the same house he could afford as a young millionaire in 1958.

During an interview with the BBC he said: “I’m happy there. I’d move if I thought I’d be happier someplace else.”

Warren Buffett’s current home residence:

Very interesting that the one of the world’s richest men is content with the same house he bought in 1958 and never upgraded to one of the mega mansions or compounds that most billionaires own. He likes to keep his life simple and familiar.

The home is luxurious and sits protected behind a gate close to O.C.'s beaches and yacht clubs.

The mansion has five bedrooms including a private master bedroom that looks like it belongs in a resort. The master ceiling is 20-feet high with double story windows a soaking tub double rain shower steam room and studio space.

The backyard has the obligatory California pool spa and a twisting water slide.

Some of the renovations Christina made to the home were actually featured on her show ""Christina on the Coast.""

What Happened: One of the most surprising names in the new Ark space ETF was Deere & Company (NYSE: DE). The farm equipment maker is the 13th largest holding in the new ETF representing $10.8 million and 3.1% of the fund’s assets as of Thursday.

The inclusion shows Ark is not only including pure space companies. The fund also will hold companies that could benefit from the growth of space.

“Aerospace beneficiary companies are companies whose operations stand to benefit from aerospace activities including agriculture internet access global positioning system construction imaging drones air taxes and electric aviation vehicles” according to Ark Funds.

Why It’s Important: Since the 1990s John Deere has worked on using GPS technology to improve precision agriculture.

In 2018 John Deere partnered with NASA to improve its self-driving tractors. The company tapped into NASA’s global network of ground stations.

Most self-driving tractors cultivating the majority of American farmland rely on NASA technology. The NASA model for commercial software can help predict yields and classify land types using satellite imagery.

“This innovation resulted in perhaps one of NASA’s most important contributions to modern society — highly accurate GPS navigation anywhere on Earth including crop fields” the Food Institute said on the GPS improvements brought from NASA software.

The link between space and agriculture companies appears here to stay: In December 2020 NASA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture extended a long-standing partnership on space-based assets.

Ark Funds sees Deere & Company and other agricultural-related names such as top holding Trimble Inc (NASDAQ: TRMB) as winners in the growth of satellites and GPS.

DE Price Action: Shares of Deere & Company ended the week up 0.29% at $372.12.

As that celebration takes place another seminal report—this one obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from the world’s largest investment house—closes the loop on one of the key arguments of that decade-long fight. It definitively shows that the firms that joined that divestment effort have profited not only morally but also financially.

The original report from the London-based Carbon Tracker Initiative found something stark: the world’s fossil-fuel companies had five times more carbon in their reserves than scientists thought we could burn and stay within any sane temperature target. The numbers meant that if those companies carried out their business plans the planet would overheat. At the time I discussed the report with Naomi Klein who like me had been a college student when divestment campaigns helped undercut corporate support for apartheid and to us this seemed a similar fight; indeed efforts were already under way at a few scattered places like Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. In July 2012 I published an article in Rolling Stone calling for a broader large-scale campaign and over the next few years helped organize roadshows here and abroad. Today portfolios and endowments have committed to divest nearly fifteen trillion dollars; the most recent converts the University of Michigan and Amherst College made the pledge in the last week.

No one really pushed back against the core idea behind the campaign—the numbers were clear—but two reasonable questions were asked. One was would divestment achieve tangible results? The idea was that at the least it would tarnish the fossil-fuel industry and would eventually help constrain its ability to raise investment money. That’s been borne out over time: as the stock picker Jim Cramer put it on CNBC a year ago “I’m done with fossil fuels. . . . They’re just done.” He continued “You’re seeing divestiture by a lot of different funds. It’s going to be a parade. It’s going to be a parade that says ‘Look these are tobacco and we’re not going to own them.’ ”

The second question was: Would investors lose money? Early proponents such as the investor Tom Steyer argued that because fossil fuel threatened the planet it would come under increased regulatory pressure even as a new generation of engineers would be devising ways to provide cleaner and cheaper energy using wind and sun and batteries. The fossil-fuel industry fought back—the Independent Petroleum Association of America for instance set up a Web site crowded with research papers from a few academics arguing that divestment would be a costly financial mistake. One report claimed that “the loss from divestment is due to the simple fact that a divested portfolio is suboptimally diversified as it excludes one of the most important sectors of the economy.”

As the decade wore on and more investors took the divestment plunge that argument faltered: the philanthropic Rockefeller Brothers Fund said that divestment had not adversely affected their returns and the investment-fund guru Jeremy Grantham published data showing that excluding any single sector of the economy had no real effect on long-term financial returns. But the Rockefeller Brothers and Grantham were active participants in the fight against global warming so perhaps the fossil-fuel industry suggested motivated reasoning was influencing their conclusions.

The latest findings are making that charge difficult to sustain. For one thing they come from the research arm of BlackRock a company that has been under fire from activists for its longtime refusal to do much about climate. (The company’s stance has slowly begun to shift. Last January Larry Fink its C.E.O. released a letter to clients saying that climate risk would lead them to “reassess core assumptions about modern finance.”) BlackRock carried out the research over the past year for two major clients the New York City teachers’ and public employees’ retirement funds which were considering divestment and wanted to know the financial risk involved. Bernard Tuchman a retiree in New York City and a member of Divest NY a nonprofit advocacy group used public-records requests to obtain BlackRock’s findings from the city late last month. Tuchman then shared them with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis a nonprofit that studies the energy transition.

In places BlackRock’s findings are redacted so as not to show the size of particular holdings but the conclusions are clear: after examining “divestment actions by hundreds of funds worldwide” the BlackRock analysts concluded that the portfolios “experienced no negative financial impacts from divesting from fossil fuels. In fact they found evidence of modest improvement in fund return.” The report’s executive summary states that “no investors found negative performance from divestment; rather neutral to positive results.” In the conclusion to the report the BlackRock team used a phrase beloved by investors: divested portfolios “outperformed their benchmarks.”

In a statement the investment firm downplayed that language saying “BlackRock did not make a recommendation for TRS to divest from fossil fuel reserves. The research was meant to help TRS determine a path forward to meet their stated divestment goals.” But Tom Sanzillo—I.E.E.F.A.’s director of financial analysis and a former New York State first deputy comptroller who oversaw a hundred-and-fifty-billion-dollar pension fund—said in an interview that BlackRock’s findings were clear. “Any investment fund looking to protect itself against losses from coal oil and gas companies now has the largest investment house in the world showing them why how and when to protect themselves the economy and the planet.” In short the financial debate about divestment is as settled as the ethical one—you shouldn’t try to profit off the end of the world and in any event you won’t.

These findings will gradually filter out into the world’s markets doubtless pushing more investors to divest. But its impact will be more immediate if its author—BlackRock—takes its own findings seriously and acts on them. BlackRock handles more money than any firm in the world mostly in the form of passive investments—it basically buys some of everything on the index. But given the climate emergency it would be awfully useful if over a few years BlackRock eliminated the big fossil-fuel companies from those indexes something they could certainly do. And given its own research findings doing so would make more money for their clients—the pensioners whose money they invest.

BlackRock could accomplish even more than that. It is the biggest asset manager on earth with about eight trillion dollars in its digital vaults. It also leases its Aladdin software system to other big financial organizations; last year the Financial Times called Aladdin the “technology hub of modern finance.” BlackRock stopped revealing how much money sat on its system in 2017 when the figure topped twenty trillion dollars. Now with stock prices soaring the Financial Times reported that public documents from just a third of Aladdin’s clients show assets topping twenty-one trillion. Casey Harrell who works with Australia’s Sunrise Project an N.G.O. that urges asset managers to divest believes that the BlackRock system likely directs at least twenty-five trillion in assets. “BlackRock’s own research explains the financial rationale for divestment” Harrell told me. “BlackRock should be bold and proactively offer this as a core piece of its financial advice.”

What would happen if the world’s largest investment firm issued that advice and its clients followed it? Fifteen trillion dollars plus twenty-five trillion is a lot of money. It’s roughly twice the size of the current U.S. economy. It’s almost half the size of the total world economy. It would show that a report issued by a small London think tank a decade ago had turned the financial world’s view of climate upside down.

Alexander Richter 4 Apr 2021

Investment firm ECP has closed the acquisition of remaining 50% interest in Terra-Gen a renewable energy developer & operator with geothermal assets in Nevada.

ECP an investment company investing across energy transition and decarbonization infrastructure assets announced the successful completion of its first Continuation Fund with $1.2 billion in capital commitments and the closing of the fund’s subsequent acquisition of the remaining 50% interest held by ECP’s third fund ECP III in Terra-Gen a leading renewable energy developer and operator. ECP previously sold a 50% stake in the Company to First Sentier Investors. The transaction will provide additional capital to support Terra-Gen’s next phase of growth while allowing ECP III to fully exit its original investment in the Company.

ECP III originally acquired Terra-Gen in 2015 partnering with an experienced management team to acquire a portfolio of strategically located California renewable assets and capitalize on a number of compelling development opportunities. Since ECP’s initial investment the Company has more than doubled its portfolio of operating renewable assets and expanded its pipeline of wind solar and battery storage projects throughout California and numerous key domestic markets. Terra-Gen currently operates more than 1600 MW of facilities and has more than 3000 MW of projects under advanced development including the Edwards Sanborn solar + storage project the largest project of its kind in North America.

Terr-Gen operates two geothermal power plants in Nevada the 67 MW Dixie Valley geothermal plant (2 units) and the 17.7 MW (2 units) Beowave geothermal plant.

“As one of the largest owners of renewable assets in the U.S. ECP is excited to continue its partnership with Terra-Gen as it moves into its next phase of growth and executes on a robust pipeline of advanced near-term development opportunities” said Schuyler Coppedge Partner at ECP. “We believe that Terra-Gen’s wind and storage assets in particular will serve as critical resources to facilitate the energy transition and help California meet its renewable and decarbonization goals.”

The lead LP in the Continuation Fund is Blackstone Strategic Partners and included a diverse group of global investors including existing ECP III limited partners seeking to invest in a leading California-focused renewable energy platform with strong environmental social and corporate governance characteristics.

PJT Partners served as financial advisor on the Continuation Fund transaction. Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal counsel to ECP on the sale of Terra-Gen and the formation of the Continuation Fund. Citi served as lead financial advisor on the sale of Terra-Gen.

Mary Magdalene went to the tomb in which Jesus’ body had been placed and saw a large stone in front of it had been moved Mills said reading aloud from the Gospel of St. John.

Mary called to Simon Peter and another disciple that the Lord had been taken from the tomb and she did not know where he was. Mary wept as she stood outside the tomb. She turned around and saw Jesus but thought he was the gardener. Jesus said: “‘Woman why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?'” Mills read.

It was then that Mary realized who he was and announced to the disciples “I have seen the Lord.”

Mills the Congregational Church’s Christian education supervisor and Sunday school teacher spoke to about 50 people who turned out Sunday at the RiverWalk at Head of Falls for the ecumenical Easter sunrise service organized by the Waterville Interfaith Council. Worshippers began arriving at about 5:30 a.m.

Seagulls and ducks flew over the Two-Cent Bridge as the sun slowly emerged from a smattering of clouds on the Winslow side of the river. The people wearing masks because of the coronavirus pandemic stood in a circle and sang prayed and greeted friends under a half moon still visible in the sky over the gazebo.

The Rev. Thomas Blackstone pastor of the Pleasant Street United Methodist Church welcomed the group saying the Easter sunrise service is one of the “delightful traditions of the Interfaith Council” which represents a number of different faiths in Waterville.

Blackstone introduced Mills and John Balicki rector of St. Mark’s Episcopal Church; Sister Judith Donovan of the Sisters of St. Joseph; Kate Smanik dean of religion and spiritual life at Colby College in Waterville; and the Colby InterVarsity Christian Fellowship Singers.

Donovan offered a call to worship: “Alleluia Christ is risen” she said to which the group responded “Christ is risen indeed.”

﻿

The Colby singers — junior Lensky Augustin and freshman Giftlin Rajarathinam — sang “Christ the Lord is Risen Today” with Rajarathinam playing the guitar. Later they sang “Because He Lives.” Kayla Murphy a Colby junior and worship team coordinator was on hand to support them.

Mills read a prayer of confession and assurance with the group responding and Smanik read aloud from First Corinthians.

Blackstone offered a reading “And the Glory” by Ann Weems from “Kneeling in Jerusalem.”

Balicki recalled the last time he was at Head of Falls — June 7 2020 — when he and others gathered at noon to support Black Lives Matter and recite names of those who had died including George Floyd Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.

“Unfortunately since June 7 we have added many names” Balicki said. “We have still had many victims of racial violence in our country and senseless shootings.”

Balicki also cited the many people who have died from COVID-19.

“We are much in need of resurrection this year” he said.

He then asked the group: “Why are we here? What are we looking for? Even more importantly who are we looking for?”

All come looking for something Balicki said.

“Please know that just as Jesus called Mary by her name” Balicki said “he calls each of us by names as well.

“Here on this beautiful morning as the sun will rise at some point remember there is one person we are looking for and he is looking for us.”

“Is this really edible?”

But Aldi had a very simple explanation for the confused customer.

“The Sprinters Multipack features a batch code on the smaller packets and an expiry date on the larger outer packet. Apologies for any confusion caused” the company wrote.

This isn’t the first time a best before date on an Aldi product has caused concern.

Last month shopper Chris took to Facebook to share the odd sequence of numbers she spotted on a mini pack of Blackstone Sweet Chilli & Sour Cream Chips.

A closer look at Chris’s photos showed that the number “3111-4-2” followed by “11:36” and “39” were printed in the best before box.

“Just wondering how you read this ‘best before’ date?” asked Chris on the Aldi Mums Facebook page.

“Or am I just dumb!?”

The query kickstarted a wave of humorous comments from ALDI fans who were amused by the find.

Said a third: “You have 3111 days to eat them so no real rush.”

Wrote one more: “Not sure if it’s BC or AD?”

Added one more: “Look it’s safe to say some day in the future before 11:36 am.”"

Whichever side of the spectrum you fall on the 737-MAX is back in the skies.

If it wasn’t hard enough for airlines to sell tickets this year things got far more difficult when they brought the beleaguered Boeing plane back.

The plane brings airlines significant fuel savings and new bells and whistles to the flying experience but not everyone is sold. To allow flyers a chance to ease into the notion many airlines adopted policies which gave “outs” for people who didn’t want to fly on one for one reason or another allowing them to swap for alternative options.

After a successful few months back in service in the United States United is now the first airline to drop this courtesy policy taking away flexibility for anyone who doesn’t want to fly on one. It’s expected others will too.

737-MAX Is Back Flexibility Is Gone

American Airlines was one of the more generous airlines when the 737-MAX debuted for the airline on the New York-Miami route.

If a passenger wasn’t comfortable with the new aircraft on their ticket American let people swap to a different flight operated by another type of aircraft or if the MAX was the only plane serving their destination to receive a full refund or switch to another “nearby” airport free of charge.

That policy still exists and things haven’t exactly been faultless.

But United in a way only United seems to know how to do is now telling passengers if they book a Boeing 737-MAX or even if they don’t and end up one there’s no official policy offering flexibility to allow them to change for free. The change comes into effect on April 7th 2021.

Until this point United emailed passengers proactively to offer alternatives and to inform them as a courtesy of what they’re scheduled to fly on. United will stop doing so from April 7th and anyone who wishes to change may be subject to fare difference or any other fees to avoid the aircraft.

United like most US airlines right now does have a sweeping flexibility policy due to covid-19. The airline also dropped change fees permanently so the main factor is that you may need to pay more for a different flight via fare difference.

This change could also impact travelers on a tight schedule who may not find a suitable non-MAX flight alternative which fits their needs. Accepting a future travel voucher could be better than nothing but someone in that situation would likely need to dig further into their pocket to book a fresh ticket if the case.

The wing tips go both up and down on the 737 MAX.

Will Other Airlines Drop Flexibility?

It’s unclear at this point whether American Airlines will keep the policy in tact or join United in dropping specific flexibility for those scheduled on the plane. Southwest just places a huge order for more 737-MAX aircraft and it won’t be long until many more are flying.

European and UK regulators have also cleared the 737-MAX to fly and many airlines are eager to get the plane into service. The plane has many major customers in South America Europe Asia-Pacific Africa The Middle East and beyond so as deliveries are made it’ll become harder and harder to avoid.

If you absolutely don’t want to end up on one whatever the reason this article offers quite a few ways to search out which flights will be operated by a 737-MAX how to tell visually (even if they change the name) and the airlines which will operate the plane."

In many places restaurants have been closed and even where they’re open customers have been reticent to go out to eat because of the pandemic.

This is a program known for consistently devaluing their points program and which even added a checkbox for people to opt into points earning on each reservation something people easily missed.

They made clear to expect points expiration to come March 31. My points expired earlier in the month than that. So I emailed a complaint to OpenTable at the suggestion of a reader. They got back to me saying they’d give me my points back.

Due to an unexpected surge in email requests related to points expiration and redemption response times are longer than usual. If you are receiving this email please know that we have received your original inquiry and are ensuring that your points don’t expire on March 31st or that any recently expired points are reinstated. Given our current quantity of requests it may take more than one week for us to process your request.

One hint for your points is to get more value out of them redeeming for Kayak bookings since both OpenTable and Kayak are owned by Booking Holdings (née Priceline Group).",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's how drug firms are trying to fix it,"In his first years as an oncologist Jonathan Drachman treated people with kidney cancer and melanoma. There were few treatment options for them in the 1990s he says and cancer immunotherapy—the manipulation of a person’s immune system to kill off cancer cells—was still new.

In brief Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a potent human protein that can activate and also dampen the body’s immune response. Nearly 30 years after the US Food and Drug Administration first approved IL-2 to treat melanoma and kidney cancer a host of pharma and biotech companies are racing to the clinic with engineered versions of the protein that they hope will be safer and more precise than those in use today. Others are trying to harness IL-2’s immune-suppressive power to treat autoimmune diseases.

But there was a drug called Proleukin that for better or worse gripped his attention. Proleukin also called aldesleukin was a therapeutic version of interleukin-2 (IL-2) a small human protein called a cytokine that could attach to specific kinds of immune cells and stimulate them to grow and divide. Some of these immune cells could kill foreign invaders including cancer cells.

Proleukin was an early cancer immunotherapy and when it worked Drachman says it worked well. About 15% of people treated went into remission he says and of those up to 8% survived for years even decades. Drachman now the CEO of Neoleukin Therapeutics a company developing an IL-2-like therapy says he couldn’t have been more excited.

“It was one of the first immunotherapies that actually worked in anyone” he says.

But there was a catch. Proleukin could be dangerous. At a time when many cancer treatments could be taken without checking into the hospital Drachman says a person on Proleukin had to be admitted to the cancer ward and almost always the intensive care unit. With a half-life so short that it started disappearing almost as soon as the infusion was over the drug had to be given at high doses every few hours for days to be effective.

For many people that high dose induced shakes and chills as their bodies responded to the cytokine Drachman says. Many developed vascular leak syndrome: their blood vessels leaked fluid their bodies swelled their blood pressures dropped quickly and they became confused or lost consciousness altogether. Nearly 75% of patients treated with Proleukin eventually developed antibodies to the drug raising fears that the antibodies would decrease efficacy. Many people couldn’t tolerate the treatment.

For every person seemingly cured Drachman says there were as many who died of their cancers.

But Drachman kept thinking about those 15% of people who went into remission. He and others wondered how many more people IL-2 could successfully treat if researchers could figure out how to engineer out the toxicity. It would be years before technology would catch up—before biology computing and protein chemistry were advanced enough to build a better IL-2.

These new IL-2s have been attracting the drug industry’s attention and companies have inked a flurry of six- and seven-figure deals over the past few years to develop the molecules for the clinic. Many of these molecules aim to rev up the immune system’s cancer response. Others aim to calm the overactive response at the root of autoimmune diseases. But none of these tweaks is a sure shot. A few clinical trials of IL-2 drug candidates have failed or been canceled.

The big deal around IL-2



The IL-2 drug candidates under investigation are new proteins that don’t exist in nature. Some are molecules that resemble IL-2 but have amino acid changes that strengthen some actions and weaken others. Others are IL-2s with antibodies and other chemical compounds attached that thwart some immune interactions and facilitate others.

All are trying to solve therapeutic IL-2’s fundamental problems—a short half-life that requires toxic dosing levels nonspecific binding that stalls efficacy and causes side effects and a tendency to spur the production of antibodies that could affect the efficacy of the drug or native IL-2.

Some scientists say the clinical trials are as much a test of the technologies that have gone into these engineered IL-2s as they are of the candidates’ abilities to successfully treat cancer or autoimmunity.

Traditional IL-2 works says Giovanni Abbadessa an oncologist who leads early clinical development of cancer immunotherapies at Sanofi which paid $2.5 billion for Synthorx a biotechnology firm developing an engineered IL-2. But the cytokine could work better he says. The question is: Which of the many biochemical tweaks or chemical additions will overcome IL-2’s limitations—without creating new ones?

“I think it’s really fascinating to see how different companies have taken different technological strategies and approaches to find different ways to do the same thing” Abbadessa says. “And of course I’m afraid only clinical trials—larger clinical trials—will tell us which one is the better way.”

One molecule two cell fates

About 45 years ago while studying immune cells called T cells researchers working with Robert Gallo at the US National Cancer Institute discovered a molecule that made T cells grow and divide. It was originally called T-cell growth factor and was eventually renamed IL-2.

A few years later while trying to understand how IL-2 stimulates T cells to multiply a team at the National Cancer Institute that included Warren Leonard as well as a team led by eventual Nobel Prize winner Tasuku Honjo discovered a molecule on the surface of T cells to which IL-2 binds.

But when researchers tried to re-create the effect of that binding they couldn’t. IL-2 bound to that molecule (eventually called α) wasn’t enough to get T cells to multiply. It would take years and dozens of scientists to figure out that IL-2 stimulates immune cells in a complicated way using a receptor that can have two prongs β and γ or three α β and γ. It was eye opening that IL-2 uses a multiprong receptor Leonard says but it was even more revelatory when researchers later discovered that the way IL-2 attaches to the receptor is the source of its therapeutic potential.

“It was always in the back of our minds that this could be something of down-the-road therapeutic utility” Leonard says of understanding how IL-2 works. “But at least at the time we were driven by more basic-science considerations.”

IL-2 stimulates many kinds of immune cells including T cells and natural killer (NK) cells says Jamie Spangler a bioengineer at Johns Hopkins University who is developing antibody-coupled IL-2s as possible therapies. T cells can take on special tasks including becoming effectors which drive the immune response or regulatory cells restraining the immune response. Natural IL-2 stimulates both effector and regulatory T cells to multiply providing an army that allows the immune system to do its job but with checks and balances.

Indeed providing checks and balances seems to be IL-2’s most fundamental task Spangler says. During the years of unraveling how the cytokine works came a surprising finding: mice missing the IL-2 gene can still mount an immune response; IL-2 it appears has backups that can take the cytokine’s place. But Spangler says these mice have serious autoimmune problems.

It turns out that IL-2 binds very tightly to the α piece of the receptor which is primarily found on the regulatory T cells which dampen the immune response. And IL-2 binds less tightly to the β and γ pieces which are found on both effector and regulatory T cells. So binding to all three parts of the receptor allows IL-2 to stimulate cells that reduce the immune response. Binding to only β and γ allows IL-2 to ramp up the response.

In those mice that can’t make IL-2 other cytokines spur the multiplying of effector cells and the other immune cells which fight infection or cancer. But those same experiments suggest that IL-2 is critical in keeping the immune response in check.

Up until maybe 10–15 years ago we didn’t have the tools and the wherewithal to actually hone the activities of IL-2 in a targeted way. Jamie Spangler bioengineer Johns Hopkins University

What this means for IL-2 as a therapy is that building an IL-2-like compound that stimulates mainly effector cells to grow could spur a potent anticancer immune response Spangler says. And building an artificial IL-2 to preferentially stimulate regulatory cells could create something that mainly fights autoimmunity.

“It’s a fascinating molecule” she says of IL-2 “because it’s sort of got this two-faced function.”

But only in the past few years has the technology developed to allow scientists to take advantage of IL-2’s two faces Spangler says. “Up until maybe 10–15 years ago we didn’t have the tools and the wherewithal to actually hone the activities of IL-2 in a targeted way” she says. “I think that’s really what’s been a part of this whole renaissance.”

Bulking up a skinny cytokine

Most of the industry effort to modify IL-2 focuses on developing it for cancer immunotherapy says Nikolaos Sgourakis a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who studies the structure of cytokines. The scientists building IL-2 as a cancer agent are trying to make something that won’t bind to the α piece of the receptor or are trying to boost IL-2’s interaction with the β and γ pieces.

But in addition to building something that is specific to effector T cells and other cancer-killing immune cells these scientists have to build something that is long lasting has few side effects and doesn’t inadvertently prompt the antibody-making arm of the immune system to attack it.

Among the scientists working on ways to prevent IL-2 from binding to the α part of the receptor is Spangler. Her lab is developing therapeutic IL-2s that are attached to antibodies. One of these constructs blocks the ability of IL-2 to connect with the α part of the receptor keeping IL-2 from preferentially stimulating regulatory T cells to multiply and potentially spurring cancer-killing effector cells to multiply instead.

For several years Roche has likewise sought to turn IL-2 into a therapeutic that can’t bind to the α part of the IL-2 receptor. The company is doing this through muteins—versions of the IL-2 protein with altered or mutated amino acid sequences that change how the molecule interacts with its receptor. Roche calls its IL-2 mutein IL-2v for IL-2 variant.

Pablo Umaña who leads cancer immu­notherapy projects at Roche says the firm’s scientists also tried coupling IL-2v to antibodies that attach to cancer cells that have small immune beacons called tumor antigens on their surfaces. The idea he says was to keep the company’s IL-2 near the tumor so IL-2 could stimulate effector T cells.

The researchers ran into problems. One of their IL-2-antibody constructs became immunogenic—in trials people given the drug developed antibodies against it. Another was well tolerated but didn’t have the cancer-killing effect the company was looking for. The trials were stopped.

IL-2 has these funny geometries. It bends and twists in funny ways. Carl Walkey senior vice president of corporate development Neoleukin Therapeutics

Now Umaña says Roche is working on an IL-2-antibody construct that attaches to two points on the same T cell: the β and γ parts of the IL-2 receptor as one point and PD-1 an immune-regulating protein that many cancer immunotherapies attempt to override to make T cells more effective at killing as the other. Umaña hopes the dual-action molecule now in Phase 1 trials will strengthen IL-2’s ability to stimulate effector cells. The idea is that the antibody’s binding to PD-1 will create a strong interaction that helps solidify the weaker IL-2 interaction with its receptor on effector cells urging those cells to divide.

“We call this our third-generation IL-2 variant” he says.

Companies are also trying ways to get IL-2 to stick around longer in the bloodstream so they can reduce the high doses that lead to toxicity and side effects. One strategy is to pegylate the molecule. Attaching polyethylene glycol (PEG) to specific points in the amino acid chain of IL-2 makes the construct bigger lengthening its half-life says Willem Overwijk vice president of oncology research at Nektar Therapeutics.

Nektar’s lead IL-2 candidate bempeg­aldesleukin or bempeg features six strands of PEG attached to lysines on aldesleukin the active ingredient in Proleukin.

Overwijk says the therapy is injectable and doesn’t become active until some of the PEG chains fall off freeing up the part of the protein that binds preferentially to the β and γ pieces on cancer-killing effector T cells and NK cells. Overwijk says people with tumors who have been treated with bempeg have many effector T cells around their tumors and few regulatory cells.

And unlike with Proleukin people treated with bempeg are not likely to require hospitalization.

“That’s a huge difference for the patient. They can go home basically right after; they don’t have to stay in the hospital” Overwijk says. “It’s a totally different drug now.”

Bempeg is in testing as a stand-alone therapy and as a combination with other cancer immunotherapies. In general the trials have been small and Nektar has had to grapple with investors concerned about trial results as well as manufacturing issues that may have affected some early results. Nektar reports that in Phase 2 trials of bempeg combined with Opdivo a checkpoint inhibitor from Bristol Myers Squibb about one-third of the people in its 38-person cohort saw all their cancerous lesions disappear after treatment. Many of the trial participants lived 30 months after treatment started before their cancers started progressing again.

Unearthing unearthly IL-2s

Many researchers trying to bring modified IL-2s to the cancer clinic use aldesleukin which only slightly varies from natural IL-2 as a starting point for mutations or they couple natural IL-2 to another molecule.

But several companies are exploring molecules that act like IL-2 but are completely artificial. Neoleukin’s lead compound does what IL-2 is supposed to do to stimulate effector T cells but it’s smaller and more compact Drachman says.

NL-201 Neoleukin’s IL-2-mimicking compound came out of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington. Carl Walkey an executive at Neoleukin who was previously at the institute says the team used computational biology to envision what an ideal IL-2 would look like as a cancer treatment. Researchers sorted through an astronomical combination of amino acid sequences to understand how altering amino acids in the IL-2 molecule might affect its structure and function Walkey says.

They then made versions of the best candidates and chose NL-201 for its activity. The molecule barely looks like natural IL-2 yet it binds to the β and γ parts of the IL-2 receptor with enough affinity to potentially stimulate effector T cells to divide and kill.

“IL-2 has these funny geometries. It bends and twists in funny ways” because it has so many different jobs across many cell types Walkey says. NL-201 “is much more ideal. It’s straighter. It’s more compact.”

NL-201 is also stabler than the native cytokine he says; it has a rich hydrophobic center and a hydrophilic exterior that makes it soluble. It’s an “idealized protein structure” Walkey says.

The US Food and Drug Administration seems to be moving carefully with what Walkey says is the first completely engineered made-from-scratch protein to approach the clinic. In January FDA officials asked Neoleukin to make some changes to its clinical trial protocols to better measure dosages. Drachman says he hopes to be in trials sometime this year.

For Sanofi IL-2 immunotherapy dreams rest on the unnatural amino acid N 6 -[(2-azidoethoxy)carbonyl]-l-lysine or azidolysine. The novel amino acid was developed by Synthorx cofounder Floyd Romesberg and engineered into an IL-2 candidate called THOR-707. Sanofi now owns Synthorx and THOR-707. This unnatural lysine has a PEG attached to it that blocks the molecule from interacting with the α part of the IL-2 receptor. THOR-707 is in early trials in people with a wide range of tumors.

“I see it as a cleaner approach to try and have a selective drug” Abbadessa says comparing it with other modes of engineering IL-2. “We hope that it will work.”

Then there’s Bright Peak Therapeutics which has taken protein building completely out of cells. Rather than coaxing bacterial or animal cells to spit out modified IL-2s which is the norm Bright Peak’s IL-2-like molecule is made by chemically stitching together small peptides.

Targeting IL-2 Several companies are trying to engineer the interleukin-2 (IL-2) protein to steer its activity toward T cells that kill cancer or T cells that block autoimmune responses. Here are some examples. ▸ Technology: IL-2 with mutations ▸ Goal: Change amino acids to strengthen or weaken interactions between IL-2 and various combinations of its receptors ▸ Companies: Pandion Therapeutics Roche

▸ Technology: IL-2 with nonnatural amino acids ▸ Goal: Strengthen or weaken interactions between IL-2 and various combinations of its receptors; provide anchors to add molecules to influence immune response ▸ Companies: Synthorx Bright Peak Therapeutics

▸ Technology: IL-2 or IL-2 mutants coupled to antibodies ▸ Goal: Improve IL-2’s half-life and steer immune response ▸ Companies: Pandion Therapeutics Roche

▸ Technology: IL-2 or IL-2 mutants bound to polyethylene glycol (PEG) ▸ Goal: Improve IL-2’s half-life by making the molecule inactive until PEG chains fall off ▸ Company: Nektar Therapeutics

▸ Technology: IL-2 mimics ▸ Goal: Re-create IL-2’s function but without half-life and toxicity issues ▸ Company: Neoleukin Therapeutics

Sources: Companies. Note: This list is not exhaustive.

Taking the protein-assembly process out of cells allows the company’s scientists to better understand the growing amino acid chain as it’s assembling and folding says CEO Sef Kurstjens. Company scientists can more easily incorporate things like noncanonical amino acids.

Vijaya Pattabiraman Bright Peak’s cofounder and an organic chemist says the company’s chemists can stitch together a peptide and modify an amino acid on that peptide to improve its half-life. Researchers can build the next section of the protein and if needed modify it.

The scientists can then join these pieces with all the different elements they want to build their perfect molecule and once it’s folded the scientists can add molecules like PEG if that’s what their design calls for. This process doesn’t require microbes or cells that have to determine how to add an artificial amino acid.

“It can be anything that chemists and biologists can think about and dream of” Pattabiraman says of a molecule built using Bright Peak’s technology. “There’s no other way you can really introduce multiple noncanonical amino acids within the protein and get the biology that we want.”

Steering IL-2 toward autoimmunity

For all of IL-2’s potential as a cancer therapeutic Hopkins’s Spangler says we shouldn’t forget its potential as a strong suppressor of the immune response. Because IL-2 binds so strongly to the α part of the receptor low doses can trigger the multiplication of regulatory T cells which dampen the immune response making the cytokine an enticing drug candidate for autoimmune disorders. She is developing an antibody-coupled IL-2 to skew toward activating regulatory T cells.

But modulating IL-2 to activating regulatory T cells is a more nuanced task than treating cancer Penn’s Sgourakis says. T cells aren’t the only cells that express the α part of the IL-2 receptor. Any effort to boost the activity of regulatory T cells could also stimulate nontarget cells. And he says effector cells can start producing that α segment scooping up a therapeutic IL-2 meant to tamp down the immune system.

As IL-2 and its receptor move in space he says there are fleeting conformations—shapes that last just an instant but could mediate some of the most important interactions IL-2 might have with a molecule that affects the immune response. Using nuclear magnetic resonance Sgourakis’s team is trying to capture the fleeting moments to design mutants to mimic those interactions including ones that could lead to IL-2-based autoimmune therapies.

“You really have a much more narrow set of conformations or of IL-2 forms that could be potentially useful for an autoimmune disease treatment” he says. “Trying to make an IL-2 that targets cancer immunotherapies is like hitting a free throw. Trying to make a molecule that targets autoimmunity or dampens a certain set of immunity is like trying to hit a half-court shot.”

Still a few companies are trying. This includes Amgen which is developing its own IL-2 products and Merck & Co. which in February announced it is buying Pandion Therapeutics for $1.85 billion. Pandion’s pipeline includes two IL-2-based molecules plus the technology to deliver those molecules and others to specific tissues.

Pandion cofounder Jo Viney says turning therapeutic IL-2 toward autoimmunity should require lower doses than used in cancer treatment and should thus lower the risk of side effects. But using existing IL-2 is still daunting she says. While a person with cancer would take IL-2 therapy for about a week autoimmune diseases are chronic and IL-2 might have to be given over long periods. IL-2 could activate other immune cells which could counteract the autoimmune effort. And with a short half-life IL-2 would be an almost daily treatment she says.

But on the plus side the use of IL-2 therapies for autoimmunity could unleash a more comprehensive shutdown signal on an overreacting immune system she says; in contrast current autoimmune therapies tend to be molecules and antibodies that target only one component of an autoimmune response.

Pandion and Amgen are using similar technology to build autoimmune-specific IL-2: coupling IL-2 muteins to antibody fragments that extend IL-2’s circulation time.

Making Pandion’s candidate PT101 involved testing many amino acid mutations in the native IL-2 protein Viney says. The firm’s scientists found that acidifying a critical asparagine destabilized IL-2’s binding to the β piece of the receptor. Adding four other amino acids to the IL-2 mutein created a molecule that would preferentially bind to the α piece of the IL-2 receptor favoring the growth of regulatory T cells.

Viney says that because Pandion’s IL-2 is coupled to the antibody fragment the therapy could be given to people every few weeks instead of every day. In a small Phase 1 trial people who received PT101 produced many more regulatory T cells than people who were untreated. The experimental biologic seemed to produce few side effects and no antidrug antibodies. By the end of 2021 Viney says PT101 should be in trials for ulcerative colitis and lupus.

Amgen’s lead IL-2 construct efavaleukin alfa is in testing for lupus and graft-versus-host disease. The company ended a trial of the drug candidate—a fusion of a mutein IL-2 and an antibody—as a “business decision” according to ClinicalTrials.gov. Nektar is also exploring pegylated IL-2 as an autoimmune therapy.

While people wait to see which if any of these novel IL-2s will become the next generation of IL-2 immunotherapy Neoleukin’s Drachman says Proleukin is still in occasional use as a late-stage therapy for people who have not responded to other treatments. He says he recently spoke to a man with melanoma whose doctors pulled him off Proleukin after his heart stopped during treatment. He went on to receive checkpoint inhibitors immunotherapies that block some of the regulatory functions of the immune system and has survived for several years.

He is one of the lucky ones. Even with checkpoint inhibitors Drachman says fewer than half of people with melanoma go into stable remission. Melanoma is a tough cancer to treat. It’s resistant to many drugs Drachman says but not IL-2. This is why developing a safer version is so important he says.

Sgourakis and others believe that the technologies in play in the effort to create a better IL-2 may also lead to other more tolerable and potent cytokines and immune modulators to treat diseases beyond cancer and autoimmunity. What structural and computational biology reveal could guide scientists to molecules that affect a host of immune functions.",,,,,,

""This is obviously a book of fiction but I think with anything people crave authenticity"" Brown 29 told PEOPLE about her new novel. ""And so even though these aren't real people they are based off and inspired by my own feeling situations thoughts questions about love and life and working through why we are the way that we are. That is all really based in my my own experiences.""



And Brown has had a whole lot of experience to draw from.

The reality TV star first came on the scene when she represented Alabama in the 2018 Miss USA pageant and was later cast on Colton Underwood's season of ABC's The Bachelor. She earned the title on The Bachelorette in 2019 and won ABC'S Dancing with the Stars that same year.

Since then she's competed on FOX’s Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test ending the show as one of two women who completed the course. Her 2021 memoir God Bless This Mess was a New York Times bestseller and in 2022 she launched a podcast with SiriusXM Better Tomorrow with Hannah Brown.

Her first novel Mistakes We Never Made is out May 7 from Forever an imprint of Hachette Books. It has everything readers could want for beachside reading: love friendship a burrito flying toward someone's head and the kind of drama that we all love to watch from afar.

Brown calls the book ""quick and nice and and an enjoyable read to have on your summer vacations by the pool at the beach.""

Emma Townsend has been just missing Finn Hughes for basically their whole lives: They almost dated in high school almost hooked up after college and now almost can't be in the same room together. Except now they have to spend a weekend in Vegas pretending not to hate each other while one of their mutuals gets married. Emma's killing it until the bride goes missing and she and Finn have to save the day — without losing their cool.

""Emma is not fully me but she is a part of me"" Brown explains noting that the book has a lot of ""Easter eggs"" that longtime followers will recognize from her own background. ""There's a core group of best friends in this book and that's really where it all started for me. I think I think some of the best love stories in our life can be those that we have with our friends. And that's a real big foundation in this book that I hope that people really can see.""

Having one book under her belt already Brown says putting out a novel has been a different kind of challenge. ""When I wrote my first book God Bless This Mess that was really therapeutic but also really emotional and I felt super vulnerable like sharing everything in my life and from my perspective but also just like some some hard things that I've gone through"" the author explains. ""Where with this one I didn't realize just how much planning it takes. To create a really beautiful cohesive funny fast-paced love story actually is a really slow process that takes a lot of management.""

She credits her co-author Emily Larrabbee for being able to ""encourage me and help me really get everything all my thoughts all my hopes for these characters in this story and how I want it to really show up on the page in a in a really attainable enjoyable way for the reader.""

And there's a second book coming after this one so when readers fall as deeply in love with Emma and her friends as the author did they won't have to leave them behind forever. ""I've become really close to Emma and her life even if it is a fictional life"" she confesses.

Brown who is engaged to Adam Woolard says Mistakes We Never Made has eaten up a lot of her time lately but that she's excited to dive into wedding planning once the book is out in the world.

""I'm really looking forward to in the next month or so going to be all in wedding-planning mode like I'm so excited for that"" she gushes. ""But for now I'm really excited for people to get their hands on this book and hopefully really enjoy it while they're their toes are in the sand by some type of water.

(WBAY) - A jury found a Brown County man not guilty of felony child sexual assault.

Last week Friday Edward Verboomen was found not guilty of three counts: first-degree child sexual assault second-degree sexual assault of a child and false imprisonment.

Verboomen was initially charged in August of 2023 and after roughly three days of trial a jury found him not guilty on all charges.

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yd2FyZC5jb20vbmV3cy82MDk1MjYvYnJvd24tdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1hbnRpc2VtaXRpc20tcHJvdGVzdHMtZW5jYW1wbWVudC_SAVhodHRwczovL2ZvcndhcmQuY29tL25ld3MvNjA5NTI2L2Jyb3duLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktYW50aXNlbWl0aXNtLXByb3Rlc3RzLWVuY2FtcG1lbnQvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Everyone gets to be uncomfortable’: How Jewish students at Brown kept antisemitism at bay,"By Mira Fox May 3 2024

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do brown eggs cost more than white eggs? Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”"

Traffic inside Las Vegas casinos is picking up again but it’s not all driven by young travelers with pent-up demand.

Casino operators say customers 65 and over have started to return spurred by the growing availability of COVID-19 vaccines across the country.

“As more of the older end of the customer spectrum receives vaccines and becomes more comfortable with leaving their houses … that for sure means they’ll start to step out and go back to their favorite casinos again” said gaming consultant Josh Swissman of The Strategy Organization.

‘Starting to trickle back in’

Bob Bransdon a 68-year-old Las Vegas local said he used to visit casinos with his wife about once a week. Then the shutdowns came.

The two spent months away from casinos while they were closed and continued to avoid the properties after their June reopenings out of caution. They weren’t alone: The pandemic had led to a sharp decline in casino visitation from the 65-plus age group which is more susceptible to severe illness tied to COVID-19.

That could be turning around. Bransdon who started visiting casinos again in August said he has noticed an uptick in the 65-and-older crowd especially in the afternoons. He said the numbers aren’t what they were before the pandemic but there is “no shortage of people there.”

Some casino operators have noticed the uptick too. Several executives discussed the trend in recent weeks during the latest round of casino companies’ earnings calls.

“We’re beginning to see that part of the database that 65 and older if you will database starting to trickle back in” Golden Entertainment Chairman and CEO Blake Sartini said during a March 11 call. “We see that as a great catalyst going forward.”

The heads of other Las Vegas casino operators — including Red Rock Resorts Inc. Boyd Gaming Corp. and Penn National Gaming Inc. — also have said they have started to notice that this age group is rebounding.

“I think up until very recently that the 65-year-plus demographic has been fairly shy about coming back to the facility” Frank Fertitta III CEO of Red Rock Resorts said during a February call with investors. “If the vaccine has continued ramp-up and rollout we are cautiously optimistic that we’re starting to see the 65-plus demographic slowly return back to our facility.”

One of the major driving forces behind this demographic’s return has been the rollout of vaccinations. As of Friday 22.4 percent of American adults had been fully vaccinated according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of those vaccinations have gone toward those in older age groups with 53.5 percent of Americans 65 and older fully vaccinated.

Jo Ann Woodward 72 has not yet received a vaccine but that hasn’t stopped the Phoenix resident from making her regular Las Vegas trips.

Woodward has made two solo trips to Las Vegas during the pandemic and plans to return in April. By that time she hopes to be vaccinated — she’s waiting to receive a Johnson & Johnson vaccine so she can have a “one and done” shot — and she expects more friends will be ready to join her once they’ve all had shots in arms.

“They think that now that they’ve had the vaccine they’re immune (from the virus) and they can go wherever they want” she said. “I probably will have more people that want to go with me when I’m vaccinated.”

More confidence to venture outside the home paired with pent-up demand is good news for casinos according to Stifel analyst Steve Wieczynski.

“We expect a significant amount of pent-up demand from the (55 and older) demographic as vaccinations kick in and the country slowly goes back to normal” he said in a Feb. 25 note.

Spokespeople for the two of the six largest casino operators in Las Vegas — Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp. — did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for Boyd MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment Inc. declined to comment and a Red Rock spokesman referred to comments made by executives during the latest earnings calls.

A lucrative customer

The fact that any age group is coming back to Las Vegas is “huge” said gaming consultant Debi Nutton but the 65-plus demographic can be especially lucrative.

“Your kids are off to college; you’ve established yourself in your career” she said of the age group. “They have more discretionary income.”

According to a 2019 report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority baby boomers spent more than millennials in nearly every category including food and drink transportation shopping and sightseeing. They also spent far more on gambling budgeting an average of $838.20 per trip compared with millennials’ $350.47.

“You’re talking about a majority of the (casinos’) customer base” said Clyde Barrow a gaming industry expert and professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. “Certainly for the core (gambling customer) the table games and the slot machines. Maybe not so much for the clubs and the concerts the pool parties and those things.”

Those spending habits should carry forward in 2021. Management at Red Rock Resorts said they believe older customers have plenty of discretionary spending after months of lockdowns and limited entertainment options.

“They seem to be in pretty good shape from a financial standpoint because they just haven’t been spending their money. There’s a lot of disposable income there” said Lorenzo Fertitta vice chairman of Red Rock’s board during the company’s earnings call. “They’re anxious to come back.”

This crowd also could help solve one of the greatest challenges Las Vegas resorts have faced since the onset of the pandemic: filling rooms midweek.

Midweek occupancy rates aren’t expected to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon — conventions probably will need to make a full comeback before that can happen — but UNLV Assistant Professor of Hospitality Amanda Belarmino said as far as midweek leisure travel goes older customers lead the pack.

Their return is “highly significant for Las Vegas” she said. “They’re retired. They have that flexibility to travel midweek.”

Convergence of young and old

Virginia Valentine president of the Nevada Resort Association said the state’s resorts are “excited” to welcome back more guests as vaccines roll out and people feel more comfortable traveling.

“Those guests 65 years and older have had earlier access to the vaccine and we would anticipate their return as they feel more comfortable venturing out and resuming activities they enjoy” she said. “Our members value this customer segment and we’re happy to have them back.”

Boyd Gaming which has started to see its older core customers return expects the trend to broaden in the second and third quarters according to a March 11 note from J.P. Morgan based on conversations with Boyd CEO Keith Smith and CFO Josh Hirsberg.

The operators’ challenge will be figuring out how to attract older gamblers while also keeping their newer younger gamblers interested in returning. It’ll be easier said than done especially as other entertainment options such as clubs and shows reopen and vie for the attention of younger crowds.

“Most operators believe that as events movie theaters restaurants open up that younger customer could be fleeting” Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon said.

But online offerings could help gaming companies earn the loyalty of these newer younger customers even as other entertainment venues open their doors Beynon said.

“Given the convergence of land and digital — with online and land-based (betting) — these customers may appreciate that a little bit more” he said. “They’ll spend money online betting on a sports game but then maybe go to the land-based property that’s tied in with that asset.”

An image of “Ann-Margret” from “Viva Las Vegas” and a scooter from “Vegas! The Show” are shown at the David Saxe Production offices in Las Vegas. (David Saxe)

At some point in the conversation Ann-Margret casually drops the initials. “E.P.”

As in “We were friends for a long time E.P. and I. We met on the movie we had several things in common including a love for Las Vegas. We dated and we just had a great time together.”

E.P. would be Elvis Presley and the movie was “Viva Las Vegas” the 1964 classic that solidified the city’s image as place to set yer soul on fire. The scene where the duo blaze through “C’mon Everybody” with the “University of Nevada” lettering in the background was set at what is today UNLV’s Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art.

It is appropriate then that Ann-Margret heads up the list of inductees for the upcoming 17th Annual UNLV College of Fine Arts Hall of Fame event set for April 13 at the university’s outdoor Valerie Pida Plaza. The event was rescheduled from last year because of pandemic public-gathering restrictions.

Ann-Margret joins the writer and cultural critic Dave Hickey Harrah’s headlining magician Mac King and Luxor headlining comedian Carrot Top (legal name Scott Thompson) as fellow inductees. Trumpet great and singer Brian Newman will receive the inaugural Las Vegas Newcomer Award. Newman has made an impact in town as bandleader and performer for Lady Gaga and as the front man for the “After Dark” late-night hang at NoMad Restaurant.

Also being recognized with the Koep Dean’s Medal are Justin Favela UNLV alumnus and mixed media and installation artist; and Candy Schneider vice president of education and outreach for The Smith Center for the Performing Arts. Stage director and educator Giovanna Sardelli (daughter of esteemed Vegas singer Nelson Sardelli) and mixed-media artist Sush Machida will be recognized as Alumni of the Year.

The Hall of Fame was founded in 2003 to honor past and present residents of Southern Nevada who have made a significant impact in the areas of visual arts performing arts and/or architecture. Past inductees include Tony Curtis Phyllis McGuire Robert Goulet The Killers Wayne Newton Liberace Clint Holmes Penn & Teller Lance Burton and Siegfried & Roy.

Ann-Margret is no question a deserving member of that list of dignitaries especially at UNLV. “Viva Las Vegas” was directed by UNLV College of Fine Arts Hall of Fame inaugural inductee and film-studies guest speaker George Sidney. Ann-Margret was cast in the film about four years after opening in Las Vegas as a performer at the since-imploded Dunes.

“I started in 1960. I was a toddler very young” she said with a laugh. “I had been at Northwestern for about a year and three gentlemen and I created a band called the Suttletones and were hired by the Dunes lounge. We were on at like 5 in the afternoon until 8 o’clock at night. Nobody came to see us perform. They were in there to drink and talk.”

Tony Bennett and Al Hirt with whom Ann-Margret would later record were headlining the showroom at the time.

Ann-Margret wend on to forge a successful stage career in Vegas with her Dunes shows leading to a stint opening for George Burns at the Sahara. She headlined Las Vegas Hilton and Caesars Palace along with the Dunes. She has also been nominated for two Oscars (for 1971’s “Carnal Knowledge” and 1975’s “Tommy”) along with five Golden Globe awards two Grammys and an Emmy.

The headliner also developed a fondness for motorcycles starting with the Honda 150 she cruised in “Viva Las Vegas.” That scene was the inspiration for a number in “Vegas! The Show” at Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood the Honda swapped out for a Vespa.

Ann-Margret had graduated to a Harley-Davidson and rode one to the the opening of the Harley-Davidson Cafe on the Strip in 1999. As she says “I love my motorcycles and the big noise they make.”

The entertainer has no real “feel” for today’s Las Vegas having spent many years away from the city.

“It has been so long I really don’t know what it’s like now” she said. “But I have very fond memories so many good friends there. I have good warm fabulous feelings about Las Vegas. Performing there helped me put three children through college.”

The classic film too is a fond memory as is “E.P.”

“What can I say?” Ann-Margret said. “Yes certainly admired and respected him. We were a lot alike and made a great movie together.”

When was the last time she saw “Viva Las Vegas?” Not recently.

“When it came out in 1964” Ann-Margret said with a laugh. “I never see my movies more than once. I like to keep it it that way in my memories.”

Pierluigi Paganini April 03 2021 April 03 2021

More clients of Capital One have been impacted in the 2019 data breach the US bank is notifying them of their SSNs exposure.

US bank Capital One notified a number of additional customers that their Social Security numbers were exposed in the data breach that took place in July 2019.

A hacker that was going online with the handle “erratic” breached the systems at Capital One and gained access to personal information from 106 million Capital One credit applications.

Law enforcement arrested the hacker Paige A. Thompson for the security breach.

Paige Thompson is a former Amazon Web Services software engineer who worked for a Capital One contractor from 2015 to 2016.

THOMPSON posted about the Capital One hack on GitHub she exploited a misconfigured web application firewall to get access to the data. On July 17 2019 Capital One was informed of the incident by a GitHub user who saw the post. On July 19 2019 that financial institution discovered the intrusion and informed the FBI.

Capital One immediately fixed the configuration issue exploited by the hacker.

Paige A. Thompson was charged with computer fraud and abuse in U.S. District Court in Seattle.

The security breach data breach took place on March 22nd and 23rd the hacker accessed information of customers who had applied for a credit card between 2005 and 2019.

“Based on our analysis to date this event affected approximately 100 million individuals in the United States and approximately 6 million in Canada.” states a press release published by Capital One. “Importantly no credit card account numbers or log-in credentials were compromised and over 99 percent of Social Securitynumbers were not compromised.”

“The largest category of information accessed was information on consumers and small businesses as of the time they applied for one of our credit card products from 2005 through early 2019.”

Exposed data includes names addresses zip codes/postal codes phone numbers email addresses dates of birth and self-reported income. Attackers also obtained portions of credit card customer data including:

Customer status data e.g. credit scores credit limits balances payment history contact information

Fragments of transaction data from a total of 23 days during 2016 2017 and 2018

The hacker accessed bank account numbers and Social Security numbers only for a limited number of customers:

About 140000 Social Security numbers of our credit card customers

About 80000 linked bank account numbers of our secured credit card customers

Now Capital One while analyzing data stolen during the 2019 security breach with the help of a third-party expert discovered that intruders gained access to some of its customers’ SSNs.

“Recently Capital One re-examined the files that were impacted by the 2019 data security incident using new and more advanced tools. As part of this analysis we determined that your Social Security number was among the data to which the unauthorized individual gained access.” reads the letter sent by the bank to the impacted customers.

Capital One estimated the overall economic impact of the data breach at $100-$150 million.

In 2020 Capital One was fined $80 million by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for having failed to protect data of its customers.

The Mavericks led after each quarter and trailed just once despite playing without Kristaps Porzingis who sat out for the fifth time on the back end of a back-to-back this season while recovering from his surgically repaired right knee.

Dallas did have coach Rick Carlisle back on the sidelines after he missed Friday's win at the New York Knicks. Carlisle had tested positive for COVID-19 but later tests revealed it to be a false positive. Carlisle had been vaccinated in January.

Bradley Beal participated in pre-game warmups but missed his fourth straight game for Washington with a right hip contusion. Beal leads the NBA with 31.3 points per game.

The heavy National Guard presence had begun to thin.

But on Friday not quite three months after the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol a car came careening midday onto the Capitol grounds slamming into two Capitol Police officers and leaving one of them dead and the other injured.

This time the source of the violence was not an angry pro-Trump mob but a lone driver armed with a knife who had recently told friends he had left his job and had “afflictions.” After crashing his car and menacing officers he was shot and killed.

“It is with a very very heavy heart that I announce one of our officers has succumbed to his injuries” Yogananda D. Pittman the acting Capitol Police chief said during a news conference near the scene. “This has been an extremely difficult time for U.S. Capitol Police after the events of Jan. 6 and now the events that have occurred here today.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8wMi9wb2xpdGljcy91cy1jYXBpdG9sLWluY2lkZW50L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAT9odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzA0LzAyL3BvbGl0aWNzL3VzLWNhcGl0b2wtaW5jaWRlbnQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capitol Police officer killed another injured after suspect rams car into police barrier outside building,"CNN —

One US Capitol Police officer has died and another is injured after a suspect rammed a vehicle into a police barricade outside the Capitol building Friday afternoon the department’s acting chief Yogananda Pittman told reporters during a press briefing roughly two hours after initial reports of the attack first surfaced.

The officer was identified by Pittman later Friday as Officer William “Billy” Evans an 18-year veteran of the force and a member of its “First Responders Unit.”

“It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the passing of Officer William ‘Billy’ Evans this afternoon from injuries he sustained following an attack at the North Barricade by a lone assailant” she said in a statement not long after telling reporters the name of the officer would not be released until his family was notified.

During the press briefing Pittman said the suspect in the attack who brandished a knife after ramming his vehicle into a police barricade on Constitution Avenue and was subsequently shot by officers had also died.

Federal and local law enforcement sources told CNN that the suspect has been identified as Noah Green. One federal source told CNN he was 25 years old.

An investigation into the attack is ongoing Pittman said but the immediate danger appears to have subsided. USCP lifted an hours-long lockdown of the Capitol Friday afternoon after law enforcement determined the “external security threat” had been cleared.

But while the suspect was quickly neutralized the deadly incident undoubtedly serves as a stark reminder of the violent insurrection that occurred less than three months ago and the persistent security concerns that have been top of mind for many on Capitol Hill in the time since despite a recent ramping down of some additional protective measures.

Swift response

Police and National Guardsmen responded swiftly as the situation unfolded Friday immediately moving to secure the Capitol as initial reports of violence began to emerge.

“Just after 1 p.m. a man in a blue sedan rammed his vehicle into the North Barricade at the US Capitol striking 2 USCP officers” US Capitol Police said in a statement. “The Department immediately locked down the Capitol Campus. The man exited the vehicle with a knife and ran toward our officers. At least one officer drew their weapon and shot the suspect.”

That sequence of events aligns with what a senior congressional aide and a US Capitol Police source told CNN earlier Friday. At the time the sources said that after the driver of the vehicle rammed his car into a barricade on Constitution Avenue the driver exited the vehicle brandishing a knife. Police responded shooting the suspect and taking him into custody.

A law enforcement official told CNN at least one of the officers was stabbed.

Pittman said Friday that the suspect Green was not known to USCP before Friday’s attack. A review of Green’s social media shows he posted in the weeks prior that he had lost his job and suffered medical ailments and said he believed the federal government was targeting him with “mind control.”

Less than two hours before he was shot and killed Green posted a number of Instagram stories on an account that appears to belong to him including links to ​other Instagram videos of Nation of Islam leader Minister Louis Farrakhan speaking.

“The U.S. Government is the #1 enemy of Black people!” a caption on one video read. In another post on the Instagram account Green wrote last week that he believed Farrakhan had saved him “after the terrible afflictions I have suffered presumably by the CIA and FBI government agencies of the United States of America.”

Heartbreak over yet another officer death

The death of Officer Evans has once again cast a dark cloud over Washington.

Only four USCP officers had been killed in the line of duty prior to this year according to its data but the department is now mourning the loss of one of its own for the second time in almost as many months.

The weight of losing yet another officer was evident in Pittman’s voice Friday as she informed reporters of Evans’ death though he was not identified until later in the day and again in a statement issued by the department that said members were “devastated” by the news.

That sentiment was echoed by President Joe Biden and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who offered their condolences to Evans’ family.

“Jill and I were heartbroken to learn of the violent attack at a security checkpoint on the U.S. Capitol grounds which killed Officer William Evans of the U.S. Capitol Police and left a fellow officer fighting for his life.” Biden said.

“We send our heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans’ family and everyone grieving his loss. We know what a difficult time this has been for the Capitol everyone who works there and those who protect it” he added.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Evans “a martyr for our democracy” adding his death was “tragic and heroic.”

The top Republican in the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Evans’ “name will go down in history for his selfless sacrifice.”

“Once again brave officers of the United States Capitol Police have been violently attacked while simply doing their job” McConnell added.

Pelosi ordered that the flags flown over the US Capitol be flown at half-staff in Evans’ honor her spokesman Drew Hammill said in a tweet Friday and Biden also ordered the White House flags to be lowered to half-staff.

‘Much to be determined about this attack’

Details about Friday’s incident remain scarce though police officials said it does not appear to be terrorism-related.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas underscored the lack of clarity surrounding the situation in his statement Friday saying that “there is still much to be determined about this attack” and committed his department’s full support to the US Capitol Police and to DC Mayor Muriel Bowser as the investigation is carried out.

Biden said Friday that he has “been receiving ongoing briefings from my Homeland Security Advisor and will be getting further updates as the investigation proceeds.”

It remains to be seen how Friday’s attack might impact longer-term plans regarding security at the Capitol a topic that has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks as many lawmakers and staff hoped to reclaim some sense of normalcy despite ongoing congressional investigations into the failures around the January 6 attack.

Barbed wire fencing that surrounded the Capitol complex for months after pro-Trump rioters stormed the building has since come down and thousands of the National Guard troops who were deployed in response to the insurrection have since returned home though thousands still remain in Washington and were seen responding to Friday’s attack.

The National Guard later confirmed Friday it had been deployed to the Capitol.

“The DC National Guard deployed a Immediate Response Force (IRF) composed of National Guard soldiers and airmen to the Capitol complex this afternoon to support the U.S. Capitol Police. Due to operational security we cannot discuss further details regarding the IRF” the National Guard said in a tweet.

“No National Guard members were injured in the incident at the Capitol. Currently approximately 2300 National Guard members are in DC supporting local state and federal authorities in DC” it added.

""When I got hurt and was laying on the floor in Washington honestly I thought I was done"" Embiid said after scoring 24 points in a 122-113 victory over the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday night in his first game back from a bone bruise in that left knee. ""I thought my season was done. The pain how bad it was hurting I just knew that it was something worse than we saw after.

""I was just crying and asking myself 'Why me? Why does it always happen to me? When everything seems to be going well with the team and myself something always has to happen.'""

It turned out however to be not quite as bad as Embiid feared. Rather than being out for the season he instead wound up missing 10 games over the past three weeks. In his absence Philadelphia went 7-3 and with Saturday's win the Sixers moved back into a tie with the Brooklyn Nets for the best record in the Eastern Conference with six weeks to go.

Embiid though was clearly still trying to knock some of the rust off of his game. While his final line was impressive -- those 24 points came with eight rebounds two assists and three blocks as well as finishing the game a plus-20 in 28 minutes -- he had four turnovers and shot 6-for-14 from the field including missing all four of his 3-point attempts.

Afterward Embiid said he needs to get back in rhythm offensively and blamed part of his issues on the brace he's wearing on his left knee.

""Defensively it's easy. I've got to just be myself. Block shots and protect the paint not let anything get in there. But offensively I'm going to kind of blame the brace I was wearing. It just felt like I just didn't have the rhythm all game. It felt like I had an itch on my shot every single shot. It wasn't smooth. I had no rhythm. I hate the brace and that was part of it.

""I just have to get used to it play with it and hope it keeps getting better. But offensively I had way too many turnovers.""

He also said he knew what Minnesota's strategy would be Saturday night because Timberwolves coach Chris Finch worked under Raptors coach Nick Nurse for half the season until being hired to run the Timberwolves in February.

""They would double and triple every time I had it on the block"" Embiid said. ""It's fitting because the coach he comes from Toronto so I knew going into the game that was going to happen.

""I've just got to get in sync with my teammates ... but it's going to come with time.""

Embiid is in the midst of a career season and now he will have a chance to force himself back into the MVP race. He won't play in Sunday's game against the Memphis Grizzlies and said his conditioning is lagging behind after having to spend so much time on the sideline.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- The Archdiocese of Chicago broadcasted the Easter Mass in English from Holy Name Cathedral this weekend.

Mass will air on TV at abc7chicago.com and in the ABC 7 Chicago app.

The move comes after both the Archdiocese of Chicago and the Joliet Diocese announced they would suspend all public masses because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some Masses have since resumed but at a limited capacity.

New ""Be Safe. Places of Worship"" guidelines allow a maximum of 50 people per room or 25% of the room capacity at Chicago houses of worship as long as required social distancing can be maintained according to a release from Mayor Lori Lightfoot's office.

Houses of worship will also be required to provide sanitation stations frequently disinfect facilities and ensure people wear facial coverings according to the release.

The Chicago Department of Public Health recommends that the elderly or those with underlying health conditions continue to practice their faith from home.

""During this difficult time it is particularly important that the faithful have access to the grace and comfort of Holy Mass"" said Bishop Ron Hicks vicar general of the Chicago Archdiocese.

Hicks said the church does not want to keep people from praying in faith.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zb3dldGFubGl2ZS5jby56YS9waWMtb2YtdGhlLWRheS8yMDIxLTA0LTA0LWluLXBpY3R1cmVzLS1kaWFrb25pYS1jb3VuY2lsLW9mLWNodXJjaGVzLWJlYWNoZnJvbnQtZ29vZC1mcmlkYXktc2VydmljZS_SAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc293ZXRhbmxpdmUuY28uemEvYW1wL3BpYy1vZi10aGUtZGF5LzIwMjEtMDQtMDQtaW4tcGljdHVyZXMtLWRpYWtvbmlhLWNvdW5jaWwtb2YtY2h1cmNoZXMtYmVhY2hmcm9udC1nb29kLWZyaWRheS1zZXJ2aWNlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IN PICTURES | Diakonia Council of Churches' beachfront Good Friday service,Please click here to view our site optimised for your device.,,,,,,

Nash later said CarMax already is the overall largest buyer of used vehicles from consumers in the U.S. But it has competition. Online used-vehicle startups such as Carvana Co. and Vroom are stepping up efforts to purchase vehicles directly from consumers as are many large franchised dealership groups.

For CarMax the Edmunds acquisition will help accelerate its own efforts on that front. The deal is expected to close in June. CarMax didn't disclose the purchase price it is paying to buy the rest of Edmunds but it did say the cash-and-stock deal values Edmunds at $404 million.

After the closing Edmunds will be reported as an operating unit in CarMax's financial results. Edmunds had unaudited revenue of $140 million last year according to CarMax.

Vehicle acquisition remains a strategic focal point for CarMax and its competitors as used-vehicle inventory tightens amid high demand.

Nash acknowledged that overall used-vehicle supply in the U.S. has dipped of late but he said getting cars and trucks through the ""appraisal lane""— meaning the online instant-offer tool — helps alleviate strained supply in other channels.

""Our focus with the online [buying] is to continue to drive as much as we can of buying vehicles right from the consumers"" Nash said. ""And we see this as [having] the potential to really increase our self-sufficiency which we think is a huge competitive advantage.""

CarMax has had anywhere from a 35 to 50 percent rate of self-sufficiency in the last five years he said.

""I would expect this to take us to numbers that really are at historic highs if not kind of breaking the ceiling on self-sufficiency"" Nash said. ""So our goal is to continue to see how far we can push that number on the north side.""

The company struggled with sale-ready inventory levels in its fiscal fourth quarter which ended Feb. 28. Nash said the coronavirus pandemic and severe weather affected operations in the period.

He estimated that CarMax's stock of sale-ready vehicles was down by about 20 percent at the end of the quarter compared with the year-earlier period. Overall inventory levels however were up year over year Nash said.

""We have the capacity and now it's just a matter of getting the inventory back to our target [level]"" he said.

CarMax saw big improvements in vehicle sales for March Nash said crediting that in part to tax refund and stimulus payments to consumers.

""It's been a record month for us"" he said. ""We sold more than 100000 cars in the month of March for the first time in the company's history.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the state of Veracruz some communities celebrate Carnival from February to May during the end of the sugar-cane-cutting season. But this year because of the pandemic celebrations have been canceled to avoid the spread of the coronavirus. Still people have found a way to celebrate at home.

The town of Tuzamapan located in the center of Veracruz and Almolonga an Afro-Mexican community have celebrated Carnival for more than 100 years.

The main character of the Tuzamapan Carnival is the “Bonetero” named after a large hat made of paper and wood. Men wear the hat with a wooden mask that covers their identity and carry a large wooden machete as part of their costume.

In Almolonga people dress in colorful bull masks which are a sign of masculinity and also sin and they dance and celebrate in the streets.

In the community of Alto Tío Diego in Veracruz Carnival is celebrated before the beginning of Lent and traditionally includes large parades.

The inhabitants are mostly coffee and sugar cane farmers with some ranchers. Their ancestors were descendants of European immigrants who settled in the region in the 19th century. They adopted the Carnival tradition and costumes of the surrounding Afro-descendant towns. Popular mask shapes include donkeys bulls and goats and they are often hand-carved and passed down for generations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NydWlzZS9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tdW5zZWF0cy1jYXJuaXZhbC1hcy1jcnVpc2UtbGluZS13aXRoLXRoZS1sYXJnZXN0LWZsZWV00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean Unseats Carnival as Cruise Line With the Largest Fleet,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelpulse.com/news/cruise/royal-caribbean-unseats-carnival-as-cruise-line-with-the-largest-fleet on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NydWlzZS9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tdW5zZWF0cy1jYXJuaXZhbC1hcy1jcnVpc2UtbGluZS13aXRoLXRoZS1sYXJnZXN0LWZsZWV00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGUuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9zcHJpbmctZmxpbmctY2Fybml2YWwtdW5kZXJ3YXktYXQtd2VzdC10b3duLW1hbGwv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2F0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL3NwcmluZy1mbGluZy1jYXJuaXZhbC11bmRlcndheS1hdC13ZXN0LXRvd24tbWFsbC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Spring Fling’ carnival underway at West Town Mall,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wate.com/news/local-news/spring-fling-carnival-underway-at-west-town-mall/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGUuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9zcHJpbmctZmxpbmctY2Fybml2YWwtdW5kZXJ3YXktYXQtd2VzdC10b3duLW1hbGwv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2F0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL3NwcmluZy1mbGluZy1jYXJuaXZhbC11bmRlcndheS1hdC13ZXN0LXRvd24tbWFsbC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdmFubmFobm93LmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA0LzAzL2Vhc3Rlci1jYXJuaXZhbC1zZWVkLWNodXJjaC83MDc1NzM4MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Easter Carnival at The Seed Church,"Easter Carnival at The Seed Church

JAL is working with Common Pass Verifly and IATA Travel Pass across a variety of routes and dates as carriers worldwide try to get to grips with differing technologies and country requirements.

The airline is trialling the Common Pass platform on selected flights from Japan to Honolulu and Singapore which it says will “confirm the function of sending Covid-19 test results from Toho University Haneda Airport Terminal 3 Clinic (an approved Covid-19 testing facility by the State of Hawaii) to the Common Pass app”.

Secondly JAL is trialling the Verifly app on selected US routes with a view to implementing the platform on North America routes from this month.

And finally the carrier plans to trial the IATA Travel Pass on selected international flights during May. JAL said that the trial would have several aims including confirmation of the process of information verification at the airport counter.

The airline noted that Common Pass and the IATA Travel Pass “aim to become the industry standard for full implementation on a global scale” while Verifly “is in practical use in the US which allows the introduction of the platform on JAL international flights to/from the country”.

This week rival Japanese carrier ANA also announced a trial of the Common Pass platform.

JAL said that the purpose of the trials was to:

Introduce and expand worldwide the health credential platforms which can display information on a customer’s digital device including Covid-19 test results issued by medical institutions and other entry requirement information for each destination

Achieve a contactless and seamless check-in process with health credential apps

Expand applicable situations including clearing health quarantine processes with the usage of health credential platforms

The COVID-19 outbreak created a volatile U.S. third-party logistics market in 2020 which presented growth opportunities for 3PLs with strong carrier management e-commerce and airfreight forwarding capabilities while other 3PLs did not fare as well.

After a lackluster 2019 in which transportation activity declined year-over-year as import tariffs took hold the industry awoke to a pandemic nightmare in March 2020 with vast economic shutdowns. By May things began bouncing back as shutdowns were dialed back and the V-shaped recovery took hold. Even with local and regional economic “spits and spurts” inventories needed to be replenished and personal protective equipment drove strong airfreight demand. There was no time like the present for logistics expertise and 3PLs prevailed as an essential industry.

Overall strong domestic and international transportation demand has continued into 2021 further driving up domestic and international transportation rates. With inventories increasing and COVID-19 cases waning demand for 3PL services seems to be becoming more stable and manageable. As the nation gets closer to herd immunity in the COVID battle we should continue to see increasingly strong demand as more consumers leave quarantine and boost spending. In fact 2021 might be the true start of our generation’s roaring ’20s.

Armstrong

While many 3PLs still are providing us with 2020 financials Armstrong & Associates’ current estimates show U.S. 3PL market gross revenues grew 8.8% bringing the total market to $231.5 billion. Most of the growth came from international and domestic transportation management which responded to COVID-­related demands for PPE and to restock inventories upon economic reopenings. Overall 2020 was a better year for 3PLs than 2019 which registered the market’s first decline since 2009. But segment growth was uneven.

Total 3PL segment net revenues (gross revenues minus purchased transportation) grew 2.1% to $93.5 billion reflecting gross margin compression due to a volatile carrier sourcing market and transportation management 3PLs spending more to secure hard-to-find carrier capacity. The overall gross margin for all segments declined to 41% from 44%.

International Transportation Management

Leading all 3PL segments for revenue growth in 2020 was international transportation management (ITM) which consists of air and ocean freight forwarding customs brokerage and complementary value-added services. Airfreight revenues swelled in 2020 with the pandemic and extraordinary demand for PPE. With commercial passenger aircraft making up approximately 40% of total air cargo capacity the pandemic upended airfreight forwarding and rates surged albeit on lower overall volumes.

With the economic reopenings in May ocean freight demand came on strong as shippers worked on replenishing inventories. The ongoing results have been port congestion tight container drayage capacity and increased rates. “Blank sailings” in which a scheduled ship is canceled from a route and stronger ocean carrier alliances also have reduced ocean capacity and buoyed rates.

Overall ITM realized a 19.2% gross revenue gain in 2020 expanding to $70 billion. While having a lower growth rate than overall gross revenue due to a tight carrier capacity market net revenue increased a healthy 11.4% to $24.6 billion. Our expectation is for demand and pricing to remain strong in ITM for the remainder of the year.

C.H. Robinson Worldwide’s global forwarding division saw 2020 gross revenue grow 33.2% to $3.1 billion and net revenue increased 17.8% to $629 million. It has been expanding rapidly in ITM via a mix of acquisitions and organic growth. In 2011 it had net revenue of $100 million.

Expeditors International of Washington the largest U.S.-based freight forwarder had a better-than-average 2020 with gross revenue increasing 23.7% to $10.1 billion and net revenue increasing 11% to $2.9 billion. Growth primarily came from airfreight where gross revenue grew a whopping 63% to $4.8 billion from $2.9 billion in 2019.

Apex Logistics International headquartered in Hong Kong has significant operations in the U.S. and is one of the largest China-­U.S. airfreight forwarders. Its airfreight metric tons grew 44% to 750000 in 2020 driving a 53% increase in gross revenue to $2.3 billion. Apex Logistics managed multiple weekly air charters of PPE from China to the U.S. and has burgeoning e-commerce business. It also more than doubled its ocean freight forwarding business which ended 2020 with 190000 20-foot equivalent units.

In late February Kuehne + Nagel announced it was acquiring Apex Logistics for about $1.5 billion. The combination makes Kuehne + Nagel the largest global airfreight forwarder with just more than 2.1 million metric air tons surpassing DHL Supply Chain and Global Forwarding. It also significantly expands Kuehne + Nagel’s Asian 3PL operating network.

Dedicated Contract Carriage

The asset-heavy dedicated contract carriage (DCC) 3PL segment had the second-highest net revenue growth of the four 3PL segments at just 0.3% to $20 billion. Gross revenue declined 2%. The negative effect of COVID made 2020 a volatile and lower-volume year versus 2019 when DCC net revenues grew 12.1%.

Traditional DCC contracts have one- to three-year terms with specific trucking assets being dedicated to customers. This makes DCC contracts much “stickier” than standard shipper-­carrier trucking contracts. A&A’s market research shows dry van trailers being used for 70% of DCC truckloads refrigerated 16% flatbeds 6% and tankers and others 8%. Three-fourths of major DCC providers have dry vans and reefers. Half of major DCC providers have flatbeds. Customer trailers/containers often are used especially for retail operations such as Walmart.

DCC segment leader J.B. Hunt Dedicated Contract Services with 9911 power units in dedicated posted above average net revenue growth of 3.2% to $2.2 billion making its DCC market share 11% on a net revenue basis. It has more than 160 customers and A&A estimates that about half of J.B. Hunt’s dedicated tractors are tandem axle sleepers. About as many are day cabs used in regional operations. A significant part of Hunt’s DCS operations involve direct store delivery. It also has developed a large last-mile delivery network that has significant home-­delivery capabilities.

Penske Logistics helped by its 2020 acquisition of Black Horse Carriers and 2018 acquisition of Epes Transport System has grown into the second-largest dedicated fleet with 6718 power units. Combined DCC revenues are estimated at more than $1 billion.

We expect moderate DCC demand and growth for 2021 as the economy further rebounds. A lot will hinge upon continued strength in contract truckload rates.

Domestic Transportation Management

The non-asset-based domestic transportation management (DTM) segment includes freight brokerage which represents 83% of segment revenues and managed transportation which accounts for 17%. In 2020 3PLs scrambled to find carrier capacity to meet shipper demand. DTM gross revenue increased 9.9% to $91.2 billion but net revenue decreased 1.8% to $13.2 billion as volatility in motor carrier capacity quickly increased spot market rates compressing segment gross margins by 1.7%.

The ongoing digitalization of transactional truckload freight brokerage continues at a rapid pace as more large shippers have built integrations with 3PLs’ transportation management systems for truckload spot-market rate quoting and automated load tendering and booking. In turn about 20 3PLs have built TMS interfaces that provide these shippers instant rate quotes and the ability to complete load tendering and booking through system APIs (application program interfaces). This process automates traditional spot market freight-brokerage sales functions and is increasing shippers’ use of more spot versus contract pricing.

Sales automation for spot market truckload is happening in conjunction with the automation of carrier sales (procurement) functions. Freight brokers are using intelligent capacity-­management systems to digitally match shippers’ loads to carriers based on historical and real-time carrier capacity data analyzed via machine learning algorithms.

This digital freight-matching capability has become a competitive differentiator within the DTM segment as 3PLs look to increase the number of loads or shipments they manage per person per day. Ultimately this automation will put further pressure on freight brokerage gross margins while it should improve overall profitability.

Large companies such as C.H. Robinson TQL XPO Logistics Hub Group and Echo Global Logistics are some of the 3PLs driving industry automation along with the newer tech-first digital freight brokers and DTM market entrants Convoy Transfix and Uber Freight. At this point most of the top freight brokers are strategically looking at ways to digitalize operations while adding value through improved carrier management and customer and carrier experiences.

Value-Added Warehousing and Distribution

Rapid growth in e-commerce fulfillment could not offset the loss of business-to-business-related activity as overall revenues for the value-added warehousing and distribution (VAWD) 3PL segment sagged in 2020 versus its 9% growth 2019. VAWD net revenues declined 1.1% to $35.7 billion.

VAWD 3PLs continue to benefit from growth in retail ­e-commerce business which continues to be the fastest-growing domestic 3PL segment with a compound annual growth rate of 28% since 2017. Many VAWD 3PLs are supporting retail brands’ strategies to manage their own order fulfillment channels and avoid being captive to large e-retailer platforms such as Amazon. Operationally the growth in e-commerce business has meant an expansion in multiclient warehousing and fulfillment operations with many having footprints of less than 100000 square feet.

An ongoing headwind for VAWD 3PLs has been the “Amazon effect.” 3PLs are continuing to see increased competition from Fulfillment by Amazon which controls 60% of the U.S. e-commerce 3PL market. It dramatically has impacted warehouse employee wages and lease rates in key distribution areas such as Plainfield Ind. and California’s Inland Empire. In turn it is driving significant interest from VAWD 3PLs to automate warehouses with autonomous robotic solutions. With some autonomous robots costing less than $500 per month to operate the cost-benefit and positive return on investment are increasing 3PLs’ interest in warehouse robots to support activities such as picking putaway and cycle counting.

""They're really bad this time of year"" Wade Wilson an associate certified entomologist said of the tussock moth caterpillars.

In their larval stage these colorful lepidoptera the insect order comprising moths and butterflies are out in abundant numbers. When it comes to their presence in Florida it's the northcentral part of the state that seems to get hit the hardest according to experts on these creepy crawlies.

Look but don't touch

There are two types of tussock moth caterpillars that look almost identical and are especially common in this area: the fir tussock moth caterpillar and the white-marked tussock moth caterpillar.

Both of these hairy creatures if they come in contact with a person's skin can cause dermatitis.

""For some people it can just cause itching in other people it can cause a rash"" Jonathan Stoddard an associate certified entomologist and president of the South Daytona-based Imperial Pest Prevention said. ""It’s not uncommon for children to pick them up because of the bright colors they have.""

These two types of tussock moth caterpillars have red heads and what looks like black antennae projecting to the front and what looks like a static tail at the other end. They also have four dense tufts of hair on their backs.

The body of the fir tussock can be dark or light with orange spots while the body of the white-marked tussock is lighter with yellow spots.

A third but rarely seen species is the definite tussock moth caterpillar which has a yellow or tan head and a lighter body than the other two wrote John L. Foltz emeritus professor in the University of Florida's entomology and nematology department.

The dorsal glandular structures on the white-marked tussock are red orange on the fir tussock and pale yellow on the definite tussock.

At maturity these tussock moth caterpillars are about an inch and a half in length.

Despite its common name the fir tussock moth caterpillar is generally hosted by oaks and bald cypress. The white-marked tussock moth caterpillar is associated with a number of plants but some of the more common hosts are oak willow cherry and hackberry trees according to research by UF's entomology and nematology department.

""You’ll find them mostly in the hardwood trees inland"" said Karen Stauderman a commercial horticulture agent III with UF's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. ""Beachside you won’t really find them there.""

While they're native to North America and not technically an invasive species it can feel like they are given their sheer numbers.

""About 20 years ago is when I really started noticing them in large numbers"" Wilson technical director for the Jacksonville-based Turner Pest Control said.

Cocoons and control

Once the tussock moth caterpillar has foraged for food it finds somewhere to set up its cocoon or pupate.

""Besides the annoying presence of numerous hairy caterpillars many larvae spin their difficult-to-remove cocoons on outdoor furniture stored boats and the walls and soffits of our houses"" Foltz wrote.

The tan oval-shaped structures spun in early April are surprisingly strong. They also contain hairs from the caterpillars.

Touching the cocoons also can cause dermatitis and the cocoons can retain this effect for a year even when there isn't anything left inside Stauderman said.

""Males emerge and fly to the wingless females from mid-April into early May"" according to Foltz. ""The wingless female lays eggs on her cocoon and dies.""

As much as these tussock moth caterpillars can be a nuisance experts even those in the pest control business say using chemicals to remove them isn't really worth it.

Birds and lizards will eat some of them and others won't make it to maturity because of fungi and bacteria Stauderman said.

Pest control practices also have changed over the years.

""Everything has migrated toward what is called integrated pest management"" Stoddard said. ""Unless something is posing a direct threat pesticides aren't always the best answer.""

Wilson echoed that sentiment.

""Years ago we knew we had to take a safer approach to our environment with pesticides"" Wilson said. When it comes to the tussock moth caterpillars ""it's usually best to let them do their thing and they'll be gone in about four weeks or so.""

He said if someone comes in contact with one of the caterpillars or a cocoon it's best to wash the area with soap and water and treat it with a topical ointment or lotion so long as it doesn't contain alcohol which causes further irritation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaHJvbmljbGVvbmxpbmUuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ob21lL3JlYWRlci13YW50cy1hZHZpY2Utb24tc2VsZWN0aW5nLXRyZWVzLXdoYXQtYXJlLWFsbC10aGVzZS1jYXRlcnBpbGxhcnMvYXJ0aWNsZV9iNmViMGQ2OC05MzYyLTExZWItYTFjNy05Yjc4NWRjMmQ5MjYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reader wants advice on selecting trees; what are all these caterpillars?,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The stripy grubs are deceptively beautiful as they wriggle in single file from one pine tree to another.

However each caterpillar is covered with tiny barbed hairs too tiny to see which can cause reactions ranging from mild inflammation and irritation to severe anaphylactic shock.

Upon contact with skin a rash soon forms which can be incredibly itchy painful and lasts for as much as three weeks. After pupation they turn into the pine processionally moth.

The invasive species has long blighted southern France but has now reached the area around the capital and now parks of the inner city.

“It was absent from the region in the 1990s but since then it has really rocketed” said Jérôme Rousselet expert at the French institute of agricultural research Inrae.

Now it has crossed Paris’ ring road.

“We are observing a rise in the number of sites alerting to the presence of nests of pine processionaries coming up from southern Paris” the environmental arm of the capital’s town hall told Le Parisien adding that the Parc Floral in the 12th arrondissement as well as the Parc Monsouris in the 14th arrondissement were now affected.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy93b3JsZC8xNDE4NzExL2NhdGVycGlsbGFyLWludmFzaW9uLWhhaXJ5LXBpbmUtbGF0ZXN0LWZyYW5jZS1wYXJpcy11ay13b29kbGFuZC10cnVzdNIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy93b3JsZC8xNDE4NzExL2NhdGVycGlsbGFyLWludmFzaW9uLWhhaXJ5LXBpbmUtbGF0ZXN0LWZyYW5jZS1wYXJpcy11ay13b29kbGFuZC10cnVzdC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caterpillar invasion: Fearsome 'hairy pine' spotted in Paris - and it's heading for UK,"Bubonic Plague: Squirrel in Colorado tests positive

The pine processionary moth when it is in its caterpillar stage of life cycle form a 'procession' when moving from one area to another. The spikes of the dreaded creature can cause severe reactions such as anaphylactic shock. If human skin touches the spikes protruding from the caterpillars body it can cause a painful rash to form math lasts for up to three weeks.

In most cases contact with the creature causes mild inflammation. The species is usually prevalent in southern regions closer to the equator but temperature changes brought on by global warming have seen its habitual area expand. However now the moth is commonly seen in northern areas of France and is even predicted to migrate to the UK. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph Jérôme Rousselet an expert at the French institute of agricultural research Inrae said: ""It was absent from the region in the 1990s but since then it has really rocketed"".

New launch 32% more productive and 48% more efficient than predecessor

Caterpillar has announced the launch of its new 992 wheeled loader a large mining loader model that offers up to 32% greater productivity reduces maintenance costs by as much as 10% and offers up to 48% greater payload than its predecessor model.

According to a statement from Cat the new 992 wheeled loader which replaces the 992K is powered by the new Cat C32B engine with US EPA Tier 4 Final/EU Stage V as well as Tier 2 equivalent emission engine options. Powertrain design enhancements to the transmission axles and final drive along with the new engine deliver a 20% longer interval for planned component replacement.

Cat added that the 992 offers both standard- and high-lift configurations and delivers the lowest cost-per-ton when paired with fleets of Cat 775 777 and 785 trucks. Standard-lift payload capacities reach 23.1t for quarry face applications and 27.2t for loose material handling while high-lift capacities reach 20.4t and 24.5t in respective applications. A new Z-bar linkage optimised for performance and improvements to rimpull and breakout force deliver greater machine capacity and efficiency.

Cat added that the new 992 has demonstrated “up to 48% greater payload-per-fuel efficiency” in field testing in applications where a four-pass match to 90.7t trucks was achieved versus five passes with the 992K. The 992 provides up to 9.5% more rimpull during digging and up to 20% more breakout force increasing productivity.

“The new Cat 992 Wheel Loader features an on-demand throttle mode to optimise payload-per-fuel efficiency without slowing production. New standard automatic retarding controls disable the impeller clutch enable the lockup clutch and use the implement and fan pumps retarding to slow the machine on grade. The available advanced automatic retarding controls with engine brake feature offers full control of the loader’s speed on grade to maintain a desired hold speed” said Cat’s statement.

Automating critical digging cycle elements optional New Autodig Components further improve productivity and efficiency while reducing tire wear. To stop slippage before it happens a tire slip prevention feature reduces rimpull before the tires are set and increases rimpull when downward force is applied to the tire. The tire set function detects pile contact and automatically lifts against the pile to set the tires and increase available traction. The lift stall prevention feature automatically manages rimpull in-dig to prevent hydraulic stall while lifting through the face so the 992 spends less time in the pile.

Optional new Payload Overload Prevention allows for productivity and efficiency improvements by providing a large enough bucket to be used to achieve target pass-match across a range of material densities without the risk of overload. With the overload value fully adjustable based on the target payload this feature can be configured to automatically stop or slow the lift function when the overload value is exceeded.

Improvements to the setback and strike plane angles a longer bucket floor and a stronger and larger bottom section increase the bucket fill factor by 10%. The taller side plate with level top surface helps to improve visibility beyond the bucket edge to the material pile.

Available Operator Coaching empowers operators to exceed productivity targets by measuring and providing feedback to teach proper operating techniques. Among other operating techniques this feature shows how to properly shorten travel avoid unracking in-dig enter the pile with a level bucket reduce the dump height and use the kickout the manufacturer added."

The membership-only workspace which combines coworking and child care is scheduled to open its first location in the Westfield Century City mall this spring.



“We’re not just trying to make the lives for working parents easier but make parenting easier in general” said Joan Nguyen who came up with the concept for BumoWork with company co-founder Chriselle Lim.



BumoWork isn’t the only coworking company offering a fresh approach in the L.A. market. After being hit hard by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic for the past year the once-hot industry is starting to show fresh signs of life.



West Adams-based Yoube Inc. for instance plans to open its first coworking popup in West Adams this spring. And Union Cowork which has several locations in the San Diego area opened in the Arts District last fall.



Even old guard operator WeWork Cos. Inc. which has endured slowdowns and contraction recently opened a location at 9830 Wilshire Blvd. in Beverly Hills. Amenities include a movie theater and podcast studio.



Newmark Group Inc. Executive Managing Director Ryan Harding said “Coworking 3.0” is coming into play. The new iteration combines elements of the initial version which was more about executive suites with aspects of the second wave which focused on open creative spaces.



Newmark recently acquired flex office space provider Knotel Inc.



“People do want that flexibility going forward” Harding said. “Flexibility is going to be the key. Coworking is going to lend itself very well to that.”



Landlords he added still see benefits to coworking as tenants may grow into larger office spaces in the same building. And coworking companies often sign large long-term leases.



Peter Belisle Southwest region market director for Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. agreed that there is still interest in coworking spaces.



“A number of clients envision having some form of coworking as part of their portfolio strategy” he said adding that some companies may have one large office space and a few coworking outposts closer to where their employees live.



“Flexibility is one of the key hot points for clients today. We think the demand side is not only from the individuals who are popping into these but large organizations are looking at incorporating flex office space in their portfolio” CBRE Group Inc. Executive Vice President John Zanetos said.



But it’s not all good news on the coworking front. During the pandemic several operators have shuttered locations or paused plans for additional outposts.



“A number of coworking providers have been restructuring what their square footage is and where their locations are for sure” Belisle said. “They have been using this time to think about what markets we should be in and … aggressively restructuring.”

New opportunities

Still as vaccination rates increase and businesses figure out next steps for workers companies like BumoWork are hoping to take advantage of new opportunities.



The company’s Century City space was originally set to open last year but “because of the pandemic we had to pivot pretty quickly” Nguyen said.



It already has people signed up for the location including a roster of celebrity clients. To become a member parents apply online then participate in a family interview before being officially invited to enroll.



Fees range from $300 for weekend-only care to $4000 a month for a full care and coworking membership. Children must be under 6 years old.



In addition to weekday coworking and child care BumoWork offers weekend camps. There’s also outdoor space at the location.



The company’s child care component is not just a playroom set aside for kids. Rather it occupies one side of the floor and is staffed by licensed child care professionals. The coworking space takes up the other half of the floor.



“When you’re on the child side you won’t even know the coworking side exists and when you are in the coworking space you don’t know the child care space exists” Nguyen said.



The licensed professionals also help kids learn while they’re in the space. Nguyen said the company has teachers who are trained in chemistry and foreign languages.



Century City is the company’s first location but Nguyen aims to grow BumoWork. She has been in talks with other buildings and companies about additional outposts.



“With Covid there’s been a bigger highlight on working parents” Nguyen said.

Other operators

For Yoube the planned location in West Adams is just the first of many. As the company looks to a national expansion it expects to open roughly 50 outposts around L.A. in the next few years.



Yoube was founded by Jenny Berglund Castro Stephan Agerman and Babak Kheshti. It is looking to take advantage of empty retail and office spaces in desirable areas.



“The type of locations we are looking at are nontraditional office spaces. We are taking over retail spaces” Agerman said.



He added that this could even be spaces in malls.



“We’re really solving a great problem for them. In the mall space it’s hard to get people to come back to a mall every day but if you work there it’s great” Agerman said.



Castro said she saw the need for spaces that could be used for just a few hours that were a step up from a coffee shop but not an office that you go to every day.



Clients can sign up buy credits for an hour for a day or a package and can then book a workspace. The group is focused on hot desks and meeting pods not private offices.



“It’s really meant to be a super flexible solution” Castro said.



Eventually she said the West Adams location could have space for 68 people but will launch at reduced capacity due to the pandemic.



The property is owned by CIM Group. Agerman said his goal is to replicate it at other buildings owned by the company adding that Yoube is interested in management agreements and revenue-sharing options as well.



“We are looking for white boxes to come in and set up our model” Castro said referring to blank-slate areas. “We are not expecting to do a lot of buildout.”



Union Cowork is also new to town. Its Arts District location has private offices open desks podcast rooms conference areas and a full kitchen. Rates start at $400 a month and grant access to the company’s seven locations.



Union Cowork Chief Operating Officer Stephanie Lawrence said the company offers “boutique-style coworking.”



“We are really just focused on stabilizing but the hope is to get back on track to expanding all throughout Southern California but mostly in L.A.” Lawrence said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMDMvaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbnMvZGV2ZWxvcGVycy10aWVzLWZvcmQtZ292ZXJubWVudC1iZW5lZml0LWhpZ2h3YXktNDEz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,INVESTIGATION: Developers with ties to Ford government stand to cash in on Hwy. 413,"Another of the developers Michael DeGasperis hosted Ford and PC MPP Stephen Lecce in a private luxury suite at the BB&T Center in Miami to watch a Florida Panthers’ NHL game in December 2018. In a statement spokespeople for Ford and Lecce said both politicians paid for their own tickets to the game and no government business was discussed.

One developer John Di Poce employed the head of the Ontario PC party’s fundraising arm for several years and three other developers employ the chair of Caroline Mulroney’s 2018 PC leadership campaign as a government lobbyist. Mulroney is now Ontario’s transportation minister and will play a key role in future decisions about the 413 highway.

If built the road will raze 2000 acres of farmland cut across 85 waterways and pave nearly 400 acres of protected Greenbelt land in Vaughan. It would also disrupt 220 wetlands and the habitats of 10 species-at-risk according to the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority.

Four of the developers are connected to Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative government through party officials and former Tory politicians now acting as registered lobbyists.

Eight of Ontario’s most powerful land developers own thousands of acres of prime real estate near the proposed route of the controversial Highway 413 a National Observer/Torstar investigation has found.

In the past year Ford’s government has signed controversial minister’s zoning orders (MZO) for two properties in Vaughan near Highway 400 close to the terminus of the 413’s route and a parcel of land in Caledon near a proposed interchange.

The provincial government has handed down extraordinary directives in at least three instances since April 2020 to help fast-track development on lands owned by some of these major developers around the proposed highway.

That was shortly after the Ford government had resurrected the proposed 413 highway. The previous Liberal government had shelved the project in 2018 as concerns about urban sprawl and its impact on the environment grew.

The group of developers own 39 properties covering 3300 acres that are conservatively valued at nearly half a billion dollars according to land registry documents. The value of those lands could rise dramatically if the highway is built and residential commercial and industrial development is allowed to spread along the route.

Most of the developers in the group are also prolific PC donors contributing at least $813000 to support the party since 2014.

The proposed 60-kilometre route of the 413 highway would extend northeast from Highway 401 near Milton looping around the built-up edges of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to Highway 400 north of Vaughan. It would pass through parts of Greenbelt land just south of the Oak Ridges Moraine a protected environmentally sensitive area.

One study commissioned by the previous Liberal government estimated the proposed highway would save drivers a mere 30 to 60 seconds of driving time. The Ministry of Transportation contends that it would save drivers 30 minutes.

In an emailed statement on behalf of Ford Mulroney and the transportation ministry the premier’s spokesperson said the 413 highway is needed because “even with significant investments in transit the major highways in York and Peel regions are all forecasted to be operating over capacity by 2031.”

“There is a very strong case for moving forward with this project when considering the forecasted population growth this region will experience in the coming years” said Ivana Yelich the premier’s spokesperson.

The highway also known as the GTA West Corridor is under increasing criticism from residents environmental groups and now local governments who are questioning the need for a new road and a price tag estimated to be anywhere from $6 billion to $10 billion.

On Humber Station Road just south of Bolton the Muia family are among those waiting and worrying about the fate of the highway. The 413 hangs over them like a shadow figuratively for now but perhaps literally some day.

The highway would pass right over the roof of the family house at the location of what will be the Humber Station interchange. Their two-acre property will become pavement and concrete bridges and ramps.

Vince Muia is 86 and he wasn’t planning on going anywhere. “I hoped to pass away at my property” he said.

When the highway was first conceived some two decades ago it was meant to be part of a bypass that extended all the way to Fort Erie. Now only the 60-km stretch from Milton to Vaughan remains.

The environmental concerns that have dominated discussion around the highway — rallying together citizens from across the GTA — are not new. The detrimental impacts to the GTA’s farmland waterways and Greenbelt have been discussed for the past two decades — and that was in part why the project was shelved by the Liberals.

When the Progressive Conservatives revived the project late in 2018 they also pledged to review the environmental assessment (EA) for the highway allowing for a more “streamlined process for assessing potential environmental impacts.” This would allow for early works along the highway route such as new bridge construction or expansion to begin before the completion of the EA expected in 2022.

“The previous Liberal government prematurely cancelled the environmental assessment on the GTA West Corridor never released the lands and as a result left hundreds of landowners in limbo for years without any plan to alleviate congestion in the Greater Toronto Area” Yelich said.

“Our government is doing the due diligence that was never done on this project by following through with the Environmental Assessment process which is among the most stringent assessment processes in the country to determine if the GTA West Corridor is a viable project for York Peel and Halton regions” Yelich added. “We are fully committed to the consultation process.”

Ontario’s NDP and Liberal leaders are both pledging to kill the 413 highway saying it’s costly harmful and unnecessary.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Ford is “benefiting his developer buddies who in turn end up filling the coffers” of the PC party while Liberal Leader Steve Del Duca said the premier is “focused exclusively on rewarding billionaire Conservative donors.”

The findings of the Observer/Torstar investigation raise questions about why the 413 highway was resurrected by the Ford government shortly after it was axed who stands to benefit if it’s built and why the government has taken such contentious steps to speed development along the route.

The land holdings uncovered in the joint investigation are just a snapshot of the total property ownership along the proposed highway route.

The search of land registry documents and corporation profiles focused on larger parcels of properties many more than 100 acres in size within five kilometres either side of the proposed route as well as properties associated with major developers. A CFL football field including end zones is about two acres in size.

One of the developers who owns the largest number of acres near the proposed highway is John Di Poce who is associated with Di Poce Management Limited and Di Poce Real Estate Holdings Limited.

The Observer/Torstar investigation identified 10 properties near the proposed highway owned by Di Poce’s companies covering 663 acres in total. More than half of the properties were near the village of Kleinburg and Copper Creek Golf Club.

“I’m in the building business. I sell houses” Di Poce told the Globe and Mail in 2000. “I’m a private person and I don’t want to have anything to do with anybody.”

Di Poce declined to comment about his land holdings and ties to the Ford government.

For a number of years one of Di Poce’s key contract consultants was Tony Miele who simultaneously held the role of chair of the PC Ontario Fund the party’s fundraising arm a role he continues to hold.

Miele is a former president and CEO of the Ontario Realty Corporation (ORC) which managed the provincial government’s real estate portfolio until 2011 when it became part of Infrastructure Ontario. He was appointed to the position by Mike Harris the former PC premier and resigned from the ORC in early 2006.

On March 28 he sent an email to donors imploring them to help the party raise more than $46000 in four days “to ensure that Doug Ford has the largest war chest of any party in the next election.”

The relationship between Miele and Di Poce dates back to the late 1990s when Miele was a manager for the Canada Lands Company a federal version of the ORC.

In Nov. 1997 in his role with Canada Lands Company Miele oversaw the sale of 30 acres of federally owned land across the street from the Chrysler assembly plant in Bramalea to Di Poce’s company for $58000 an acre.

A month later Di Poce flipped the property for $165000 an acre. How did he do it? “Luck nothing but luck” he said at the time.

After leaving ORC Miele became a consultant for Di Poce’s company.

In an emailed statement Miele stated he was a contract development consultant for Di Poce until 2016 and his role “did not involve any discussions whatsoever on the proposed Highway 413.”

Another prominent developer with more than 600 acres of property near the proposed highway is the Cortellucci family which owns Zancor Homes Fernbrook Homes and other real estate development companies under the Cortel Group umbrella.

The Cortelluccis are also known for their philanthropy. In 2019 the family donated $40 million to the new hospital in Vaughan at a gala event attended by nearly 1000 people including Ford.

In 2019 Ford relaxed the naming policy for Ontario hospitals making it easier for hospitals to recognize benefactors. In 2020 the hospital was renamed the Cortellucci Vaughan Hospital.

A Cortellucci-owned banquet hall now called the Riviera Event Space ⁠has also been the venue for a variety of political fundraising events. Premier Doug Ford’s brother the late Toronto mayor Rob Ford hosted a $300-per-plate fundraiser at Riviera in 2014.

The family has also found itself at the centre of controversy in 2018 when Cortel Group founder Mario Cortellucci ran for a seat in the Italian Senate alongside a coalition of right-wing parties who called for among other things closing Italian mosques and removing migrants from the country. At the time Cortellucci’s campaign manager said he “comes from an immigration family” and is a “strong believer in immigration.”

Mario Cortellucci arrived in Canada in 1962 and started working in construction in the '70s. As children growing up in a small Italian village Mario and his brother Nick ⁠— also a developer ⁠— would sift through sand and stone by the river he told the Vaughan-based luxury lifestyle magazine Dolce in 2012.

“He taught me things like vision and how to plan for the future” Mario’s son and Cortel Group vice-president Peter Cortellucci said of his father at the time. “You don’t plan for the next couple of months you plan for the next 10 years.”

Peter Cortellucci did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Cortel Group and his family’s land holdings political donations and views on the proposed highway.

Two of the major GTA land development families — the DeGasperis and Guglietti clans — come from the same town in central Italy and are related by marriage.

The Guglietti family is known for Melrose Investments Inc. Rosehaven Homes and Tamarack Lumber.

Companies associated with members of the Guglietti family own at least six properties with a combined total of nearly 500 acres close to the proposed 413 highway.

The Gugliettis did not respond to multiple requests for comment sent to Melrose Investments.

Patriarch Giovanni Guglietti who died in 2009 came to Canada in 1952 at the age of 17 and in 1961 he married Concetta DeGasperis.

Her three brothers — Fred Tony and Angelo DeGasperis — had started Condrain an infrastructure company in 1954.

There are two main branches of the DeGasperis family holdings.

One arm descends from brothers Fred Tony and Angelo with businesses such as Metrus Condor DG Group Aspen Ridge Homes and Vineland Estates winery.

The other arm descends from a cousin Giovanni (John) DeGasperis and includes Arista Homes and a variety of TACC corporations — an acronym for The Amazing Construction Company.

John’s son Silvio DeGasperis who owns TACC Construction has fought against restrictions on development in southern Ontario for more than 15 years beginning with the previous Liberal government’s 2004 decision to protect the Greenbelt. The move effectively ruled out his plans to develop nearly 1000 acres of farmland in Pickering east of Toronto.

A 2006 profile in the Toronto Star called Silvio a “fast-talking well-dressed” developer who despite standing five feet eight inches “casts a large shadow in Greater Toronto.”

“I’m a relatively small player” he said at the time when it was estimated he was grossing $650 million per year.

“But if you push me around I’ll push back.”

On Dec. 28 2018 the Florida Panthers took on the Montreal Canadiens at the BB&T Center in Miami. Michael DeGasperis Silvio’s younger brother played host to Doug Ford and Stephen Lecce in the DeGasperis family’s luxury box. Lecce — who had not yet been named education minister — represents the King-Vaughan riding where DeGasperis’ Arista Homes is based.

Companies connected to the DeGasperis family own three properties with a total of 168 acres near the proposed highway as well as five properties owned jointly with other developers. Messages left for Michael DeGasperis and TACC went unreturned.

The DeGasperis family’s main TACC corporation Burlington-based Argo Development and a company associated with Fieldgate all employ former federal Conservative MP Peter Van Loan as a lobbyist registered with the Ontario government. When asked what he aims to influence in his lobbyist registration for TACC Developments he states “Impact of proposed highway on Client’s lands.”

Van Loan was the government house leader under Stephen Harper from 2011 to 2015. He was also the chair of Caroline Mulroney’s 2018 failed campaign for the leadership of the Ontario PC party. Mulroney’s spokesperson said Van Loan has never lobbied the minister regarding Highway 413.

Van Loan is a former president of the Ontario PC party and from 2015 to 2018 he was the director of candidate training and recruitment for the provincial PCs.

Van Loan did not respond to requests for comment.

In addition to Van Loan two of the DeGasperis family’s companies employ former PC MPP Frank Klees as a registered lobbyist. His lobbying goals according to his registration are focused on several matters including highways housing and infrastructure.

Klees Ontario’s transportation minister in 2003 said Highway 413 “has never been a subject of discussion with provincial office holders on behalf of either Condor or DG Group.”

The De Meneghi family which runs Lormel Homes owns 234 acres close to the 413 route in Vaughan. Elvio De Meneghi a principal at the company didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.

Amir Remtulla chief of staff for the late Rob Ford lobbied on behalf of Lormel Homes from Sept. 2019 to July 2020. He was also employed by TACC Construction as a lobbyist from Nov. 2019 to Oct. 2020. Remtulla didn’t respond to requests for comment but lobbying registrations indicate his work for both companies was focused on developments unrelated to the 413.

Argo Development employed Jim Burnett a longtime Conservative campaigner as a lobbyist from Feb. 2020 until early this year.

Burnett worked on Patrick Brown’s 2015 campaign to lead the Ontario PC Party and was an assistant to former PC leader Tim Hudak.

Burnett said he never discussed the 413 highway with the government or companies he represented as a lobbyist.

Developers donated to PC Party Ontario Proud

Each of the developers donated to the Progressive Conservatives. Three also gave to the third-party conservative group Ontario Proud.

About $753000 went directly to the party with another $60000 to Ontario Proud.

Many also donated to other parties but those contributions totalled far less with about $350000 going to the Ontario Liberals and nearly $28000 to the Ontario NDP. The vast majority of the donations to other parties were also made before the PCs formed government in 2018.

While names match the Observer/Torstar investigation cannot independently verify they are the same people. Observer/Torstar reporters sent the donation records to the developers and they either did not respond or did not dispute them. Common names and people who donated less than $500 were excluded.

The DeGasperis family led the way. The family members their companies and senior staff have donated $332265 to the PCs since 2014. They contributed $157756 to the Ontario Liberals and $27507 to the Ontario NDP.

TACC Developments is also part of Nashville Developments a consortium of developers that includes Fieldgate and donated $50000 to Ontario Proud in 2018.

“It just shows you how much the Highway 413 project is about benefiting land speculators who donated a lot of money to the (PC party)” Ontario Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said of the donations found by the Observer/Torstar investigation.

Lobbying in Ontario is often about building relationships said Dan Gold who recently completed his PhD at the University of Ottawa on how lobbying influences decision making in Canada and the United States.

“It’s not about bribing a politician it’s about finding a candidate who is receptive to your position and helping them get into office” said Gold. “In some way it’s more insidious because it’s not just one decision but finding an elected official whose viewpoint aligns with yours.”

He said the donations that developers give politicians “don’t buy you the outcome you want but they buy you access.”

Asked about donations and the role of lobbyists Ford’s office did not directly respond.

'The profit margins are astronomical'

Access to transit drives up land values.

“The on and off ramps really are going to be the driving factors” said Keith Lancastle CEO of the Appraisal Institute of Canada which analyzes real estate values. “That’s where I’ve increased access to the properties nearby.”

The combined purchase prices for the properties associated with the major developers in this snapshot total $450 million.

But three-quarters of the properties identified have been held by the developers for more than a decade and more than half of them were purchased before 2004 which suggests their value could have grown dramatically.

Even if the highway is approved and built it could still take years before development of the farms and open land is permitted and proceeds.

It’s typical for developers to buy up properties around the fringes of cities and hold them as farmland for long periods speculating they will eventually be included in the urban boundary.

If a highway or other form of mass transit is also approved the land is worth dramatically more according to Victor Doyle a former Ontario government planner.

“The profit margins are astronomical” said Doyle.

“So if any developer speculatively bought land in Caledon and Vaughan then developers are going to be pushing for the highway to no end because they stand to benefit even more so from their investment.”

Doyle worked as a government planner when the province was mulling the 413 before shelving it in 2018. He said despite years of studies a three-person panel commissioned by the Liberals found the highway was not the best solution to GTA’s gridlock problem and suggested highway expansions and better use of the nearby Highway 407 instead.

“I think the reinvigoration of the 413 under the Conservatives can be directly attributed to the development industry” said Doyle who has been credited as one of the architects of the Greenbelt.

Developers push municipalities to expand the urban boundary in their official plans Doyle said. Despite an ongoing pandemic and opposition from some GTA-area municipal councils the province has given municipalities until next summer to update their official plans to 2051.

“The minute the Minister of Municipal Affairs signs an official plan which expands the urban boundary the value of that land goes up dramatically” he said.

In Ontario land zoned for employment land is going for $1.9 million per acre in 2021 according to CBRE Group a commercial real estate services firm.

For now the highway remains a proposal zoning changes are merely forecasted in official plans and many of the lots remain agricultural.

None of that seems to have dented the value of land near the planned 413.

A 98-acre lot at 14275 The Gore Road in Caledon sold for $3.8 million in 2008. In May 2019 the farmland located about four km north of a proposed 413 interchange was bought by a company connected to the principals of Argo Development for $40 million.

Special orders fast-tracked development near the 413

While city councils can revamp their official plans such changes can take years to materialize.

The province has a way for developers to skip the wait. They’re called minister’s zoning orders or MZOs and the Ford government has used more of them since 2018 than the previous government did in 15 years.

The orders — made by Ford’s Municipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark and in the face of mounting criticism — are unappealable.

“We will never stop issuing MZOs for the people of Ontario” Ford said on March 9.

Three Ford government MZOs cleared the way for projects near the 413.

One issued in Vaughan in April 2020 approved developers’ plans to demolish three protected wetlands where development is normally forbidden and replace them with a massive Walmart distribution centre. The land sits near the point where the 413 would join Highway 400.

The province had previously classified the wetlands as “provincially significant” a title given to places the government deems most precious. Often they control floods or are home to rare species.

The developers struck a deal with the province and the local conservation authority to build new wetlands nearby as a replacement.

The project broke ground in August 2020.

A photo of the event shows Condor founder Angelo DeGasperis standing alongside Ford three of Ford’s cabinet ministers two local politicians the CEO of Walmart Canada and the president of the development company Muzzo Group.

They all held shovels.

The warehouse’s construction set to be done in 2024 was endorsed by the local council. It was opposed by environmentalists who said the MZO was a “deeply troubling precedent.”

On the other side of Highway 400 less than two kilometres away from the proposed interchange with the 413 a November 2020 MZO rezoned farmland to become the future site of five neighbourhoods. Among the developers participating: Lormel Homes Fieldgate and TACC Developments.

Environmentalists who are opposed to such developments located next to the Greenbelt say it paves over a carbon sink hampers Ontario’s ability to grow food locally and increases emissions-intensive urban sprawl.

The plans for the development include stipulations that there be a “net positive environmental outcome.”

The Ford government used an earlier MZO in July 2020 to approve a housing development in Caledon located on land near a proposed 413 interchange. The project was proposed by a group of companies that includes Nick Cortellucci’s Brookvalley Project Management and Fieldgate.

The project in the works for about a decade with the backing of Caledon council had been postponed due to the Liberals’ decision to shelve the 413.

Another MZO request by Cortel Group which would rezone land just north of the Walmart warehouse if approved is under consideration by Minister Clark.

The 195-acre property includes valleys forests and provincially significant wetlands according to a Toronto and Region Conservation Authority staff report.

In a letter to Vaughan council last year asking for city support for the MZO Cortel cited the 413: “The lands are located along a major north-south transportation corridor (Highway 400) which will connect directly with the proposed new GTA West Corridor. These lands therefore have very significant strategic importance in the GTA and in the province for the movement of people and goods throughout Ontario.”

'What are you going to do leave the house and live underneath the bridge?'

Those who are now fighting the highway for a second time in three years say there’s a grassroots feel to the opposition this time.

In February environmental law charity EcoJustice asked the federal government to take over the environmental assessment of the highway. The federal government is expected to make its decision some time in early May. It’s a decision that many believe could kill the project.

In the meantime almost all of the municipalities impacted by the highway — and who have long backed it — have pulled their support for the project including Vaughan King City and Halton Hills. Brampton and Caledon have endorsed the request for federal oversight.

Back on Humber Station Road the Muia family has started looking for a new place to live in case the highway is approved. A lot of real estate agents have been knocking on the door lately.

Vince 86 and his 84-year-old wife moved out of the Jane-Lawrence area of Toronto 22 years ago to get some breathing room.

Sam 57 moved back in three months ago to help his parents. Together they’re trying to figure out what they should do.

His parents want to stay in the same area if they’re forced out and they’ve looked at some properties but all of them are selling for up to $500000 over the asking price Sam said.

“They say they’re not moving” Sam added. “I said ‘What are you going to do leave the house and live underneath the bridge?’ Because there will be bridges all over the place here.”

The competitive landscape in the logistics industry is constantly shifting. Many large freight brokers and contract logistics providers have expanded in recent years through mergers and acquisitions. And new companies and investors have been entering this growing field with their own ideas on how to manage freight transportation more efficiently.

At the same time logistics providers are adjusting to market changes such as the growing demand for e-commerce fulfillment and rising standards for service levels and freight visibility.

Transport Topics has produced an annual ranking of the largest companies in this dynamic segment of the transportation business for nearly two decades but much like the industry itself this list continues to evolve.

Clevenger

For the 2021 edition of our Top 50 Logistics Companies list we’ve decided to use a different metric — gross revenue — to rank the largest third-party logistics providers in North America.

That’s a departure from the methodology we used in years past when we ranked companies on the basis of net revenue which is gross revenue minus the cost of purchased transportation.

While gross and net revenue are both perfectly valid ways of examining the comparable size and capabilities of 3PLs we’ve come to the conclusion that gross revenue is a better reflection of an organization’s overall reach and therefore more closely aligned with our objective — to identify the largest companies in the logistics industry.

Although most of the names on this year’s Top 50 are familiar this change in methodology reshuffles the list significantly.

Freight brokers and freight forwarders now rise in the rankings because they generate much higher gross revenue than net revenue as they arrange transportation and pay carriers to move freight on behalf of their shipper customers. In contrast there is generally little or no difference between gross and net revenue for 3PLs that primarily provide warehousing and distribution services or dedicated contract carriage.

With this new ranking system C.H. Robinson Worldwide the largest freight broker in North America by a wide margin is now No. 1 on the TT Top 50 Logistics Companies list as well.

Meanwhile major changes are on the horizon for No. 2 XPO Logistics which announced in December 2020 that it intends to split into two separate publicly traded companies.

The transaction expected to close in the second half of 2021 will uncouple XPO’s contract logistics business from its trucking and brokerage operations. Both XPO and the spinoff company GXO Logistics will likely rank high on this list next year.

A new name on this year’s Top 50 is No. 8 Transportation Insight Holding Co. which operates as two sister companies — enterprise logistics provider Transportation Insight and freight brokerage Nolan Transportation Group. TI Holding Co. is a portfolio company of private equity firm Gryphon Investors.

Another newcomer to the Top 50 is digital freight broker Uber Freight which cracks the list for the first time at No. 41. Parent company Uber Technologies which rose to prominence with its ride-hailing app for car passengers has targeted freight transportation as one of its next major growth opportunities. Uber Freight launched its load-booking app in 2017 with a focus on automating manual processes and streamlining transactions particularly for small carriers.

Other companies making their debut on the Top 50 list include No. 35 AIT Worldwide Logistics and No. 39 Capstone Logistics.

AIT based in Itasca Ill. provides ocean and airfreight forwarding and freight brokerage services and operates 42 warehouses.

Georgia-based Capstone Logistics offers freight brokerage warehousing and fulfillment last-mile delivery and transportation technology. The company expanded its brokerage capabilities through its acquisition of LoadDelivered Logistics in 2018.

Transport Topics produced this Top 50 list and accompanying sector rankings in cooperation with industry research and consulting firm Armstrong & Associates which provided estimates for some revenue figures in cases where data was not available from company management or public sources.

On a final note we wish to recognize the role that logistics companies of all sizes have played in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether managing vaccine distribution or simply arranging transportation to keep store shelves stocked 3PLs have been doing their part in the fight against the coronavirus. This historic event has illustrated the essential nature of the work performed every day by logistics professionals.

The COVID-19 outbreak created a volatile U.S. third-party logistics market in 2020 which presented growth opportunities for 3PLs with strong carrier management e-commerce and airfreight forwarding capabilities while other 3PLs did not fare as well.

After a lackluster 2019 in which transportation activity declined year-over-year as import tariffs took hold the industry awoke to a pandemic nightmare in March 2020 with vast economic shutdowns. By May things began bouncing back as shutdowns were dialed back and the V-shaped recovery took hold. Even with local and regional economic “spits and spurts” inventories needed to be replenished and personal protective equipment drove strong airfreight demand. There was no time like the present for logistics expertise and 3PLs prevailed as an essential industry.

Overall strong domestic and international transportation demand has continued into 2021 further driving up domestic and international transportation rates. With inventories increasing and COVID-19 cases waning demand for 3PL services seems to be becoming more stable and manageable. As the nation gets closer to herd immunity in the COVID battle we should continue to see increasingly strong demand as more consumers leave quarantine and boost spending. In fact 2021 might be the true start of our generation’s roaring ’20s.

Armstrong

While many 3PLs still are providing us with 2020 financials Armstrong & Associates’ current estimates show U.S. 3PL market gross revenues grew 8.8% bringing the total market to $231.5 billion. Most of the growth came from international and domestic transportation management which responded to COVID-­related demands for PPE and to restock inventories upon economic reopenings. Overall 2020 was a better year for 3PLs than 2019 which registered the market’s first decline since 2009. But segment growth was uneven.

Total 3PL segment net revenues (gross revenues minus purchased transportation) grew 2.1% to $93.5 billion reflecting gross margin compression due to a volatile carrier sourcing market and transportation management 3PLs spending more to secure hard-to-find carrier capacity. The overall gross margin for all segments declined to 41% from 44%.

International Transportation Management

Leading all 3PL segments for revenue growth in 2020 was international transportation management (ITM) which consists of air and ocean freight forwarding customs brokerage and complementary value-added services. Airfreight revenues swelled in 2020 with the pandemic and extraordinary demand for PPE. With commercial passenger aircraft making up approximately 40% of total air cargo capacity the pandemic upended airfreight forwarding and rates surged albeit on lower overall volumes.

With the economic reopenings in May ocean freight demand came on strong as shippers worked on replenishing inventories. The ongoing results have been port congestion tight container drayage capacity and increased rates. “Blank sailings” in which a scheduled ship is canceled from a route and stronger ocean carrier alliances also have reduced ocean capacity and buoyed rates.

Overall ITM realized a 19.2% gross revenue gain in 2020 expanding to $70 billion. While having a lower growth rate than overall gross revenue due to a tight carrier capacity market net revenue increased a healthy 11.4% to $24.6 billion. Our expectation is for demand and pricing to remain strong in ITM for the remainder of the year.

C.H. Robinson Worldwide’s global forwarding division saw 2020 gross revenue grow 33.2% to $3.1 billion and net revenue increased 17.8% to $629 million. It has been expanding rapidly in ITM via a mix of acquisitions and organic growth. In 2011 it had net revenue of $100 million.

Expeditors International of Washington the largest U.S.-based freight forwarder had a better-than-average 2020 with gross revenue increasing 23.7% to $10.1 billion and net revenue increasing 11% to $2.9 billion. Growth primarily came from airfreight where gross revenue grew a whopping 63% to $4.8 billion from $2.9 billion in 2019.

Apex Logistics International headquartered in Hong Kong has significant operations in the U.S. and is one of the largest China-­U.S. airfreight forwarders. Its airfreight metric tons grew 44% to 750000 in 2020 driving a 53% increase in gross revenue to $2.3 billion. Apex Logistics managed multiple weekly air charters of PPE from China to the U.S. and has burgeoning e-commerce business. It also more than doubled its ocean freight forwarding business which ended 2020 with 190000 20-foot equivalent units.

In late February Kuehne + Nagel announced it was acquiring Apex Logistics for about $1.5 billion. The combination makes Kuehne + Nagel the largest global airfreight forwarder with just more than 2.1 million metric air tons surpassing DHL Supply Chain and Global Forwarding. It also significantly expands Kuehne + Nagel’s Asian 3PL operating network.

Dedicated Contract Carriage

The asset-heavy dedicated contract carriage (DCC) 3PL segment had the second-highest net revenue growth of the four 3PL segments at just 0.3% to $20 billion. Gross revenue declined 2%. The negative effect of COVID made 2020 a volatile and lower-volume year versus 2019 when DCC net revenues grew 12.1%.

Traditional DCC contracts have one- to three-year terms with specific trucking assets being dedicated to customers. This makes DCC contracts much “stickier” than standard shipper-­carrier trucking contracts. A&A’s market research shows dry van trailers being used for 70% of DCC truckloads refrigerated 16% flatbeds 6% and tankers and others 8%. Three-fourths of major DCC providers have dry vans and reefers. Half of major DCC providers have flatbeds. Customer trailers/containers often are used especially for retail operations such as Walmart.

DCC segment leader J.B. Hunt Dedicated Contract Services with 9911 power units in dedicated posted above average net revenue growth of 3.2% to $2.2 billion making its DCC market share 11% on a net revenue basis. It has more than 160 customers and A&A estimates that about half of J.B. Hunt’s dedicated tractors are tandem axle sleepers. About as many are day cabs used in regional operations. A significant part of Hunt’s DCS operations involve direct store delivery. It also has developed a large last-mile delivery network that has significant home-­delivery capabilities.

Penske Logistics helped by its 2020 acquisition of Black Horse Carriers and 2018 acquisition of Epes Transport System has grown into the second-largest dedicated fleet with 6718 power units. Combined DCC revenues are estimated at more than $1 billion.

We expect moderate DCC demand and growth for 2021 as the economy further rebounds. A lot will hinge upon continued strength in contract truckload rates.

Domestic Transportation Management

The non-asset-based domestic transportation management (DTM) segment includes freight brokerage which represents 83% of segment revenues and managed transportation which accounts for 17%. In 2020 3PLs scrambled to find carrier capacity to meet shipper demand. DTM gross revenue increased 9.9% to $91.2 billion but net revenue decreased 1.8% to $13.2 billion as volatility in motor carrier capacity quickly increased spot market rates compressing segment gross margins by 1.7%.

The ongoing digitalization of transactional truckload freight brokerage continues at a rapid pace as more large shippers have built integrations with 3PLs’ transportation management systems for truckload spot-market rate quoting and automated load tendering and booking. In turn about 20 3PLs have built TMS interfaces that provide these shippers instant rate quotes and the ability to complete load tendering and booking through system APIs (application program interfaces). This process automates traditional spot market freight-brokerage sales functions and is increasing shippers’ use of more spot versus contract pricing.

Sales automation for spot market truckload is happening in conjunction with the automation of carrier sales (procurement) functions. Freight brokers are using intelligent capacity-­management systems to digitally match shippers’ loads to carriers based on historical and real-time carrier capacity data analyzed via machine learning algorithms.

This digital freight-matching capability has become a competitive differentiator within the DTM segment as 3PLs look to increase the number of loads or shipments they manage per person per day. Ultimately this automation will put further pressure on freight brokerage gross margins while it should improve overall profitability.

Large companies such as C.H. Robinson TQL XPO Logistics Hub Group and Echo Global Logistics are some of the 3PLs driving industry automation along with the newer tech-first digital freight brokers and DTM market entrants Convoy Transfix and Uber Freight. At this point most of the top freight brokers are strategically looking at ways to digitalize operations while adding value through improved carrier management and customer and carrier experiences.

Value-Added Warehousing and Distribution

Rapid growth in e-commerce fulfillment could not offset the loss of business-to-business-related activity as overall revenues for the value-added warehousing and distribution (VAWD) 3PL segment sagged in 2020 versus its 9% growth 2019. VAWD net revenues declined 1.1% to $35.7 billion.

VAWD 3PLs continue to benefit from growth in retail ­e-commerce business which continues to be the fastest-growing domestic 3PL segment with a compound annual growth rate of 28% since 2017. Many VAWD 3PLs are supporting retail brands’ strategies to manage their own order fulfillment channels and avoid being captive to large e-retailer platforms such as Amazon. Operationally the growth in e-commerce business has meant an expansion in multiclient warehousing and fulfillment operations with many having footprints of less than 100000 square feet.

An ongoing headwind for VAWD 3PLs has been the “Amazon effect.” 3PLs are continuing to see increased competition from Fulfillment by Amazon which controls 60% of the U.S. e-commerce 3PL market. It dramatically has impacted warehouse employee wages and lease rates in key distribution areas such as Plainfield Ind. and California’s Inland Empire. In turn it is driving significant interest from VAWD 3PLs to automate warehouses with autonomous robotic solutions. With some autonomous robots costing less than $500 per month to operate the cost-benefit and positive return on investment are increasing 3PLs’ interest in warehouse robots to support activities such as picking putaway and cycle counting.

West Bromwich Albion have contacted West Midlands Police after Callum Robinson was targeted with racist abuse on social media after his side's win over Chelsea on Saturday.

Robinson and the Baggies inflicted a 5-2 win over 10-man Chelsea coming from behind to pick up a huge win in their bid to defy the odds and beat the drop.

One of the stars of the win for West Brom was Robinson who scored two of his side's five goals at Stamford Bridge but the former Sheffield United man was then targeted by vile abuse on social media.

Following a post on social media celebrating the victory for his side an account - who has a Chelsea player as the profile picture - posted a series of monkey emojis underneath.

Robinson screenshotted the comments and added them to his story with the caption 'smh' which means 'shaking my head'.

It is the latest in a string of incidents as the struggle goes on to protect footballers from such abuse amid countless examples in the Premier League and elsewhere over recent months.

Clubs and players are now highlighting the abuse in a bid to show authorities what is happening and some incidents have been investigated by police.

West Brom confirmed in a statement on Saturday night they had reported the abuse.

""West Bromwich Albion has contacted West Midlands Police to report racist social media posts directed at Callum Robinson following Saturday's 5-2 win over Chelsea"" the statement read.

""The despicable Instagram posts were sent in reply to the Republic of Ireland international after he scored twice in a memorable team performance at Stamford Bridge.

""The club is appalled by the messages and will offer Callum the help and support he may require in response to the incident.

""Albion will continue to confront all forms of discrimination and will assist the authorities with their inquiries seeking the toughest available legal punishment.

""It is deeply disturbing that scoring two goals in a football match can provoke a reaction of this kind.

""There is No Room For Racism. Anywhere.

""Challenge it report it change it.""

There have been calls for accounts to have ID registration so that abusers cannot be anonymous and Arsenal legend Thierry Henry recently quit social media to send a message against the hatred on the platforms.

""There has been an evolution in terms of abuse being reported inside the stadium people became braver. But now we have a new problem the abuse has moved to social media"" said Henry in a statement.

(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

[Ensure you have all the info you need in these unprecedented times. Subscribe now.]

The COVID-19 pandemic has squeezed many years of growth in online sales and e-commerce fulfillment into a single 12-month period.

Confronted with business closures restrictions on large gatherings physical distancing guidelines and the fear of catching the novel coronavirus consumers turned their computers and phones into shopping malls spending $861 billion online with U.S. merchants in 2020 a 44% increase over the prior year according to estimates by Digital Commerce 360.

In fact e-commerce accounted for more than 21% of total retail sales last year up from less than 16% in 2019 the research firm reported. That increase of more than five percentage points far eclipsed previous annual gains in online shopping.

“People are bored sitting at home and have extra money that would have been spent on a vacation” said Cathy Morrow Roberson an industry consultant who heads Logistics Trends & Insights.

They are spending that money on their homes including buying exercise equipment and office furniture and equipment for remote work and they are doing much of that spending online Roberson said.

“What was expected to happen in seven years happened in one year last year” said Kraig Foreman president of eCommerce at DHL Supply Chain Americas.

Westerville Ohio-based DHL Supply Chain ranks No. 7 on the Transport Topics Top 50 list of the largest third-party logistics companies in North America. The contract logistics provider is a business unit of Germany-based Deutsche Post DHL Group.

It wasn’t an easy transition as retailers and logistics providers had to adapt to dramatic changes in the marketplace quickly said Sean Henry CEO and co-founder of Stord an Atlanta-­based supply-chain visibility and e-commerce fulfillment company.

First companies had to reorganize their operations to implement social distancing and other health safety protocols.

“Our operations were not built for social distance” Foreman said. “Before the pandemic you tried to get as much done in as little space as possible because optimizing space is efficient.”

And then they had to deal with massive supply chain disruptions as entire economies slid into limp mode in the initial months of the pandemic while the virus spread. Depending on the business the fulfillment centers had to help clients deal with massive demand as shoppers flocked to stores or started ordering online.

Other logistics companies had clients that were forced to close as lockdowns set in and now wanted to develop ­e-commerce capability quickly.

At the same time some companies found their ability to restock hampered by lengthy delays at the nation’s largest ports a result of the massive amount of inventory coming to U.S. shores.

Along the way they also had to adjust to the general increase in e-commerce demand.

Wilson

“The volume increase we are seeing means that we have to work differently than in the past. Manual operations can’t keep up with the activity” said Malcolm Wilson slated to become CEO of a new global contract logistics company GXO Logistics following its planned spinoff from XPO Logistics later this year. He currently heads XPO’s European operations.

XPO’s split into two separate companies is expected to close in the second half of 2021. XPO will retain its less-than-truckload and freight brokerage business while its logistics segment becomes GXO.

Greenwich Conn.-based XPO ranks No. 2 on the TT Top 50 list of logistics companies prior to the planned spinoff.

Another complicating factor is that the rapid growth in the volume of goods is mirrored by an increasing number of discrete items — including furniture and appliances — being shipped Wilson said.

“We have to work even harder to make our warehouses more efficient” he said. “Consumers don’t want to wait weeks or even days for their product to arrive. Organizations like XPO have to be able to shorten lead times against a bigger volume of orders.”

Logistics and e-commerce fulfillment executives said the pan­demic demonstrated how companies need to rapidly build capabilities to deal with the changing business environment.

Agility is at the top of the list.

Foreman

“People behaving a certain way this afternoon immediately hits the fulfillment supply chain” DHL’s Foreman said.

But agility is not just about making an adjustment at the drop of a hat Stord’s Henry said. It’s also about making intelligent changes based on data and understanding where products need to be for customers.

Through it all companies also have been expanding their reverse logistics operations.

“The number of returns coming back has grown significantly with e-commerce but it is complex taking that stuff back” said Greg West C.H. Robinson Worldwide’s vice president of less-than-truckload and head of its consolidation centers.

For returns companies have to consider the value of the product and the cost of taking it back. Much of it gets liquidated West said. Depending on the item many retailers simply tell the consumer to keep it and credit them for the cost.

As they adjusted to changing demand and supply chain configurations many companies found themselves constrained by their logistics partners’ capacity and technology limits such as their order management systems.

“If you’re a shipper and all of a sudden you can’t get your goods to market it’s a big wake-up call” West said.

That’s why companies such as C.H. Robinson and Stord are investing in both capacity and technology that can help clients deal with sudden bottlenecks.

C.H. Robinson acquired Prime Distribution Services from Roadrunner Transportation Systems Inc. for $225 million in cash just as the pandemic was spreading into the United States last year. Prime offers a suite of distribution fulfillment and inventory management services and plugged a gap in C.H. Robinson’s operations.

“You have to bring transportation and warehousing together. It’s hard to hit the requirements of large retailers if you can’t ­marry that business” West said.

Stord a 5-year-old startup wants to help retailers navigate rapidly shifting consumer shopping patterns by offering a flexible array of logistics and fulfillment services primarily by leasing warehouse space distributed nationally. ­Henry said such an approach extracts brands from needing to build warehouses across the country to meet consumer expectations for rapid delivery.

“Our overall mission is to be a shipper’s cloud supply chain platform — both the physical logistics network and the software to­gether in one platform” Henry said.

He said much of the industry is gravitating in that direction as retailers work to get the correct amount of inventory as close to consumers as possible. The Stord system allows shippers to use data to rebalance goods nationally and increase shipping speed.

C.H. Robinson and others also are offering demand planning and forecasting tools.

Shippers are tackling the pandemic-­driven boom in e-commerce with multiple strategies XPO’s Wilson said.

“We have customers that simply want XPO to solve a problem. They will give us the data and we will design a supply chain for them and operate a warehouse” he said.

But others want to outsource warehousing because they don’t want to distract from their core businesses Wilson said.

Regardless of the approach the use of technology — both hardware and software — is helping the industry cope with the ­e-commerce surge.

“You are seeing a lot of retailers embracing cloud technology so that they can know where their inventory is in real time” said Roberson of Logistics Trends & Insights.

That enables them to better position inventory and connects the middle mile with the last mile in delivery service.

The past holiday season de­monstrated why that capability is essential Roberson said. It speeds delivery to shoppers and gives them accurate tracking information which eases con­sumer concerns.

Automated hardware adoption also is accelerating.

XPO for one has been deploying automation and robotics in its warehouses to boost productivity.

But that creates a challenge for XPO — to design warehouses that meld both human labor and automation. Robots can’t yet gift wrap a package or take over all goods-picking operations to fulfill an order Wilson said.

All of the effort the logistics industry is making now to deal with the e-commerce surge will pay off for years to come executives said.

“A lot of people won’t go back to how they used to shop” Wilson said. “They will be quite happy shopping online and not leaving their homes.”

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Scorpio Tankers is -12% which ranks worse than 70% of the companies in Oil & Gas industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 31.3% which ranks better than 81% of the companies in Oil & Gas industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Scorpio Tankers's return on invested capital is 4.91 and its cost of capital is 5.97. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Scorpio Tankers is shown below:

The connection between fast food restaurants and green living seems like a complete contradiction. Amid Styrofoam cups and packaging plastic lids cardboard holders and genetically modified vegetables and inorganic meat the industry is not particularly environmentally friendly. But as going green becomes more of an attractive image for customers many companies are moving towards greener options that are less harmful to the environment.

There is now real progress towards greener alternatives in the fast food industry.

Environmentally-Conscious Packaging

Green packaging is the new “it” factor as fast food chains are beginning to adapt to greener friendly packaging alternatives. It’s an impressive move away from the customary environmentally damaging use of petroleum-based Styrofoam containers a product which fast food restaurants have been using for the past few dozen years by the billions.

With affordable alternatives fast food and regular restaurants now have great replacement options available – and they are taking advantage of these green advances in packaging. These compostable biodegradable and recyclable packaging work just as well as their more harmful counterparts being oven microwave and freezer safe while remaining ecologically-safe.

Ironically it’s the most unexpected fast food chains that are emerging as leaders in the green fast food movement. For the past two years big chains like McDonalds and Starbucks are placing a central focus on changing their packaging improving their sourcing and lobbying the FDA to increase the amount of recycled fibers allows in fast food packaging.

The movement is meant to decrease their carbon footprint waste and of course cut costs.

Organic Food

The famous Chipotle restaurant was the first ground-breaking big fast food chain to abide their food by organic standards – using only natural meats hormone-free chicken and organic beans. They have never used animal meat with growth hormones and turned this into a selling point to their customers creating their famous slogan “Food with Integrity”.

Smaller chains like Le Pain Quotidien and EVOs and Pizza Fusion are taking their commitment to using organic ingredients very seriously. Le Pain Quotidien is baking their products with only organic and local ingredients while Pizza Fusion used the green movement to their marketing advantage claiming to be “Saving the Planet One Pizza at a Time”.

All their pizzas are made with the finest organic ingredients packaged in compostable boxes and delivered to your home in a hybrid vehicle – green all the way!

Reducing Carbon Footprint

Some fast food restaurants known for their ‘organic’ choices are adapting to a greener alternatives to cut down on carbon footprint. Some like Chipotle are actively working at reducing their carbon footprint. Their going green process has started by using solar cells hyper-efficient plumbing and biodegradable utensils. New restaurants set up in the country are built with elements of green design in mind.

Others have installed recycling bins and segregated trash to ensure that materials and recyclables are disposed of properly. Starbucks itself is now mandating that all their cups be made from recyclable materials and be recyclable on their own. They too are using green building designs for their new stores and are now diversifying their purchases by buying fair trade coffee.

McDonalds has established a waste diversion program and have gone so far so as to refuse to source beef from locations causing rainforest degradation. Subway is making other moves towards become a green-friendly company as well by improving their energy efficiency in transport and using recycled material in the construction of new chains.

Finding the Profit in Going Green

One of the most impressive advancements in this green movement is the fact that fast food chains are taking advantage of environmentally friendly alternatives to cut costs & increase profit.

Recently Starbucks started offering a great deal to its customers: reusable cups sold for $1 apiece. The cups last for about a month cut down on the company’s waste and trash hauling costs and offer environmentally conscious customers an affordable way to lower their carbon footprint. To push sales on the reusable cups customers save 10 cents on each refill.

Other companies are following on this plan as well offering reusable mugs bowls or vessels. Just Salad a salad restaurant chain is offering their clients reusable salad bowls. When customers use their bowl they get free toppings in their salads – a great marketing & environmental ploy to decrease the unnecessary expenditure of one-time use salad bowls.

Bob’s a Brazilian fast food company has taken a more creative approach that serves a great marketing purpose. Their burgers are wrapped in the ultimate recyclable wrapping: edible rice-based paper. Its innovative concepts like these that are inspiring restaurants towards environmental alternatives.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldGJlYXQuY29tL29yaWdpbmFscy9wZXRjby1pcy1hbi1hdHRyYWN0aXZlLWJ1eWluZy1vcHBvcnR1bml0eS1oZXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Petco is an Attractive Buying Opportunity Here,"Pet products and services retailer Petco Health and Wellness Company NASDAQ: WOOF shares recently went public on Jan. 14 2021 through an initial public offering (IPO). The stock is trading well below it’s $31.08 highs on IPO day and is beginning to look tasty at these levels. As geographies get past the pandemic with accelerating COVID vaccinations  Petco is appearing more like a value stock with re-opening tailwinds thanks to brick-and-mortar stores and veterinary services that require live physical engagement. The pandemic created a surge in pet ownership along with all the expenses and products needed to keep them healthy. Online pet care retailers like Chewy NASDAQ: CHWY were strong pandemic benefactors but may see sales migrate to brick and mortar players. Petco has over 1500 physical stores providing pet care products along with grooming veterinary and insurance services to over 21 million customers. COVID created over 3 million new pets in 2020 pushing the demand for premium products and services. Prudent investors seeking exposure can monitor for opportunistic pullback entry levels to consider building a position in shares of Petco.

Petco CEO Ron Coughlin set the tone “We exited 2020 with momentum delivering fourth-quarter revenue growth of 16% above our expectations a 17% comparable-store sales or comp sales 90% plus digital growth almost a million new customers into the franchise and 13% adjusted EBITDA growth.” He noted how COVID provided strong tailwinds of “millions of new pets-oriented homes in the past 12 months” generating predictable annual spend for several years. CEO Coughlin noted how 50% of pet owners simply want a one-stop shop for their pet care needs which plays to the core strength of the Company especially as it bolsters omnichannel engagement and transactions. The Company launched 400 more shipment store and curbside pickup locations.

Growth Drivers

The pandemic created more pet owners (over 3 million new pets in 2020) and Petco plans to open up to 70 new veterinary hospitals annually to meet the demand. Full-service locations offer grooming training and veterinary services generating 91% more sales than regular locations. Full-service locations are the strongest growth drivers indicating 50% YoY growth further bolstered by omni-channel going from four transactions to 23 annually. The Company owns PupBox a Chewy-like competitor that optimizes pet care supplies deliveries connecting customers to the Petco eco-system. The annual spend on pet care has been increasing 4% annually for years and expended to accelerate as analysts expect that figure to rise up to 7% driven by the migration to premium products. CEO Coughlin summed it up “All-in-all a pet has historically been a great high growth category to accelerate in 2020 from COVID tailwinds and that creates an annuity for many years to come.”

By Ridwan Abbas

We spoke to six companies at the forefront of sustainable insurance to understand how climate change is influencing their overall corporate strategy. Below are excerpts from responses from AXA Chubb Manulife Munich Re Swiss Re and Tokio Marine.

Q: How does climate change influence strategy and decision-making in your organisation?

AXA chief risk officer Renaud Guidée: For several years AXA has been developing an ambitious climate strategy and is acting for change on multiple fronts. That includes understanding and measuring our impact better increasing transparency and more broadly consolidating a leadership position to align with the 1.5°C warming target of the Paris Agreement by 2050. For several years AXA has been developing an ambitious climate strategy and is acting for change on multiple fronts. That includes understanding and measuring our impact better increasing transparency and more broadly consolidating a leadership position to align with the 1.5°C warming target of the Paris Agreement by 2050.

Our current strategy building on over five years of progress leverages all of our assets and expertise: Investments underwriting research and outreach.

Chubb spokesperson: We recognise that a changing climate affects everyone — customers employees shareholders business partners and the communities we serve. We take concrete action after careful evaluation of risks and opportunities pertaining to climate change. The most important strategy components influenced by climate change are business opportunities risk mitigation and company operations.

Manulife global chief sustainability officer Sarah Chapman: Manulife has been a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since November 2017 publishing its first disclosure aligned with the TCFD in 2019 and is committed to adopting and aligning its disclosures to the TCFD recommendations. Manulife has been a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since November 2017 publishing its first disclosure aligned with the TCFD in 2019 and is committed to adopting and aligning its disclosures to the TCFD recommendations.

We made history in 2018 as the first insurer to issue a green bond in Canada which followed Manulife’s achievement as the first life insurer globally to offer a green bond in 2017. The environmental benefit of C$1bn of general account’s low-carbon investments that underpin two MFC green bond issuances amount to 150000+ tons of carbon dioxide avoidance.

Munich Re chief climate and geo scientist Ernst Rauch: Munich Re has traditionally focused on covering peak risks associated with natural disasters; that is why we have deep expertise and an intimate understanding of climate change. We carefully observe and analyse these facts and data to assess risks and their evolution over time and then price adequately based on this data.

Munich Re is supporting the target of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to below 2°C and has a dedicated climate-change strategy on the asset and liability side of the balance sheet as well as with its own emissions.

Swiss Re chief risk officer reinsurance Asia Karen Tan: We have a group sustainability strategy that aims to create long-term value for both our business and society by evolving our business towards a low-carbon economy. This strategy is embedded throughout our re(insurance) value chain covering both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet and also includes operations and dialogues with our stakeholders for example with clients and regulators.

This strategy is embedded throughout our re(insurance) value chain covering both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet and also includes operations and dialogues with our stakeholders for example with clients and regulators.

Last year we made important and ambitious commitments to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions for our whole business by 2050 and net zero in our own operations by 2030. Swiss Re has also recently announced an increase in internal carbon levy. We are the first multinational company to put a triple-digit price on both direct and indirect operational emissions.

Tokio Marine spokesperson: The increasing severity of natural disasters caused by climate change is one factor behind deteriorating earnings from fire insurance in particular owing to the rising number of claims payments. If we can be an early mover in supporting the growing renewable energy sector we will be well placed to enhance our reputation and secure opportunities to cultivate the market.

Q: To what extent are you incorporating climate risk in your underwriting and/or new product design?

AXA: Sustainability and more specifically climate risk has been included in our underwriting practices for years already for example through exclusions (coal tobacco oil sands). More recently on the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement CEO Thomas Buberl called for the creation of a ‘Net-Zero Insurance Underwriting Alliance’ (NZUA) to extend our commitment collectively to climate neutrality to our insurance activities.

The thinking of the NZUA goes to the very heart of the insurance business and has the potential to transform the way we approach risk profoundly. The ambition of the alliance is also to prepare the insurance industry to accompany the green transition. It’s all part of the road to COP26.

Chubb: For several years Chubb has offered a suite of coverages through the specialised clean tech industry insurance programme. We also support transitional efforts through specialised products such as our green building restoration coverages. We will continue developing products and services as the opportunities and need arise.

Munich Re: The insurance industry has to identify the effects and long-term trends of an increasing influence of climate change over time quantify it and subsequently consider risk-adequate pricing. In the interest of facilitating adaptation to the unavoidable adverse impacts from climate change and adopting climate-friendly technologies Munich Re has been driving forward initiatives on loss minimisation and prevention.

We also develop new business from covering risks in the renewable energy sector where we already enjoy a leading position in performance covers for wind power photovoltaics and battery storage.

Swiss Re: We have a framework for monitoring sustainability risks including those related to climate change. The framework called sustainable business risk framework is supported by an escalation mechanism and an online tool which is used by underwriters and asset managers to assess sustainability risks (including the climate risk) of their proposed transactions. In addition our in-house natural catastrophe models include rapid feedback loops to incorporate learnings post-event and latest scientific information in our view of risk to better inform underwriting decisions.

Tokio Marine: We incorporate recent climate risk when we underwrite and determine premiums while we also plan to develop new products and services based on clients’ needs related to climate risk.

Q: How can life insurers address the impact of climate change?

Manulife: The good news is that many life insurers globally have already been contributing to the transition to the low-carbon economy. Specifically and uniquely for Manulife our agriculture and timber business on the asset management side is one of the largest natural resource asset managers for institutional investors. Over the past five years John Hancock Natural Resources Group-managed forests and farms have removed an average of 3.1m tons of CO2 from the atmosphere annually – enough to take roughly 670000 passenger vehicles off the road for a year.

We have a unique role to play in providing natural-climate solutions and driving the broader ESG agenda across our operations and more importantly our investments.

Q: How are you helping clients mitigate climate risk?

AXA: We are one of the only global insurers to have developed our own internal natural catastrophe modelling with massive R&D investment and strong links to academia. Our AXA XL Risk Consulting franchise delivers services which include infrastructure reinforcement and warning systems. AXA climate also offers innovative solutions to enable adaptation to climate change through parametric insurance for faster recovery real-time protection services and resilience-building consulting and adaptation services.

Chubb: Chubb’s more than 600 risk engineers work with our commercial and consumer clients to moderate the risks from climate change perils and make them more resilient. The company brings deep technical knowledge to this work from providing guidance on construction standards wildfire land management and coastal protection to the development of lithium battery storage systems.

Another example: Chubb’s green property insurance policy provides coverage for commercial businesses that desire to rebuild to a ‘greener’ standard in the event of a loss to an existing building.

Munich Re: Being one of the leading reinsurance companies globally Munich Re supports its clients with its knowledge and data analysis through the use of different tools. One example is our risk intelligence suite which shows essential information on today’s hazards and climate projections to improve clients’ risk portfolios.

Swiss Re: Some recent examples of our work in Asia based on our sustainability principles include an index-based rice insurance product in Vietnam using radar-based remote sensing technology for yield data. This project scored a few firsts for us – it is the first time that we integrated satellite technology into a public insurance scheme and it is also the first index-based rice insurance product adopted in a public scheme in ASEAN. In Nagaland India we have also partnered with a direct insurer (Tata AIG General Insurance) to provide India’s first parametric Nat CAT insurance scheme for a state.

Ultimately the insurability of climate risks is highly dependent on the preventive measures and other actions such as socioeconomic policies zoning laws and geographic planning. As such we work closely with governments on climate-adaptation strategies by sharing with them underlying climate risks and costs of adaptation measures.

Tokio Marine: Some examples of our solutions include:

Business continuity plan (BCP) consulting service: We support our corporate clients to formulate BCP as well as employee training so that they can mitigate the impact to their business in times of natural disaster and recover quickly. NADIAct: It is a GIS platform which supports clients to monitor disaster information of various locations and by utilising alert mail sent from NADIAct clients can take appropriate initial action when necessary. Mobile agent (app): We send personalised videos regarding the preparation for a natural disaster such as typhoon and send messages related to disaster prevention/evacuation via mobile app to give a heads up to our client.

Q: Do you incorporate sustainability into your ERM approach and what are some of the challenges posed if any?

AXA: We take ESG considerations into account in every aspect of our risk management process. This integration of sustainability requires a multidisciplinary approach involving many teams – risk management actuarial underwriting risk modelling investments to name a few. This is an area in which we need to develop our thinking further especially with regard to scenario analysis and stress tests. One of the big challenges we face is the availability of reliable data which is required to feed into climate models and scenarios.

Chubb: Because the potential effects of climate change present a significant risk to Chubb analysis thereof has been integrated into our overall enterprise risk management (ERM) process. For example in our investment portfolio we have taken action to reduce our fixed income investment exposure to municipalities and states prone to natural catastrophes. In working with Chubb’s product boards and investment team the ERM function also stress tests the impact of climate change on Chubb’s balance sheet liquidity and operations to ensure resiliency in light of intensifying natural catastrophes activity.

Manulife: We have begun to integrate climate risk into some of our internal stress testing and scenario analysis activities which includes drawing from emerging guidance on scenario analysis to inform things like our capital adequacy and impacts on our investment portfolios. At the same time we are closely monitoring and actively participating in industry and regulatory forums to collaboratively explore best practices and tools.

Swiss Re: Our sustainable business risk framework is used as a basis to identify sustainability risks in our underwriting and asset portfolios. In addition we have a well-established and robust emerging risk identification process. It is an annual exercise driven by our group risk management team in Switzerland with regional focus and input from our experts as well as senior management.

One of the challenges is finding the right balance between developing projections of the financial risk of climate change over a long-time horizon while at the same time ensuring that today’s risk view is comprehensive. Getting today’s risk view right is important as it forms the point of reference upon which all future climate scenarios are premised. This requires careful management of resources and prioritising risks that are material for the business.

Beyond underwriting Swiss Re is committed to responsible investing and integrates ESG criteria consistently across its entire investment portfolio.

Tokio Marine: We see climate-related risk such as major wind and flood disasters as one of the material risks and evaluate capital adequacy through a quantitative risk management process. In future we anticipate climate-related risk will increase and further intensify so it is important to take appropriate actions.

Q: What will the talent implication be as the insurance industry moves towards a more ‘green’ footing?

AXA: It’s a rapidly evolving space. We value people with an open mind-set and are flexible in terms of industry and technical background. There is an opportunity for new skillsets to come into financial services. We are also seeing strong interest from our staff. Training is part of our climate strategy.

Manulife: Life insurance products are long-term commitments with contracts that can last a lifetime. It is therefore critical that our product professionals and actuaries understand sustainability and the impact climate risk can have on our products including mortality morbidity investment and other risks.

Munich Re: In the 1970s Munich Re started to build a solid knowledge base with diverse experts in fields like meteorology climate physics floods earthquakes and statistics. Today we have many colleagues with such unique expertise in locations worldwide working on analysing and modelling Nat CAT risks. With our business development activities with new low emissions technologies we are also looking for outstanding talents with expertise in this high-tech domain.

Swiss Re: We incorporate sustainability into everything we do. We are building this awareness and innovation in our people and we also work with external partners to test and learn before we scale and replicate through our global footprint. We are doing what we can to lend our skills and knowledge as well as grow the talent pool in this area but like everyone else in the industry we still see a talent gap in this space. To develop a pipeline of strong green finance talent we believe that it needs to be a private-public partnership effort.

In Asia we are already seeing some positive developments in this direction. For instance the Monetary Authority of Singapore launched its first centre of excellence to drive Asia-focused green finance research and talent development.

Lastly as sustainability is a global topic we think that it is important to leverage expertise and talent across markets. We think that cross-functional collaboration within the company between teams in different regions for example Europe and Asia would help in developing and strengthening local expertise in markets with larger expertise gaps.

(KOLN) - Lincoln Fire and Rescue responded to a fire at New Covenant Community Church on Saturday.

According to LFR a call for smoke showing from the church came in just before 3 a.m. When crews arrived they reported fire into the roof.

LFR said a lightning strike is suspected but not confirmed to be the cause of the fire.

According to the fire inspector’s initial estimate the fire caused $1.5 million in damage to the building with a large amount of the damage up in-between the roof and the ceiling.

A spokesperson for the church said on social media that the church will hold a gathering on Sunday in the front parking lot at 10:30 a.m. for worship and prayer. Any additional service and programming has been cancelled. The spokesperson also asked that people avoid going inside the church for the time being due to multiple hazards.

Representatives of the church have already met with insurance and a crew is on site to begin clean-up and restoration.

This incident is still under investigation. Stay connected to 1011now.com for the latest updates.

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said.

He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

WEST COLUMBIA S.C. — Members of the Suburban Baptist Church in West Columbia are spreading a message of love after their building was vandalized on Friday.

Sunday's sermon from Suburban Baptist Church Associate Pastor Elijah Smalls was a message of forgiveness and love to the people who spray-painted parts of the church's exterior and ministry home across the street.

""The same way they spray-painted our door it'll be the same door that will open up to show them love"" he says.

The graffiti ranged from messages such as ""Save Gaza"" and ""Welcome to Hell"" to various obscene depictions. West Columbia District 5 Councilman Mickey Pringle said he was heartbroken to see this happen to a staple in the community.

""I was totally shocked because Suburban has been a part of this community forever and all of the good things they do; serving the people of this community. I was like 'Who would even do something like that"" he says.

Sunday was a different scene with the doors painted white and the church sign covered by a poster board. Pastor Tracy Mcgee said a member of the West Columbia Police Department came to their aid and provided the temporary fixes.

""He called and he said 'I got to get those doors with the pornography on them painted; you can't walk through church doors like that'"" McGee said. ""We're blessed; we have a professional crew coming out the early part of next week. We had an outside individual that really wanted to pay for that. The one that wanted to do that is a Palestinian-American.”

According to West Columbia Mayor Tem Miles who was sitting in a pew during Sunday’s service the city is working to find those responsible. He adds that the vandals also damaged other parts of the neighborhood.

“Some homes around here were vandalized; some public property street signs were vandalized” he said. ""We got folks who are working to figure out who it is within our community or outside of our community; came here and did these things. We're going to make sure they receive the attention they deserve.""

Mayor Miles said the city is still looking for the suspects and had no updates on their investigation.

During Sunday's sermon Pastor McGee spent nearly 30 minutes addressing the crime and reminding the church about grace but also consequences.

""God never said 'I'll take the circumstances away.' He simply said 'I will still love you and I can forgive you of your sins but He paid a price"" McGee said.

Pastor McGee said the community response has been overwhelming with calls from around the country.

""From Canada Texas all over the Carolinas - calling and pledging and wanting to do what they can do for the church"" he said. ""We're a very humble church a very small church so God has sat there and said 'I've got you; I've got you covered.""

Councilman Pringle said he hopes this will bring West Columbia together.

""Pastor Tracy he's been a part of this community for a long time and hopefully everybody will rally to their support and give them the support they need"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzbXYuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvd29tYW4tY2hpbGQtbmVhcmx5LWNhcmphY2tlZC10cnlpbmctYXR0ZW5kLWNodXJjaC_SAWFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c212LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA2L3dvbWFuLWNoaWxkLW5lYXJseS1jYXJqYWNrZWQtdHJ5aW5nLWF0dGVuZC1jaHVyY2gvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman child nearly carjacked trying to attend church,"NASHVILLE Tenn. (WSMV) - Officers with the Metro Nashville Police Department arrested a man after he allegedly tried to carjack a woman who had just arrived at church on Sunday morning in Madison.

According to the arrest affidavit a woman and her 3-year-old son were parked outside the Abundant Life Living Word Church on Sunday morning around 10:15 a.m. when 30-year-old Javaunn Brown approached from the street. The woman said the man made small talk about the apartments across the street before demanding she give him her car keys the affidavit states.

The woman told officers she immediately started calling for help. Brown then jumped in the back seat and began pulling her son out of the car when church staff came outside and confronted him according to the affidavit. Brown began threatening to blow up the church and said he worked for the president before running away the affidavit states.

When officers arrived at the church on Cheyenne Blvd. they received a burglary call from the Nashville Korean Seventh-Day Adventist Church next door. They responded and found Brown getting into one of the Korean church’s vans the affidavit states. Brown took off running into the woodline with officers giving chase until he broke a window at an unoccupied house for sale on Gilead Court police said.

After receiving permission from the realty company to enter the house SWAT agents found Brown hiding in the attic and took him into custody.

Brown was booked on Sunday and charged with attempted carjacking attempted especially aggravated kidnapping and evading arrest. He remains in custody on a $71500 bond.

This Sunday the lot is empty. Still people that go here did meet but instead of meeting up for a sermon they went out to serve the community all across Jefferson County.

Austin Johnson is in the kitchen of a fire station in Watertown pulling pork.

Johnson and his team put a BBQ together for city firefighters. He says serving is something we should all put into practice.

“We are led to serve just like Jesus served us as he walked on this earth and so we want to be like Jesus and do what Jesus does and one of those big things is serving and serving your community and helping others” said Johnson.

After a quick prayer it was time to dig in. The church team made enough food for both the day and night side shifts at the fire hall.

“It’s been fantastic to see some people in the community come in the food has been awesome we had great BBQ” said Watertown City Firefighter Chad Crosby.

Kids were also part of this team and got to interact with the fire engines.

Crosby says what he appreciated the most:

“For coming in and spending their time with us the food was wonderful met some great people heard some cool stories people as far way as Africa Alaska from California from Texas.”

Around 15 groups like this one served Jefferson County throughout the weekend at places like homes schools and fire stations.

Tak hanya Sjahrir Kota Medan juga punya arti lebih untuk Pierre Tendean. Setelah lulus dari Akademi Teknik Angkatan Darat (Atekad) di Bandung Pierre hijrah ke Medan pada penghujung 1962. Ia bertugas dalam satuan Batalion Zeni Tempur 1 Daerah Militer II/Bukit Barisan.

Seorang gadis keturunan Jawa yang tinggal di Medan Nurindah Rukmini Chamim mampu menggaet hati Pierre. Mimin begitu nama panggilannya menurut Abie Besman dkk dalam Sang Patriot: Kisah Seorang Pahlawan Revolusi (2019) dikenal Pierre saat ia dan beberapa koleganya mengunjungi rumahnya. Sejak perkenalan pertama ia rajin berkunjung ke rumah keluarga Chamim. Perkenalan pertama rupanya langsung membuat Pierre jatuh cinta.

Disebutkan di dalam buku Sang Patriot Pierre dan Rukmini terpaut usia delapan tahun. Sewaktu berkenalan Rukmini masih duduk di bangku SMA berusia 16 tahun. Sementara Pierre berusia 24 tahun.

Rukmini adalah anak sulung Raden Chamim Rijo Siswopranoto—seorang wiraswasta terpandang di Sumatera Utara. Keluarga besarnya termasuk dalam Barisan Muhammadiyah Kota Medan dan Yogyakarta. Keluarga ini dikenal sebagai penganut Islam yang taat.



“Saat Pierre tengah merindukan suasana kampung halaman di Semarang atau ketika kangen masakan khas Jawa buatan ibunya kerinduan itu sedikit terobati dengan kehadiran Rukmini berserta keluarganya” tulis Ahmad Nowmenta Putra dan Agus Lisna dalam Jejak Sang Ajudan: Sebuah Biografi Pierre Tendean (2018).



“Kelihaian Mimin dan keluarga dalam meracik masakan Jawa yang memanjakan lidah Pierre merupakan elemen penting dalam kehidupan Pierre kala merantau di Medan.”



Selama di Medan Pierre kerap surat menyurat dengan keluarganya di Semarang. Dalam salah satu suratnya ke kakaknya Mitzi Farre Tendean ia mengaku sudah ketemu jodoh. Mitzi kemudian menasihati Pierre. “Pierre kalau orang mau berumah tangga yang terpenting adalah restu dari orang tua” kata Mitzi seperti diungkap Masykuri dalam buku Pierre Tendean (1983).



Hanya enam bulan Pierre di Medan. Ia dan beberapa rekannya dipanggil ke Bogor pada akhir Juni 1963 untuk ikut pelatihan di Pusat Pendidikan Intelijen (Pusdikintel) TNI Angkatan Darat. Usai lulus Pierre yang berpangkat letnan dua itu ditugaskan memimpin kelompok sukarelawan yang akan mengadakan penyusupan ke daerah Malaysia.



Kala itu Indonesia tengah melakukan konfrontasi dengan Malaysia. Ketegangan ini bermula ketika Sukarno menolak pembentukan Federasi Malaysia pada awal 1963 yang disebutnya sebagai boneka Inggris. Dalam konfrontasi ini dilakukan Operasi Dwikora. Pierre bertugas sebagai mata-mata. Ia diperbantukan kepada Dinas Pusat Intelijen Angkatan Darat (DPIAD) yang bermarkas di Selat Panjang Riau.



Lantaran anak laki-laki satu-satunya di keluarga ibu Pierre Maria Elisabeth Cornet khawatir nyawa anaknya melayang dalam tugas spionase. Maria yang kebetulan kawan baik mertua Menteri Kordinator Pertahanan dan Keamanan/Kepala Staf Angkatan Bersenjata (Menhankam/KSAB) Jenderal Abdul Haris Nasution memohon kepada Nasution untuk menarik Pierre dari garis depan.



Masykuri menulis permohonan itu dikabulkan. Pierre kemudian ditarik ke Jakarta dan pada 15 April 1965 pangkatnya dinaikkan menjadi letnan satu. Ia diberi tugas baru: menjadi ajudan Nasution.



Tragedi berdarah memisahkan Pierre-Rukmini





Long distance relationship antara Pierre dan Rukmini terus berjalan. Mereka kerap berkirim surat. Kota Medan menjadi tempatnya berkunjung ketika ada kesempatan cuti tugas selain kampung halamannya di Semarang. Menurut Abie Besman dkk pada September 1964 Pierre menyempatkan terbang ke Medan untuk menghadiri ulang tahun Rukmini yang ke-17.



Masykuri menulis pada 31 Juni 1965 Pierre mendampingi Nasution ke Medan. Kesempatan bertandang di Kota Melayu Deli dimanfaatkan Pierre mengunjungi kekasihnya.



Sebelum bertolak kembali ke Jakarta Pierre mengadakan pertemuan khusus dengan keluarga Chamim. Ahmad dan Agus menulis Pierre dan keluarga Chamim menentukan tanggal pernikahan.

Meski begitu masih ada tembok besar yang menghadang cinta mereka: perbedaan agama. Menurut Abie Besman dkk Rukmini meragukan kelanjutan hubungannya dengan Pierre. Ia hanya bersedia melanjutkan hubungan ke tahap serius dengan pemuda yang punya keyakinan sama.

Dalam benak Pierre juga berkecamuk masalah itu. Masing-masing sukar melepas keyakinannya. Di sisi lain ada kode etik TNI yang tak mengizinkan Pierre menikah berbeda agama. Namun Pierre tak ragu. Ia jalan terus.

Keyakinan Pierre keluarga besarnya di Semarang bakal menerima calon istrinya itu bertambah besar setelah melihat hubungan cinta beda agama juga terjadi pada adiknya Rooswidiati.

Roos menjalin hubungan dengan seorang pengusaha asal Bugis bernama Muhammad Jusuf Razak. Hubungan itu berlanjut ke tahap yang lebih serius setelah ayah Pierre A.L. Tendean memberikan lampu hijau.

Pada 2 Juli 1965 pernikahan Roos dan Razak berlangsung di Semarang. Sebelumnya Roos memilih mengikuti keyakinan Razak.

Tak ada yang menyangka acara kumpul keluarga besar di Semarang itu menjadi yang terakhir bagi Pierre. Menurut Ahmad dan Agus dua hari sebelum diculik Pierre sempat mengungkapkan niatnya menikah dengan Rukmini kepada iparnya Razak.

Masykuri dalam bukunya menjabarkan dua versi penculikan Pierre. Menurutnya pada 1 Oktober 1965 sekitar pukul 04.00 WIB Nasution dan istrinya belum tidur karena diganggu nyamuk. Saat itu empat truk yang memuat orang-orang berpakaian Tjakrabirawa dan satuan lain berpakaian loreng datang ke kediamannya di Jalan Teuku Umar Jakarta Pusat.

Setelah menyergap penjaga rumah Nasution pasukan itu masuk ke dalam. Istri Nasution melihat seorang siap menembak kemudian ia mengunci pintu kamar. Nasution membuka pintu dan tiga orang menembak. Pintu kamar ditutup lagi.

Anak Nasution Ade Irma Suryani tertembak saat dibawa adik perempuan Nasution Mardiah untuk diselamatkan dari kamar itu. Nasution berhasil lolos ke luar kamar diantar istrinya menuju kamar mandi lalu melompat melewati tembok.

Akibat suara tembakan Pierre yang tidur di paviliun terbangun. Ia kemudian mengisi senjatanya dengan peluru dan keluar. Namun baru lima meter di muka paviliun Pierre ditangkap gerombolan penculik. Beberapa orang anggota pasukan penculik menyatakan ia Nasution.

Versi kedua yang ditulis Masykuri Pierre yang tidur di paviliun terbangun karena mendengar rentetan tembakan di kamar Nasution pada 1 Oktober 1965 menjelang subuh. Tembakan itu mengenai Ade Irma Suryani.

Pierre bergegas bangun dan lari menuju ruang depan. Nasution berhasil lolos dengan meloncati tembok menuju pekarangan tetangganya. Pierre kemudian kepergok anggota penculik. Ketika ditanya Pierre menjawab dirinya ajudan Nasution. Akan tetapi kata “ajudan” yang disebut Pierre tak terdengar sehingga mereka menganggap ia adalah Nasution.

Beberapa tahun kemudian salah culik itu diragukan beberapa pihak. “Kalau tentara Istana pastilah kenal betul wajah Nasution oleh karena Nasution sebagai KSAB hampir tiap hari bolak-balik ke Istana menemui Bung Karno” tulis buku Ada Apa di Balik Soeharto dan Jenderal AH Nasution (1998).

Selain Pierre gerombolan penculik membawa tiga perwira yang masih hidup yakni Letjen Siswondo Parman Mayjen Sutoyo Siswomiharjo dan Letjen R. Suprapto serta tiga perwira yang sudah meninggal yakni Jenderal Ahmad Yani Mayjen Donald Isaac Panjaitan dan Letjen Mas Tirtodarmo Haryono ke Lubang Buaya.

Di Lubang Buaya menurut John Roosa dalam Dalih Pembunuhan Massal: Gerakan 30 September dan Kudeta Suharto (2006) perwira yang masih hidup tewas ditembak. Lalu jenazah mereka dilempar ke dalam sumur mati.





“Siapa tepatnya yang membunuh para perwira itu masih belum diketahui. Penuturan rezim Suharto bahwa ketujuh perwira itu disiksa dan disayat-sayat oleh massa pendukung PKI yang kegirangan sementara perempuan-perempuan dari Gerwani menari-nari telanjang merupakan rekayasa absurd bikinan para ahli perang urat saraf” tulis John Roosa.

Rencana Pierre menikah pun kandas. Mirisnya maksud keluarga Chamim untuk menikahkan Pierre dan Rukmini baru diketahui keluarga besar setelah Pierre gugur.

“Keluarga Chamim mengirim telegram yang menyebut akan menikahkan Rukmini dengan Pierre pada 21 November 1965” tulis Ahmad dan Agus.

Rukmini hadir dalam perayaan Hari Kesaktian Pancasila pada 1967 di Lubang Buaya. Ia sempat dipeluk Bung Karno. Pada 1972 Mimin menikah dengan seorang karyawan bank. Ia lalu dikaruniai tiga orang anak.

“Ibu Rukmini meninggal sekitar Juli 2019” ujar Ahmad Nowmenta Putra salah seorang penulis buku Jejak Sang Ajudan saat dihubungi Kamis (1/4)."

Andre Cisco NFL Draft Profile

In every NFL Draft there is a player that will slide because of an unfortunate injury. In 2013 it was South Carolina running back Marcus Lattimore. It could be argued that Tua Tagovailoa would have gone higher in last year’s draft if it weren’t for concerns about his devastating hip injury.

This year Syracuse safety Andre Cisco has the potential to be the most talented player to fall in the 2021 NFL Draft due to an unfortunate injury. Before tearing his ACL in a pre-game collision earlier this season the Syracuse safety was amongst the best and arguably the most ball-hawking safety in college football. Cisco’s status for his rookie season in the NFL is still unclear but if he is able to overcome injuries it’s very clear that he could be one of the best steals of the draft.

Top Three Player Traits

Ball Skills

Cisco’s best asset as a safety is without a doubt his ability to play the ball in the air. In his three-year career he had 13 interceptions and 29 passes defended including a ridiculous 2018 campaign when he had 7 picks and 18 PBUs. The reason he is so good at this is because of his ability to diagnose plays and act on them quickly. This is arguably his best ability as a safety. He especially excels in zone coverage and plays much bigger than his size. He has soft hands as well so he very rarely will drop a potential interception.

Speed

Due to his injury we won’t know what Cisco’s 40-yard dash time is before the draft but after watching his tape it’s not entirely necessary. One of his abilities that allows him to excel in zone coverage is his ability to find good angles and reach receivers at the right angle. Cisco does extremely well in deep coverage because of his natural speed and agility to cover the entire deep field. While Cisco’s play overall isn’t reminiscent of Bob Sanders his speed turning him into essentially a heat-seeking missile certainly is.

Physicality

While Cisco can be over-aggressive at times (which will be discussed later) a positive side of that is that he does not shy away from contact. If Cisco identifies a run play early on he’s immediately hitting the line of scrimmage and trying to punch the ball out of the runner’s arms. As the NFL continues to move toward an RPO approach with dual-threat quarterbacks this type of safety who can quickly identify plays and put themselves in position with the linebackers to stuff it are also increasingly more valuable.

Top Three Traits To Improve Upon

Aggressiveness

This can quickly turn into a semantics argument given I just listed physicality as a strength of his and these two tend to go hand in hand. So let’s clarify: Cisco’s physicality means he seeks out contact which is an asset in defending against the run. However his aggressiveness not just for contact but for the ball as well can also hurt him. There are times that Cisco will go for the ball or the big hit which will result in a missed tackle or big play. This type of aggressive mindset makes him pretty susceptible to play fakes and pump fakes as well. He needs to learn when to play it safe rather than go for the highlight reel.

Man Coverage

This is where it’s tough to gauge where Cisco fits in an NFL defensive system. A lot of his skills make him perfect for a versatile free safety role at the next level but he absolutely has to improve on his man coverage skills. While he’s capable of defending players one-on-one he commonly gets lost on juke moves and struggles with hip fluidity. If a team like the Rams want to replace the loss of John Johnson at free safety with the likes of Cisco they will have to ensure they can help coach him up when it comes to man coverage. He would also be a really good fit for the Chargers alongside Derwin James.

Injuries

I always hate knocking players for injury history as it is usually something totally out of their control. However as noted before Cisco’s ACL injury hopefully isn’t serious but the truth of the matter is no one knows yet. It’s a promising sign that at his pro day which was about six months after his surgery Cisco was able to take part in the bench press drill and told reporters that he would be ready to go in time for training camp. It’s also worth noting he missed three games during his sophomore year with an injury as well. So while he’s not chronically hurt durability is an inevitable concern for the Syracuse safety.

Summary

Andre Cisco is arguably the best safety in this year’s draft class but due to his ACL he’s usually found in the 3-5 range of most expert’s safety rankings. NFL teams will have to heavily invest in medically clearing him before selecting him in the 2021 NFL Draft but if he passes that he will be a steal for whoever gets him in Rounds 2-4.

Dickerson Dead at 71,"B.B. Dickerson -- one of the founding members of the funk band War -- has reportedly died.

A rep confirmed his passing to Billboard citing a battle with a long undisclosed illness. He said B.B. -- whose real name was Morris -- died peacefully at his home in Long Beach.

Dickerson was one of the OG band members who helped put War on the map in the late '60s and '70s -- this after being discovered by record producer Jerry Goldstein and paired with lead singer Eric Burdon ... who served as the face of the group thereafter.

He served as the primary bassist for War and often contributed vocals as well -- including heading up lead singer duties for their 10-minute-plus opus ""The World is a Ghetto"" -- which was reimagined and covered countless times over the years.

B.B. was also there for War's biggest hit single to date ""Why Can't We Be Friends?"" plus a long string of other well-known tracks like ""Spill the Wine"" ""Gypsy Man"" ""Low Rider"" ""Me and Baby Brother"" ""The Cisco Kid"" ""All Day Music"" ""Slippin' Into Darkness"" ""Summer"" and countless others.

He was also there performing with War when they notably shared the stage with Jimi Hendrix in London back in 1970 -- which became the latter's last public performance before he died.

B.B. toured and performed with War until 1979 -- when he departed only to reunite with other founding members in the '90s under a new stage name the Lowrider Band as they attempted to get out from under the thumb of Goldstein who had the rights to ""War.""

B.B. is said to be survived by his mother uncle and children. He was 71.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzA0L3dhci1jby1mb3VuZGVyLW1vcnJpcy1iYi1kaWNrZXJzb24tZGVhZC1hdC03MS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morris B.B.

Dickerson co-founded War in 1969 featuring singer Eric Burden whose sixties band The Animals had several hits including “House of the Rising Sun.”

War had its first number one album in 1973 with “The World is a Ghetto.” Its hits included the title track and “The Cisco Kid.” The band also had success with tunes including “Why Can’t We Be Friends” “Spill the Wine” and “Low Rider” before Dickerson departed in 1979.

Billboard reports that Dickerson was on stage with War when Jimmy Hendrix joined them in what turned out to be the late guitar-playing “Hey Joe” singer’s last performance in 1970.

Dickerson reportedly died from an unspecified illness Friday in a California hospital. The Californian was 12 when he started playing bass."

The campaign appears to be the first time that so many powerful Black executives have organized to directly call out their peers for failing to stand up for racial justice.

The effort led by Kenneth Chenault a former chief executive of American Express and Kenneth Frazier the chief executive of Merck is a response to the swift passage of a Georgia law that they contend makes it harder for Black people to vote. As the debate about that bill raged in recent weeks most major corporations — including those with headquarters in Atlanta — did not take a position on the legislation.

“There is no middle ground here” Mr. Chenault said. “You either are for more people voting or you want to suppress the vote.”

Former President Trump on Saturday added to a list of organizations he's calling on supporters to boycott for opposing Georgia's voting restrictions. Driving the news: Trump on Friday urged a boycott of ""woke companies"" that have taken a stand and Major League Baseball for moving its All-Star Game out of Georgia adding: ""Are you listening Coke Delta."" In his new statement he said: ""Boycott Major League Baseball Coca-Cola Delta Airlines JPMorgan Chase ViacomCBS Citigroup Cisco UPS and Merck.""

What else he's saying: Trump accused ""Radical Left Democrats"" of playing dirty by boycotting companies that offend them.

""Now they are going big time with WOKE CANCEL CULTURE and our sacred elections"" Trump said.

""It is finally time for Republicans and Conservatives to fight back — we have more people than they do — by far!"" he added before making a series of complaints including about the 2020 presidential election and then wishing: ""Happy Easter!""

The other side: Democrats have criticized the new law with President Biden calling it ""Jim Crow on steroids.""

Citigroup declined to comment and the other companies named in Trump's boycott list did not immediately return Axios' requests for comment.

Trump issued a bitter message Saturday in which he stoked divisions over Georgia’s restrictive new voting law. It came a day after he urged a boycott of “woke companies” including Major League Baseball for moving its All-Star Game out of Georgia. He later expanded the list of companies that he says supporters should boycott for opposing Georgia’s voting restrictions.

Trump pointed the finger at “radical left Democrats” claiming they “have played dirty” for years “by boycotting products when anything from that company is done or stated in any way that offends them.” Now he said they’re “going big time with WOKE CANCEL CULTURE and our sacred election.” So it’s time for Republicans to “fight back” and push their own boycotts which should be successful because “we have more people than they do—by far!” Trump called on supporters to “boycott Major League Baseball Coca-Cola Delta Airlines JPMorgan Chase ViacomCBS Citigroup Cisco UPS and Merck.” The former president went on to warn that the “radical left will destroy our country if we let them” and ended his message with a greeting: “Happy Easter!”

Many key leaders quickly answered Trump’s call to boycott baseball. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel for example tweeted Saturday that she wouldn’t be tuning into Major League Baseball. “Guess what I am doing today?” McDaniel tweeted. “Not watching baseball!!!!”

Georgia’s Gov. Brian Kemp doubled down on his defense of the controversial law Saturday saying his state had fallen victim to “cancel culture.” Kemp made an effort to frame the discussion over the law as a partisan issue. “Yesterday Major League Baseball caved to fear and lies from liberal activists” Kemp said at a news conference. “In the middle of a pandemic Major League Baseball put the wishes of Stacey Abrams and Joe Biden ahead of the economic well-being of hard-working Georgians who were counting on the All-Star Game for a paycheck.”

Democrats including former President Barack Obama have largely praised the MLB’s decision to move its game. Georgia voting rights activist and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said she was “disappointed” over the MLB’s decision but praised the league for speaking up on the issue. “As I have stated I respect boycotts although I don’t want to see Georgia families hurt by lost events and jobs” Abrams said in a statement. “Georgians targeted by voter suppression will be hurt as opportunities go to other states. We should not abandon the victims of GOP malice and lies – we must stand together.”

If Trump will really call on supporters to boycott companies that have decried efforts to restrict voting access his list should get a lot larger. Almost 200 companies on Friday signed onto a strong statement that called on lawmakers across the country “to work across the aisle and ensure that every eligible American has the freedom to easily cast their ballot and participate fully in our democracy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY2EueWFob28uY29tL25ld3MvZG9uYWxkLXRydW1wLWV4cGFuZGVkLWxpc3Qtd29rZS0wOTQxMTc5NjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Donald Trump has expanded his list of 'woke' companies to boycott due to their opposition to Georgia's voting law,"Melania and Donald Trump share a moment with Barack and Michelle Obama at Trump's inauguration ceremony in January 2017.

Donald Trump has spoken out again about the companies that oppose Georgia's new voting law.

He called for more boycotts saying ""don't go back to their products until they relent.""

Barack Obama meanwhile commended the MLB on its decision to move its All-Star Game from Atlanta.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Former President Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of companies that oppose Georgia's new voting law and widened his appeal for more boycotts.

""Never submit never give up!"" Trump said. In a statement he added that his political opponents - the ""Radical Left Democrats"" - had long used brand boycotts to send messages.

""It is finally time for Republicans and Conservatives to fight back - we have more people than they do - by far! Boycott Major League Baseball Coca-Cola Delta Airlines JPMorgan Chase ViacomCBS Citigroup Cisco UPS and Merck. Don't go back to their products until they relent. We can play the game better than them"" Trump said.

Trump was in opposition to another former president Barack Obama who supported Major League Baseball's (MLB) decision to move its 2021 All-Star Game.

""Congratulations to @MLB for taking a stand on behalf of voting rights for all citizens. There's no better way for America's pastime to honor the great Hank Aaron who always led by example"" Obama said on Twitter.

Elsewhere Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel said she was skipping MLB broadcasts.

""Guess what I am doing today? Not watching baseball!!!!"" she said on Twitter.

MLB's decision to move the game could cost the Atlanta economy about $100 million in lost revenue Holly Quinlan a local tourism official told CNN on Saturday.

Georgia voting rights activist Stacey Abrams said she supported the league's decision but didn't ""want to see Georgia families hurt by lost events and jobs.""

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp who signed the bill told Fox News that New York voting laws were more restrictive than those in Georgia.

""Major League Baseball may be scared of Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams but we're not. We will continue to fight to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat in Georgia"" Kemp said on Twitter.

“Generational wealth starts with generational knowledge.”

So says Capital Gains Investment Group co-founder Kwame Stover. He is a 13-year Army veteran who pulled strength from struggle. Realizing a lack of knowledge surrounding cryptocurrency he set out to empower his community through economics.

When we enter the workforce we are taught how to invest our earnings and achieve financial freedom. During his military career Stover recognized the importance of self-discipline and learning financial literacy early in our community.

In addition he made wise decisions with his military pay. He started with trading stocks and learning stock options. Then he began to invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin DEFI and NFT (non-fungible tokens). Today Bitcoin is worth almost $50000 per coin. Through sound investments and recognizing the importance of credit Stover is now a millionaire.

However he did not come from a financially stable family. A combination of self-education and mentorship allowed him to acquire the knowledge needed to commence the accumulation of wealth. Not just financial wealth but intellectual wealth.

Rather than keep the knowledge for himself he recognized the importance of giving back to his community. He does not give out money. He “pays it forward” by passing on the knowledge that it takes to create another millionaire which he has done.

The word “millionaire” is usually associated with conspicuous consumption and arrogance. Stover is the exact opposite.

When we met he was dressed in sweatpants and a crewneck sweater with running shoes. Furthermore he still lives here in Fayetteville and works to build the community as a board member of Southern CC Inc a veteran nonprofit organization founded by a fellow veteran Tony Brown. Southern CC Inc is dedicated to building autonomous communities and creating financial stability along with generational wealth.

Stover accumulated his wealth at an early age. Still in his 30s he feels “rather than wait let’s learn now.” Keeping true to his word Stover created a children’s book entitled Crypto for Kids which sells for $12. With this book he hopes to create financial awareness for future generational wealth.

Life is a constant journey of education and increase in wisdom. During our conversation Stover spoke on the subject of dynastic wealth. The Rothschilds and Kennedys are examples of dynastic wealth totaling in the upper billions. These families understand the power of group economics.

Much of the Black community lacks the financial knowledge to properly combine assets and effectively invest. Stover partnered with Morris Benton Elise Benton and Erica Brown to create an investment group that provides practical methods to financial management in a manner that allows ordinary citizens to become a part of the world’s new thriving cryptocurrency market and possibly achieve dynastic wealth.

Other Rakeem Jones columns:

Stover told me that his goal was to become a billionaire in five years. Many would think that he was saying that he wants to have a personal worth of a billion dollars. However he explained that he wanted to generate a billion dollars. For instance he could make a billion people one dollar each and achieve this status. With Capital Gains Investment Group he and his team are doing just that and creating a permanent fix.

His permanent fix is a platform that gives users the knowledge that is actually needed to understand and succeed in trading. Through trading and group economics Stover believes we can achieve ownership.

According to Stover the true definition of being wealthy is the ownership of your time.

Like he said now is the time to educate ourselves and those around us. Knowledge is the most valuable possession that we can obtain or relinquish.

I leave you with this prayer from Napoleon Hill’s “Think and Grow Rich”: “I ask not Oh Divine Providence for more riches but more wisdom with which to accept and use wisely the riches I received at birth in the form of power to control and direct my mind to whatever ends I desire.”

Be the best you for you and those around you. Salute to every activist getting active. Peace.

Citizens hit the streets in protest. They threw bananas and yogurt in Iceland and rocks in Pakistan. Governments fell. Authorities launched hundreds of tax probes and criminal investigations.

“This is an earthquake” CNN columnist Frida Ghitis said at the time. “The aftershocks will continue for months even years to come.”

She was right.

Half a decade later the Panama Papers’ revelations about how the offshore financial system enables greed and treachery continue to roil political and economic systems worldwide.

In just the past month alone more than 300 news articles in 14 languages referenced the Panama Papers as authorities continue to pursue investigations and push for reforms a search of the Nexis news database shows.

Among the Panama Papers-related developments in the month of March:

In Malta authorities charged Keith Schembri former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s chief of staff with money laundering and fraud as a result of an investigation sparked in part by the Panama Papers — and a court heard more testimony about the car-bomb assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia a Maltese journalist who used evidence from the trove of documents in her exposés of high-ranking government officials.

In Peru Rafael López Aliaga a presidential candidate came up empty in his push to get a court to halt a continuing investigation of his role in a Panama Papers-related money laundering case.

In Denmark the country’s tax minister cited the Panama Papers to justify hiring hundreds of new employees to bolster the fight against tax fraud.

In the U.S. prosecutors revealed the third guilty plea in a tax fraud case that came to light through the Panama Papers and lawmakers cited the Panama Papers to support the push to enact two landmark pieces of legislation now before Congress — the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act and the For the People Act a voting rights bill that’s being called “the boldest democracy reform since Watergate.”

Beyond individual countries the Panama Papers has become a global touchstone of the debate around corruption financial crime and inequality. It is cited in parliaments and courthouses and movie studios.

Just as Watergate became both a landmark in the history of journalism and a shorthand for political tricksterism the Pulitzer Prize-winning Panama Papers investigation has inspired many journalists to embrace a new kind of leading-edge journalism — and its alliterative name has come to serve as a shorthand for financial perfidy by the globe’s ruling elite.

“On a personal level there was a before and after Panama Papers in my journalism career” said Mariel Fitz Patrick an Argentine journalist who worked on the investigation. She was shocked by the number of journalists around the planet — more than 370 from 76 news organizations — who worked in secret on the project for more than a year. In Argentina she told ICIJ recently “that experience would mark a new path for us in the way we do journalism and in our future investigations.”

In the broader world actor Meryl Streep who starred in the Netflix movie “The Laundromat” heads a growing list of popular culture stars who have brought the shadowy mechanics of offshore-enabled financial crime into homes and common parlance through works that reference the Panama Papers — cartoons films quiz shows such as “Jeopardy!” and National Public Radio’s “Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me” and television series such as “Billions” and “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.”

Financial experts meanwhile continue to fret over the risks of “another Panama Papers” or whether a “new Panama Papers” is needed to keep up the fight against dirty money. An anti-corruption consultant advised in December: “High net worth individuals need to take certain proactive steps to avoid being lumped together with Yakuza crime bosses and kleptocrats in the aftermath of the next Panama Papers-type scandal.”

The Panama Papers’ revelations also continue to resonate for transparency advocates around the world according to Lakshmi Kumar policy director at Global Financial Integrity a U.S.-headquartered research and advocacy group.

The crimes and case studies unearthed by the media partnership’s investigation have provided colorful easy-to-explain fodder for groups like hers that work to persuade government authorities to embrace tougher standards for financial accountability and transparency.

“The Panama Papers woke everyone up” Kumar said in an interview this week. “It was the first big thing that everyone remembers … Even five years down the road those examples that the Panama Papers revealed are just as relevant. They haven’t gone out of fashion.”

A massive leak

ICIJ and its partners began publishing their explosive Panama Papers disclosures at 2 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on April 3 2016.

ICIJ McClatchy the Miami Herald German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung and other media partners spent more than a year sifting through 11.5 million leaked files to expose offshore holdings of current and former world leaders and more than 100 other politicians and public officials across the globe.

The files which Süddeutsche Zeitung obtained and shared with ICIJ and other partners came from Mossack Fonseca a little-known but powerful law firm based in Panama with branches in Hong Kong Zurich and dozens of other places.

The law firm’s leaked internal files contained information on 214488 offshore entities connected to people in more than 200 countries and territories. The data included emails financial spreadsheets passports and corporate records revealing the secret owners of bank accounts and companies in 21 outposts in the offshore system from Nevada to the British Virgin Islands to Singapore.

It was in short a treasure trove for investigative reporters — and for anyone interested in knowing how the rich and famous and corrupt and criminal play with their money offshore. Former South African President Thabo Mbeki called the revelations “a massive blow to financial secrecy.”

“Panama Papers” quickly became the No. 1 trending item on Twitter worldwide. In the first several weeks 72 stories and data products produced by ICIJ were visited more than 80 million times by people in more than 200 countries and territories. Media partners’ stories reached an audience that numbered in the hundreds of millions across digital print and broadcast.

A cartoon in the New Yorker magazine showed a businessman looking out of the window of his office with his young heir at his side surveying the smokestacks and office towers of his empire: “Son someday soon this will all be exposed in the Panama Papers.” A Sunday edition of the iconic American newspaper comic Doonesbury showed a high-ranking official from the fictitious nation of “Berzerkistan” learning that he’d been exposed in the Panama Papers as having salted away $1.835 billion offshore. “SO THAT’S WHERE I PUT IT!” he exclaims.

Some real-life politicians lost their jobs — even their freedom.

Iceland’s prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned following nationwide protests after revelations that he and his wife owned a company in the British Virgin Islands. Politicians in Mongolia Spain and beyond also fell.

In 2017 Pakistan’s Supreme Court removed from office the country’s longest-serving prime minister Nawaz Sharif as result of the Panama Papers’ revelations about his family’s properties overseas. A year later he was sentenced in the case to 10 years in prison on corruption charges and fined $10.6 million.

Follow the money

From Day 1 of the Panama Papers governments around the world traced whatever previously hidden dollars euros yen and other currencies they could. Countries have recouped more than $1.36 billion in unpaid taxes fines and penalties as a result of inquiries sparked by the Panama Papers according to ICIJ’s latest tally.

In the last two years ten countries including Australia Belgium Denmark Germany and Italy reported recovering more than $185 million in new money as a result of Panama Papers-inspired investigations. Norway for the first time disclosed that it has clawed back almost $34 million. Hundreds of tax probes against individuals and companies remain open according to reporting gathered by ICIJ and its partners.

Parliaments — embarrassed by the revelations or seeking to harness public outrage to plug fiscal holes in budgets drained by tax evasion — have enacted new laws.

The government of Panama which initially denounced the Panama Papers as a campaign to “distort the facts and tarnish the reputation of the country” ultimately signed a multilateral convention to share foreign taxpayers’ information with other nations. New Zealand tightened its trust laws to prevent further abuses by foreigners attracted by the country’s once pristine reputation. Since then the number of so-called foreign trusts in New Zealand has plummeted 75%.

In the United Kingdom members of parliament repeatedly referenced the Panama Papers when passing legislation in 2017 that created the country’s first criminal offense for lawyers who do not report clients’ tax evasion. Last September Ghana’s registrar general said that the Panama Papers was instrumental in his government passing a new law that required owners of companies in Ghana to identify themselves. Ghana is now one of 81 countries to approve such laws — more than double the number since 2018.

In the U.S. the Panama Papers helped persuade Congress to write and pass the Corporate Transparency Act which requires owners of U.S. companies to disclose their identities to the Treasury Department. The legislation the biggest revision of American anti-money laundering controls since the post-9/11 Patriot Act was signed into law in January.

Gary Kalman the head of Transparency International in the U.S. who lobbied for the bill said that the Panama Papers and the so-called “Emma Watson Effect” were especially useful.

For years opponents of ownership registries argued that celebrities millionaires and other high-profile citizens needed anonymous companies to avoid the paparazzi — or even kidnappers. The example of Watson the Harry Potter film star who the Panama Papers revealed owned an offshore company for what her representatives said were “privacy reasons” helped Kalman give legislators a concrete example of why registries posed no risk to law-abiding citizens.

Under the new U.S. law Kalman said celebrities or high profile people would be confidentially revealed to the U.S. government but their names would not be publicly available. “Bottom line if you are not doing anything illegal there is really no reason to fear a beneficial ownership directory” he said.

Not everyone was happy with the new law.

“Some will say that this all started in 2016 when a Panamanian law firm made headlines” a Forbes contributor wrote in January complaining that the new law had “killed off Incognito Mode” in the world of business. “The information in these documents was so scandalous that ordinarily boring legal documents took on a snappy moniker: ‘the Panama Papers.’”

The moniker has also become a catchword beyond the realm of politics and government.

I think it is fair to say that the Panama Papers project introduced cross-border journalism to the world. — Jóhannes Kr. Kristjánsson Icelandic journalist

The Panama Papers have been referenced in thousands of academic papers including articles such as “Speaking Truth to Power: Twitter Reactions to the Panama Papers” in the Journal of Business Ethics and “Structural studies of the global networks exposed in the Panama Papers” in Applied Network Science.

The Panama Papers even pops up in an August 2016 article in the European Journal of Political Theory titled “Aristotle and the problem of oligarchic harm” and in a 2018 review in an organizational studies journal that explores the “speculative anthropology” of novelist David Foster Wallace.

At least a dozen books have been published about the Panama Papers — including one by Frederik Obermaier and Bastian Obermayer the German journalists who obtained the leaked data and another by former ICIJ journalist Jake Bernstein “Secrecy World” which became the inspiration for filmmaker Steven Soderbergh’s movie “The Laundromat” starring Streep Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas.

At the movie’s September 2019 premiere at the Venice International Film Festival Streep said the film sought to use humor to tell a “very dark black-hearted joke — a joke that’s being played on all of us” by the clients and operatives of the offshore world.

Global journalism

The Panama Papers continues to be cheered too as a pathbreaking model for international reporting and collaborative journalism.

Jóhannes Kr. Kristjánsson an Icelandic journalist who did the digging within and outside the document trove that brought down his country’s prime minister spent almost a year working in his apartment unable to tell anyone else in his small nation what he was doing.

He says his in-laws “really thought I was just a lousy bum or something not working on anything.”

In his lonely striving he leaned on the support of “great journalists all around the world” — project partners who were also secretly sleuthing through the same document set. Some remain his close friends five years later.

One regret with the project is he never got a chance to taste the ice cream flavor — Wintris — that a local shop in Reykjavík named after the offshore company secretly controlled the Panama Papers showed by the prime minister and his wife.

Kristjánsson believes the kind of global collaboration among journalists that made the Panama Papers investigation possible is a crucial weapon in the defense of democracy.

“I think it is fair to say that the Panama Papers project introduced cross-border journalism to the world” Kristjánsson told ICIJ this week. “It is a really powerful tool when journalists in many countries work together on the same story and publish at the same time. This is extremely important for journalists in countries where human rights and press freedom are violated.”

Fitz Patrick one of five Argentine journalists who initially worked on the Panama Papers said the project inspired her to continue to delve into issues related to money laundering and international financial crimes. And she said it inspired the Argentine reportng partners to continue to work across the lines of news outlets’ traditional rivalries — treating each other as allies instead of adversaries.

“Working with a competing media company? That was unthinkable until that moment in Argentina” Fitz Patrick said.

A 2018 article in the International Journal of Communication said that the Panama Papers and ICIJ’s next offshore secrecy investigation — the Paradise Papers — have helped show the way to a new kind of international reporting that wrestles with an increasingly complex and networked world.

Traditionally the article notes international journalism has been “foreign correspondence” which brings back home to a domestic audience news from far-away lands about elections trains crashes and other one-off events.

In contrast the piece says ICIJ’s “global network journalism” goes beyond the “traditional national comfort zone” by bringing together journalists from around the planet to deeply analyze and expose murky transnational systems like the offshore world.

This kind of reporting is vital in an era when dirty money can move halfway around the world with the click of a computer key and offshore operatives are adept at hiding wealth behind Russian doll-like configurations of front men shell companies and trusts.

“My reporting on the Panama Papers and other subsequent leaks has made me realise how broken the international system is” said Jacob Borg a Maltese journalist who has been shoved and insulted while reporting on what he calls the “mafia-like tentacles exposed by the Panama Papers” in his small European country.

Last month — 59 months after the Panama Papers investigation was released — Maltese authorities charged Keith Schembri the powerful chief of staff to the country’s prime minister from 2013 to 2019 with fraud and money laundering. The Panama Papers revealed that Schembri owned two secretive offshore companies. He resigned in 2019 after police questioned him during a probe into the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia who had earlier connected Schembri’s offshore dealings to corruption.

“Whilst dirty money flows easily across borders it often takes local authorities weeks months and years to catch up and gather information about these illicit flows” Borg said. “Collaborative journalism has proven to be a lot more efficient.”

Alec Bohm had a tiebreaking single in the eighth inning Zach Eflin gave Philadelphia another strong start and the Phillies completed a three-game sweep of the Braves with a 2-1 win Sunday.

Philadelphia’s pitching staff was the story of the season-opening series as the starting trio of Aaron Nola Zack Wheeler and Eflin surrendered only three runs 11 hits and one walk while recording 24 strikeouts in 20 2/3 innings against NL MVP Freddie Freeman and an Atlanta lineup that led the majors in 2020 with 556 hits.

The Phillies bullpen which posted a 7.06 ERA in 2020 didn’t yield a run in 7 1/3 innings in the set.

“Everyone did their job” Phillies manager Joe Girardi said. “The starters came in and did their job. The bullpen did their job. To limit this team to the amount of runs that we did is not easy to do.”

Philadelphia’s pitching held Atlanta’s lineup in check with Freeman Ronald Acuña Jr. Ozzie Albies and Marcell Ozuna combining to go 3 for 44 (.068) in the three-game set.

“We’re going to go through this in this game” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “We’ll probably go through this in July or August. We faced some good pitching. But I’d rather face a team like us (as an opponent) early than late when we get our offense going and get some at-bats.”

Eflin went seven strong innings allowing only four hits and one walk while striking out eight. The lone mistake he made was hanging a curveball to Travis d’Arnaud who pierced the winds blowing into Citizens Bank Park with a tying solo homer in the seventh that ended Atlanta’s 19-inning scoring drought.

“We know that those guys can hit” Eflin said. “It’s a huge goal to go into a start and try to limit the amount of pitches they can hit. You stress weak contact against them. It’s great to pitch deep into the game for the first start keep them off balance get some double plays when I needed to and kept them guessing.”

Philadelphia regained the lead in the eighth as Rhys Hoskins Bryce Harper and Bohm hit consecutive singles off Chris Martin (0-1). Hoskins scored just ahead of the throw from center fielder Cristian Pache.

Hector Neris recorded his first save dodging trouble caused by two-out walks to Freeman and Ozuna. D’Arnaud flied out to end it

“I think we proved to ourselves that any given night we can go win a game and we have guys stepping up” Bohm said. “And we showed that our bullpen is for real with these guys shutting the door.”

Atlanta starter Ian Anderson wiggled in and out of trouble early striking out seven hitters while allowing four hits. Andrew Knapp homered in the second.

CROWD SOURCING

After playing in front of 8500 people in the first two games of the homestand the Phillies received permission from the City of Philadelphia to increase attendance on Sunday to almost 11000 fans – roughly 25 percent of the attendance at Citizens Bank Park.

The club announced a crowd of 10773 for Sunday’s finale with social distancing pods scattered around all levels of the ballpark.

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania increased attendance limits at outdoor sports and concert venues to 50 percent on Sunday and 25 percent at indoor venues. The city of Philadelphia however has different regulations and has limited attendance to just 20 percent prior to Sunday.

UP NEXT

Braves: Atlanta was scheduled to play at Washington in a three-game set beginning Monday. The Nationals had their first three games of the season called off because of a COVID-19 outbreak. Drew Smyly will make his first start for the Braves after coming over as a free agent from San Francisco. The Nationals have not announced their starting pitcher and were not fully cleared to have full squad workouts as of Sunday afternoon.

Phillies: Host the New York Mets in a three-game set beginning on Monday. Philadelphia will send newly signed left-hander Matt Moore to the mound for the first time. Moore spent the 2020 season in Japan after pitching just twice for the Detroit Tigers in 2019. He will face two-time Cy Young winner Jacob deGrom who will make his debut in New York’s delayed opener after a weekend series in Washington was postponed due to the Nationals’ COVID-19 issues.

PHILADELPHIA – The Atlanta Braves looked a little patchwork in their second game of the season.

The All-Star Game patch that appeared on the right sleeve of the Braves' jerseys during opening day was sewn over Saturday against Philadelphia at Citizens Bank Park. The same logo was gone from their hats too.

The uniform change came a day after Major League Baseball announced that this summer's All-Star Game was being moved out of Atlanta over the sport's objections to sweeping changes to Georgia voting laws.

It was easy to spot the change on the jersey with the outline of the All-Star patch hastily covered over. The Braves still have a patch on their left sleeves marking the 150th anniversary of the franchise.

The summer event had been scheduled for July 13 at Truist Park in Atlanta.

“I’m disappointed that it’s not going to being there” Braves manager Brian Snitker said before a 4-0 loss to Philadelphia. “But I’m focused on playing baseball and what we’ve got going on this season. Other than being disappointed that’s all I have to say on it.”

Said Atlanta pitcher Charlie Morton in his 14th season big league season: “It’s about more than just the guys in the clubhouse. It’s about the city of Atlanta the state of Georgia the Braves organization people coming in from all over the country and the businesses in the area seeing a boost.”

“I’m disappointed for the Braves organization and those who are local who would have benefitted seeing the influx of business and excitement in the area. It’s a bad situation. Some of the guys who are likely to be on the team it would have been nice to represent the team in their home park. People would have been able to see what was done in the ballpark"" he said.

“Other than that I don’t know what to say about it. It just stinks” he said.

A new site for the game hasn’t been announced.

MLB said the All-Star Game festivities will still feature a planned tribute to late Braves Hall of Famer Hank Aaron a civil rights hero. Houston manager Dusty Baker who played with Aaron in Atlanta and several others have suggested the event be held in Milwaukee — Aaron began his career with the Milwaukee Braves and finished with the Milwaukee Brewers.

“I think Major League Baseball made a good decision"" said Brewers manager Craig Counsell who added he'd like to see the game held in Milwaukee.

“Absolutely. I think it would be a thrill for the city for sure” he said. ""It’s not a good thing for the city of Atlanta and some people who have lost some economic opportunities but if it’s going to be somewhere else it would be a thrill for the city to have it here.”

Commissioner Rob Manfred made the decision to move the All-Star Game and events along with the amateur draft from Atlanta after discussions with individual big leaguers and the Players Alliance an organization of Black players formed after the death of George Floyd last year.

“This all came together rather quickly"" said Chicago Cubs outfielder Jason Heyward who is Black. ""We had I think a day left in spring training. The Players Alliance we gathered and got as many people as we could on a call. It was probably less than 50 guys on there out of the 100 or whatever. We had our conversation.

“We knew how we felt about it. We wanted to make sure I think that regardless of what happened the decision was made that we were there to do what we could in Atlanta” he said.

Heyward who grew up in the Atlanta area and was the Braves' first-round draft pick in 2007 said ""it was nice to see someone make a move pretty quickly and try to do it in a positive light knowing it’s still a tough decision.”

“I think you’re not going to be able to please everybody. I know there’s a lot of people in Atlanta that love baseball and were looking forward to see an All-Star Game there. A Midsummer Classic I think that’s special as somebody growing up there and watching a lot of baseball” he said. “But at the same time I think when you talk about a message the people are still out here pushing for equality.”

The English star is competing in her eighth ANA Inspiration dating back to her first appearance as an amateur in 2012. That debut performance brought her “worst” finish to date a tie for 38th. Since then Hull has never finished worse than 26th including a runner-up finish in 2016 and revels in taking to the difficult track at the foot of the San Jacinto Mountains.

“I first played in this event I think when I was 15 years old as an amateur and my dad was here with me. I just really love it” said Hull whose lone LPGA Tour victory came at the 2016 CME Group Tour Championship. “I just like it because it's quite a tight golf course and the rough can be thick and the greens are firm. I feel like that suits my game because I hit the ball quite high and I'm able to stop it where others find it quite hard.”

Hull missed the 2020 ANA Inspiration after being diagnosed with COVID-19 during the standard pre-tournament testing process. She had hoped that 2021 would go off without a hitch but she sprained her ankle while out for a run last week in Carlsbad before her final round of the Kia Classic. Thankfully for Hull it was more a case of injured pride and she sits in a tie for fourth heading into the weekend as she searches for her first major title.

“Beware the injured golfer they say. Yeah I literally went for a 5K run fell over a pothole and banged my chin. I was more embarrassed at the time. It didn't really hurt. Carried on with my 5k played 18 holes at the Kia and wasn't until after until I sat down for an hour and I stood up and couldn't walk on it” said Hull of her mishap. “I rang my friend Jason who used to work for me as a physio. He told me to ice it and I listened to him and it worked a lot then the guys here have been strapping it up for me. Feels loads better.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The agreement (with the Solar Energy Corporation of India that he cited on Friday) itself says that the government guarantee for the deal’s completion should be ensured he said.“It is after ensuring it that KSEB went ahead with the agreement. There is a provision that if KSEB is unable to use renewable energy as fixed by the regulatory commission it can purchase a renewable energy certificate for the equivalent unit. It is by ignoring this provision that KSEB went ahead with power purchase from Adani Group” Chennithala said.He said as per the figures of the state electricity regulatory commission the state is considered as a power-surplus state for the last five years.In 2021-22 KSEB will have 811 million units of power. Under these circumstances the government should answer why it chose to purchase power from Adani Group. The chief minister is directly involved in the deal Chennithala said.Responding to the reaction of the chief minister and the power minister Chennithala said their comments were on the expected lines. “The power minister said KSEB has not made any agreement with Adani Group. But there is another direct agreement between KSEB and Adani Group for the purchase of power. The director board that met on February 15 this year decided to purchase power directly from Adani Group for the April and May months” he said.He said the larger question is while power from small scale hydropower projects and solar projects is available at Re One per unit and Rs 2 per unit respectively why did the government choose to purchase power from Adani Group at the rate of Rs 2.83 per unit offering a profit of approximately Rs 1000 crore to the corporate. Solar Energy Corporation of India is only an intermediary that charges a commission between KSEB and Adani Group he added.Chennithala had earlier cited the Thiruvananthapuram airport bidding row to allege that the government has been taking a stand in favour of the Adani Group. He had said that while the government openly criticized the Central government move to hand over the airport to Adani Group it covertly helped the group in the bidding for the airport.Asked about the allegations raised by Chennithala regarding power purchase agreements with Adani chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in Kozhikode on Saturday that something serious has happened to the opposition leader and it is unbecoming for his post to level false allegations.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvZ292ZXJubWVudC10by1zbGFwLXJlY292ZXJ5LW5vdGljZS1vbi12ZWRhbnRhcy1jYWlybi1hZnRlci1kZWxoaS1oaWdoLWNvdXJ0LWp1ZGdtZW50L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgxODk2MDg2LmNtc9IBpQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvZ292ZXJubWVudC10by1zbGFwLXJlY292ZXJ5LW5vdGljZS1vbi12ZWRhbnRhcy1jYWlybi1hZnRlci1kZWxoaS1oaWdoLWNvdXJ0LWp1ZGdtZW50L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MTg5NjA4Ni5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Government to slap recovery notice on Vedanta's Cairn after Delhi High Court judgment,"

The oil ministry will seeks tens of millions of dollars from Vedanta's Cairn Oil & Gas after the Delhi High Court held that the firm was liable to pay higher profit share to the government in lieu of its Rajasthan oil and gas block license being extended beyond initial term a top official said. In the interim the firm's Barmer basin block licence whose initial 25-year term ended on May 15 2020 has been given an eighth interim extension the official who wished not to be identified said.""Now that the Delhi High Court has upheld the government policy we will issue recovery notices seeking higher profit petroleum since May 15 2020"" he said. ""The exact amount is being calculated but it will be in tens of millions of dollars.""When contacted a company spokesperson said ""We are in the process of reviewing the court's order will assess any next course of action"" after that.The Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendrea Modi had in March 2017 approved a policy for extension of production sharing contracts (PSCs) for oil and gas blocks beyond their initial term. This policy provided that the government's share of profit petroleum (earning from sale of oil and gas after deducting all expenses) would be 10 per cent more during the extended period.Vedanta's Cairn sought a 10-year extension of Rajasthan PSC which the government approved. But the firm challenged in Delhi High Court the condition for additional profit petroleum. A single judge bench of the Delhi High Court in May 2018 upheld the company position that the extension has to be on same terms and conditions as the original licence.The government challenged the order before a division bench which on March 26 this year ruled that ""there cannot be extension of the Production Sharing Contract unconditionally on the same terms and conditions which were prevailing 25 years ago i.e. on 15th May 1995 the effective date.""It set aside the May 2018 single judge order.""In effect what the Delhi High Court has said is that the company has to pay higher profit share after May 15 2020. So the company is now liable to pay higher profit petroleum for the period they operate the block post May 15 2020"" the official said.Vedanta he said has the option to not agree to the government condition and relinquish the block.""Even in that case the company is liable to pay additional profit petroleum for the period they operate the block post May 15 2020"" he said.The additional profit petroleum will be in addition to over USD 520 million that the government has sought from the company in a separate cost recovery dispute in the Rajasthan block - the the mainstay oil and gas block of Vedanta.The government claims additional profit petroleum after re-allocating Rs 2723 crore common cost between different fields in the block and disallowance of Rs 1508 crore cost on a pipeline.The company has challenged the demand through an arbitration.It also had a dispute with its partner state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) over investments made in the block which held up the computation of the government's share of profit petroleum for fiscal years ending March 31 2019 and March 31 2020.ONGC holds 30 per cent interest in the block while Cairn Oil & Gas a unit of Vedanta Ltd  is the operator with a 70 per cent stake.Sources said the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had way back in May 2018 raised a demand for additional share of profit oil for the government after disallowing Rs 1508 crore out of the cost incurred on laying a heated-pipeline to transport Barmer crude and Rs 2723 crore in the reallocation of certain common costs.These costs pertain to only Cairn's share in the Rajasthan block as ONGC has agreed to pay the government if these costs are disallowed.In all Rs 4828 crore including interest is being sought to be disallowed for the 2017-18 fiscal.The company had previously stated that it believes that it has sufficient as well as a reasonable basis for having claimed such costs and for allocating common costs between different fields.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvZ29hL2dpbXMtc29sYXItcGxhbnQtdG8taGVscC1zdGF0ZS1tZWV0LTE0LW9mLWl0cy10YXJnZXQvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODE4OTE1ODAuY21z0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9nb2EvZ2ltcy1zb2xhci1wbGFudC10by1oZWxwLXN0YXRlLW1lZXQtMTQtb2YtaXRzLXRhcmdldC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODE4OTE1ODAuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GIM’s solar plant to help state meet 14% of its target,PANAJI: One of Goa’s largest solar power generation systems became operational on Saturday at the Goa Institute of Management ( GIM ) campus in Sakhali where the institute has installed the 675kW solar power plant The solar panels have been installed on the roof-tops of the academic buildings. GIM alone will be now helping the state meet 14% of its target of solar power generation to be attained by 2022 set based on the Paris accord.“It is one of the largest solar power generation systems in Goa today. The institute should now soon be off the grid of the electricity department. Within the next three years this dream can be a reality I think. The panels used by GIM are the best available in the market today” power minister Nilesh Cabral said.The plant was set up taking advantage of the state government’s scheme that facilitates the storage of surplus solar energy generated by prosumers in the grid.The facility has been installed on Opex basis by JLTM Energy India Pvt Ltd a subsidiary of Technique Solaire of France. The contract requires GIM to purchase all the power generated by the power supplier and the net metering permits the consumer to store the excess power not utilised in the grid for use subsequently except during peak hours.All the capital investment and also the operation and maintenance is ensured by the Opex operator who guarantees a minimum generation failing which he pays a penalty.“GIM has always been conscious about the impact of its decisions on the ecosystem around it and has continuously strived to reduce its carbon footprints.The solar project is one such initiative and is aligned to our efforts in adopting sustainable practices on campus. We are possibly the only educational institute in the country to have an energy management system where we track the live power per capita consumption across the campus.The consumption pattern is tracked and analysed on a regular basis via a specially designed software” GIM director Ajit Parulekar said.The solar cells installed are of the monocrystalline variety that ensures a better solar energy conversion and utilise lesser roof area. The solar panels are of 500 Wp capacity and manufactured by Trina Solar of China.

The decision to pull the July 13 game from Atlanta’s Truist Park amounts to the first economic backlash against Georgia for the voting law that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp quickly signed into law March 25.

Critics of the legislation say it will restrict voter access and disproportionately affects people of color. In a Wednesday interview with ESPN President Joe Biden voiced his support to move the MLB All-Star Game and draft out of Atlanta.

“This is all about keeping working folks and ordinary folks that I grew up with from being able to vote” Biden said.

The 98-page bill places new restrictions on mail-in voting and other absentee balloting efforts. It also gives greater legislative control over how elections are run and even bans the distribution of food and water to people standing in line to vote.

Crystal Greer the founder of #ProtectTheVoteGA says it’s a voter suppression tactic with the potential to restrict voting access for people of color.

“We’re asking that the governor repeal this bill because it does disenfranchise Black voters” Greer said.

Greer and her organization are pushing for a repeal.

“When we’re doing all we can as constituents by emailing our representatives protesting 25 days straight making phone calls” Greer said. “You’re now pushing us in the corner to now have to pull back our money pull back our dollar cause that is the last power play we have.”

Corporations like Delta and Coca-Cola both headquartered in Atlanta initially declined to take a position they both later changed course.

“We’re starting to see a lot of corporations finally speak out unfortunately after the bill was passed” Greer said.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian labeled the law “unacceptable” while Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey called the legislation a “step backward.”

Bishop Reginald Jackson who presides over more than 400 African Methodist Episcopal churches in Georgia said too many corporate leaders have been “silent” on voting laws. He has called for his 90000 parishioners to boycott Delta Coca-Cola and other major brands.

“This is not just a Georgia issue or problem. It is a national problem that we believe puts our democracy at risk” Jackson said.

The same situation could play out in other states; similar laws are working their way through legislative sessions in Texas and Arizona.

“When you see unfortunately a state like Georgia successfully pass a law like that it does encourage other people in leadership in other states to follow suit” Greer said.

Kemp called the MLB’s decision a “knee-jerk decision” that means “cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life sports included. If the left doesn’t agree with you facts and the truth do not matter.”

“This attack on our state is the direct result of repeated lies from (President) Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams about a bill that expands access to the ballot box and ensures the integrity of our elections” Kemp said in a statement referring to the Democratic candidate whom he narrowly defeated in the 2018 election. “I will not back down. Georgians will not be bullied.”

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms a Democrat said she supports MLB’s decision. Atlanta will no doubt share in the economic loss though the Braves’ home stadium is now located outside the city in suburban Cobb County.

“Unfortunately the removal of the MLB All-Star Game from Georgia is likely the first of many dominoes to fall until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed” Bottoms said in a statement.

The Atlanta Braves issued a statement Friday saying the team is disappointed by the MLB’s decision.

“We are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city” the team said. “The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion.”

In October 2020 Coca-Cola made a huge announcement: The company had decided to discontinue 200 of its beverage brands in an effort to rid its portfolio of underperforming brands and prioritize those that showed the most opportunity for growth and scale. While you might think the ongoing pandemic was the catalyst for Coca-Cola’s decision to retire certain brands it wasn’t. The company’s plans to tighten up its portfolio were already in motion before the pandemic reared its head in early 2020. However supply chain issues and altered customer shopping behavior that resulted from the pandemic encouraged Coca-Cola leaders to fast-track those plans.

The decision to discontinue certain products is nothing new for Coca-Cola. The company has axed many of its products over the years. In memory here are 10 Coca-Cola products you can’t buy anymore — some of which were recently removed from the beverage titan’s lineup and others that you may have forgotten about.

TaB

TaB introduced in 1963 as the company’s first diet soft drink was one of the products on Coca-Cola’s 2020 hit list. The saccharine-laced beverage’s marketing campaign was initially targeted at women and as a result TaB reached peak popularity in the 1980s. In the decades that followed the brand managed to hold onto a much smaller but impressively loyal following — mostly comprised of consumers who remember TaB as a beloved cultural icon.

While juice and smoothie brand Odwalla wasn’t originally created by the Coca-Cola company it had been part of its product lineup since 2001. However less than two decades later Coca-Cola added it to its list of discontinued brands. According to CNN a spokesperson for Coca-Cola said that the pandemic wasn’t the cause of Odwalla’s demise. Instead the company had noted that health-conscious consumers were simply less interested in smoothies.

Zico Coconut Water

Like Odwalla the Zico brand was not a Coca-Cola original. However Zico enjoyed a less successful run. Coca-Cola acquired the brand less than a decade ago in 2013. Coca-Cola’s decision to cull Zico from its portfolio may have had something to do with its competitor Vita Coco which has often been recognized as the No. 1 selling coconut water in the U.S. Vita-Coco experienced sales spikes at Costco Amazon and Walmart following the onset of the pandemic while Zico remained in Coca-Cola’s underperforming category.

In 2004 Coca-Cola launched C2 to a target market of 20- to 40-year old males who wanted a unique beverage that tasted like Coke without the calorie and carb load. To get that combination Coca-Cola couldn’t get rid of all the carbs and calories in C2 — only half. Sadly the beverage flopped because while it did retain the full flavor of Coke it didn’t live up to the zero-carb zero-calorie male expectation. Coca-Cola did get it right though about a year later when it introduced current fan-favorite Coke Zero.

OK Soda

In 1993 Coca-Cola created OK soda to grab the attention of Generation X — those born from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s — based on the assumption that the generation was cynical and disillusioned. The company named the product OK because their research found that while Coke was the second most recognizable word in the world OK was the first. Plus the word OK helped the soda underpromise instead of making it seem like the next great thing which fit in perfectly with its marketing strategy to less-than-trusting Gen Xers. Even though the soda had a national media campaign the company only tested it in select markets to bolster demand. Unfortunately sales didn’t live up to the hype and OK soda was sent to the chopping block in 1995.

In 1985 in an attempt to re-energize its brand Coca-Cola announced the unthinkable: It was changing its formula for its original Coca-Cola for the first time in 99 years. Often referred to as New Coke the reformulated beverage was met with outrage from consumers who wanted their old Coke back. And 79 days later Coca-Cola gave consumers their wish. To resolve the situation Coca-Cola Classic — aka original Coke — was sold alongside New Coke which later was rebranded as Coke II before it was discontinued. But that wasn’t the end of New Coke. In 2019 as a result of Coca-Cola’s partnership with Netflix’s “Stranger Things” which featured New Coke throughout its season three episodes the beverage company released a limited run of 12-ounce cans of New Coke that were available as part of a bundle from CokeStore.com/1985.

Georgia’s new voting law requires a drivers’ license or state ID number be listed to submit an absentee ballot to vote among other new reforms. The state already required ID to vote in person. It had previously relied on signature matching to verify ballots.

COCA-COLA FACES BOYCOTT IN GEORGIA FOR NOT DENOUNCING GOP-BACKED ELECTION BILL

Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO James Quincey issued a statement Wednesday night saying the company is ""disappointed in the outcome of the Georgia voting legislation.""

""Voting is a foundational right in America and we have long championed efforts to make it easier to vote"" Quincey said. ""We want to be crystal clear and state unambiguously that we are disappointed in the outcome of the Georgia voting legislation. Throughout Georgia’s legislative session we provided feedback to members of both legislative chambers and political parties opposing measures in the bills that would diminish or deter access to voting.""

Quincey added that Coca-Cola's focus ""is now on supporting federal legislation that protects voting access and addresses voter suppression across the country.""

MLB has also condemned the new legislation.

""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box"" league commissioner Rob Manfred said announcing the decision to pull this year’s All-Star Game out of the Peach State Friday. He said protesting Georgia’s new GOP-backed election integrity law was ""the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport.""

The House recently passed H.R. 1 the For the People Act election reform favored by Democrats and panned by Republicans.

The legislation would create automatic voter registration across the country and ensure those who complete felony sentences have their voting rights restored. The bill will also expand early voting and enhance absentee voting by simplifying voting by mail.

In a letter to Coca-Cola that reporters posted to social media eight members of the House of Representatives declared their offices Coke-free zones and demanded that the Atlanta-based soda behemoth stop “intentionally” misleading the public.

The signatories included eight GOP state representatives: Victor Anderson Clint Crowe Matt Barton Jason Ridley Lauren McDonald III Stan Gunter Dewayne Hill and Marcus Wiedower.

“Given Coke’s choice to cave to the pressure of an out of control cancel culture we respectfully request all Coca-Cola Company products be removed from our office suite immediately” they wrote.

“Should Coke choose to read the bill share its true intentions and accept their role in the dissemination of mistruths we would welcome a conversation to rebuild a working relationship” the lawmakers said echoing Republican claims that the national hubbub over the law is based on lies and/or misleading facts.

The letter accuses the company of deciding to “perpetuate a national dialogue” they said “seeks to intentionally mislead the citizens of Georgia and deepen a divide in our great state.”

Coca-Cola got itself involved in Georgia politics when CEO James Quincey called the law “unacceptable” and “a step backwards.”

“It does not promote principles we have stood for in Georgia around broad access to voting around voter convenience about ensuring election integrity” he said.

Kicking Coke out of Georgia offices is crossing a much bigger bridge than kicking them out of offices in say Minnesota.

Not only has Atlanta been the longtime headquarters of the Coca-Cola Corp. but its dominance has even affected local dialect. In Georgia it’s common to call all forms of soda pop even Sprites or Pepsis “Cokes” “Co-colas” or similar.

The UK waste management company BusinessWaste.co.uk is concerned about the volume of plastic waste being thrown away owing to toothpaste tubes and is calling for plastic-free alternatives.

“Toothpaste is an essential hygiene item that people will always buy” said Mark Hall company spokesman at BusinessWaste.co.uk “however the problem is the packaging; does it really need to come in a plastic tube?”

Brushing up on the facts

UK residents alone use 300 million tubes of toothpaste every year. Spread end to end that is about 75000 km of plastic enough to circle the world twice. The problem is that they are usually made of different types of plastic and many brands contain a metal layer inside the tube which is not easy to separate from the plastic. “A lot of toothpaste tubes have that layer of aluminium in to keep them fresh but this makes it a recycling nightmare” Hall explained “so unfortunately most tubes will end up at a landfill.”

This worries BusinessWaste.co.uk as on average it takes 500 years for a toothpaste tube to fully biodegrade in landfill. Fortunately pump-action toothpaste tubes can be easier to recycle said Hall but this still depends on whether the local council will collect them.

Not only are plastic toothpaste tubes bad for the environment but also there is a high chance that consumers are not getting their money’s worth as up to 10% of the product remains in the tube when it actually appears to be empty. “Manufacturers do this on purpose” said Hall “It is all designed to make users buy a replacement tube sooner. Plastic toothpaste tubes aren’t beneficial for the earth or your value for money.”

Plastic-free solutions

As people are growing more concerned about their plastic footprint many companies are inventing clever solutions to reduce the amount of plastic we throw away and these include companies providing dental hygiene products. The options are varied and range from glass jars of toothpaste (either in powder tablet or regular paste form) or solid toothpaste as bars or sticks. Alternatively the internet offers many recipes and instructions for homemade toothpaste. Finally Hall suggested exploring the option of investing in a bamboo toothbrush or in recyclable heads for an electric toothbrush.

The market for streaming-video services keeps getting more and more crowded. And while some companies look to compete for a piece of viewers' wallets there's a growing preference toward free ad-supported video-on-demand services or AVODs.

There are several big media companies in the AVOD space: ViacomCBS (PARA 3.10%) bought Pluto TV in 2019 Fox (FOX 1.49%) (FOXA 1.40%) acquired Tubi last year and Comcast (CMCSA -0.52%) launched Peacock last summer. But Roku (ROKU 2.06%) has managed to attract an audience much faster than the traditional media companies and it's poised to stay in the lead.

63 million viewers and counting

Roku launched The Roku Channel in 2017. That's well after Pluto TV (2013) and Tubi (2014) came to market but the timing couldn't have been better. Cord-cutting was accelerating at the same time prices for subscription video-on-demand services started climbing.

Since The Roku Channel's launch the company has tripled the number of active accounts using its connected-TV devices to 51 million. In 2020 management said Roku Channel viewers were growing twice as fast as its overall platform. Indeed Roku Channel viewers grew more than 100% while active accounts increased ""just"" 39% for the year.

The company continued growing viewership quickly in the final months of 2020 jumping from an estimated 54 million viewers at the end of the third quarter to 63 million by the end of the year.

Growing faster than the competition

While all AVOD services saw a big jump in viewership in 2020 The Roku Channel performed exceptionally well.

Tubi which ended 2020 with 33 million monthly active users said viewership increased 58% last year. Pluto TV's monthly active users grew 80% globally and 34% in the United States.

The analysts at eMarketer believe Roku will keep pace with its now-smaller competitors in 2021. The research firm expects U.S. viewers for Roku to climb another 19% this year while Tubi and Pluto TV viewership will rise 20% and 17% respectively.

Comcast says Peacock signed up 33 million accounts by the end of 2020. But internal data seen by The Information suggests just 11 million households are regularly watching content on the new streaming service.

Adding lots of content

The big media companies are adding lots of content to their AVOD services.

Fox now distributes some of its broadcast content like The Masked Singer shortly after it originally airs on its network. Likewise Pluto TV has added a lot of old Viacom content since the big media company bought the streaming service a couple years ago. Both are also exploring the potential for original content on their platforms.

Comcast hopes to improve engagement this summer with exclusive content from the Olympic Games. The sporting event was meant to be at the center of its launch campaign but COVID-19 had other plans.

Meanwhile Roku has aggressively negotiated for additional content on The Roku Channel as part of its distribution agreements for premium streaming services on its connected-TV platform. It's also starting to license original content for the AVOD service. CEO Anthony Wood says the growth of The Roku Channel creates a virtuous cycle where it's able to invest in more and better content which in turn draws in more viewership so it's quite possible The Roku Channel's growth could continue to outpace the competition in 2021.

Winning ad dollars

Racking up a bunch of viewers with a growing content library is one thing. It's another for Roku to take on media giants like Fox ViacomCBS and Comcast in advertising sales.

But the company has been building up its advertising capabilities for years. It acquired Dataxu in 2019 and recently made a deal to buy Nielsen's ad technology. The two businesses position Roku to sell ads beyond its own streaming service or connected-TV platform. It can place ads on other digital properties and even linear TV just like the traditional media companies.

While it might not have as much inventory to sell on linear TV as competitors with broadcast networks it can offer marketers the ability to reach unique audiences in streaming with its audio content recognition technology. What's more Roku is less likely to cannibalize its ad sales with streaming video ads like Fox ViacomCBS or Comcast.

So while the big media companies are growing AVOD services to move ad revenue from one bucket to another Roku's taking share of the overall television advertising market. As more TV advertising moves from linear to digital that advantage will become extremely important.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9lYXN0YmF5dGltZXMvbmFtZS9yb24tbmV2ZWxzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTY2ODMwNznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ron Nevels Obituary (1947 - 2021) - Resident Of Martinez CA - East Bay Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/eastbaytimes/name/ron-nevels-obituary?id=6683079 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9lYXN0YmF5dGltZXMvbmFtZS9yb24tbmV2ZWxzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTY2ODMwNznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

The offering was an 89 mph fastball from right-hander Aaron Civale. Baddoo — the ninth Tiger to homer in his first at-bat — sent the ball 372 feet the opposite way to left field. He had a 103.7 mph exit velocity. His blast gave the Tigers a 3-1 lead in the third inning.

He started in left field batting ninth in manager AJ Hinch's lineup in Game 3 of the season for the Tigers (2-0).

Baddoo was a Rule 5 draft pick in December from the Minnesota Twins.

[ Akil Baddoo was surprise of spring for Tigers. It was a no brainer to keep him ]

He hasn't played above High-A in the minor leagues and underwent Tommy John surgery in May 2019. The 22-year-old went 13-for-40 (.325) in spring training with two doubles five home runs 11 RBIs 10 walks and 14 strikeouts.

If he doesn't stay on the active 26-man roster for the entire 2021 season he must be offered back to the Twins.

The 26-man contingent that competed at Comerica Park on April 1 might evolve into something completely different by Aug. 1.

There are hitters at Triple A waiting to be summoned to the majors. There are big leaguers learning new positions on the fly. The Indians could cycle through a host of players at first base and center field as the season unfolds. They could benefit from young pitchers taking leaps forward — or stumble if they encounter growing pains. A lot of players with limited track records could determine the club’s fate.

So in no scientific way let’s rank the 20 players whose performances might loom largest this season.



20. César Hernández

The second baseman was a model of consistency last season. He posted a .355 on-base percentage led the league with 20 doubles and captured his first Gold Glove Award. He returned to Cleveland on a one-year deal that includes a club option for 2022. Hernández has missed only four games the past three years so expect manager Terry Francona to scribble the switch-hitter’s name near the top of his lineup card every day.



19. Jake Bauers

18. Bobby Bradley

17. Nolan Jones

The Indians are essentially holding a season-long audition at first base. Bauers has the first opportunity to land the gig. Bradley who authored a superior spring performance is in Columbus waiting his turn. If those two falter Jones the organization’s top prospect could enter the mix this summer perhaps in right field shifting Josh Naylor to first. First base often serves as a position of power and run production; will any of the club’s candidates fit that description?



16. Daniel Johnson

He was rightfully disappointed about being optioned to Triple A and missing out on the opportunity to vie for the vacant center-field spot during spring training. Johnson has played all three outfield positions in the minors and has performed at the plate. So at some point he could be an option in center or right. And if he hits righties the way he has in the minors he should solve part of the team’s search for offense.

As Johnson said during spring training: “They know what I can do. I don’t have to prove anything else.”



15. James Karinchak

The only Cleveland reliever since the 1970s to strike out 100 or more batters in a season is Paul Shuey who tallied 103 strikeouts in 1999. Could Karinchak top Shuey’s total in his first 162-game season? (Cody Allen piled up 99 strikeouts in 2015.) Karinchak struck out nearly two hitters per inning in 2020. He’ll frequently find himself on the mound in high-leverage situations and not always in the ninth inning. If he can avoid those innings in which he couldn’t find the strike zone with a map and a tour guide he could anchor an imposing bullpen in 2021.

14. Eddie Rosario

Cleveland’s lineup sorely needs sources of stability and Rosario has proven reliable at the plate the past four seasons. He’ll play on a daily basis and hit in the middle of the order. He’s typically good for 25 home runs 30 doubles plenty of contact and very few walks. He connected on his first homer of the season Saturday. Rosario’s name popped up on a handful of MVP ballots the past two seasons. The Indians would appreciate it if he could treat other teams the way he has treated their pitchers during his career (.301/.337/.560 slash line).

13. Emmanuel Clase

A bullpen featuring Karinchak Nick Wittgren Phil Maton Trevor Stephan a revitalized Bryan Shaw and the ageless wonder Oliver Pérez? That could be a solid group. Now add in a guy who throws 102 mph with movement who is driven to be the team’s closer after a year of watching from afar. Yeah that’ll play. Clase needs to prove he can record high-leverage outs during games that count but he has already convinced Francona to consider him for late-inning opportunities which is a feat in itself. It’s important for the Indians to net something from the Corey Kluber trade. Clase can vault this relief crew from a solid group to the team’s strength.



12. Andrés Giménez

He has large cleats to fill but he impressed Cleveland’s evaluators to such a degree during spring training that he landed the starting shortstop gig and forced Amed Rosario to learn a new position. It would certainly benefit the team if it pinpointed Francisco Lindor’s long-term replacement in rapid fashion but Giménez figures to have competition in the coming years from Gabriel Arias Tyler Freeman and others.



11. Amed Rosario

If Rosario can quickly learn the quirks of playing center field the Indians could halt this game of musical chairs. That’s not a simple task for a guy who shifted to center field only three weeks ago. His athleticism and hitting acumen vaulted him toward the top of every prospects list a few years ago. He showcased those abilities with the Mets in 2019. He’ll receive chances to squeeze his way into the starting lineup but his glove might determine just how much he can help the Indians in 2021 and whether he’s a long-term fit in Cleveland.



10. Roberto Pérez

Sure Cleveland’s brass would be thrilled if he hit 24 home runs again and ensured opposing pitchers can’t simply sleepwalk through the bottom of the order. The newly svelte Pérez launched his first homer of the season beyond the left-field fence at Comerica Park on Thursday a promising sign. But more importantly the team is relying on Pérez — and his trusty sidekick Austin Hedges (Don’t look up his spring training numbers. Don’t do it. I’m telling you. Don’t. Believe me. You did it didn’t you? Pretty scary stuff right? Yikes.) — to guide a young pitching staff in making a collective leap forward. Pérez is also eyeing his third consecutive Gold Glove Award.

“I’ve been working hard to have the same season or even a better season (than) 2019” Pérez said.

9. Cal Quantrill

8. Logan Allen

7. Triston McKenzie

This trio will round out the rotation throughout the season two at a time. All three were once top-100 prospects (McKenzie still is) who eased Chris Antonetti’s conscience as he dealt away one core rotation piece after another. McKenzie dazzled during a month-long cameo last summer; now he needs to prove he can increase his workload while avoiding injury. How many of this trio will establish themselves as reliable effective starters? The answer to that question should offer plenty of insight into the team’s potential in the near future.

6. Josh Naylor

One of these 20-somethings has to enjoy a breakout season at the plate right? (Maybe.) With chaos reigning supreme in center field and at first base Naylor could bring stability to right field (or first if he winds up there). He’s only 23 and doesn’t have a full season’s worth of plate appearances in the majors but the club is optimistic he can bloom into a steady hitter in the middle third of the lineup.



5. Aaron Civale

4. Zach Plesac

These two land a bit higher on the list because they’re expected to shoulder a heavier innings burden than Allen McKenzie and Quantrill. Plesac and Civale arrived at spring training ready to inherit a customary workload. There’s a bit of mystery about what each can accomplish though. They broke into the majors in 2019 helping to rescue a rotation that missed Kluber and Carlos Carrasco and bid farewell to Trevor Bauer. The 2020 campaign marked their first “full” season in the majors but it lasted only 60 games. Was Plesac’s eight-start sample a mirage or is he really a top-line starter? Can Civale’s revamped delivery help him miss more bats? If both take substantial steps forward this season Cleveland’s rotation will remain in excellent shape.



3. Franmil Reyes

They need pop (soda to those who reside outside of the Midwest) in the middle of the order and there’s no better candidate to provide it than the guy who has a penchant for muscling pitches into the seats in right-center field. Reyes socked 37 home runs in 2019 but only 10 after his midsummer relocation to Cleveland. He hit only nine last season. Reyes insists the deadened baseball doesn’t bother him because he has the strength to swat it into orbit no matter its composition. This is a pivotal year for Reyes to prove he can serve as an imposing force who prevents pitchers from exhaling once they get past José Ramírez and Eddie Rosario in the batting order.



2. Shane Bieber

When considering his unparalleled dominance in 2020 it’s easy to overlook that he finished fourth in the American League Cy Young Award balloting in 2019. He didn’t just hoist a clear bat above his head after striking out a few National Leaguers in a mid-July exhibition that year; he blossomed into one of the league’s better starting pitchers. Bieber is a safe bet to again pitch like an ace in 2021 — his 12 strikeouts on Opening Day hinted as much — and anchor Cleveland’s young staff even if his numbers don’t quite match his historically elite statistics from a year ago. The rest of the rotation is short on experience and could endure some hiccups. With Bieber the only question is whether he’ll receive any run support.

1. José Ramírez

No single hitter can elevate an entire lineup to significant heights. Just ask Mike Trout. Ramírez was the AL MVP runner-up last season and the Indians still registered some bowling-shoe-ugly numbers on offense. But he’s still the heartbeat of Cleveland’s lineup the guy opposing pitchers pray avoids the batter’s box when the game hangs in the balance. Without a sterling season from Ramírez the lineup stands no chance.

Could this be the year after three top-three MVP finishes the past four seasons Ramírez finally captures the award?

“I never lose hope” he said. “One day it’ll happen.”

Hu-Tao possesses great power that can take out foes handily and her builds are also straightforward. Although there is one question that still needs to be answered. Is she a good choice for a free-to-play player who cannot pick up multiple copies and a special character weapon?

For such free-to-play players we have here a comprehensive guide to gauge whether Hu-Tao is a good choice or not.

Is constellation 0 Hu-Tao worth the pulls in Genshin Impact?

miHoYo has added a powerful Pyro character in Genshin Impact that is setting the game on fire. She certainly becomes an incredible DPS character with the Staff of Homa and with all her Constellation. However free-to-play users won’t get the same gear as the whales and this brings us back to the aforementioned question.

First up Hu-Tao has the lowest base attack among her 5-star character peers. Although she compensates for it with her elemental skill (E) that grants her immense attack boost. The character has a few downsides that free-to-play players will indeed encounter. She needs her first constellation unlocked to effectively deal damage as it removes stamina cost from her charge attack after using (E).

Although there is a workaround for the stamina issue which would involve mastering the charge attack and jump mechanic. At C0 she would indeed feel weak but there is more to her than just that. You can run her with Dragons Bane and Black Cliff polearm even with just refinement 1.

In case you have purchased Battle Pass then look no further than Death Match. This weapon will provide her with an adequate Crit rate boost and some useful attack buff.

Dragon’s Bane is perfect for F2P

The Dragon’s bane polearm amplifies damage against enemies affected with Pyro and Hydro elements. Hu-Tao can constantly apply Pyro on enemies which makes Dragon’s Bane a superb choice for free-to-play players. She can easily dish out 50K plus damage with an unoptimized build and if you happen to grab all the right artifacts Hu-Tao can scale past her peers.

The continued launch of so-called “mega-constellations” of satellites used to power global internet access has been met with concern by astronomers worldwide. Those astronomers worry that individual exposures of distant objects will be ruined by a satellite crossing in front of the telescope.

But new research recently appearing in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society paints an even more grim picture. As more and more satellites go up they each contribute a small amount to the overall brightness of the sky something called light pollution.

“Our primary motivation was to estimate the potential contribution to night sky brightness from external sources such as space objects in Earth’s orbit” said Miroslav Kocifaj of the Slovak Academy of Sciences and Comenius University in Slovakia who led the study. “We expected the sky brightness increase would be marginal if any but our first theoretical estimates have proved extremely surprising and thus encouraged us to report our results promptly.”

If all the planned mega-constellations go up within just a few years our sky will be 10% brighter across much of the planet. To estimate this result the research team took into consideration the individual shape reflectivity and orbit of the satellites as well as the contribution of random space junk like spent rocket boosters.

The end result is that even the most pristine places on Earth far away from any cities will still suffer.

“Unlike ground-based light pollution this kind of artificial light in the night sky can be seen across a large part of the Earth’s surface” explained John Barentine Director of Public Policy for the International Dark-Sky Association and a study co-author. “Astronomers build observatories far from city lights to seek dark skies but this form of light pollution has a much larger geographical reach.”

The researchers hope that this will spurn satellite makers to take the worries of astronomers seriously and continue to develop aggressive mitigation strategies.

“Our results imply that many more people than just astronomers stand to lose access to pristine night skies” Barentine said. “This paper may really change the nature of that conversation.”",,,,,,,,,

Dominick Fazzary carried 15 times for 139 yards and a touchdown.

Owen Scholtisek ran 11 times for 99 yards caught two balls for 19 yards and scored two touchdowns.

Travon Jones added 72 yards on 10 rushes and 30 receiving yards on three catches.

WG/O-M quarterback Cameron Holland completed six of 13 passes for 50 yards and ran for a touchdown.

Anthony Ricauter-Minelli Scholtisek Fazzary and Cayden Confer had four tackles each for WG/O-M.

Groton had 271 yards of offense and dropped to 1-1. The Indians were also off last week when they were scheduled to face Ithaca.

OnePlus 8 Pro vs OnePlus 7T Pro design and display Looking at the front the OnePlus 8 Pro is clearly larger than the OnePlus 7T Pro. The display is 6.78 inches compared to the 6.67-inch screen on the older phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is also a bit less rounded compared to the 2019 7T Pro. However the biggest difference is that the OnePlus 8 Pro returns its front-facing selfie camera to its display. The punch-hole camera sensor is played on the top left side.

The OnePlus 7T Pro famously used the pop-up selfie camera in order to have a higher screen-to-body ratio. It’s looking like the pop-up selfie camera trend is pretty much over before it really began.

The AMOLED display on the OnePlus 7T Pro supports a 90Hz refresh rate while the OnePlus 8 Pro jumps that support up to 120Hz. This makes it great for playing games and scrolling around the user interface. Furthermore the OnePlus 8 Pro’s display is actually the best we’ve ever tested.

The back of the OnePlus 8 Pro includes basically the same rear-camera setup in the top middle but there are a couple of extra sensors placed to the left side of the main camera bank this time. The new OnePlus logo design is also on the OnePlus 8 Pro on the bottom of the device.

OnePlus 8 Pro vs OnePlus 7T Pro processor and memory The OnePlus 8 Pro has the fastest mobile processor you can currently get the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865. The OnePlus 7T Pro has last year’s champion the Snapdragon 855 Plus. The OnePlus 8 Pro comes in 8GB and 12GB of RAM models while the OnePlus 7T Pro was only sold with an 8GB model. The RAM on the new model uses the faster LPDDR5 memory compared to the LPDDR4X RAM on the OnePlus 7T Pro. The OnePlus 8 Pro has 128GB and 256GB storage options while the OnePlus 7T Pro just has the 256GB storage model. Both phones use the fast UFS 3.0 standard.

OnePlus 8 Pro vs OnePlus 7T Pro cameras

David Imel / Android Authority

The OnePlus 8 Pro has a sizable camera upgrade. While both phones have a 48MP sensor as their main camera the OnePlus 8 Pro boosts its wide-angle camera to 48MP as well compared to the 16MP wide-angle sensor found on the OnePlus 7T Pro. The telephoto sensor on the OnePlus 8 Pro is 12MP but it still outputs 8MP images. The OnePlus 7T Pro has an 8MP telephoto sensor.

In addition the OnePlus 8 Pro has a 5MP color filter which is used to take images with different spectrums of light. This means images taken with the filter can radically change the color of the objects that appear in your photos. As we mentioned the 16MP front-facing camera on the new phone is on the top-left side of the front display. The OnePlus 7T Pro’s 16MP front-camera used the pop-up design.

OnePlus 8 Pro vs OnePlus 7T Pro battery The OnePlus 8 Pro has a much bigger 4510mAh battery compared to the 4050mAh battery on the OnePlus 7T Pro. Both phones use the Warp Charge 30T tech for fast charging. The OnePlus 8 Pro should charge up to over half its capacity in just 23 minutes.

However the OnePlus 8 Pro beats the OnePlus 7T Pro hands down when it comes to wireless charging. The OnePlus 7T Pro didn’t support wireless charging at all. If you purchase the optional Warp Charge 30 wireless charger the OnePlus 8 Pro will charge wirelessly at about the same speed as its wired charging rate. There’s also support for reverse wireless charging for the OnePlus 8 Pro but it’s pretty slow at just 3W.

Other features

Both phones have an in-display fingerprint sensor. Both also use OnePlus’s OxygenOS and Android 10. There’s not a ton of bloatware on OnePlus 8 Pro and it includes support for Dark Mode 2.0 which adds a dark mode to many popular apps that don’t natively support it. Finally the OnePlus 8 Pro officially has an IP68 water and dust resistance rating compared to no such rating at all on the OnePlus 7T Pro.

Launch price When it launched the OnePlus 7T Pro had a starting price of £699 (~$762). That price point while still higher than previous OnePlus phones still made the OnePlus 7T Pro more affordable compared to other flagship devices with most of the same specs. If you wanted to get the limited McLaren Edition with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage you had to pay much more. It’s sold by T-Mobile for $699 after a $200 price cut.

The OnePlus 8 Pro is definitely much more expensive from the jump compared to the standard OnePlus 7T Pro. It normally starts at $899 with 128GB of storage and at $999 with 256GB of storage. That may turn off many people who expect something with a lower price from OnePlus. However compared to the normal price of Samsung’s Galaxy S20 Plus ($1199) the OnePlus 8 Pro still offers a lot of value. Recently the company cut the price of the phone. It’s available directly from OnePlus at $799 if you get the Glacial Green color which has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. For the same price you can get the phone with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in Onyx Black or Ultramarine Blue colors.

OnePlus 8 Pro Killer flagship OnePlus is all grown up. With the OnePlus 8 Pro you get an unabashed flagship with all the bells and whistles. Powerful specs an amazing display fast wireless charging and water resistance make the OnePlus 8 Pro a great alternative to the Galaxy S20 Plus and it's up to $300 cheaper.

OnePlus is known as one of the best smartphones in the market in every segment except for the camera. But this time it might just have overcome that weakness. Not only in the camera segment but the new OnePlus 9 series also offers several additional features that make the new phones a significant upgrade over the OnePlus 8 lineup.

The OnePlus 9 series has not been launched in Nepal yet but it will soon be on the market. So let’s see what new things it has brought for the users.

Camera

The most awaited feature in the new OnePlus 9 series is its camera. The smartphone company has collaborated with the Hasselblad camera brand to step up its camera game. The OnePlus 9 has a triple camera setup on its back. The primary is a 48MP omnidirectional PDAF camera which is backed up by another 50MP ultrawide camera and 2MP depth sensors. The camera has the feature of Hasselblad colour calibration.

OnePlus 9 Pro meanwhile packs a quad-camera setup on its back. The Pro has an additional optical zoom laser autofocus module and an extra microphone on the back. The extra microphone helps in noise reduction while recording videos. The phone has a 48 MP primary camera along with a 50MP ultrawide camera and a 2MP depth sensor. There is an additional 8MP telephoto lens that has a 3.3x optical zoom.

Both phones have a 16MP selfie camera which has an auto-HDR feature and records videos in 1080p @ 30fps. Also both phones can record videos up to 8k@ 30fps from their rear cameras. Meanwhile you can record a 4K video up to 120fps in 9 Pro which is limited to 60fps in OnePlus 9. There is also a dual-LED flash on both devices.

Performance and battery life

The OnePlus 9 series is powered by Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and runs on Android 11 with OxygenOS 11. This is a huge improvement in the performance of CPU and GPU than its predecessor OnePlus 8 series. The chipset this phone has is probably the best chipset a smartphone can have right now.

The OnePlus 9 series is backed up by a 4500mAh non-removable battery. Both these phones can be charged from 1-100% in just 29 minutes through a 65W fast charging which is insane. You only need to charge for half an hour and you can use your phone the whole day. Both phones support wireless charging but the OnePlus 9 Pro holds a massive advantage here over the OnePlus 9. The Pro version has a 50W fast wireless charging over 15W of the OnePlus 9. The Pro gets 1-100% in just 43 minutes through wireless charging.

Storage and connectivity

The OnePlus 9 series can be found in two variants: 8/128 and 2/256 GB options. Like traditional OnePlus there is no MicroSD card option to extend the storage of the phone.

Both devices support dual nano sim cards. There is no 3.5mm headphone jack on the devices. Both devices support Wi-Fi 802.11 and Bluetooth 5.2. They also use USB type-C 3.1 and both of them support a 5G network.

The OnePlus 9 series has not been officially released in the Nepali market yet but it should be on its way. The expected price of the OnePlus 9 is Rs 80000 for 8/128GB and 90000 for 12/256 GB variant whereas the OnePlus 9 Pro can cost up to Rs 105000 for 8/128GB and 115000 for 12/256GB variant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnl1Z2F0ZWNoLmNvbS9tb2JpbGUvcmVhbG1lLXg3LXByby11bHRyYS1ub3ctb2ZmaWNpYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,realme X7 Pro Ultra now official » YugaTech | Philippines Tech News & Reviews,"realme has released a new smartphone in China sporting a 6.55-inch AMOLED screen with curved edges and 90Hz refresh rate MediaTek Dimensity 1000+ SoC triple-rear cameras 5G connectivity and 4500mAh battery the realme X7 Pro Ultra.

“Lili makes a lot of noise when she sleeps. Like she’s a sleep talker. She told me this because she downloaded an app where you can record yourself sleeping and see if you say anything” Mendes 26 explained exclusively to Us Weekly on Monday March 30 while promoting her partnership with Secret. “I think it’s more to measure how long you sleep and if you sleep well that night but it’ll record you when you’re making noises.”

The Palm Springs star added: “Lili played some for Madelaine [Petsch] and me and we were dying of laughter. She like mumbles so much and that’s something I never knew until this season.”

People with diabetes could be seeing a turning point in ease of obtaining supplies for continuous glucose monitors as more of these products make their way into local pharmacies. While CGMs have traditionally only been available direct from the manufacturer or third-party supply distributors they’re now finally making their way onto the shelves of local pharmacies and even Costco stores around the country. For example the Dexcom G6 receivers transmitters and sensors are sold at discounted prices in Costco Pharmacies for the bulk chain’s member customers. Opinions may vary on just how good those discounts are but another big benefit for customers is that instead of waiting weeks for supplies to arrive in the mail you may be able to walk out the door of your local pharmacy in a day or two with everything you need. Along with Dexcom the Abbott FreeStyle Libre system supplies are also available at pharmacies and CGM maker Medtronic Diabetes is exploring pharmacy availability too. The takeaway is that lower-cost and more readily accessible purchase options are a must for any company wanting to succeed in the growing CGM market — that’s set to expand broadly to consumers even beyond those with diabetes.

How much do CGMs cost at the pharmacy? As always insurance coverage varies by type so the cost to each individual will depend on whether one even has pharmacy coverage for CGMs and what copays or deductibles may apply. To keep it simple here are the retail cash prices of the two systems currently available in pharmacies: Dexcom Users are thrilled to see the leading CGM on the market becoming more ubiquitously available. At local pharmacies: Around the United States in CVS Walgreens and many other retailers cash prices vary but most locations we queried quoted the price for a G6 transmitter at just under $300 while a three-pack box of G6 sensors runs ~$400. Remember too: Insurance may cover CGM supplies as a pharmacy benefit meaning you could find these available at local or mail-order pharmacies for a flat copay or with varying coinsurance and deductible amounts applied. At Costco: To get the Costco pricing you of course need to be a Costco member ($60) and also sign up for their free pharmacy program. As of April 2021 the Costco Pharmacy membership cash prices are as follows based on the latest company info online: G6 transmitter: $277.62 each (or membership discount price: $132.24)

Box of G6 sensors (three pack): $384.60 (or $303.74 membership discount price)

G6 receiver: $417.92 each (or $203.29 membership discount price) Note that you may see online search results showing varying price points based on an older Costco Pharmacy deal. That earlier discount was dramatically lower: a G6 transmitter only cost $28.88 and a G6 touchscreen receiver cost $35.96! Since Costco discount prices are periodically adjusted be sure to check in advance of driving to the store to purchase. These Costco prices are self-pay only as insurance isn’t applicable there (also not Medicare or Medicaid). So for anyone who may have a lower insurance copay or deductible requirement they may be better off sticking with their traditional purchase channels. Share on Pinterest Photo: DiabetesMine Caution: Unfortunately lots of patients and even many Costco pharmacy folks are unaware of this savings program. So if asked Costco employees may quote much higher prices up to $1100 for a single box of sensors — ugh! We’re also hearing that some Costco pharmacists have been insisting that they must check insurance and that this G6 discount only applies if you’ve already been denied insurance coverage which is NOT TRUE as we have confirmed with Costco corporate contacts. Be sure to be insistent if you encounter this barrier. Freestyle Libre The Abbott Freestyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) system is not (yet) what many consider to be a full-featured CGM with real-time glucose alerts for High and Low readings but it does qualify as a continuous sensor and is growing in popularity. This system has been available through national pharmacies like Costco CVS Kroger Walgreens and Rite Aid since it launched in late 2017. Senior public affairs manager Jennifer Heth at Abbott tells us that a majority of their 500000 users in the United States are already getting their Libre 14-day-wear sensors through retail pharmacies. Notably Abbott says the Libre costs 70 percent less than the list price of other CGM systems currently available. Here are the approximate prices for the Libre system in pharmacies: List price of $54 per sensor according to Abbott (though retail pharmacies like Costco and Walgreens quote prices of $58–69)

With commercial insurance most patients pay between $10 and $75 per month for Libre 14-day sensors at participating pharmacies

Handheld reader: $70 (though the separate receiver isn’t required as users can opt to use the FreeStyle LibreLink mobile app for iOS or Android for no charge) Abbott tells us that building out their pharmacy purchase channel is an “area of focus” for the company that started in 2020. “Pharmacists play a central role in patient care and are valued for their impact on improving outcomes for people living with diabetes” Heth says. “Abbott is dedicated to providing education on the rapidly evolving diabetes technology… Abbott has provided educational grant support for pharmacist continuing education programs with the American Pharmacists Association Pharmacy Times among others.” Heth also tells us that in addition to national and online programs Abbott provides live peer-to-peer training sessions for pharmacists and webinars on the clinical application of FreeStyle Libre and CGM report interpretation using the Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) a standardized one-page report that visually summarizes glucose trend data. Medtronic and Eversense CGMs: Not in pharmacies Sorry friends. Medtronic confirms that it will be a while before their CGM supplies hit the pharmacy channel. Spokeswoman Pam Reese director of global communications for Medtronic Diabetes tells us: “We are currently exploring pharmacy options for our CGM. We have some pharmacy access already and are continuing to build our own internal pharmacy operations. In addition we are exploring a retail pharmacy strategy.” It makes sense that the fourth CGM sensor on the market the implantable Eversense from Senseonics would not be available in pharmacies. This sensor must be implanted under the skin via a minimal surgical incision procedure by a qualified doctor. Still we asked the company about any plans to sell supplies (replacement transmitters or charging cords) in pharmacies. Senseonics’ director of global PR and brand marketing Karen Hynes says no explaining: “If Eversense is covered under someone’s pharmacy benefit it would be mail ordered and shipped directly to the healthcare provider who is placing the sensor. Otherwise it would go through the DME (durable medical equipment) channel and would be shipped to the healthcare provider.”

Why is CGM access in pharmacies taking so long? The effort to make CGM supplies more readily available for retail purchase began back in 2015 when a half-dozen or more insurance plans began covering CGM supplies in a different way than they traditionally had. They recategorized these devices as a “pharmacy benefit” rather than the traditional classification as “durable medical equipment” (DME). This meant people with certain plans would no longer be bound to buying supplies from designated third-party medical equipment suppliers or directly from the manufacturer but rather could purchase them wherever medications are sold. Anthem and UnitedHealthcare (UHC) were among the big insurance carriers taking that important first step toward eventual over-the-counter access to CGM supplies in local pharmacy chains like CVS or Walgreens. Other insurers have moved in this direction over time. Even with some insurers now classifying CGM as a pharmacy benefit it remains a “Your Insurance Coverage May Vary” situation in terms of how much any individual might pay for supplies — some plans require only a low fixed copay applied to all pharmacy benefit items while others require coinsurance where you pay a percentage of the actual cost of the item. Still other plans require that you meet an annual deductible before any copay or coinsurance kicks in. It all varies. Currently most CGM users are still purchasing their supplies from designated third-party medical equipment vendors or directly from the manufacturer. Per Dexcom’s talking points pharmacy distribution allows for “a more seamless experience for physicians and patients changing the once eight-step month-long distribution process into four simple steps that enable a patient to get their Dexcom device in as few as 1–2 days through their pharmacist.” When Dexcom began planning for pharmacy availability several years ago (during the early G5 model days) it pushed for access by mail-order as well as in retail pharmacies — including “drop shipments” of orders prepared for pickup 24 hours in advance. Presumably that “just in time” shipping policy was meant to avoid pharmacies stockpiling expired sensors that they can’t sell or running out of supplies. Going into 2020 Dexcom is pushing for an increase in its CGM business going through pharmacy channels by as much as 70 percent of their sensor business to be exact. After 2019 the CGM manufacturer says it has now crossed the threshold of supplying more than 50 percent of its CGM supplies through pharmacies.

Walgreens makes CGM history Walgreens made headlines in 2019 with its pharmacy expansion for the Dexcom G6 especially for Medicare beneficiaries who can now obtain their CGM supplies within that local pharmacy. Many Dexcom customers who use Walgreens have also started receiving automated emails and messages about syncing pharmacy and CGM accounts for more efficiency. In fact Walgreens’ Find Care marketplace introduced a program in 2019 in which interested people with diabetes can proactively request a prescription for the Dexcom G6. They simply complete a questionnaire that is sent to their healthcare provider for review and potential prescription. No doubt as the next-generation Dexcom-Verily G7 product (designed to be more consumer friendly fully disposable and lower cost) moves forward and launches in 2021 we will see more big pharmacy chains adding CGM tech to their shelves. Still overall use of CGMs among people with type 1 diabetes remains low at about 35 percent. This is attributed in part to provider reluctance to prescribe the system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNub3Blcy5jb20vZmFjdC1jaGVjay9zYWxtb24tYnVyZ2VyLXJlY2FsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco Salmon Burgers Being Recalled Over Fears They 'May Contain Small Pieces of Metal',"Claim: Salmon burgers sold at some Costco stores were recalled in March 2021 because they “may contain small pieces of metal.” Rating: About this rating True

In March 2021 Trident Seafoods issued a voluntary recall for a single lot of its Pacific salmon burgers sold in some Costco stores over concerns that the patties “may contain small pieces of metal.”

An announcement of the recall was shared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 27 2021. The source of the small pieces of metal had not been identified as of this writing but the agency noted that no injuries or illness related to the recalled products had occurred.

The recall included all Pacific Salmon Burgers with the lot number GC101431 and a “best by” date of Jan. 14 2023. It is not known how many burgers were affected by the recall but the company said that it includes those sold in Costco stores located in Wichita Kansas as well as those in the states of Alabama Florida Georgia Louisiana Mississippi North Carolina Oklahoma South Carolina Tennessee and Texas along with the territory of Puerto Rico:

Trident Seafoods is advising anyone possessing with any burgers from that lot number to return the product to their local Costco store for a full refund.

MARYLAND — Easter Sunday dinner can often prompt a last-minute run to a grocery store for whipped topping or rolls but some of the most popular grocery stores in Maryland either won't be open or will have limited hours on the holiday which falls on April 4.

National chains are varied in their opening plans for the holiday celebrated across Christian faiths. At least 38 chain stores plan to close for Easter with at least 23 opening for at least a part of it according to a list from the coupon company RetailMeNot. Walmart Rite Aid and Safeway are among the grocery giants staying open for at least part of the day the list shows. At least two stores that require a membership to shop there Sam’s Club and Costco will be closed however.

Target Pharmacy stores with locations all over the country — such as CVS Duane Reade and Walgreens — will largely be open for their regular Sunday business hours. Kroger will be open for grocery shopping but its pharmacy will be closed.

Although the coronavirus vaccine rollout continues and many states are lifting pandemic-related restrictions the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still urges people to limit grocery trips and use curbside pickup or delivery options when possible to limit the virus's spread."

The Surprising Connection Between The Crown And Downton Abbey

The Crown and Downton Abbey two of the most acclaimed period dramas of all time share a surprising connection even the most devoted of fans may have missed. Viewers of The Crown likely remember Porchie a recurring character throughout the first three seasons who was a close friend of Queen Elizabeth's. Well Porchie is Henry Herbert the 7th Earl of Carnarvon also known as a member of the family that owns Highclere Castle a.k.a. the real Downton Abbey.

In The Crown seasons 1-3 Porchie is portrayed as a childhood friend of Queen Elizabeth's who she's still quite close to. In fact the show hints the pair might harbor unrequited romantic feelings for one another. But in real life the Queen is actually godmother to Porchie's son George Reginald Oliver Molyneux Herbert and the duo were far more likely to bond over their shared love of horses than to harbor any romantic feelings for one another.

During a June 2012 interview with The Telegraph Porchie's son opened up about his father's friendship with England's queen. ""It was a very equal friendship ranging over many interests"" he said. ""They were from the same generation. They had been through the war. They shared a great love of the countryside and wildlife as well as horses. Whether they were walking at Sandringham Highclere or in Scotland it was always a great obsession.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVycG9vbGVjaG8uY28udWsvbmV3cy9saXZlcnBvb2wtbmV3cy9ob3ctdHdvLWxpdmVycG9vbHMtbW9zdC1mYW1vdXMtMjAzMDI3MzjSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlcnBvb2xlY2hvLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvbGl2ZXJwb29sLW5ld3MvaG93LXR3by1saXZlcnBvb2xzLW1vc3QtZmFtb3VzLTIwMzAyNzM4LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How two of Liverpool's most famous streets got their names,"Castle Street and Church Street are two of Liverpool city centre's most famous roads.

Before coronavirus thousands upon thousands of people walked down them daily and will again once life returns to some normality when lockdown restrictions are fully lifted.

But the two city centre streets have more in common than location - they gained their names literally from the long-vanished buildings that used to stand there.

And though the historic buildings themselves are long gone there are still reminders of them if you know where to look.

Castle Street

The street is named after the medieval castle that stood on the site now occupied by Derby Square and Liverpool Crown Court.

The spot chosen for the Castle of Liverpool was a plateau overlooking the River Mersey - a good vantage point to spy out the approach of any potential enemy.

It was built as a result of King John issuing a Letters Patents popularly known as the Royal Charter to Liverpool on August 28 1207 – at a time when the tiny fishing port was becoming an important trading centre.

The castle is believed to have been constructed around 1235 although some records suggest it could have been as early as 1208.

Built from sandstone and designed to be self-supporting in times of siege the castle had four towers and was surrounded by a dry moat.

Historians believe the main entrance faced what we now know as Castle Street with what is now the Victoria Monument in the middle of the castle site.

It included an orchard a chapel a bakehouse and a herb garden.

The commanding structure had a gatehouse flanked by two towers at the north east corner facing Castle Street and its footprint was around the same size as Harlech Castle in Wales.

Some of the most dramatic scenes of Liverpool's history were played out in the shadow of the castle during the civil war.

In May 1643 the Parliamentarians took the city and the crucial supply route to Ireland.

Royalists gained control of the fortress in 1644 but only after suffering the loss of 1500 men in one week of fighting.

Once the Royalists were defeated Parliament ordered the demolition of the castle. By the early 1700s it was in ruins and being used as a shelter for the homeless.

The site was given to the Mayor and Corporation of Liverpool at an annual rent of £6 13s and 4d (£6.67).

St George’s Church was built there in 1734 and stood on the site until 1899.

Apart from the name Castle Street there are other reminders of Liverpool's former castle stronghold.

A bronze plaque dedicated to the Castle of Liverpool can be found in the stonework of the Queen Victoria monument unveiled on October 11 1902.

The whole area was the subject of an architectural dig in 1976 before contractors moved in to build the court complex.

Some believe remains of the 13th-century stronghold including dungeons are still underneath Derby Square.

The crown court building itself was built to resemble a castle as a reminder of what once stood on that site.

Church Street

It takes its name from St Peter's church which once stood where the entrance to Liverpool ONE is now.

And it wasn't just any church either: it was actually Liverpool’s Anglican pro-cathedral a church that serves as a temporary cathedral while the true one was being built.

The church was opened in 1704 but became the seat of the Bishop in 1880 when the Bishopric of Liverpool was created by Queen Victoria at the same time that that town was granted city status.

(Image: Hidden Liverpool)

In 1919 the Anglican Church sold the land occupied by St Peter’s church to Liverpool Corporation to build funds for the new cathedral - it was then sold on to Woolworths.

St Peter's Church was demolished in 1922 - but that doesn't mean all traces of the church have been lost.

There are several subtle hints to the church's existence along Church Street including the names of the surrounding streets such as Church Alley and Peter's Lane.

(Image: Liverpool Echo)

The throughway to Peter's Lane from Church Street is even called Keys Court a reference to the Keys of St Peter - and if you look high above the entrance to Keys Court nowadays you'll see a carving of those keys.

For those seeking to look even closer there's an even smaller indication of the church's existence hidden on the flagstones of Church Street.

Embedded in the pavement outside of Keys Court there is a small brass cross made from melted-down alter rails of the demolished church - which marks the entrance to the church in years gone by.",,,,,,,,,

Thunder Mountain High School played host to Ketchikan Wrangell Petersburg Sitka and Mt. Edgecumbe for the Brandon Pilot Invitational Friday and Saturday. The tournament kicked off a high school wrestling season that’s been repeatedly delayed and shortened by pandemic concerns.

While team scores weren’t kept at this year’s invitational TMHS wrestling coach Josh Houston said he was pleased with the team’s showing.

“As a whole we did pretty well” Houston said. He added he’s pleased that the tournament was able to happen at all.

Houston said while the team may not have a lot of experience with high school wrestling many of the members come with prior wrestling experience either through club or middle school wrestling.

“We’ve got a fairly young team but a lot of the guys come with a bunch of experience” Houston said.

Five members of the team took first place in their respective weight classes and four TMHS wrestlers went undefeated across both days of the tournament.

[Juneau Dance teams earn superior ratings]

The four undefeated first-place finishers were sophomore Carson Cummins who went 6-0 and won the 112-pound bracket (Cummins normally wrestles at 103 pounds); senior Nate Houston who went 6-0 and finished first among 125-pounders; sophomore 171-pounder Jamal Johnson; and senior Camden Erickson who went 7-0 at 215 pounds.

Sophomore Sage Richards went 4-1 and came in first in the 189-pound division.

Houston said he expects those standouts to have exceptional seasons this year.

In light of multiple pandemic-related delays to the start of the wrestling season Houston said there are some things he —and just about every other wrestling coach in the region —will be working to improve as the season goes on.

“I told some of the guys ‘Every coach will go to practice Monday and talk about conditioning’” Houston said. “We’ll try to get as prepared as we can for a very short season.”

Senator Cummins said Sinn Féin have not been fully truthful about their online affairs this week regarding the party’s complex transnational digital set up which stretches across Serbia the US Germany Ireland and the United Kingdom.

“Today we learn a professional digital company headed by a former Facebook executive has been contracted to work for both Sinn Féin while also providing consultancy to their fundraising wing in the United States Friends of Sinn Féin which by law cannot contribute anything to Sinn Féin’s Irish operation.

“While other parties worked within the confines of rigid financing laws that we introduced Sinn Fein has established a labyrinth of a social media management system which requires immediate examination.

“This is Sinn Féin’s social media output meets Ardoyne via Manhattan and the Balkans.

“We know the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) have already investigated aspects of Sinn Féin’s funding and financing and referred some of it the Electoral Commission of Northern Ireland.

“We need to lift the lid on this now and SIPO need to fully investigate this immediately with the full extent of their powers.

“On Monday Sinn Féin said they ‘have two party supporters who occasionally help out our social media team’. Today we learn it is a contracted private company managing their social media from Serbia.

“Why did Sinn Féin not admit this when first asked just days ago? Why did they describe them as supporters and not employees or contractors? Why not be truthful?

“Did Sinn Féin only formalise the relationship with this company since media queries came in this week? Is this business relationship reflected in their SIPO returns?

“Friends of Sinn Fein (FOSF) in the US have employed a top social media company as per their filed returns under the Foreign Agents Registration Act for the period November 2019 to October 2020.

“Later in the year we’re thinking of launching a China fund to address China investment” Daisy Cai said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday. The country could make up roughly about a third to 40% of B Capital’s global fund she added.

The U.S. currently accounts for slightly more than half of B Capital’s global investment while South and Southeast Asia Latin America and Europe make up the rest.

Saverin’s Venture Firm Enters China With Ex-SoftBank Partner

B Capital hired Cai a former SoftBank Vision Fund partner to run a team of about 10 investment professionals initially from Hong Kong and focus on Chinese tech startups serving businesses in health care financial services and transportation among others. As general partner at B Capital which Saverin founded with former Bain Capital executive Raj Ganguly in 2015 she’s tasked with helping expand the young venture house’s global footprint.

Cai said B Capital recently invested in Xingyun Group which helps international brands expand their e-commerce operations in China. It’s also looking at backing a major auto parts retail chain she added without naming the company.

“We believe that China is as big of an opportunity in the global tech market as the U.S.” Ganguly told Bloomberg News last week. Saverin added his firm will bet on startups serving businesses in China where “the economy is vast but tech innovation is still under-invested relative to the industrial sector.”

People with diabetes could be seeing a turning point in ease of obtaining supplies for continuous glucose monitors as more of these products make their way into local pharmacies. While CGMs have traditionally only been available direct from the manufacturer or third-party supply distributors they’re now finally making their way onto the shelves of local pharmacies and even Costco stores around the country. For example the Dexcom G6 receivers transmitters and sensors are sold at discounted prices in Costco Pharmacies for the bulk chain’s member customers. Opinions may vary on just how good those discounts are but another big benefit for customers is that instead of waiting weeks for supplies to arrive in the mail you may be able to walk out the door of your local pharmacy in a day or two with everything you need. Along with Dexcom the Abbott FreeStyle Libre system supplies are also available at pharmacies and CGM maker Medtronic Diabetes is exploring pharmacy availability too. The takeaway is that lower-cost and more readily accessible purchase options are a must for any company wanting to succeed in the growing CGM market — that’s set to expand broadly to consumers even beyond those with diabetes.

How much do CGMs cost at the pharmacy? As always insurance coverage varies by type so the cost to each individual will depend on whether one even has pharmacy coverage for CGMs and what copays or deductibles may apply. To keep it simple here are the retail cash prices of the two systems currently available in pharmacies: Dexcom Users are thrilled to see the leading CGM on the market becoming more ubiquitously available. At local pharmacies: Around the United States in CVS Walgreens and many other retailers cash prices vary but most locations we queried quoted the price for a G6 transmitter at just under $300 while a three-pack box of G6 sensors runs ~$400. Remember too: Insurance may cover CGM supplies as a pharmacy benefit meaning you could find these available at local or mail-order pharmacies for a flat copay or with varying coinsurance and deductible amounts applied. At Costco: To get the Costco pricing you of course need to be a Costco member ($60) and also sign up for their free pharmacy program. As of April 2021 the Costco Pharmacy membership cash prices are as follows based on the latest company info online: G6 transmitter: $277.62 each (or membership discount price: $132.24)

Box of G6 sensors (three pack): $384.60 (or $303.74 membership discount price)

G6 receiver: $417.92 each (or $203.29 membership discount price) Note that you may see online search results showing varying price points based on an older Costco Pharmacy deal. That earlier discount was dramatically lower: a G6 transmitter only cost $28.88 and a G6 touchscreen receiver cost $35.96! Since Costco discount prices are periodically adjusted be sure to check in advance of driving to the store to purchase. These Costco prices are self-pay only as insurance isn’t applicable there (also not Medicare or Medicaid). So for anyone who may have a lower insurance copay or deductible requirement they may be better off sticking with their traditional purchase channels. Share on Pinterest Photo: DiabetesMine Caution: Unfortunately lots of patients and even many Costco pharmacy folks are unaware of this savings program. So if asked Costco employees may quote much higher prices up to $1100 for a single box of sensors — ugh! We’re also hearing that some Costco pharmacists have been insisting that they must check insurance and that this G6 discount only applies if you’ve already been denied insurance coverage which is NOT TRUE as we have confirmed with Costco corporate contacts. Be sure to be insistent if you encounter this barrier. Freestyle Libre The Abbott Freestyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) system is not (yet) what many consider to be a full-featured CGM with real-time glucose alerts for High and Low readings but it does qualify as a continuous sensor and is growing in popularity. This system has been available through national pharmacies like Costco CVS Kroger Walgreens and Rite Aid since it launched in late 2017. Senior public affairs manager Jennifer Heth at Abbott tells us that a majority of their 500000 users in the United States are already getting their Libre 14-day-wear sensors through retail pharmacies. Notably Abbott says the Libre costs 70 percent less than the list price of other CGM systems currently available. Here are the approximate prices for the Libre system in pharmacies: List price of $54 per sensor according to Abbott (though retail pharmacies like Costco and Walgreens quote prices of $58–69)

With commercial insurance most patients pay between $10 and $75 per month for Libre 14-day sensors at participating pharmacies

Handheld reader: $70 (though the separate receiver isn’t required as users can opt to use the FreeStyle LibreLink mobile app for iOS or Android for no charge) Abbott tells us that building out their pharmacy purchase channel is an “area of focus” for the company that started in 2020. “Pharmacists play a central role in patient care and are valued for their impact on improving outcomes for people living with diabetes” Heth says. “Abbott is dedicated to providing education on the rapidly evolving diabetes technology… Abbott has provided educational grant support for pharmacist continuing education programs with the American Pharmacists Association Pharmacy Times among others.” Heth also tells us that in addition to national and online programs Abbott provides live peer-to-peer training sessions for pharmacists and webinars on the clinical application of FreeStyle Libre and CGM report interpretation using the Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) a standardized one-page report that visually summarizes glucose trend data. Medtronic and Eversense CGMs: Not in pharmacies Sorry friends. Medtronic confirms that it will be a while before their CGM supplies hit the pharmacy channel. Spokeswoman Pam Reese director of global communications for Medtronic Diabetes tells us: “We are currently exploring pharmacy options for our CGM. We have some pharmacy access already and are continuing to build our own internal pharmacy operations. In addition we are exploring a retail pharmacy strategy.” It makes sense that the fourth CGM sensor on the market the implantable Eversense from Senseonics would not be available in pharmacies. This sensor must be implanted under the skin via a minimal surgical incision procedure by a qualified doctor. Still we asked the company about any plans to sell supplies (replacement transmitters or charging cords) in pharmacies. Senseonics’ director of global PR and brand marketing Karen Hynes says no explaining: “If Eversense is covered under someone’s pharmacy benefit it would be mail ordered and shipped directly to the healthcare provider who is placing the sensor. Otherwise it would go through the DME (durable medical equipment) channel and would be shipped to the healthcare provider.”

Why is CGM access in pharmacies taking so long? The effort to make CGM supplies more readily available for retail purchase began back in 2015 when a half-dozen or more insurance plans began covering CGM supplies in a different way than they traditionally had. They recategorized these devices as a “pharmacy benefit” rather than the traditional classification as “durable medical equipment” (DME). This meant people with certain plans would no longer be bound to buying supplies from designated third-party medical equipment suppliers or directly from the manufacturer but rather could purchase them wherever medications are sold. Anthem and UnitedHealthcare (UHC) were among the big insurance carriers taking that important first step toward eventual over-the-counter access to CGM supplies in local pharmacy chains like CVS or Walgreens. Other insurers have moved in this direction over time. Even with some insurers now classifying CGM as a pharmacy benefit it remains a “Your Insurance Coverage May Vary” situation in terms of how much any individual might pay for supplies — some plans require only a low fixed copay applied to all pharmacy benefit items while others require coinsurance where you pay a percentage of the actual cost of the item. Still other plans require that you meet an annual deductible before any copay or coinsurance kicks in. It all varies. Currently most CGM users are still purchasing their supplies from designated third-party medical equipment vendors or directly from the manufacturer. Per Dexcom’s talking points pharmacy distribution allows for “a more seamless experience for physicians and patients changing the once eight-step month-long distribution process into four simple steps that enable a patient to get their Dexcom device in as few as 1–2 days through their pharmacist.” When Dexcom began planning for pharmacy availability several years ago (during the early G5 model days) it pushed for access by mail-order as well as in retail pharmacies — including “drop shipments” of orders prepared for pickup 24 hours in advance. Presumably that “just in time” shipping policy was meant to avoid pharmacies stockpiling expired sensors that they can’t sell or running out of supplies. Going into 2020 Dexcom is pushing for an increase in its CGM business going through pharmacy channels by as much as 70 percent of their sensor business to be exact. After 2019 the CGM manufacturer says it has now crossed the threshold of supplying more than 50 percent of its CGM supplies through pharmacies.

Walgreens makes CGM history Walgreens made headlines in 2019 with its pharmacy expansion for the Dexcom G6 especially for Medicare beneficiaries who can now obtain their CGM supplies within that local pharmacy. Many Dexcom customers who use Walgreens have also started receiving automated emails and messages about syncing pharmacy and CGM accounts for more efficiency. In fact Walgreens’ Find Care marketplace introduced a program in 2019 in which interested people with diabetes can proactively request a prescription for the Dexcom G6. They simply complete a questionnaire that is sent to their healthcare provider for review and potential prescription. No doubt as the next-generation Dexcom-Verily G7 product (designed to be more consumer friendly fully disposable and lower cost) moves forward and launches in 2021 we will see more big pharmacy chains adding CGM tech to their shelves. Still overall use of CGMs among people with type 1 diabetes remains low at about 35 percent. This is attributed in part to provider reluctance to prescribe the system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9xdWVlbi1lbGl6YWJldGgtY29uc2lkZXJzLWhhcnJ5LWJpdC0xODMwMDAwMzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Queen Elizabeth Considers Harry a “Bit of a Lost Soul” Like Princess Margaret,"From Cosmopolitan

I’ll be honest the only knowledge I have about Princess Margaret is what I’ve watched on The Crown. I know I know. I’m a 20something American who didn’t exactly learn about the British royal family in history class. So can you blame me? With that said what I do know about the late Countess of Snowdon I like. That’s why it’s quite interesting that royal biographer Andrew Morton compares her with Prince Harry. Apparently the two second-borns have a lot in common and Queen Elizabeth knows it.

“I think the Queen knows that being the spare is hard and a part of her recognizes that Harry was sometimes a bit of a lost soul just like her sister” Morton tells Vanity Fair. His latest biography Elizabeth & Margaret: The Intimate World of the Windsor Sisters examines the sisters’ close yet often tense relationship. “She has always wanted to protect Harry and I think in part that’s because she watched Margaret fall victim to the system” he continues. “Shutting out Margaret didn’t help and the Queen has learned from that. She didn’t want history to repeat itself with Harry.”

Princess Margaret struggled to find her place within the monarchy and since Harry chose to step down from his duties as a senior royal it does make sense that he takes after his great-aunt.

Andrew explains “When you compare personalities Harry is like Margaret a royal rebel. Margaret once said ‘Disobedience is my joy’ and you see some of that in Harry. The Queen also knew Margaret sometimes felt like an outsider and I think that’s why she has made sure the door is always open for Harry to return to the royal fold. She will have a lot of empathy and sympathy for him because she grew up watching her younger sister act the role of the spare which is not easy.”

While Harry and Margaret might be a tad more difficult to understand the Queen loves her grandson just like she loved her sister.

“She has a lot of affection for Harry. She was there the day Harry lost his mother and has been there for him ever since” he added. “She has deliberately taken him under her wing. I think as a grandmother she has been far more understanding than as a mother at times.”

You love all the deets on the royals. So do we! Let’s talk through them all here.

What Happened: One of the most surprising names in the new Ark space ETF was Deere & Company (NYSE: DE). The farm equipment maker is the 13th largest holding in the new ETF representing $10.8 million and 3.1% of the fund’s assets as of Thursday.

The inclusion shows Ark is not only including pure space companies. The fund also will hold companies that could benefit from the growth of space.

“Aerospace beneficiary companies are companies whose operations stand to benefit from aerospace activities including agriculture internet access global positioning system construction imaging drones air taxes and electric aviation vehicles” according to Ark Funds.

Why It’s Important: Since the 1990s John Deere has worked on using GPS technology to improve precision agriculture.

In 2018 John Deere partnered with NASA to improve its self-driving tractors. The company tapped into NASA’s global network of ground stations.

Most self-driving tractors cultivating the majority of American farmland rely on NASA technology. The NASA model for commercial software can help predict yields and classify land types using satellite imagery.

“This innovation resulted in perhaps one of NASA’s most important contributions to modern society — highly accurate GPS navigation anywhere on Earth including crop fields” the Food Institute said on the GPS improvements brought from NASA software.

The link between space and agriculture companies appears here to stay: In December 2020 NASA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture extended a long-standing partnership on space-based assets.

Ark Funds sees Deere & Company and other agricultural-related names such as top holding Trimble Inc (NASDAQ: TRMB) as winners in the growth of satellites and GPS.

DE Price Action: Shares of Deere & Company ended the week up 0.29% at $372.12.

The first iteration introduced in 2012 permitted combine drivers to take charge of the corn cart by synchronising guidance information once it was nearby easing the unloading process and minimising losses – particularly at night and at relatively high speeds.

But the same technology can now be used for any harvesting process where crops are continuously loaded into trailers.

In particular Deere is eyeing up customers working with trailed elevator machinery harvesting potatoes and carrots. It may also be useful for vegetable growers during planting applications.

The Machine Sync system requires JD Link telematics a Starfire satellite receiver and a Gen4 Premium 4600 or 4640 display with automation activation.

Most customers would select all these components ex-factory when ordering a new tractor or self-propelled machine although retrofitting is possible. The carting tractor must also be fitted with a stepless transmission.

It costs £1425 on machines with Autotrac activation or £425 for those with Premium activation.

Deere has also launched a new app developed by German start-up Solorrow that allows farmers to create variable rate application maps for fertiliser spreading and other field operations.

Maps can be sent wirelessly to machines in the field via the firm’s Operations Center.

The John Deere in-cab display receives the data and then gives the Isobus-controlled fertiliser spreader or sprayer the site-specific application rate based on its current position in the field.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvZXJpYy1ub3JkbWFuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTY5MTU4OTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eric Nordman Obituary (1945 - 2021) - Waterloo IA - Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/wcfcourier/name/eric-nordman-obituary?id=6915899 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvZXJpYy1ub3JkbWFuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTY5MTU4OTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtobWVydGltZXNraC5jb20vNTA4MzM1NjIvZm9yZC1kaXN0cmlidXRvci1ybWEtcmVsZWFzZXMtYW5udWFsLXJlcG9ydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford distributor RMA releases annual report,"Ford distributor RMA releases annual report

RMA the exclusive distributor of John Deere products participated in an event in Takeo province in July to showcase modern farming machinery. The firm released its annual financial report earlier this week. Supplied

RMA (Cambodia) Plc the exclusive distributor of Ford Land Rover and John Deere products in Cambodia released its remarkably stable annual report on Thursday.

Total revenue for 2020 was $1.195 billion a modest increase from $1.148 billion in 2019. Pre-tax profit for the year was $27128216 just $857376 less than 2019’s figures.

RMA’s Q12020 showed a 55.2 percent growth year-on-year (Yoy). Sales contracted in Q22020 with revenue declining by 40.9% YoY. The decline was attributed to COVID-19 restrictions by RMA Chairman Kevin Whitcraft.

Sales rebounded in Q32020 with a negligible decline of 0.4 percent YoY. Q42020 revenue was strong with a 21 percent increase YoY.

The Ford brand remained an integral part of RMA’s portfolio accounting for 33.7 percent of the group’s new car sales in 2020. The Ford Ranger was Cambodia’s best selling selling new vehicle.

RMA listed its bond on the Cambodia Securities Exchange in April this year at a coupon rate of 5.5 percent and was named “The best local currency bond” by regional publication The Asset.

Delta proactively cancelled 72 flights as of this writing on Sunday compared to just 1 for United and 5 at American before the flying day even started according to aviation tracking site FlightAware. I’m told there are still trips where crew aren’t yet assigned so that number may rise.

That’s more flight cancellations that the Atlanta-based carrier used to experience in a year and comes on the heels of mass cancellations over Thanksgiving and again over Christmas. And as in recent holiday breakdowns the problem appears to be lack of available pilots.

Delta spokesperson Anthony black tells me

Delta teams have been working through various factors including staffing large numbers of employee vaccinations and pilots returning to active status. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and the overwhelming majority have been rebooked for the same-travel day.

As a result of needing to transport passengers whose flights were cancelled the airline has lifted its load factor caps for Sunday and Monday. In other words it’s willing to fill every seat to get people to their destination which helps transport passengers more quickly than they’d otherwise be able to but for passengers on flights that weren’t cancelled it means having someone in a middle seat next to them – when they may chosen Delta for their trip because of the airline’s promise that wouldn’t happen on trips for another four weeks.



New York LaGuardia – Atlanta Delta 1625 at 1 p.m. on Sunday

Delta more than any other U.S. airline has prided itself – and sold itself – on reliability. In the past they’ve gone over a month at a time without a mainline flight cancellation and hit 200 days in a year without a mainline cancellation. Holiday weekends would traditionally be a ‘no cancel’ day where the airline would go to tremendous lengths (including 20 hour flight ‘delays’ with different crew and aircraft) doing anything possible to avoid classifying a flight as cancelled. That didn’t work this year.

Is Delta’s reliability magic gone perhaps along with the managers who took buy outs as part of the airline’s cost containment during the pandemic? Has Delta lost the managers who knew how to run the airline and balance flights and crew resources? The consistent problems Delta has faced over holiday weekends seems a bad omen for the airline’s future reliability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS93b2tlLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1oeXBvY3JpdGVzLWRlbHRhLWNvY2EtY29sYS1mYWNlLWdvcC1iYWNrbGFzaC1rbm9ja2luZy1nZW9yZ2lhLXZvdGluZy1sYXctMTU4MDg2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Woke Corporate Hypocrites': Coca-Cola Airlines Face GOP Voting Backlash,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/woke-corporate-hypocrites-delta-coca-cola-face-gop-backlash-knocking-georgia-voting-law-1580867 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS93b2tlLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1oeXBvY3JpdGVzLWRlbHRhLWNvY2EtY29sYS1mYWNlLWdvcC1iYWNrbGFzaC1rbm9ja2luZy1nZW9yZ2lhLXZvdGluZy1sYXctMTU4MDg2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzAzL3RydW1wLWNhbGxzLWZvci1ib3ljb3R0LW9mLW1sYi1jb2tlLWFuZC1kZWx0YS1haXJsaW5lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump calls for boycott of MLB Coke Delta after they opposed Georgia voting law,"Former President Trump called Friday night for a boycott of Major League Baseball Coke and Delta Airlines — and all other companies that have pulled out of Georgia or otherwise protested the state’s controversial new voting reform bill.

The Republican called for a boycott in a statement he issued hours after MLB announced it is pulling the All-Star Game from Atlanta in response to the bill which President Biden has labeled “Jim Crow in the 21st century.”

“Baseball is already losing tremendous numbers of fans and now they leave Atlanta with their All-Star Game because they are afraid of the Radical Left Democrats who do not want voter ID which is desperately needed to have anything to do with our elections” Trump’s statement read.

“Boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with Free and Fair Elections. Are you listening Coke Delta and all!”

On Wednesday Atlanta-based Coca Cola’s CEO appeared on CNBC’s “Power Lunch” to oppose the bill’s voting restrictions after a growing chorus of critics called for a Coke boycott over the company’s silence following the March 25 passage of the bill.

On the same day Delta’s CEO called the bill “unacceptable” and “based on a lie” after the Georgia company was criticized for not speaking out harshly against the measure.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Friday that the MLB All-Star game will not take place in Atlanta. MLB Photos via Getty Images

The new GOP-led law includes new restrictions including ID requirements on voting by mail and limits the number of drop boxes for mail-in ballots.

It increases legislative control over elections in the state moves that conservatives said will improve election integrity.

Democrats said the law is full of “voter suppression tactics” and a response to Georgia turning blue in the 2020 election a result that Trump falsely claimed was due to fraud.

DXCM,Dexcom,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aGxpbmUuY29tL2RpYWJldGVzbWluZS9jZ20tYWNjZXNzLXBoYXJtYWNpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can You Buy CGMs for Diabetes at the Pharmacy?,"Share on Pinterest As continuous glucose monitors advance and become more widely prescribed manufacturers are pushing for expanded access in pharmacies. People with diabetes could be seeing a turning point in ease of obtaining supplies for continuous glucose monitors as more of these products make their way into local pharmacies. While CGMs have traditionally only been available direct from the manufacturer or third-party supply distributors they’re now finally making their way onto the shelves of local pharmacies and even Costco stores around the country. For example the Dexcom G6 receivers transmitters and sensors are sold at discounted prices in Costco Pharmacies for the bulk chain’s member customers. Opinions may vary on just how good those discounts are but another big benefit for customers is that instead of waiting weeks for supplies to arrive in the mail you may be able to walk out the door of your local pharmacy in a day or two with everything you need. Along with Dexcom the Abbott FreeStyle Libre system supplies are also available at pharmacies and CGM maker Medtronic Diabetes is exploring pharmacy availability too. The takeaway is that lower-cost and more readily accessible purchase options are a must for any company wanting to succeed in the growing CGM market — that’s set to expand broadly to consumers even beyond those with diabetes.

How much do CGMs cost at the pharmacy? As always insurance coverage varies by type so the cost to each individual will depend on whether one even has pharmacy coverage for CGMs and what copays or deductibles may apply. To keep it simple here are the retail cash prices of the two systems currently available in pharmacies: Dexcom Users are thrilled to see the leading CGM on the market becoming more ubiquitously available. At local pharmacies: Around the United States in CVS Walgreens and many other retailers cash prices vary but most locations we queried quoted the price for a G6 transmitter at just under $300 while a three-pack box of G6 sensors runs ~$400. Remember too: Insurance may cover CGM supplies as a pharmacy benefit meaning you could find these available at local or mail-order pharmacies for a flat copay or with varying coinsurance and deductible amounts applied. At Costco: To get the Costco pricing you of course need to be a Costco member ($60) and also sign up for their free pharmacy program. As of April 2021 the Costco Pharmacy membership cash prices are as follows based on the latest company info online: G6 transmitter: $277.62 each (or membership discount price: $132.24)

Box of G6 sensors (three pack): $384.60 (or $303.74 membership discount price)

G6 receiver: $417.92 each (or $203.29 membership discount price) Note that you may see online search results showing varying price points based on an older Costco Pharmacy deal. That earlier discount was dramatically lower: a G6 transmitter only cost $28.88 and a G6 touchscreen receiver cost $35.96! Since Costco discount prices are periodically adjusted be sure to check in advance of driving to the store to purchase. These Costco prices are self-pay only as insurance isn’t applicable there (also not Medicare or Medicaid). So for anyone who may have a lower insurance copay or deductible requirement they may be better off sticking with their traditional purchase channels. Share on Pinterest Photo: DiabetesMine Caution: Unfortunately lots of patients and even many Costco pharmacy folks are unaware of this savings program. So if asked Costco employees may quote much higher prices up to $1100 for a single box of sensors — ugh! We’re also hearing that some Costco pharmacists have been insisting that they must check insurance and that this G6 discount only applies if you’ve already been denied insurance coverage which is NOT TRUE as we have confirmed with Costco corporate contacts. Be sure to be insistent if you encounter this barrier. Freestyle Libre The Abbott Freestyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) system is not (yet) what many consider to be a full-featured CGM with real-time glucose alerts for High and Low readings but it does qualify as a continuous sensor and is growing in popularity. This system has been available through national pharmacies like Costco CVS Kroger Walgreens and Rite Aid since it launched in late 2017. Senior public affairs manager Jennifer Heth at Abbott tells us that a majority of their 500000 users in the United States are already getting their Libre 14-day-wear sensors through retail pharmacies. Notably Abbott says the Libre costs 70 percent less than the list price of other CGM systems currently available. Here are the approximate prices for the Libre system in pharmacies: List price of $54 per sensor according to Abbott (though retail pharmacies like Costco and Walgreens quote prices of $58–69)

With commercial insurance most patients pay between $10 and $75 per month for Libre 14-day sensors at participating pharmacies

Handheld reader: $70 (though the separate receiver isn’t required as users can opt to use the FreeStyle LibreLink mobile app for iOS or Android for no charge) Abbott tells us that building out their pharmacy purchase channel is an “area of focus” for the company that started in 2020. “Pharmacists play a central role in patient care and are valued for their impact on improving outcomes for people living with diabetes” Heth says. “Abbott is dedicated to providing education on the rapidly evolving diabetes technology… Abbott has provided educational grant support for pharmacist continuing education programs with the American Pharmacists Association Pharmacy Times among others.” Heth also tells us that in addition to national and online programs Abbott provides live peer-to-peer training sessions for pharmacists and webinars on the clinical application of FreeStyle Libre and CGM report interpretation using the Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) a standardized one-page report that visually summarizes glucose trend data. Medtronic and Eversense CGMs: Not in pharmacies Sorry friends. Medtronic confirms that it will be a while before their CGM supplies hit the pharmacy channel. Spokeswoman Pam Reese director of global communications for Medtronic Diabetes tells us: “We are currently exploring pharmacy options for our CGM. We have some pharmacy access already and are continuing to build our own internal pharmacy operations. In addition we are exploring a retail pharmacy strategy.” It makes sense that the fourth CGM sensor on the market the implantable Eversense from Senseonics would not be available in pharmacies. This sensor must be implanted under the skin via a minimal surgical incision procedure by a qualified doctor. Still we asked the company about any plans to sell supplies (replacement transmitters or charging cords) in pharmacies. Senseonics’ director of global PR and brand marketing Karen Hynes says no explaining: “If Eversense is covered under someone’s pharmacy benefit it would be mail ordered and shipped directly to the healthcare provider who is placing the sensor. Otherwise it would go through the DME (durable medical equipment) channel and would be shipped to the healthcare provider.”

Why is CGM access in pharmacies taking so long? The effort to make CGM supplies more readily available for retail purchase began back in 2015 when a half-dozen or more insurance plans began covering CGM supplies in a different way than they traditionally had. They recategorized these devices as a “pharmacy benefit” rather than the traditional classification as “durable medical equipment” (DME). This meant people with certain plans would no longer be bound to buying supplies from designated third-party medical equipment suppliers or directly from the manufacturer but rather could purchase them wherever medications are sold. Anthem and UnitedHealthcare (UHC) were among the big insurance carriers taking that important first step toward eventual over-the-counter access to CGM supplies in local pharmacy chains like CVS or Walgreens. Other insurers have moved in this direction over time. Even with some insurers now classifying CGM as a pharmacy benefit it remains a “Your Insurance Coverage May Vary” situation in terms of how much any individual might pay for supplies — some plans require only a low fixed copay applied to all pharmacy benefit items while others require coinsurance where you pay a percentage of the actual cost of the item. Still other plans require that you meet an annual deductible before any copay or coinsurance kicks in. It all varies. Currently most CGM users are still purchasing their supplies from designated third-party medical equipment vendors or directly from the manufacturer. Per Dexcom’s talking points pharmacy distribution allows for “a more seamless experience for physicians and patients changing the once eight-step month-long distribution process into four simple steps that enable a patient to get their Dexcom device in as few as 1–2 days through their pharmacist.” When Dexcom began planning for pharmacy availability several years ago (during the early G5 model days) it pushed for access by mail-order as well as in retail pharmacies — including “drop shipments” of orders prepared for pickup 24 hours in advance. Presumably that “just in time” shipping policy was meant to avoid pharmacies stockpiling expired sensors that they can’t sell or running out of supplies. Going into 2020 Dexcom is pushing for an increase in its CGM business going through pharmacy channels by as much as 70 percent of their sensor business to be exact. After 2019 the CGM manufacturer says it has now crossed the threshold of supplying more than 50 percent of its CGM supplies through pharmacies.

Walgreens makes CGM history Walgreens made headlines in 2019 with its pharmacy expansion for the Dexcom G6 especially for Medicare beneficiaries who can now obtain their CGM supplies within that local pharmacy. Many Dexcom customers who use Walgreens have also started receiving automated emails and messages about syncing pharmacy and CGM accounts for more efficiency. In fact Walgreens’ Find Care marketplace introduced a program in 2019 in which interested people with diabetes can proactively request a prescription for the Dexcom G6. They simply complete a questionnaire that is sent to their healthcare provider for review and potential prescription. No doubt as the next-generation Dexcom-Verily G7 product (designed to be more consumer friendly fully disposable and lower cost) moves forward and launches in 2021 we will see more big pharmacy chains adding CGM tech to their shelves. Still overall use of CGMs among people with type 1 diabetes remains low at about 35 percent. This is attributed in part to provider reluctance to prescribe the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the sketch actors dressed up as US treasury secretary Janet Yellen and others explain the phenomenon through an Eminem-inspired rap. The skit is an example of how the NFT scene has exploded globally in recent months.

For the uninitiated NFT is a one-of-its-kind asset that is not interchangeable in nature. It means that the NFT is not replaceable by another ‘identical’ item.

View Full Image A burst of interest in NFTs hit. a peak last month when a digital artwork by Beeple sold for $69.3 million

For example if two individuals hold a bitcoin each they can exchange their bitcoins which are a replica of each other and have the same value. However NFTs are not interchangeable as they are more like pieces of art where each and every token is unique in itself. While bitcoins are also digital assets NFTs are unique digital assets with each token representing a unique value.

In August 2017 NFTs had debuted on the ethereum network and among the first tokens was the digital collectible game called CryptoKitties that allowed players to buy breed and sell virtual cats. Since then NFTs have evolved to include digital real estate video game items digital art and music.

To ride this recent boom India’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange by volume WazirX has launched the country’s first marketplace for NFTs. The platform will allow the exchange of digital assets and intellectual properties including art pieces audio files videos programs and even tweets alongside other digital goods and services. According to the company Indian creators can place their digital assets for auction over the blockchain-based NFT marketplace and earn royalty thereafter.

“Globally the market is nascent at $10-15 million per week but the potential is huge. As of now it is difficult to estimate the market size in India. We’re in discussions with some artists for listing. Basically the artist has to first create the music or video file and upload it to a crypto wallet. The money then gets locked into a smart contract which only transfers the NFT when payment is received"" said Nischal Shetty CEO of WazirX.

The files are stored in a crypto wallet to automate the process and remove the risk of either party defaulting. “Only cryptocurrencies can be used for the payment. As for the copyright or royalty the artist can decide whether to transfer these rights along with the NFT or only give it for private use. This will be stated in the code"" Shetty added.

The crypto industry is still trying to figure out what’s going to be the best use case for NFTs. However in recent times many artists have used it globally to sell their creations in the form of collectibles or art while keeping their copyrights intact.

Digital artist Michael Joseph Winkelmann who is professionally known as Beeple last month sold a piece called “Everydays: the First 5000 Days"" at auction house Christie’s for nearly $70 million by using an NFT. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey raised $2.9 million for charity by auctioning off his first-ever tweet with an NFT. Tesla chief Elon Musk last month said he is selling an electronic music track that is about NFT as an NFT.

As per global crypto exchange Kraken the NFT market activity may have lulled slightly since the freneticism of late February but it was still worth more than $33 million in the last week of March.

In India there have been comments from the RBI and the government and there is a framework being contemplated for cryptocurrencies or digital currencies.

“However for NFTs there is no separate legal framework so we might have to rely on regular principles of the Indian Contract Act for the sale/purchase of goods"" said Shilpa Mankar Ahluwalia partner and head of fintech Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.

Investors looking to jump on the NFT bandwagon should note that there is little clarity on how these instruments are regulated.

“From the Indian perspective the legal situation is unclear. In my opinion NFTs are derivatives as per the Securities Contract Regulation Act. Therefore you are not legally allowed to exchange trade sell or buy NFTs under the present Indian laws. Legally you can only trade derivates on authorized exchanges such as for stocks or commodities. However it may be possible to do a peer-to-peer matching decentralized exchange (DEX) because it isn’t an exch-ange but a matching portal where you only match buyers and sellers"" said Mathew Chacko partner at Spice Route Legal a law firm.

In India a derivative derives its value from particular security which is a financial instrument such as stocks or commodities. However as of now there is no legal framework for a derivative value for a non-financial asset.

NFTs are billed as digital art pieces but according to investment advisers these tokens are much riskier. Like cryptocurrencies NFTs are a high-risk asset and retail investors should stay away.

But maybe just maybe the two Bellevue hairstylists decided they could do the same thing.

The pair the best of friends since attending La’James International College in Fremont found a 1998 Dutchman classic camper trailer in Iowa spent six months turning it into a salon and suddenly Good Life Grooming for Men was open for business.

It’s still hard for them to believe.

“We are young women we put it together even though it seemed freaking impossible” Harrison said. “We did it. I feel proud of myself proud of Branda.”

Harrison and Blundell both in their late 20s spent six months tearing apart the camper and then putting it back together adding salon chairs and stations for each of them a wash station a wax pot a waiting area and a restroom. Even a coffee bar.

Harrison jokes that her boyfriend Greg Knaff better beware of her new construction skills. Who knows what she could change in their home while he’s away?

“He will leave for work and now I have some knowledge” she said.

The two women had none when they started working on the camper.

Zero construction background is how Harrison frames it.

“So once we gutted it we figured out our new layout and went for it” she said.

Knaff and Blundell’s brother Mykel Miller helped with the transformation which took from July to December. Between the purchase and renovations they’ve invested $30000.

It brings a “wow” from everyone who enters the mobile salon.

“I feel like clients are always super surprised when they walk in” Blundell said. “It looks like a small camper on the outside and it’s so open and spacious. It’s really surprising.”

Now all they need are more customers. The pair were used to cutting 16 heads of hair during always-busy eight-hour shifts at Sport Clips.

Their client list is small but growing as they travel between the DJ’s Dugouts in Bellevue and Plattsmouth and the Modern Work Suites & Studios at 84th and F streets. It takes them about 15 minutes to set up for business and about the same time to close up so everything moves safely.

Curiosity brings some in and others have followed their journey on the business’s Facebook page. They have loyal customers from their previous jobs too. They say their biggest strength is convenience.

They joke that they’ve learned to live frugally while they survive the growing pains of a new business. They have big plans; they’re just unsure what those will be.

“I don’t know if we have an exact picture of what the dream is; we’ve been letting it create itself” Blundell said. “We’d love to have more than one trailer — have a gals' trailer and numerous guys' trailers. We’d love to get into weddings do grooming parties for the guys. We’re open to whatever the future brings and building it as we grow.”

What do hydra tiny freshwater organisms that look like inverted jellyfish have in common with four-time Olympic gold medallist Simone Biles? Their incredible ability to somersault it seems. Hydra are smaller than the width of a human finger but can bend their bodies and perfectly flip over their tentacles. Now with a combination of biophysical experiments and computational modelling researchers have found that differences in tissue stiffness along hydra’s body length makes this unique motion possible.

Named after the serpent-like monster in Greek mythology that regrows two heads for each one that’s cut off hydra are known for similar powers of regeneration. Slice open a hydra and each half will grow into two new bodies. In addition they don’t exhibit ageing leading some biologists to label them ‘immortal’. This drew Suyash Naik an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune into studying the organism.

“My initial goal was to study what physical changes occur across the hydra body during regeneration” Naik said. “While studying this I noticed that hydra tissue is notably stiffer in its head region.”

This serendipitous discovery changed the direction of his research towards locomotion.

Naik measured the stiffness of hydra tissue by calculating a property of materials called the Young’s modulus – a number that determines how much a certain amount of force can stretch something. Stretchy rubber bands have low Young’s moduli while metal rods have high values.

It’s common to see experiments in physics labs where this quantity is measured by suspending heavy weights on rods and observing how much they bend. But measuring this quantity for the soft tissues of a tiny delicate organism is tricky.

To achieve this the researchers used an atomic force microscope (AFM) on hydra for the very first time. An AFM can measure material properties down to the scale of individual atoms using a cantilever which looks like a microscopic diving board with a needle pointing downwards at one end. The cantilever is moved gently across a sample without damaging it like a back massager. Forces from individual molecules within the sample make the cantilever vibrate through which scientists can obtain a ‘force terrain’ of the sample surface. The strength of these forces can be translated to various material properties including the Young’s modulus.

Using the AFM Naik found that the Young’s modulus at the hydra head is three times greater than at its base – i.e. a sharp decrease in stiffness from head to toe.

The researchers pondered what the function of this stark gradient might be. “We thought of a system of springs with two parts of different stiffness connected like a slinky” Naik said. This could explain hydra’s somersaulting motion – where its stiff ‘shoulder’ stores energy when it bends before releasing the energy to land.

To verify that the change in stiffness governed hydra’s ability to somersault the researchers used two techniques. First they disturbed the shoulder tissue’s stiffness by manipulating the medium that binds cells together after which the hydra was unable to somersault. In an independent approach they created a computational model of springs with the right stiffness and were able to replicate hydra’s motion with it.

Studying locomotion of the simplest organisms is important from an evolutionary standpoint. It sheds light on how animals embraced the need to move around in search for food water and to evade predators.

“The fact that hydra may have evolved to actively manipulate its own body structure in order to bring about this complex motion is exciting” says Sudhakaran Prabhakaran a biologist at Cambridge University who was not involved in this study. “This is a fascinating interdisciplinary collaboration between biology physics and computation experts coming together to explain a fundamental aspect of a living organism.”

There are few ways more aesthetically pleasing than a somersault to go from point A to point B. A trait picked up millions of years ago by an ostensibly immortal organism is mimicked today by humans seeking sporting immortality. When asked to compare hydra’s somersault to the elegance of an Olympic gymnast Naik smiled and said the twirl of the tiny tentacled creature is far superior.

The researchers’ study led by Sanjeev Galande and Shivprasad Patil at IISER Pune was published on October 29 2020 (preprint paper here).

Employees at a Dollar General in Kenansville North Carolina couldn’t believe their eyes when a stray Lab mix kept sneaking into their store with customers and heading straight for a stuffed purple unicorn in the toy aisle.

They had taken the toy away from him and sent him back outside before but one day they managed to trap him inside and quickly called Duplin County Animal Services. Dispatch sent officer Samantha Lane to the store for “one of the strangest calls” she had ever received.

When Samantha arrived she found the pup sitting happily with the stuffed unicorn in the store. He was such a good boy and obviously loved the toy so much that she decided to buy it for him!

The dog was brought back to the shelter and given the name Sisu after the dragon from the new Disney animated film “Raya and the Last Dragon.”

They couldn’t quite figure out why Sisu was so fixated on the unicorn toy but since he knew basic commands and had some inside-dog manners they speculated that he might have come from a home with young kids.

The shelter advertised Sisu as a lost dog but sadly no one came forward to claim him. After they shared a picture of him with his unicorn on Facebook his story gained national attention!

“This is what happens when you break into the Dollar General consistently to steal the purple unicorn that you laid claim to but then get animal control called to lock you up for your B & E and larceny but the officer purchases your item for you and brings it in with you” the shelter wrote.

Thanks to the media coverage their phone was soon ringing off the hook with people asking to adopt this precious boy – and his favorite toy!

Sisu adores his toy and it’s bringing him a lot of comfort as he awaits his forever home. He cuddles with the unicorn constantly and sleeps curled up with it every night. As a result it didn’t take long for everyone at the shelter to fall in love with him!

“It’s so sweet. It’s amazing. I mean he’s obviously super smart and even when we got him to the animal shelter he’s been very obedient. He sits shakes. Someone should be looking for him” said Joe Newburn a supervisor at Duplin County Animal Services.

I don’t know of any other reason why he would focus on the unicorn other than he had one at home. If the store had called and said he tore open dog food that would make more sense but not hunting for a purple unicorn.

Sisu is about to start a new life with an adoptive family and the people at Dollar General have pledged to send some gifts to ease his transition.

The company said they’ll be shipping over a “few extra purple unicorns for the adoptive family” along with a thank-you gift for Samantha who purchased the original unicorn for Sisu. They’re also making a pet food donation to the shelter!

Now that’s a happy ending! We’re sure Sisu will put his “life of crime” behind him now that he has all the stuffed unicorns he could ever want.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL2NhbGlmb3JuaWEvcmVkb25kb2JlYWNoL3doYXRzLW9wZW4tY2xvc2VkLWVhc3Rlci1yZWRvbmRvLWJlYWNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's Open Closed On Easter In Redondo Beach,"REDONDO BEACH CA — Did you forget an important item for your Easter Sunday celebration — eggs to dye or an important item on your list?

But when her foster son became part of her family she discovered he hadn’t had the same experience. Birthdays were a time of mixed emotions for him.

Nogueras explained that he had been removed from his biological parents’ care for several years and spent “a great amount of his young life” in the care of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families.

It was her son’s experiences that inspired Nogueras to start the Onset-based nonprofit The Gifted Crate.

“We wanted to ensure that these kids and teenagers are still celebrated” she said.

The Gifted Crate which launched in fall 2020 was designed to support foster parents and ensure that kids and teens in foster care receive a customized “birthday crate” to celebrate their special day.

“In this crate is everything you need to have a small birthday celebration” Nogueras said. “It’ll include a cake mix candles party supplies — like a tablecloth cake plates and banners — and a couple of gifts based on the kids’ or teenagers’ interests or requests.”

Nogueras — the organization’s co-founder and executive director — said the crates are valued between $50 to $100.

The Gifted Crate works with social workers in the region to deliver the crates to children. Social workers request a crate and The Gifted Crate’s team of six volunteers assemble and deliver the crate.

Nogueras recalled how the crates have had lasting impacts on several kids’ lives. The Gifted Crate recently provided a foster mom with some special birthday surprises for one pre-teen boy whose father left the country leaving the boy in the state’s care she said.

The boy had a new bike — but he didn’t have a helmet. With that in mind his birthday crate came with a helmet a set of Legos and an action camera so he could document his adventures on video.

“He just spent hours with the Legos he received and with his social worker” Nogueras said. “It’s those stories that really tug at us. That’s why we’re here.”

Although the gifts are chosen to suit the kids’ interests they’re not the only things that make the crates special.

“Another pre-teen we had a couple months ago she told her social worker that she’s been in care since she was a toddler and it was her first birthday with party plates” Nogueras said. “Those little things we take for granted — it’s just maybe a dollar from the Dollar Tree. [...] But these kids have gone without it.”

On top of guaranteeing a festive celebration The Gifted Crate’s staff and volunteers also hope to strengthen the foster family bonds Nogueras said.

“[The foster parents] don’t even have to claim that [the crate] is from an organization because we understand the stigma of feeling like everything is just a charity” she said. The creates “are essentially given to families to help them bond or strengthen their bond that they already have with the kids in their care.”

The Gifted Crate’s decision to package their birthday supplies in banker’s boxes instead of birthday gift bags for example was also intentional.

“We want [the kids] to reuse this crate maybe for memorabilia and things they collect throughout the years while in care” Nogueras said. “Either they can bring it back home when they reunify with their parents or if they move on toward adoption they can reuse that box to hold on to momentos.”

The Gifted Crate is located at 211 Onset Avenue in the basement of the building that houses Ebb and Flow. The space isn’t really open to the public but it is where crates are organized Nogueras said.

She said Onset is a great location for the nonprofit because the organization has already provided a lot of kids in Wareham with birthday crates.

“It’s kind of a central hub for us” Nogueras said noting that the Department of Children & Families’ Cape Cod New Bedford and Plymouth offices were all in close proximity. Social workers from those offices send in requests for crates she said.

The organization has received requests for 32 crates in April.

“The amount of [requests for] crates we’re getting means the word is spreading but it also means there’s a lot of kids in DCF care so it’s a little bittersweet” Nogueras said.

With the increased demand she outlined a number of ways community members can show their support:

• Hosting drives for toys and gifts for older children

• Volunteering as “crate couriers” who deliver crates to social workers

• Donating money (on Venmo the organization is @TheGiftedCrate) or items from The Gifted Crate’s wishlist

Businesses are also asked to donate spare banker’s boxes or to volunteer their time to help pack crates.

Other Half’s seltzers are scheduled to be on-tap starting in April with canned seltzers launching by summer.

Beers brewed at Domino Park are available to go from the taproom via curbside pickup or neighborhood bike delivery.

Other Half Domino Park also offers a curated selection of wine with a menu of craft cocktails Champagne and small-batch spirits available starting this summer.

“The intimate brewing system at Domino Park allows us to try new techniques and brew with new hops and yeast strains to create new innovative beers as well as continue to improve our existing ones” says Sam Richardson co-founder / brew master. “We are excited to brew more on-the-fly beers here but will continue to offer what Other Half is known for including IPAs sours and stouts at our originalBrooklyn location.”

“In addition to offering a host of new beers and styles that we brew on-site we wanted to offer cocktails Champagne and wine for our guests to enjoy” says Andrew Burman co-founder / COO. “We’re fortunate to have a great network of friends who helped us curate a liquids program that complements our beers and look forward to raising a glass once we can all gather safely. And since our team loves whisky and mezcal we’re psyched to offer a broader list of these spirits too.”

Other Half anchors the bustling corner of South 1st Street and River Avenue in a 3600-square-foot space with 50-feet of waterfront frontage overlooking Manhattan and the East River. Designed by Space Exploration the taproom and production facility has an outdoor patio 20-foot windows and ample natural light.

As if collecting 5000 boxes was not enough to create community interest the students will be attempting to set the world record for the most cereal boxes dropped in a domino fashion in a ‘chain reaction for change.’

Students at Lake Ridge Academy are attempting to collect 5000 unopened full sized boxes of cereal to benefit Second Harvest Food Bank and North Ridgeville Community Care.

The school is currently looking for sponsors and donors who will contribute to help with bulk cereal purchases. Organizers are in need of 15 business sponsors to support the cause. Each business sponsorship is $100 and the monies will be used to help purchase cereal to reach the goal of 5000 boxes. Each sponsors’ name and logo will be included on the school’s Parents Association (PA) webpage spotlighted on the PA Facebook page as well as being included on day of signage and in press releases. Business partners already committed include Mercy Health and Aldi.

The public can make monetary donations through Lake Ridge Academy. Every little bit counts toward the purchase of cereal. Those who choose to sponsor organizers we will be in touch for a copy of your business logo so that your business can be recognized before and during the event.

The school is grateful for both monetary donations and unopened full size cereal boxes. Due to COVID-19 mitigation measures the school buildings are closed to the public. Monetary donations are the most sensible right now. If you would like to drop off your cereal box(es) please contact the school to make arrangements 440-327-1175. Schools officials are working with a grocery chain to hopefully purchase cereal in bulk by the crate. This can be accomplished gradually over the next few weeks. The cereal will be stored in Bettcher Hall at Lake Ridge Academy.

The cereal box collection will culminate with the Royals Run an attempt to break the world record on May 5 at the Bettcher Convocation Center. The event will be live streamed for all to watch the cereal boxes fall.

The deadline to donate is April 30. For more information go to pa.lakeridgeacademy.org/royals_run.

His son was at MetroHealth Medical Center for 65 days recovering from second and third degree burns on 40 percent of his body.

Delton was injured at a friend’s house on November 23 2020. The other boy was burning plastic covering off a copper wire and retrieved a jug from the garage filled with liquid. He tossed the liquid onto the flames then threw the jug across the yard and ran in the opposite direction. A gas tank leaning on the fence exploded less than 15 feet away from Delton. He ended up with burns to his back right arm hand and both legs. The other boy was not hurt. Delton underwent a total of nine surgeries and had to learn to walk again. He came home January 26 and is now undergoing therapy.

To help you find your way as quickly as possible to the nearest drive-thru we've collected all the fast food restaurants we're—using ""fast food"" pretty loosely here—that are going to be open as usual on Easter Sunday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 373.98 points to 33527.19 a record closing high. The S&P 500 gained 1.4% to 4077.91 also hitting a new record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also climbed 1.7% to 13705.59.

The Labor Department reported Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 916000 in March the highest since August 2020 while the unemployment rate fell to 6%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting an increase of 675000 and a jobless rate of 6%.

Meanwhile a measure of U.S. services industry activity soared to a record high in March. The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing activity index jumped to a reading of 63.7 last month the highest level in the survey's history.

""A 'Capital V' recovery that is in the early innings"" said Tony Dwyer Canaccord Genuity's chief market strategist. ""The only thing that could stand in the way would be another shutdown of the economy to contain new Covid-19 strains or a policy mistake by the Fed. Neither appear imminent.""

Tesla shares popped more than 4% as the electric vehicle company reported production and delivery figures that broadly beat expectations.

GameStop shares cut their double-digit losses and closed down about 2% after the video game retailer said it may sell up to $1 billion worth of stock.

Classic reopening plays like airlines and cruise operators outperformed. Delta Airlines and United jumped more than 2% each while Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line gained 4.7% and 7.2% respectively.

Bond yields whose sudden advance spooked some investors in recent weeks continued to ease. The 10-year Treasury yield fell slightly to 1.71% on Monday.

""We expect equities and other risk assets to be supported by the new nominal — a more muted response of government yields to stronger growth and higher inflation than in the past as central banks lean against any sharp yield rises"" Wei Li global chief investment strategist at BlackRock said in a note.

The stock market is building on its recent strength after President Joe Biden introduced his multitrillion-dollar infrastructure proposal which focuses on rebuilding roads bridges and airports expanding broadband access and boosting electric vehicle use and updating the country's electric grid. The plan will be funded partly by a hike in the corporate tax rate to 28%.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday pushed for a global minimum corporate tax in an effort to keep companies from relocating to find lower rates.

However Biden's plan faces opposition among Republicans as the $2 trillion plan includes initiatives that they say extend beyond traditional infrastructure issues.

Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri on Sunday urged the Biden administration to pare back the package to roughly $615 billion and concentrate on physical infrastructure such as roads and airports.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. said last week that Biden's plan would not receive Republican support and vowed to oppose the broader Democratic agenda.

After being forgotten in a desk drawer for almost 35 years a sealed copy of the Nintendo video game Super Mario Bros. sold at auction on Friday for a whopping $660000.

It’s the most ever paid for a video game according to a news release from Heritage Auctions which ran the sale.

The Dallas-based auction company said the NES cartridge was purchased as a Christmas gift in 1986 and was untouched until the seller found it earlier this year.

“It stayed in the bottom of my office desk this whole time since the day I bought it” said the unidentified seller in the release. “I never thought anything about it.”

The unopened game was professionally graded by WataGames and had a score of 9.6/A+ according to the news release which called it “the finest copy known to have been professionally graded for auction.”

It is also one of the earliest copies of the game to be shrink wrapped instead of having a sticker seal according to the auction company.

This particular version of the game first went on sale in 1986 but Nintendo changed the packaging in early 1987 so only a relatively small number were sold.

“Since the production window for this copy and others like it was so short finding another copy from this same production run in similar condition would be akin to looking for single drop of water in an ocean” said Valarie McLeckie video games director for Heritage Auctions. “Never say never but there’s a good chance it can’t be done.”

It wasn’t the only video game that brought in big money at the auction. A 1987 Mega Man cartridge sold for $144000 and a buyer paid $102000 for a copy of Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! made the same year.

The $660000 price includes the buyer’s premium and shatters the previous record for a copy of Super Mario Bros. game.

A 1985 copy of the game sold for $114000 last July which at the time was the most ever paid for a video game according to Heritage which also handled that sale.

A sealed variant of Super Mario Bros. 3 broke that record in November selling for $156000 the company said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvYnVzaW5lc3MvcGV0cm9jaGVtaWNhbHMvQ2hlbWljYWwtZXhlY3V0aXZlcy11c2UtdW5leHBlY3RlZC1mb3J1bS85OS9pMTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chemical executives use unexpected forum to talk diversity the environment,"Credit: ExxonMobil Credit: Celanese Credit: Dow

Held each March IHS Markit’s World Petrochemical Conference is normally all about market intelligence. Chemical executives have attended the conference for decades to hear forecasts of polyethylene demand get the status on big ethylene projects or learn about how developments in oil and gas will affect their businesses.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic the conference was for the second time held virtually instead of in packed hotel ballrooms in Texas.

But beyond the format the content of the conference had a new twist: sustainability and diversity were two of the biggest themes.

Both topics have always gotten nods at the conference especially in talks from high-ranking industry leaders. But this year diversity and sustainability dominated entire sessions a sign perhaps that the industry’s executives now consider these issues as important as prices and operating rates.

Dow CEO Jim Fitterling set the tone for the conference with his talk which stressed the importance of diversity for an industry that strives to be innovative. “We need that diversity of thought and perspective in solving problems” he said.

But Fitterling also warned that the pandemic has gravely set back diversity efforts. In the US chemical industry for instance women held over 37% of middle-manager positions in 2018 according to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. “We already had a tremendous burden of achieving parity in the workplace” he said. “All the data that we’re seeing shows that COVID has hit minority groups—women people of color the LGBTQ community for example—harder than other groups” he said of COVID-19’s impacts on health.

The unemployment rate of Black and Latina women rose 11% postpandemic Fitterling said. He also pointed to a McKinsey & Co. study suggesting that 2 million women in the US are considering leaving the workforce because of COVID-19.

Fitterling warned that the pandemic could harden social and economic inequities for a long time to come. “If we don’t fix the problem now we’ll continue to suffer from a lack of diversity a lack of inclusion and an economy that simply fails to deliver to society in an equitable way” he said.

Executives gave prescriptions for addressing the problem. Lori Ryerkerk the CEO of Celanese and one of only a handful of women in such a role at a US chemical company said companies need to do more to increase diversity than focus on hiring. Recruiting people on college campuses or elsewhere is “the easy part” she said. “The hard part is retaining people and creating that culture of inclusion.”

That might mean uncovering unconscious bias or training people in having uncomfortable conversations. Celanese for example has organized small-group discussions around episodes of 1619 the New York Times audio series about race in America.

Additionally Ryerkerk said employees need leaders who share their backgrounds. “People want to look up in the organization and they want to see people and go ‘If she could do it I could do that too’ ” she said.

To Ryerkerk executives who get in the way of diversity are deadwood even if they are great performers financially. “You need to get rid of the leaders who aren’t walking the talk because we all keep leaders who are still in the old school” she said.

Fitterling gained firsthand experience with the power of a culture of inclusiveness when he came out as a gay man while up for a promotion to chief operating officer. “I don’t want to be on the front page of a newspaper somewhere. I’d like to come out on my own and I’d like it to be my own story” Fitterling said he told his then boss Andrew Liveris who encouraged him to speak with every member of Dow’s board.

“I went and visited them one by one” Fitterling recalled. “And to a person they all said to me ‘This is the exact right thing to do. We support you. Glad that you’re doing it. And don’t ever look back.’ That’s the culture we have at Dow.”

Managers further compared notes during a forum on increasing the role of women in petrochemicals. “When a neophyte is part of the petrochemical industry it can be quite intimidating” said Janile Parks director of community and government relations for the arm of Taiwan’s Formosa Plastics that is planning a massive petrochemical complex in Louisiana.

“I found out that most organizations lack the basic resources to reassure that a woman can navigate successfully in her role” she said. “However we’re expected to perform at the same or higher level as our male counterparts.”

The industry is stepping up to address the issue of plastic waste; clearly there is more to do. It’s now time for the industry to unite around the issue of climate change. Thomas Casparie executive vice president Shell Chemicals

Parks recommended that companies assign mentors for newer employees develop management and training programs and provide opportunities for employees to shadow their peers. “We should lean on the opportunity to hold the door open for other women who will come behind us” she said.

Indeed Justine Smith senior vice president for petrochemicals at Chevron Phillips Chemical cited sponsorship from high-level management when the moderator asked what advanced her career. “In the first 10 years of my career I was continually put on slates and given opportunities for a variety of different positions” she said.

For petrochemical companies such special positions and projects are increasingly related to environmental performance. The conference reflected that shift with chemical executives boasting about their firms’ environmental achievements even as many outside groups see companies’ efforts as mere greenwashing.

Over the decades environmental performance has rarely featured in presentations at the IHS conference. When it did the references were often related to prosaic matters like energy efficiency or emissions. But as the public became alarmed by mounting plastic waste presentations started reflecting those concerns. A couple of years ago pictures of beaches littered with plastics started appearing in the slide decks of chemical executives who insisted that they grasped the problem.

This year nearly every plastics producer making a presentation had something to say about progress on waste frequently sharing goals for incorporating postconsumer content in their resins. Dilip Kumar Agarwal executive director of Indorama Ventures said his company aims to use 750000 metric tons (t) per year of recycled resin by 2025. Vipul Shah COO for petrochemicals at Reliance Industries said his company intends to recycle 1 million t of plastic annually by 2025.

Thomas Casparie executive vice president of Shell Chemicals told the audience that the industry ought to pursue climate change with the same enthusiasm as plastics recycling.

“The industry is stepping up to address the issue of plastic waste; clearly there is more to do” Casparie said. “It’s now time for the industry to unite around the issue of climate change and really look at how can we get to net zero.”

Shell one of the world’s largest oil companies plans to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 meaning it will have to both reduce and offset its greenhouse gas emissions. “That is going to be a huge task and if you look at our current business plans they will not get us there so they will need to change over time” Casparie said.

Shell plans a large transformation. It intends to consolidate its 13 refineries into 6 “energy and chemical parks.” This Casparie said will prepare the company to sell less conventional fuel over time and create hubs for supplying renewable energy and chemicals produced using alternative feedstocks.

And Shell has been rolling out individual projects to reduce its carbon footprint Casparie said. In Moerdijk the Netherlands the company is replacing 16 ethylene steam cracker furnaces with 8 new ones which will reduce emissions at the site by 10%. The company is part of a consortium that will build a 100 MW water electrolysis plant in Germany to make green hydrogen. Shell also aims to capture and store 25 million t of carbon dioxide per year and has projects underway at its facilities in Scotford Alberta and Rotterdam the Netherlands.

Shell while not a plastics maker is active in plastics waste as well. It has been feeding a synthetic oil that Nexus Fuels derives from plastic waste into its petrochemical cracker in Norco Louisiana. Casparie intends to expand the use of waste-plastic feedstock. “We’ve got projects in Europe and most recently a feasibility study with the government of Singapore” he said.

Karen McKee president of ExxonMobil Chemical profiled a couple of her company’s initiatives in plastics recycling. In February the firm formed the Cyclyx joint venture with Agilyx a company that uses pyrolysis to break down polystyrene into styrene. Cyclyx aims to gather plastic waste in quantities adequate for recycling plants. “We feel that with our scale in the industry that this is a very good partnership” McKee said.

Also in February ExxonMobil conducted a plastics recycling trial at its Baytown Texas plant though it divulged few details. “It is a proprietary process so I can’t tell you too much about it other than this will take sorted end-of-life plastic directly into our existing facilities so it is a little bit of a step-skipping process” McKee said of the chemical recycling process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWF0dXJlcy9zdXJwcmlzaW5nLW1hc3RlcnMtdHJhZGl0aW9ucy1kaWRudC1sYXN0LXBhcmFkZS1wYWdlYW50L9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWF0dXJlcy9zdXJwcmlzaW5nLW1hc3RlcnMtdHJhZGl0aW9ucy1kaWRudC1sYXN0LXBhcmFkZS1wYWdlYW50Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 surprising Masters traditions that didn’t last from a parade to a beauty pageant,"6 surprising Masters traditions that didn’t last from a parade to a beauty pageant

Masters traditions have evolved over the years. getty images

Few events are more bound by tradition than the Masters Tournament from the Champions Dinner and Par-3 Contest to green jackets and honorary starters to pimento cheese and manual scoreboards. Indeed attending the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club feels like stepping back in time.

But not all Masters traditions have endured.

Some may have been too antiquated to succeed generations others impractical. Some have been replaced others abandoned.

As the golf world prepares to revel in the annual rite of spring that is the Masters let us revisit some of the tournament’s lost traditions.

Masters Parade

In 1957 local business leaders formed Masters Week of Augusta Inc. with the mission of creating ways to promote the tournament and try to draw people to town. Implemented ideas included a horse show and a flyover by a blimp squadron from Glynco Naval Base in Brunswick Ga.

The centerpiece from 1957-64 was a spring parade on Tuesday afternoon in downtown Augusta that newspaper editorials city leaders and civic organizers compared to the famous Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City and hoped would grow to rival the annual Tournament of Roses Parade that precedes the Rose Bowl every new year in Pasadena Calif.

A reported 25000 parade-goers lined Broad Street between 13th Street and 5th Street to see elaborate floats marching bands beauty queens and massive balloons. Augusta National founder Bobby Jones rode in the lead Cadillac convertible followed in other open-top cars by Ben Hogan Byron Nelson and other prominent Masters competitors.

Somewhere in the inaugural parade queue The Augusta Chronicle wrote was a float from the Fort Gordon Library that depicted Satan trying to blast out of bunker.

“It was just a real exciting thing for our little country town” Lillian Cullum who died in 2015 told the Chronicle of the event her late husband — Cullum’s Clothing Store owner Jim — helped establish.

‘Miss Golf’ Pageant

Beauty pageants were once a popular attraction across America and Augusta crowned a Miss Golf during Masters week from 1957-67. The winner wearing her Miss Golf sash would help present the trophy and pose with the Masters champion on Sunday at Augusta National.

An editorial in The Augusta Chronicle gushed that “it’s capacity to add beauty and excitement to an already beautiful occasion has made the Miss Golf Pageant a highlight of each year’s Masters week. Both the Pageant and its winner add luster to the Week and fully sustain their right to be regarded as the principal side attraction to the Masters Tournament itself.”

The pageant competition was held early in the week at the Bell Auditorium downtown with a coronation ball taking place on the eve of the tournament. Miss Golf would go home with a cash prize FootJoy golf shoes and other paraphernalia.

One famous contestant was Nancy Moore of Aiken S.C. who lost her bid at Miss Golf before becoming Miss South Carolina and later marrying and mothering four children with Sen. Strom Thurmond. Barbara Anne Harris Sorkin of Greenville S.C. won Miss Golf in 1966 and went on to become Miss South Carolina and compete for Miss America. She presented the trophy to repeat Masters champion Jack Nicklaus and her experience left an indelible impression.

“I know everyone was abuzz about Arnold Palmer but I thought Jack Nicklaus was a lot cuter” Sorkin says now.

Long-drive contest

In an effort to lure patrons to pay to attend practice rounds Clifford Roberts was a fan of various special exhibitions. There were teaching clinics emceed by Chick Harbert featuring Ben Hogan Sam Snead Dow Finsterwald Lionel and Jay Hebert Art Wall and Jackie Burke.

Events included an alternate-shot match a show by trick-shot artist Paul Hahn an approach-shot contest to the practice green and an iron-play contest in the expanse of property between the 9th and 18th holes that served as the original practice area. According to David Owen who wrote The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts Augusta National and Golf’s Most Prestigious Tournament Roberts once devised a competition in which the pros took turns trying (unsuccessfully) to repeat Gene Sarazen’s famous “double-eagle” shot from the 15th fairway.

“The contests were fun because the pros were always so relaxed and having such a good time” a spectator from the era is quoted saying in Owens’ book.

But the most popular special event was the long-drive competition that started when the Masters returned after its three-year World War II hiatus.

The long-drive contest took place on Wednesday at the first tee. Winners through the years included Sam Snead with a 290-yard drive in 1948; Mike Souchak with a drive of 294 yards in 1956; and Mike Fetchick with a record blast of 351 yards in 1957.

In 1954 before missing the fabled Snead-Hogan playoff by one shot despite making a Sunday ace on No. 6 amateur Billy Joe Patton launched a drive 338 yards and then passed up on his last two long-drive attempts. Nobody could top him.

In the final long-drive contest in 1959 George “the Human Howitzer” Bayer won with a drive of 321 yards with Frank Stranahan next at 294. In 1960 the event was replaced permanently by the Par 3 Contest.

Bon Air Hotel & Masters Calcutta

After the 13th of the 68 Masters he covered Dan Jenkins wrote that “in many curious ways the Bon Air is the Masters.”

“Speak to me now of a Masters and while you envision deep-green pines luscious fairways and Bobby Jones I envision — to pick a starting point — the Bon Air Hotel.”

In Augusta’s heyday as a winter retreat for rich Northerners before they could fly over en route to Florida the Bon Air was a grand if quirky destination. It was the heart of early Masters weeks with most of the players and prominent dignitaries congregating there (or the Partridge Inn across the street).

Guests were entertained nightly by well-known singers and musicians and it was the site of glamorous gala called the Golf Ball beginning in 1936. The top golfers including Bobby Jones attended the ball as the official kickoff for social events during Masters week. By 1938 more than 1000 tickets were sold.

Most important the Bon Air was the venue for the annual Masters Calcutta even after the USGA formally disapproved of gambling auctions in 1948. Players would often buy back shares of themselves and make real money above the tournament purse. Claude Harmon the 1948 champ sold for a paltry $450 about 2 percent of the $21000 in pool. A year later after his one-year suspension by Clifford Roberts for playing multiple practice shots amateur Frank Stranahan commanded a princely sum having been runner-up in 1947. Who bought him? Clifford Roberts. Stranahan got the last laugh by finishing 19th.

Any elegance the Bon Air had deteriorated into what Jenkins dubbed “Early Insanity” décor and fell out of favor with players who increasingly stayed in private homes to ruin the once communal vibe. The edifice remains as a senior residence facility.

Bass fishing

After a walk through the woods below the cabin that’s named after him President Dwight Eisenhower recommended that Augusta National build a dam to create a couple of fishing ponds on what is now the site of the par-3 course. Hence its name Ike’s Pond.

The pond and various other water hazards at Augusta National were well stocked with fish through the years. Bream used to run in Rae’s Creek which was a popular fishing spot for the caddies who chose not to play golf during the annual caddie day. Bass inhabited the ponds on 15 and 16.

But Ike’s Pond was the favored fishing hole and would attract some Masters competitors — from Snead to Fuzzy Zoeller — who arrived early to enjoy one of their favorite non-golf hobbies.

In 1976 Johnny Miller was fishing alone at the par-3 course on Monday night before the tournament when he caught a 9-pound large-mouth bass the biggest ever taken from that pond. The avid fisherman reportedly bounded up the hill and — despite his wet tennis shoes — burst into the clubhouse during the dinner honoring international players to show off his wriggling catch.

“You’d think he’d won the U.S. Open” said Jerome Franklin who was not only the last surviving charter member of Augusta National but the previous holder of the Augusta National largemouth bass record at 8 3/4 pounds.

Masters pro-am sort of

Palmetto Golf Club in nearby Aiken S.C. is the second oldest 18-hole golf course in America — originally designed from 1892-95 by Herbert Leeds (Myopia Hunt Club) and with green complexes that were redesigned and grassed by Alister MacKenzie in 1932 after he finished his work co-designing Augusta National.

From 1945-53 Palmetto attracted an elite field to its Devereux Milburn pro-am tournament the weekend before the Masters with a cast of winners including Byron Nelson Ben Hogan Herman Keiser Henry Picard Lawson Little Harold McSpaden and George Fazio. The $10000 winner’s share helped ensure top professionals came annually to the Masters which paid the winner only $2500 in 1946.

In 1945 in the middle of Nelson’s record streak of 11 consecutive PGA Tour wins he got his “Phantom 12th” win in Palmetto’s pro-am with Eugene Grace the president of Bethlehem Steel.

Tom Moore the professional emeritus at Palmetto and the club’s historian noted that Sam Snead’s name is notably absent from the board of pro-am winners in the Stanford White-designed clubhouse.

“Snead would have won pro-am two or three times but he had a way of pissing off his playing partners” Moore said. “Once a famous jockey of that era was playing with Snead and Snead said ‘If you make one net birdie on the next three holes I’m gonna win the pro-am.’ The jockey looked at his caddie and said ‘Go put my clubs in the car.’”

The Devereux Milburn Memorial Trophy — named after the past president of Palmetto who donated the award — still exists as a two-man member invitational. It’s the most coveted title for members hoping to have their names embossed on the wooden boards with Hall of Famers."

Special to the News Journal

After last year’s hiatus the annual Spring Festival of Flowers is returning April 9-11 at the Pensacola State College Milton campus. Now in its 23rd year the festival continues as a vernal convention for local growers garden clubs and commercial nurseries. It’s also a marquee event for the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS).

“The festival is a partnership with the Pensacola State College Milton campus” said Robin Vickers administrative support assistant with UF’s West Florida Research and Education Center.

In turn the festival supports IFAS agricultural programs and allows the UF Student Club to sell trees donated by area growers.

“The proceeds provide scholarships to University of Florida and PSC’s Milton Campus students” Vickers continued. “The student club sales go directly to the club to fund activities and student field trips each year.”

Additionally the festival will include a variety of booths with arts and crafts nature-minded nonprofit organizations such as the Boy Scouts and such children’s activities as face painting.

East Hill Edible Gardening has had a presence at the festival for six years. Renee Perry and her husband Tom Garner founded it in 2014 as a means to promote local gardening mainly through classes that have taught hundreds of aspiring growers. Perry operates a booth at the corner of Alcaniz and Jackson Streets on Saturdays and at the Sunday edition of Palafox Market. Outside the festival’s purview of flowers Perry’s angle is growing your own food.

“That’s my involvement with the festival. We specialize in edible plants but the festival is for plant enthusiasts. That’s how we fit in” said Perry. “I’m one of 20 to 30 vendors that come out to sell plants and make new customers. And it’s fun.”

In addition to your garden variety of herbs and vegetables Perry’s booth will introduce more obscure edibles like culantro a piquant cousin to cilantro; melokhiya a heat-loving leafy green; and mushroom plant a shrub from Papua New Guinea that tastes like its name.

Like most festivals the Spring Festival of Flowers had a humble start debuting in 1988 as a plant sale for PSC’s Environmental Horticultural Program. It was an immediate hit with the botanical community and was hosted in subsequent years by the Santa Rosa Master Gardeners and the Friends of the Milton Gardeners. In 2017 it became a collaborative effort between UF/IFAS and PSC Milton campus. The institute’s mission is “to develop knowledge in agricultural human and natural resources and to make that knowledge accessible to sustain and enhance the quality of human life.”

The PSC Milton campus sits almost dead center in Santa Rosa County which despite its urban development is still mostly agricultural. The county’s nexus with ag research dates back to 1946 when a research facility was established in Jay to aid local farmers. In 1995 the University of Florida opened the West Florida Research and Education Center (WFREC) one of 10 like facilities across the state under its Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. The center conducts research in areas such as cropping systems entomology and watershed management and offers degrees in Natural Resource Conservation and Plant Science. This ties in perfectly with the region’s cash crops like peanuts and cotton while trying to meet the recurring challenge of farming in the state’s sandy clay soil. Currently the West Florida outpost is researching the potential of a new yield.

“When Florida introduces a new crop to our state we have a responsibility to ensure we protect our natural resources for today and generations down the road” said Mark Long the admissions officer for WFREC. “This means we need to ensure the new (emerging) crop doesn’t threaten our waters soils wildlife forests and it doesn’t bring in insects or kill off insects we need. As an example we are growing carinata (an oilseed crop that can contribute to biofuel) at our research facility and all 10 of them get involved for a variety of reasons.”

As the center and the IFAS as a whole is a state and county effort the Spring Festival of Flowers is a direct result of this cross pollination as it curates its participants.

“Robin (Vickers) has an extensive network of folks that she made in the time she’s spent at UF Milton” said Long. “A lot of these nurseries hire our graduates or contribute items to help with student learning.”

P&K Nursery in Elberta Alabama for one has been at the festival since its inaugural year.

“It’s wonderful for our business” said Kristen Schell who runs the nursery. “They cater to not only the vendors but to the buyers. It’s nice to go where people know a lot about plants.”

The nursery has a booth at Palafox Market and shows up at area events like the recent Orange Beach Festival of Art and the Elberta Sausage Festival. Its 5-acre spread invites customers as well.

“People love to come out here and know it’s locally grown” she said.

P&K churns out about 18000 ferns a year along with a variety of flowers like roses and bougainvillea which will be at the festival.

“People love our blooming baskets” said Schell. “We get a lot of repeat customers.”

News Service of Florida

TALLAHASSEE — With natural gas costing more than expected Florida Power & Light customers will see increases in their monthly bills starting in May.

The state Public Service Commission on Thursday approved a request by FPL to collect $302.5 million from customers to cover additional costs of fuel for power plants. Also Thursday the commission approved a pilot program that will involve Tampa Electric Co. installing about 200 charging ports for electric vehicles.

Fuel costs make up a major part of customers’ monthly bills and utilities are supposed to pass through those costs without profiting. Each fall the commission approves estimated fuel costs. But utilities can return to the commission to seek increases in customer bills if fuel costs are substantially higher than projected.

FPL made a filing in February asking to collect the additional money pointing to increases in “natural gas prices and a rise in the natural gas forward curve exacerbated by cold weather events.”

Under the plan approved by the commission FPL customers who use 1000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month will see their bills increase from the current $99.05 a month to $103.02 in May. The additional charges will continue through December.

The utility industry uses 1000 kilowatt-hour residential bills as a benchmark but electricity consumption varies widely among customers.

Duke Energy Florida made a filing last week at the Public Service Commission that said its fuel costs surged early in the year but that natural gas prices subsequently went down. As a result it said it would not seek an increase in the amount it collects from customers.

Duke pointed to a “short-term increase driven by increased demand during the winter months coupled with a short-term decrease in supply resulting from the winter storm that impacted Texas and the (Midwest) in February. In the aftermath of that unprecedented event natural gas prices have decreased.”

The commission’s approval of the Tampa Electric vehicle-charging pilot program came as the state utilities and other companies try to prepare for increased use of electric cars and trucks in the coming years.

Under the four-year program Tampa Electric will install about 200 charging ports at places such as businesses multi-family housing communities and government buildings. The commission approved the utility spending $2 million on costs such as installation and another $100000 a year for operations.

“Electric vehicle use in Florida is on the rise and approval of these additional charging stations will help Florida keep pace with this growing industry” Commission member Andrew Fay said in a statement after the approval.

But commission Chairman Gary Clark dissented expressing concerns about Tampa Electric customers who wouldn’t participate in the program being forced to pick up part of the cost.

“I just think that we really need to look at how even in a pilot program how we are spreading costs around” Clark said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9sb2NhbC9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3Rob21hcy1mYXJyZWxsLWRlYWQvMjAyMS8wNC8wMy8yNzg1MTI5Ni05NDkyLTExZWItYmI0OS01Y2IyYTk1ZjRjZWNfc3RvcnkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thomas F.

Larry generally having been up late the night before grumbled in reply to those cheerful greetings from Cindi a cashier in the restaurant at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in Carlsbad N.M. in 1973.

Cindi swooned at the sight of Larry with his blonde hair and mutton chop sideburns clad in jeans and a T-shirt his park ranger uniform slung over his shoulder.

""He was just so cute and so cool"" says Cindi who was 21. ""He wore big Ray-Bans all the time. He was just too cool to even speak.""

Some mutual friends -- who knew Cindi thought Larry was cute -- encouraged him to ask her out.

""I knew she was a good church-going girl"" says Larry who at 25 was enjoying his bachelor freedom.

They had both grown up in Carlsbad but their paths hadn't crossed before then. Larry had recently returned to the area after a tour with the U.S. Marines in Vietnam.

When he finally did ask Cindi for a date she turned him down.

""The first time he asked me out I said 'No I really can't. My church is having a revival'"" she says. ""This makes me sound like a missionary. I'm not -- I wasn't -- but I just really enjoyed being at my church.""

She fretted that he might not ask her out again but they actually started chitchatting after that.

""I would only have 30 minutes for lunch so sometimes I would call her and ask her to put in an order for me. She would put in an order for me at the cafeteria and I would come up and eat there"" he says. ""I said 'I sure do like Butterfingers' and I would say 'Do you have any Butterfingers that are fresh?' And then every time I would come up there she would have a Butterfinger for me.""

Based on her response the first time he asked her out Larry considered whether she might have turned him down because his invitation alluded to an evening of debauchery. The next time he asked he tried a different approach.

""My friend told me she was a Christian girl so I should ask her to get a milkshake instead"" he says.

This time she said yes.

""We went bowling"" says Cindi who was working at the park during the day and going to college classes at night.

She wasn't worried about going out with him no matter how grumpy he had seemed to be because her friends assured her he was a good guy.

""They told me he was just a big teddy bear"" she says.

Cindi and Larry knew within a month of their first date that they would probably get married.

Over the holidays shortly after they started dating they drove to northern New Mexico so Cindi could introduce Larry to some of her relatives.

""We got snowed in"" she says. ""We were stuck there for about three days staying with my aunt and uncle for three days. On New Year's Eve we were at a big dance -- they were Catholic -- that they had at their church. He tapped me on the shoulder and he said 'Do you want to marry me?' And I turned around and I said 'Yes.' And then I turned back round. That's it.""

Larry didn't have a ring to offer because he hadn't actually planned to propose.

""She said yes so quick that I thought 'Well OK.' I knew that I wanted to marry her but I just didn't know when would be a good time"" he says.

When they got back to Carlsbad on Jan. 8 they went shopping for an engagement ring together.

They were married on March 15 1974 in First Freewill Baptist Church in Carlsbad.

They honeymooned in Roswell N.M. which didn't yet offer any intriguing alien conspiracies.

In 1975 Larry was hired as a park ranger in Hot Springs National Park. Cindi joined him when he went to school in Washington D.C. for about six months. She was pregnant with their first child by the time he was to leave for Hot Springs though so she stayed behind with her family while she waited to give birth. She and their newborn baby joined him in Hot Springs a few weeks later.

Larry went to work for the U.S. Postal Service in 1980 and retired in 2008. Cindi retired from First Step Inc. in 2015 after working there for 27 years.

They have two children: Ashley Bishop of Hot Springs and Scott Eaton of North Little Rock. They have four grandchildren -- Maya Bishop and Jake Bishop of Hot Springs and Emma Eaton and Elli Eaton of North Little Rock.

Larry isn't grumpy in the mornings anymore.

""Now he fixes my coffee and breakfast every morning"" she says.

Larry might not have intended to propose when he did but says ""I have no regrets. I thought she was the most beautiful woman. She still is. She hasn't changed much. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.""

Slips trips and falls make up the majority of general industry accidents according to the U.S. Department of Labor and more than a quarter of all truck and transportation workplace injuries and are the leading cause for worker compensation claims.

Nearly a decade ago a driver for a contracted carrier fell off a flatbed trailer at one of Eaton Steel Corp.'s plants. This event cost the parent company of Adica Trucking Company a $1.4 million settlement.

[Related: Fleets using new technology to remove busywork improve safety outcomes]

About three years ago Adica had one of its own drivers fall off an open flatbed onto his head. The driver was bending over and lost his balance said Jeff Bronson Adica Trucking Company director of transportation. ""That hit us in the face like a 2x4.""

Bronson along with Adica Fleet Services & Trucking Company Director of Safety Marc Scibilia and the company's corporate counsel David Gunsberg began exploring ways to prevent falls – or at least prevent a driver from falling off the working surface. The group scoured the Internet and found nothing that was both lightweight and portable.

Thus the NoFalls was born ""out of necessity"" Bronson noted.

At 85 pounds per side NoFalls is fairly lightweight and portable. It's quick to assemble and disassemble and it also meets or exceeds the OSHA guidelines for fall protection (1910.28).

""We had the product tested by an independent lab and have the report to show the results"" Bronson said.

NoFalls is a network of stakes and straps that creates a split-rail-type barrier along the edge of the trailer. It also acts as a guide wire when walking along the deck much like a handrail on a staircase.

""Many warehouses have rolling platforms that bump against your deck so if you fall you fall even with the deck"" Bronson said ""but what if you are at a job site or a facility that does not have any protection from falling? The driver has had no choices in the past to protect himself or his income. Companies have millions of dollars in exposure and no one has filled the need to cover that exposure.""

Bronson said the company has equipped all of its warehouses and processing facilities with NoFalls and Adica has begun equipping all its flatbeds with them. About 30% of the private carrier's trailers have been outfitted so far but Bronson said ""we are installing them daily as they come through the yard. We have 110 trailers scheduled.""

The system features four horizontal safety straps and five heavy-duty aluminum C-channel and square tube posts that create a 52-inch-high safety fence alongside the trailer. The straps have a workload limit of more than 1400 pounds.

""When I tested it I weighed 285 pounds and I ran right at it and hit it"" Bronson said ""and I'm an old hockey player.""

From the ground level the driver inserts the posts into the trailer stake pockets. The posts with the straps go at each end and posts with slots are placed as close to the center as possible. Quick release pins affix the unit to the deck. The driver then inserts the strap hooks from the bottom the middle straps on each end of the center post and tightens each with the ratchet. Once the lower straps have been secured the driver can climb onto the trailer and secure the top straps to the center post and tighten them.

The system meets DOT requirements for a fixed feature and can be left up when traveling down the road but Bronson notes it wasn't designed to provide cargo securement protection.

Bronson estimated the entire system could be assembled and taken down in about 10 minutes and could be stored against the inside of the bulkhead. Safety products on the market exist for flatbed drivers but Bronson notes that most are heavy expensive and difficult to store when the driver needs to haul open deck.

""We didn't get into this to make money or create a massive company"" he said. ""We got in to it to protect our guys. The drivers average [age] is about 50 or 51. Their balance isn't what is was 20 years ago. You're really increasing your chances of a fall.""

What started out as a project to ""just to protect our drivers"" Bronson and Scibilia agreed has evolved into protecting an industry. Bronson said he's received inquiries from other flatbed companies who have seen Adica's drivers using the system and made the $2000 system available for public purchase via truckfallprevention.com.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1bnRzcG9zdC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2xvY2t1cHMtYW5kLW5hdHVyYWwtYmVhdXR5LWluLXRoZS1lYXRvbnMtNzg1NDM3Mi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Eatons is an area of natural beauty and conservation with some interesting history,"In fact the population of Eaton Socon and Eaton Ford have more than doubled between 1931 and 2001 and is now 9042.

Eaton Socon is mentioned as ""Eaton"" in the Domesday Book when the manor belonged to Eudo Dapifer.

In the 13th Century it became a Soke which meant it was independent of the Hundred Cout at Barford. In time Soke became Socon.

The wier at Eaton Socon was constructed in 1967 and has associated locks to allow river navigation. The riverbank hosts a large inn called The River Mill Tavern.

St Mary's Church stands on the picturesque green in the centre of the village and the old Great North Road runs through the centre of Eaton Socon and Eaton Ford. The White Horse pub dates back to the 13th Century.

The White Horse has a long history. (Image: ARCHANT)

There is a conservation area with listed buildings and thatched cottages along the Great North Road and parts of Peppercorns Lane and School Lane.

Peppercorns Lane leads to a path that runs from Riverside Park at St Neots up to St Mary's Church which backs on to meadow land Eaton Socon Cricket Club and The Pightle which is natural wildlife area.

St Mary's Church contains a recently constructed monument to John Henry Elliot the former headmaster of Eaton Socon School. The school opened around 1818 and John was its first headmaster.

Nearby is the famous lockup. It dates back to the 19th Century and the days before the establishment of a county police force when the parish was responsible for law and order within its own boundaries

Although the majority of St Neots is east of the Great Ouse the Eatons are on the west bank. Eaton Ford is still part of the ecclesiastical parish of Eaton Socon.

In Anglo-Saxon times the area of Eaton Ford was known as Sudbury but became known as Eaton Ford as it was next to the village (and free land soke) of Eatun (now Eaton Socon) and hosted a great ford across the river a main route from the south to the town of St Neots.

A Boston man has pleaded guilty to stealing Andy Warhol paintings from a friend then selling fake versions to a collector on eBay.

Brian Walshe 46 took $80000 from the collector for two counterfeit versions of the artist’s Shadows series of works from 1978.

Walshe originally put them on eBay in 2016 for $100000 after claiming that the purchase price of the artworks was $240000.

Buyer Ron Rivlin who owns a Los Angeles gallery agreed to a deal for the paintings with a signed agreement that they could get a full refund within three days of purchase.

Authorities say the buyer’s assistant flew to Boston to collect the art and a day later Walshe paid it into his account.

“According to bank records the cashier’s check was deposited that day into an account that Walshe controlled and $33400 was subsequently withdrawn in the following 14 days” said acting United States Attorney Nathaniel Mendell.

But a day after the purchase the new owner realised that something was wrong with the paintings.

“The buyer removed the paintings’ frames and found no Warhol Foundation authentication stamps and noticed that the canvasses and staples looked new” said prosecutors.

“When he compared the paintings to the photographs from the eBay listing they did not look identical. The buyer concluded that the paintings he purchased from Walshe were not authentic.”

Investigators say that Walshe who had previously tried to sell the paintings to a New York City gallery in 2011 then made excuses to delay refunding the money.

Prosecutors say that Walshe got the paintings from a former college classmate in South Korea who agreed he could take the collection which included the Warhol works back to the US for sale.

But Walshe who was arrested for the alleged scam in 2018 disappeared with the collection until a mutual friend managed to track him down and get some of the artworks back.

Walshe pleaded guilty to wire fraud interstate transportation for a scheme to defraud possession of converted goods and unlawful monetary transaction.

He will be sentenced in August and the wire fraud charges carry a prison sentence of up to 20 years and a fine of $250000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjEvMDQvam9lLXJvaGRlLWJhY2twYWNrLWViYXkta3MxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Imagineer Joe Rohde Lists MORE Rare Disney Items on eBay - Inside the Magic,"Back in November 2020 Imagineer Joe Rohde announced that he was retiring after over 40 years with The Walt Disney Company.

A MUM has revealed how she turned a £20 Ikea unit into an incredible Barbie dollhouse for her daughter’s birthday.

Catherine Moses 26 from Full Sutton in York said she spotted a similar idea on Pinterest of using an old cabinet and decided to have a go at the DIY project herself.

The self-employed cleaner wanted to create a dollhouse for her daughter but also wanted to avoid paying the hefty £300 price tag of the official Barbie products.

Instead Catherine used a £20 Ikea Kallax unit - previously used for toys storage - and turned it into a two-story dollhouse.

She used bargain buys from eBay - including miniature mirrors and stick-on tiles - as well as materials from her craft cupboard to complete the house makeover.

The mum believes she has saved herself over £200 by doing the DIY birthday project herself instead of buying a brand new one.

She shared the transformation on Facebook writing: ""My Ikea unit turned into a Barbie house!

""Doing it for my daughter's 3rd birthday. Not finished yet but I’m happy with it so far

""Has anyone else done anything like this b4?""

The post instantly went viral and raked up over 5500 likes and hundreds of comments with strangers praising Catherine’s budget creation.

Catherine said she got the idea to turn the Ikea unit into a Barbie playhouse after her friend shared a picture with her from Pinterest.

The mother had previously researched buying a Barbie dollhouse from new but was shocked to discover the hefty £300 price.

She said: ""I had a look and based my dollhouse on a picture I found online.

""The Ikea unit was only £20 we’d had it for a while as we were using it to store toys inside Ikea fabric boxes.

""I decided to make my own dollhouse as I wanted something good quality but I also didn’t want something made of flimsy plastic or overpriced.""

Catherine who is mum to Amira who will be three-years-old at the end of September said she asked her partner’s friend for some help to get started.

The joiner made a roof for the dollhouse and used a nail gun to attach it before using plywood to secure the back of the house.

The friend also measured filed and sanded the roof.

Catherine said: ""I then got some filler to fill any gaps I waited overnight to let it dry and then used an under coat on all the new wood that was added.

""I then bought three packs of stick-on tiles and some wooden little craft frames from Poundland I got some wallpaper samples from The Range and I started doing the bathroom first.

""I started with a silver wallpaper which I roughly measured and cut it out before using some spray glue to stick it in.""

The mother went on eBay to pick up some bargain buys for the decor of the dollhouse - she spent £1.85 on rose heads and £5.19 on mirror effect tile wall stickers.

She also purchased Barbie stencils from eBay for £7 along with a Barbie bath set for £17 and a living room playset for £16.

She noticed the wallpaper she had stuck in the dollhouse bathroom was short so she decided to add the stick-on tiles.

She said: ""The tiles were really tricky to do so it wasn’t perfect but I was still pleased with it.

""I then used some of the beading for the edges of the wallpaper I just cut them down and put two coats of undercoat on before gluing it into place.

""I then moved on to doing the living room and used some floral craft paper that I already had and glued that onto the back wall.

""It was short around the edges so I improvised and used some foam roses that I had already bought for a different project and I glued them round the edges and that turned out good.

""I then had some wooden letters that were laying around in my craft cupboard so I got the glue gun and glued them together and glued some pink roses on to make it look pretty then glued it to the floor in the living room area.

""I then put some little mirrors onto the wall that I ordered off eBay.""

Catherine also used a Barbie stencil from eBay to label the front of the house with a purple Sharpie pen.

She has also made a start on the bedroom in the dollhouse by adding craft paper to create the illusion of wallpaper.

The mother started the project at the beginning of September and said she cannot wait for her daughter to see it on her birthday at the end of the month.

She added: ""I was looking for barbie houses and they were over £300. I just know she’s going to love this!

""She’s had a sneak peek at it already but I’m trying to hide it under a sheet in the garage before her birthday and until it is finished.

""I just need to finish off the bedroom kitchen kids room the hangout area and the garden area which I’m going to use fake grass on.’

The DIY enthusiast said she also has plans to use a toy box that was made for her son when he was little to create a Barbie hangout area.

And she is also going to put a bargain Barbie park set she purchased online in the garden area.

Facebook users were left totally impressed by Catherine’s incredible DIY skills and cost-effecting project.

One user wrote: ""This is a great idea. Better than the overpriced plastic tat. Looks better quality and reusing items.""

Another commented: ""Looks amazing!!! Well done lucky girl!""

A third praised the mother replying: ""Wow! That's awesome! She's going to love it.""

Meanwhile a fourth added: ""What a cracking idea. Pinterest has some unusual dollhouses too!""

The dolls belong to Rose and it’ll be up to you and your Player 2 to determine why Rose has dolls of Max and Cody why they’ve been possessed by Max and Cody and ultimately how to get back to Rose to see if she can reverse what’s happened.

The game is about love and the challenges of a relationship and it’s a great backdrop for the gameplay of It Takes Two which will force you and your Player 2 to cooperate at essentially all times. Puzzles platforming segments bosses and more must be solved together. This adventure will take Max and Cody to all sorts of locales at their house ranging from a shed with an evil toolbox to a tree that stands as the backdrop for a war between squirrels and wasps and more. That’s just the tip of the iceberg.

As the game progresses the challenges Max and Cody face will get even more difficult and it’ll be easy throughout your journey to get lost.

So in many ways entering the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) was the next logical step for the 51-year-old Irish artist whose work explores themes of digital currency and value.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are electronic identifiers that verify the existence and the ownership of a digital collectible. The technology has been around since at least 2017 and come as an offshoot of the boom in cryptocurrencies which also run on the blockchain.

But the NFT craze hit frenzied new highs in March when Christie’s the prestigious art auction house auctioned off a digital collage by an artist who goes by the name of Beeple for nearly $70m immediately making him the third-most expensive living artist in history.

The seemingly meteoric rise of NFTs has many wondering why any collector would want to buy one but for artists like Abosch NFTs are helping to solve problems that have long been central to digital art: how do you claim ownership of something that can be easily and endlessly duplicated? And what does ownership of art mean in the first place?

In 2020 Abosch started working on a series of images that tackled themes of cryptography and alphanumeric codes. After several of his in-person shows were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic Abosch decided now was the perfect opportunity to sell his work as NFTs. He plotted to auction them on OpenSea the largest marketplace for the tokens which sees 1.5 million weekly visitors and facilitated $95m in sales in February 2021 alone.

Months later he made a profit of $2m from the series all art that cannot be physically transported to a gallery or hung on a wall. It made him the most successful NFT artist on the OpenSea platform. When he spoke to the Guardian on the eve of the sale in March he said the idea that a piece of art must be a physical purchase that can be displayed somewhere is quickly becoming outdated.

“Some people struggle with this idea because they want to know what is it you actually own?” he said. “But people of a younger generation don’t struggle with it. It’s a very old-world idea wanting to hold something in your hand as if the intangible or the immaterial doesn’t have value.”

An NFT auction works much like an online auction on platforms like eBay. Each work is displayed online as a jpeg file that contains metadata – which literally means “data about data” – about the work’s title number and who owns it.

Abosch’s 1111 series launched at 11.11am EST on OpenSea  where he put up 111 works for a set amount of time. After the start of the auction interested potential buyers go to the page for Abosch’s sale to bid on each work of art individually – in this case using the cryptocurrency Ethereum.

While the NFTs were sold on Opensea the actual string of characters that attaches the owner to their new NFT is stored on Arweave a software that fashions itself as a kind of permanent internet by storing files in perpetuity across a distributed network of computers so that they cannot be deleted or destroyed in the future.

In other words: using Ethereum a buyer will pay for a jpeg on the NFT auction platform OpenSea and in exchange receive an address on Arweave confirming the purchase and ownership of the image.

Ultimately 106 of the 111 works were purchased by 53 unique collectors with the most expensive selling for $21242.

Abosch said many artists like himself are drawn to the NFT technology for its democratizing nature: anyone can log on and purchase the goods and the work comes with a publicly visible ledger of its entire history – when it was created who has owned it who has purchased it and for how much.

Abosch described this as a departure from art purchases of the past in which investors tuck valuable art away in storage to save it for a time when it will be worth more.

Cryptocurrency popularity and the rise of art market speculation have been gaining interest for quite some time – but the pandemic further primed the industry for the success of a technology like NFTs said Andrei Pesic an art history professor at Stanford.

“In the years of 2020 and 2021 as we have so weirdly and radically had to move much of our lives online it has opened up or accelerated the process of valuing digital goods in a similar way that we value physical goods” he said.

Abosch who has been using the blockchain to create art since 2013 said he believes the craze surrounding NFTs has been ignited by two factors: that the technology is legitimately interesting and useful and that any new shiny item that is making people get rich quick can easily draw attention.

“We are in a major transitional period – it’s like we’re in the middle of a serious earthquake except at the end of the earthquake instead of everything being destroyed we’re going to see new structures that are actually really interesting” he said. “But there’ll be some rubble as well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vbG9yZHNvZmdhbWluZy5uZXQvMjAyMS8wNC9pdC10YWtlcy10d28tcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It Takes Two Review,"Popular game director Josef Fares and Hazelight Studios have built up a strong reputation for developing co-op video games.

Magical Tears and The Bitter Couple

It Takes Two kicks off its tale when the bitter married couple Cody and May both proclaim their upcoming divorce will settle their relationship issues. Fortunately their daughter Rose overhears their conversation and takes action… sort of. Wishing that her parents would remain close Rose cries onto dolls resembling her parents. Soon after Cody and May wake up in new bodies – the very same dolls Rose cried on earlier. A relationship-therapy book named Dr. Hakim explains to Cody and May the only way they can reach Rose to get back to normal is to fix their loveless relationship.

At its core It Takes Two turns a mature and honest lens onto real-life relationships. Sometimes life gets in the way of love and that has a major impact. May is a workaholic providing for her family but she is never home to give that much-needed interpersonal support to Cody. Cody on the other hand does not show appreciation for May’s diligence but feels lonely and underappreciated for his efforts. With obnoxious pushes to “col-lab-or-ate” from Dr. Hakim the two begin to begrudgingly work together. From there Cody and May charge head first into an absolutely insane adventure filled with laugh-out-loud moments and an unforgettable co-op gaming experience.

It Takes Two Is Co-Op Perfection

It Takes Two is a complete co-op game from beginning to end fully prioritizing the 2-player experience. One player will control Cody while the other will play as May in a split-screen couch co-op mode. For players with some distance between them one player who owns the game can invite a friend to join them for the entirety of It Takes Two for free. That’s right – One copy two players and all the fun this title has to offer.

This bombastic adventure takes Cody and May to places only a truly wild imagination can conceive of. Aiding a colony of squirrels in their war against wasps; solving puzzles in the deep weirdness of space; surviving in a toxic-filled garden come to life; and more. All of the locales are visually gorgeous with its 3D animation similar to the delight of a Toy Story film. The places you will visit and the narrative strings are tied to the co-op gameplay. Both players will fulfill the giver and receiver roles to complete puzzles and platforming areas. While this type of gameplay has potential to become stale after some hours It Takes Two stays true to keeping gameplay-to-gameplay moments fresh and exciting.

Imagination Has No Limits in It Takes Two

After making a deal with the comically militant squirrels to take care of the wasps Cody and May are given weapons. Cody’s gun shoots a sticky substance that can explode when ignited. And of course May is given a weapon full of match sticks serving as a rocket launcher. Encounters throughout the level are shaped around that combination where Cody and May have to use their specialties to reach their goal. The entire chapter is peppered with co-op puzzles platforming sections and boss fights that kept my co-op partner and I in constant suspense.

During the space-themed level we definitely had more than a few “Ah-ha!” realizations maneuvering between challenging anti-gravity mind teasers. There were even fist-pumping moments of triumph as we took down epic-scale bosses together. In addition each chapter has a number of optional competitive minigames for Cody and May to take on. From racing to carnival-like shooting galleries there are more than enough distractions throughout to take a quick break from the story if you choose. You will not miss out on any crucial story moment if you do decide to skip them. Only some fun competition between you and your playing partner.

During the 10 – 15 hour story campaign there was never the feeling that one player was doing all the work. Cody and May are given specific roles to play in each chapter but both are equally important to achieve success. This makes playthrough number two even more enticing since Cody and May offer different gameplay experiences. It Takes Two is a font of original gameplay ideas that truly takes two. It only gets better the more you play.

A Timeless Masterpiece

At first I was worried Cody and May’s journey to reconnect intimately would feel rushed or at worst pointless. However the story’s climax not only had a satisfying end but one that felt earned by both the characters and the players after all they went through. It Takes Two attains Fares’ focus to have narrative and gameplay in unison rather than separate entities. Full of laughter surprises and addicting gameplay It Takes Two is one of the best games of 2021 so far. Everything about It Takes Two is completely wrapped in creativity and passion that cement it as a timeless masterpiece."

The stock of Bridgestone (OTCPK:BRDCY 30-year Financials) appears to be fairly valued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $20.02 per share and the market cap of $28.2 billion Bridgestone stock appears to be fairly valued. GF Value for Bridgestone is shown in the chart below.

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. Bridgestone's 3-year average revenue growth rate is worse than 69% of the companies in Vehicles & Parts industry. Bridgestone's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -18.1% which ranks worse than 83% of the companies in Vehicles & Parts industry.

Story continues

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months Bridgestone's return on invested capital is -1.37 and its cost of capital is 3.14. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Bridgestone is shown below:

Overall The stock of Bridgestone (OTCPK:BRDCY 30-year Financials) is believed to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is fair.

Krispy Kreme and Oreo have teamed up to offer new doughnut creations and for the first time an Oreo Cookie glaze which is made with Oreo cookie pieces. The new glaze—offered in addition to the company’s regular glaze and not as a replacement—and doughnuts are available starting today.

This marks the first time Krispy Kreme has teamed up with another brand to transform its glaze waterfall.

Two new doughnut types are being introduced both of which are available only for a limited time. The Oreo Cookie glazed doughnut will be covered with the Oreo glaze stuffed with cookies and the brand’s signature Kreme frosting and finished with an icing drizzle and Oreo cookie crumbs. The Oreo Cookie Over-the-Top doughnut is first coated with the Oreo glaze followed by a layer of cookies and cream filling then drizzled with chocolate icing and finished with an Oreo cookie wafer.

Krispy Kreme did not provide a calorie count for either confection.

It’s a logical time for the company to experiment with new flavors. Krispy Kreme has received a vast amount of attention for its offer of a free daily doughnut for the entirety of 2021 to anyone with a COVID-19 vaccination card.

The chain has also expanded its footprint. Last year it began delivering doughnuts nationwide via its website or app. Its increased presence comes as competition is heating up in the world of fried dough. McDonald’s has in the past couple of years begun to explore the doughnut space and Dunkin’ (formerly Dunkin’ Donuts) continues to turns heads with its coffee brands.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA0LTAzL2FzLW1lbWUtc3RvY2stbWFuaWEtZml6emxlcy13YWxsLXN0cmVldC1zZWVzLWJpZy1yZWNrb25pbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Meme Stock Mania Fizzles Wall Street Sees 'Big Reckoning',"The day-trading Reddit crowd turned the first quarter of 2021 into one of the wildest periods of stock market mania in modern history.

By Teresa Murray Consumer Watchdog

Consumers who have accounts on Facebook need to be extra vigilant in the weeks and months ahead as identity thieves could use stolen information to try and commit fraud.

Reports emerged Saturday that a hacker published data from more than 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries including 32 million records on users in the United States. The compromised data includes their full names phone numbers Facebook IDs birthdates bios locations and in some cases email addresses according to Business Insider.

This serves as another important reminder that consumers must always be on the lookout for identity thieves who may call text or email victims and try to trick them into providing more information. What we frequently see after data breaches: Bad guys may contact unsuspecting consumers and pose as Facebook in this case and try to con them into providing their password or credit or debit card numbers. Or scam artists may pose as other types of businesses including banks credit card issuers or online retailers.

For consumers who willingly provide personal information to just about any company especially a social media company it’s not a matter of if but when the data gets compromised. Names along with phone numbers birthdates and email addresses are a dangerous combination to put in the hands of identity thieves.

Besides being on guard for suspicious phone calls emails or texts consumers should check whether they’ve used information that can be found on their Facebook profiles as the answers to secret questions for financial accounts such as their high school mascot or name of their pet. Consumers should also realize the stolen information could be even more dangerous when combined with information from past data breaches such as the Equifax breach of 2017 which disclosed Social Security numbers dates of birth and financial information for half of the U.S. adult population.

Here are tips for coping with the Facebook data breach:

Consider that you could see a broader attack on your identity. If someone has your name date of birth phone number email and other personal information from Facebook they’re armed with enough ammunition to potentially do a lot of damage. You need to be extra cautious and paranoid for a while. Make that forever.

Watch out for suspicious emails phone calls or text messages that try to trick you into disclosing personal information or changing your password based on already having some information about you. Just because someone tells you your date of birth or the city you live in doesn’t mean they’re legit. Heck it wouldn’t be surprising for a con-artist who has your Facebook data to call or email or text you posing as Facebook. Also important to remember: Your bank credit card the IRS FedEx etc. will never send you unsolicited links asking for your login password or Social Security number or anything like that.

If you get an email or text unexpectedly that you think could be legitimate don’t respond. Instead contact the company or agency at a number you look up independently using the back of your credit card your account statement etc. Even if you don’t enter personal information just clicking on a bad link could infect your phone or computer with a virus that steals your information.

The same advice applies to messages on social media. It’s common for information-stealing viruses to be sent with a message such as “Is this you in this video?” Your instinct is to click and look at what the sender is talking about. Don’t give in to the temptation.

Check whether you need to change any information on any of your accounts that use secret questions for password recovery. Don’t use secret questions that other people know the answers to maybe because you have the information on Facebook. It’s probably easy to figure out from your Facebook page what city you grew up in. Same with the elementary school you attended. Or your mother’s maiden name.

Scrub your Facebook account and other social media of unnecessary personal information. Does Facebook or Instagram really need your phone number? No. Facebook frequently asks for your phone number for account security purposes; but it can contact you via your email address. Does Facebook need your birthdate including the year you were born? No. You’ll still get birthday wishes without your birth year being listed. And the site certainly doesn’t need your mailing address. (Face palm.)

Consider getting a virtual phone number such as through Google Voice for those times when you need to give out a phone number. It’s easier to get a new Google voice number vs. replacing a personal cell phone number you’ve had for 10 or 20 years.

Watch out for new Facebook friend requests especially from people you’re already friends with. The requests could be fraudulent.

Make sure your contact information is up to date with the banks credit cards investment firms and other financial institutions you do business with. You’d be surprised to learn how many people have fraud on their accounts and don’t find out quickly because companies don’t have a customer’s current cell phone number or even a correct email or mailing address.

Strongly consider putting a freeze on your credit files with the major credit bureaus. It’s free by law to freeze and thaw. You should be able to do all three bureaus in less than 20 minutes total. Check out our step-by-step guide. To do it by phone: Equifax 800-685-1111; TransUnion 888-909-8872; and Experian 888-397-3742. Freezes not only prevent someone from opening credit accounts in your name but also block someone from fraudulently creating online accounts with the IRS and Social Security Administration.

With any company that offers it opt in for two-step authentication for online access. This requires more than just your username and password. It requires a one-time code that is sent almost immediately by text or email and that you need to actually log in.

Protect your cell phone and primary email account that you use for financial accounts above all else. If someone is trying to breach an account and tries to reset your password the notifications will generally go to your cell phone or email of record. Make sure the password for your primary email account isn’t used on any other account you have.

Sign up for transaction alerts with your financial accounts so that you get text alerts or email messages about any withdrawals or transactions above a certain dollar amount new transfers payees added or any changes in contact information.

If you’re contacted by someone posing as a financial company you actually do business with and they ask for information consider that an escalated threat. Contact your banks and investment accounts first then credit cards and other types of financial accounts. Ask whether you can put additional verbal passwords on your accounts that don’t involve any data in public records or that was available on your Facebook account. We’re talking about PINs or random words (like tangerine or tooth). You want to make sure someone can’t access your accounts for wire transfers or to change your contact information without your secret password.

Here’s advice that’s good for everyone every day regardless of any data breach:

If you’ve put freezes on your credit files great. But don’t get complacent. Remember that 88% of identity theft involves existing accounts. Freezing your credit files does nothing to protect your existing credit cards loans or accounts. And a credit freeze doesn’t protect your checking or savings accounts.

Monitor your primary bank accounts credit cards investments etc. Every week is good. Every day is better.

Put every type of protection you can on your financial accounts. If you can require codes to be sent to your phone in order for you to log in do it. If you can request email or text alerts for purchases above a certain dollar amount or any bank account withdrawals or changes to your contact information then do it.

Be more cautious about anything you post on social media — Facebook Twitter Instagram etc. You can provide thieves with a lot of information without meaning to. This is especially troubling if you tag your best friend and or post photos of your dog online and then use that information as the answers for security questions for bank accounts. And remember that even if your social media accounts are accessible only to friends or family the information is still on some company’s database and can be accessed or sold.

For online financial accounts don’t use the same password on more than one account. If there’s a breach or your account gets hacked the thief can obviously do more damage if they can get into more accounts.

Never use a password that you use for a social media account such as Facebook or Twitter or Instagram on any other account and especially not your email account or any financial account. Social media platforms are hot targets for hackers.

Consider whether it makes sense to sign up for online statements from entities such as your employer your bank your credit card company etc. so that you don’t have to worry about the items getting in the wrong hands.

Whether you get your statements by mail or online know when to expect them each month and reach out if something is missing. It could be a sign someone has intercepted the item or changed your contact information.

It’s old advice but worth repeating: Check your credit reports regularly to make sure there are no accounts or inquiries you don’t recognize. In normal times you’re entitled to one free credit report per year from each of the three major credit bureaus. Because of COVID-19 you’re entitled to one free report each week from each of the three bureaus through April 2022. For the long term the best strategy is to order a report from a different bureau every four months.

Go to annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You’ll be asked to provide your name address Social Security number and date of birth. Don’t just google free credit report. You could end up on a scam site. If there’s any inaccurate information on your credit reports use the dispute process to get the information removed or corrected. Or you write out a paper request and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service P.O. Box 105281 Atlanta Georgia 30348-5281. You need to provide your name address Social Security number date of birth and which bureau you want a report from (Equifax TransUnion or Experian).

If there are actually accounts on the credit reports that aren’t yours you need to do more. Contact the creditors directly by phone to find out whether these are mistakes or whether you’re the victim of more serious identity theft. If it’s the latter you should take additional steps to protect yourself including filing an identity-theft affidavit with the Federal Trade Commission (it will provide you with prewritten letters to send to creditors). The FTC site is great and even has a chat function.

If you’ve chosen to get identity theft monitoring realize that most of these services don’t prevent identity theft — they just notify you once a problem has been detected.

Buy a shredder and use it to destroy sensitive documents.

Pay attention to your credit scores provided on any of your credit card accounts. While the scores may be different than your actual FICO score they shouldn’t change dramatically from month-to-month. If they do and you’re not sure why you need to find out. It could be a sign of fraud.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFscGhyLmNvbS9jYW5jZWwtbGlmZWxvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How To Cancel LifeLock,"LifeLock is an identity theft protection service that sends you alerts when your social security number is used. It’s a great tool to prevent fraud and identity theft.

LifeLock is a paid subscription service billed monthly or yearly. If you no longer wish to pay for the service you can cancel it. But you may not know how. In this article we will walk you through how to cancel your LifeLock subscription.

Cancel your LifeLock subscription

There are multiple ways to cancel your LifeLock subscription.

The first and easiest way to cancel your subscription is from your LifeLock account. Here’s how:

Visit the LifeLock website and sign in.

Click on your name in the upper right-hand corner then select ‘Manage My Subscriptions.’

Click ‘Cancel Subscription Renewal’ under the My Subscriptions tab. Select the reason you’d like to cancel your subscription. Select ‘Cancel Renewal’ at the bottom of the page.

Click ‘Cancel Renewal’ one more time.

Finally you will be taken to the confirmation page. If you don’t see this page your subscription is not canceled.



Of course some users may have trouble with these steps or there’s more to be done (you want to leave feedback you want a refund etc.). If that’s your predicament it may be best to reach out to LifeLock to cancel your subscription.

Here’s how:

Normally we’d say that’s all there is to it but in this case there’s a lot more to know about canceling your subscription. Let’s go over some more important information you need to know about canceling LifeLock.

How Does Canceling LifeLock Work?

As with any subscription service it’s important to know the fine print details about the company’s cancellation policy. Here are some important things you should know about your LifeLock cancellation:

Your subscription remains active until the next billing date – Which means that you can still use the tools and resources until it’s time for renewal.

You need to make sure your subscription is canceled – Confirmation is extremely important. To prevent being charged again make sure your subscription is properly canceled. Check the email that you used to sign up for the service. You should receive a confirmation there.



Contact LifeLock if you need a refund – Fortunately LifeLock is one of the those companies that offers a refund. If you canceled your subscription or if LifeLock didn’t perform the way you’d like contact the support team using the link above for a refund.

Can I use other methods to protect my identity?

Essentially LifeLock is a form of insurance that seeks to protect or alert you to attempt to steal your identity. The service isn’t cheap but there are free ways to protect your credit score and identity.

Here are some of the services LifeLock offers and their free alternatives.

LifeLock places fraud alerts on your credit report with all three agencies. Fraud alerts are largely pointless as many retailers simply ignore them and they expire after 90 days. You can ask for these to be set yourself if you have reason to believe your identity has been stolen or has a substantial risk of being stolen.

Your name is removed from credit card pre-screening. Pre-screening is a somewhat desperate move to get you to take more credit by checking your credit report and then sending you a pre-qualified credit card offer. These screens do not hurt your credit score but can be an avenue for identity theft. You can opt-out yourself at https://www.optoutprescreen.com. Further information is available here.

You get an annual copy of your credit report so you can check entries. You can get this yourself by asking for it. You are entitled to one copy per year of your credit report and you can order it from this website.

Monitor criminal websites for your personal data. What? How? Most criminal websites that trade IDs are on the dark web and no monitoring software in the world is going to be able to find them let alone track and keep an eye on them. Plus if an organization knows of the existence of criminal databases they are duty-bound to report them. I personally would not believe this claim for a second.

Credit checks are part of life now. You need one to get a phone credit card insurance rent an apartment and all manner of things. You don’t need to pay a company a hefty monthly fee to protect it when you can do it yourself by freezing your credit reports.

Protect your identity with a credit freeze

“Freezing” essentially locks your credit report to stop organizations from accessing it and passing on the details to fraudsters or criminals. For example someone steals your identity goes into a store and tries to buy a cellphone contract in your name. The store assistant will perform a credit check as usual but rather than freely accessing the report it will show as frozen and not come up. The criminal will not be able to get the contract or do anything else that requires a credit check. This protects you from the worst effects of identity theft.

All three credit reference agencies allow freezing in fact it is your legal right to freeze your report. Experian outlines it here. TransUnion outlines its here. Equifax outlines its freeze option here. There is a fee involved but it is much lower than LifeLock. Each organization provides you with a ‘thaw’ PIN which you use whenever you want a product or service requiring a credit check. You give the organization the PIN they access your report as normal and it remains locked to all other entities.

Frequently Asked Questions

The security of your sensitive information and credit are of utmost importance in the digital era. In this section we’re answering more questions about LifeLock.

I canceled my subscription but was charged again. What’s going on?

One minor flaw of subscriptions is that you can cancel at any time but your renewal date stays the same. This only becomes an issue when you cancel your subscription on or near your renewal date.

Sometimes it can take a day or two for charges to appear with your financial institution. If you canceled your subscription then a day or two later say a new charge the reason is that you’ve already renewed your subscription. But you aren’t out of luck. There are some things you can do.

Check your renewal date.

If you haven’t canceled your subscription yet check the renewal date. Follow the steps above to cancel your subscription from your online account. Under the ‘Cancel Renewal’ option in the right-hand corner look at the date (it’s in very small print).

Request a refund.

As explained above LifeLock does work with its customers to provide refunds when necessary. Use the Live Chat feature or call the company if you were charged again.

Is LifeLock worth it?

The answer to this question relies heavily on your personal preference. Of course you can add a pin to your social security number or set up credit freezes but LifeLock makes all of that much simpler.

The service will even notify you if your name appears somewhere online. So for that reason it’s definitely a great service.

Although there was quite a scandal a few years ago (the company’s CEO’s credit was breached multiple times after he advertised his social security number) they did take ownership of the problem. So while the service does not make your SSN impenetrable it does add some protection and is much easier than doing it yourself.",,,,,,,,,

Open up Instagram a magazine or the door to an influencer’s home right now and you’re almost guaranteed to see a curated jumble of funky free-flowing furniture and decor whether in the form of the viral pink Ultrafragola mirror or a wavy-handled mug. Architectural Digest dubbed it a trend across the globe. Domino proclaimed it was taking over. And as Vice recently put it “We need blobs now more than ever.” But with its now-ubiquitous nature our collective obsession begs the question: Why did these waves and zigzags and squiggles become so trendy in the first place?

To understand it you need to go back to its start — or its most recent one at least. Gemma Riberti Head of Lifestyle and Interiors at WGSN noted that the stage was set for the rise of squiggly lines as far back as 2015. That’s when billowing waters — an important reference for the wavy trend — started to emerge as an inspiration for lighting which then made its way into the rest of interiors. “Whether it’s worked into transparency or more solid materials water ripples bring the fascination for more elemental natural surfaces to life in intriguing yet soothing designs and we are now seeing it coming to items such as mirrors for instance — ‘disrupting’ the reflection and therefore creating more mindful and engaging moments” she tells TZR in an email.

A year later in 2016 the forecasting brand began tracking a surge in squiggly contours after noting it at shows like Maison&Objet. “We highlighted how sinuous rippling and flowing forms were coming to the fore influenced by the advances in digital creation across a broad range of materials from ceramic to glass wood and 3-D printing” she continues.

From there its momentum continued to build — and in 2020 demand for the aesthetic started to reach a fever pitch. Now you can find squiggles everywhere: In the pink Ettore Sottsass mirrors that have become a verified status symbol; in the twisted candles that dot coffee tables around the world; in the wiggly chairs and couches sitting in countless celebrity and trendsetter living rooms. The numbers back up its ubiquitousness too — there’s been a 28236 percent increase in searches for wavy candles and a 5296 percent increase in searches for wavy mirrors on Etsy in the last three months compared to the same time the previous year.

As for the question of why it finally took off? The most obvious answer of course points to the pandemic an event that’s defined nearly every trend of the past 12 months. “People feel more relaxed when surrounded by shapes that are curved or irregular which could explain why they feel especially drawn to them right now” Amber Dunford design psychology expert and interior stylist tells TZR. “We are collectively experiencing a great deal of tension and anxiety so it makes sense there is perhaps an unconscious desire to seek out that sense of calm via design.”

According to Riberti though the trend provides more than just a calming sensation — it’s also a way to infuse happiness into a home particularly when paired with soft bright colors. “There is an essential element of playfulness to keep into consideration: Squiggly and wavy silhouettes have a simple naive quality to them especially when worked in pastel hues” she says. “Organic and soft inviting and relatable: These qualities make squiggly designs the perfect accent piece to bring up a smile — definitely something consumers are in need of and will be willing to invest in (also because it can be worked at all price points).""

Yet it also goes beyond the sense of joy it provides. As Zoe Cohen the co-founder of furniture brand Wiggle Room explains increased time at home has given people a “heightened desire” to make their spaces look unique. “As of now these curvy or wavy furniture pieces have mostly been the domain of small businesses and independent designers” she tells TZR. “Customers want special unique items and shopping vintage or small locally-made design runs is a way to do that.”

As “trendy” as squiggles and waves may seem though Wiggle Room’s other co-founder Levi Shaw-Faber predicts they’re not going away — mainly because they were always kind of there in the first place. “We think wiggly design is here to stay because it has already been here for a long time” he explains. “The super trendy and beautiful wiggly vase by Alvar Aalto was designed in 1936 and Frank Gehry designed his famous line of wiggly chairs in 1972.” Wiggle Room itself gathered inspiration from the past in designing its first table which was informed by “Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx who in the middle of the 20th century created curving Modernist landscapes using the native plant life of Brazil” says Shaw-Faber.

Architect Frank Gehry Boris Spremo/Toronto Star/Getty Images

As Dunford points out these free-flowing shapes were also prominent in the ‘80s a decade which she says design is bringing back in many ways: “From curved shapes in seating and lighting to line drawing and wavy patterns on wallpaper.” In fact the curvy trend is these days often attributed to Memphis design movement which began in the early 1980s.

Brought to life by the Memphis Group a collective of designers and architects that included its founder Ettore Sottsass the movement became known for its signature terrazzo materials bright colors bold patterns and yes squiggles. In essence it was a rebellion against the minimalist designs and architecture of the time — a familiar sentiment which hints that this isn’t just a one-and-done trend. Rather it seems a resurgence of squiggly lines may just signal a craving for less restraint — and in that case this is far from the last decade you’ll see them.

“The Brazilian banking sector has been changing rapidly and this is very good for both consumers and the so-called traditional banks” said Itaú Unibanco CEO Milton Maluhy per FT. He acknowledged however: “We need to be quicker and better for our products and services to outdo competition.”

FT reported that newcomers such as Nubank “Brazil’s internet banking unicorn” are posing challenges to five major traditional banks: Itaú Bradesco Santander Brasil Banco do Brasil and Caixa Econômica Federal.

Traditional banks have been cutting costs by closing branches and laying off staff according to FT while regulators are taking their own steps to increase options for the banking public. One such effort is the country’s central bank’s open banking initiative intended to give clients increased control over data.

Also FT reported Brazil’s central bank in November launched a free-for-individuals instant payment system called Pix. The system reportedly helps individuals avoid fees tied to current accounts and wire transfers.

“There’s a big debate going on in Brazil [on] what’s going to happen to the profitability of the big banks” Bank of America analyst Mario Pierry told FT. “Now interest rates have come down they can’t just survive buying government securities — they need to start lending more.”

In response big banks are copying some of the FinTech startups’ popular offerings such as online brokerages and also acquiring smaller innovative companies according to FT.

In Brazil the average household loan carries an interest rate of 22 percent and the average business loan comes at 11.3 percent annual interest FT reported citing central bank data.

“Lending rates are still very high and they’re now going down over time — it’s a process” FT quoted Ilan Goldfajn chairman of Credit Suisse in Brazil and a former central bank president as having said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Biscuit Loft is located in the Biscuit Company Lofts a seven-storey factory built by a bakery company in 1925 that was converted into flats 15 years ago.

The Los Angeles firm renovated a 1620 square-foot (493-square-metre) home on the ground floor of the building extending the mezzanine balcony to create a tranquil home office.

""[We] created additional quarters and distinct uses for each room"" said OWIU Studio.

""The result is an apartment that merges Asian design principles with a downtown Los Angeles industrial edge to create a comfortable living environment that inspires thoughtful daily routine and encourages a mindful lifestyle.""

At ground level the apartment now has an open plan living area with the kitchen and dining area tucked under the mezzanine level next to a guest bedroom and en suite.

The guest bedroom doubles as another contemplative living space with a lot of Japanese-style built-in storage including integrated cupboards and shelving.

On the floor raised platforms that can double as a bed frame with the addition of a mattress conceal more storage.

""The guest bedroom design was inspired by the simple Japanese Ryokan a traditional inn and guest experience established in the 17th century"" explained OWIU Studio.

""The minimalist room is lined with tatami mats and will have a Japanese futon for when guests stay over the apartment"" it added.

""Its secondary use will function as a space for tea ceremonies and gatherings as typical in a Ryokan as well as a serene atmosphere for reading creative brainstorming and resting.""

In the main living area sofas and chairs are arranged at the far end under a double-height space with large windows. Noguchi Akari pendant lights dangle over this lofty space drawing attention to the high ceilings.

There is a small circular table for eating at but Biscuit Loft's main dining table is a large concrete slab that doubles as a kitchen island.

A sculptural wooden staircase that leads up from the ground floor with a guardrail that continues to wrap around the mezzanine jutting out to form a geometric Juliette balcony by the home office area.

""The staircase is assembled from 10 custom fabricated panels and features four angled interventions"" said OWIU Studio.

The designers used wooden pilotis to extend the mezzanine by 130 square feet (12 metres).

This intervention serves a dual function of creating extra space for a desk and reading area and creating a buffer zone before the main bedroom.

For the main bedroom OWIU Studio added a new walk-in-wardrobe space alongside the en suite bathroom.

OWIU Studio decorated the loft space with neutral white walls and biscuity toned accents such as buttery blonde wood and furnishings in natural materials such as linen and rattan.

Industrial elements left over from its days as a factory such as a large air vent above the mezzanine have been preserved but painted over.

Textured render has been applied to the main bathroom walls for contrast complemented by oxidised fixtures and fittings and a concrete sink.

OWIU Studio which stands for The Only Way Is Up is an architecture and design studio based in Los Angeles.

More Los Angeles interiors include a loft apartment in an old furniture factory by Stephen Kenn Studio and Enclosures Architects' renovation of a 1930s flat by modernist architect Rudolph Schindler.

However if you buy via one of the links it may be an affiliate and I may earn a small commission.

Looking for somewhere cool for your TV? Have a look at my 10 of the best retro television and media units all doing the job with style.

To be honest I could have gone to 40 and I might well do that in the near future. Once upon a time your TV tended to sit on some non-descript little table in the corner of the room function over style.

But times have changed and makes big and small are looking to add the style back in. Particularly when it comes to midcentury modern design. Ok you can stick your TV on the wall these days but why would you when there are all these cool options out there many offering added storage for your audio/visual essentials too.

As I said I’ll bump the number over time but here is your starter for 30…

1. Mid-Century Media Console at West Elm

Let’s start with a big one. Both in terms of size and price.

West Elm does smaller versions but this Media Console is my favourite. Unashamedly midcentury modern in inspiration it has a lovely wood construction bronze-finished hardware tapered legs and adjustable storage inside courtesy of the cupboards and drawers. Plenty of room for your TV too.

£1751 isn’t cheap but this is a statement piece.

Find out more at the West Elm website

2. Wingrove retro media and shelving unit at Made

Looking for something more than just a place for the TV? This one offers storage aplenty too – and for less than half the price of the one above.

More midcentury modern styling a lighter wood and room for your TV accessories and cables. But this one also has the upper storage too which is ideal for books and decorative items and making full use of the wall space. Nice.

£1195 for this one. Possibly cheaper as Made runs a lot of deals. See the website for any new ones.

Find out more at the Made website

3. Grayson midcentury modern TV stand sideboard at John Lewis

Don’t get too hung up on the colour as this is available in both a light and dark wood finish.

Part of a larger Grayson range this is good to hold a TV up to a 60-inch model with plenty of space behind its sliding doors (it looks particularly impressive shut) for your media devices and consoles. It also has two adjustable glass shelves and cables holes to keep things nice and tidy.

If you like midcentury modern with a Scandinavian vibe this is yours for £450.

Find out more at the John Lewis website

4. Ruark R7 audiovisual mount

This is something of a curveball. It’s a media unit. In fact possibly more of a media unit than any of the others.

At its heart is one of my favourite retro designs the Ruark Audio R7 MKIII radiogram. It’s the perfect marriage of style and substance offering great sound and a cool retro look. But it offers something extra.

You can buy a mount for it that takes anything up to a 50-inch TV as well as throwing in a shelf for a set-top box. The unit costs £299 but you’ll have to spend around £2300 on the R7 first.

Find out more at the John Lewis website

5. Carnany retro TV unit at Wayfair

Something more affordable? Have a look at this one at Wayfair.

Of course you make compromises. It takes a TV up to 39-inch rather than the huge TVs and it doesn’t have as much storage as some of the others out there. But if space and budget are tight this one should do the job and still has drawer and shelf storage below.

That price? Just £159.99.

Find out more at the Wayfair website

6. Portobello retro solid oak vintage TV unit at Maisons Du Monde



You don’t have to have a vintage TV for this one. But there’d no denying it looks great with one.

But it takes much bigger TVs if you want to go modern. Love the shape the golden oak finish the tapered legs and the storage options below. Ideal for a compact space. If you want something bigger read on down this rundown.

But if you want this the TV unit here is available for £497.

Find out more at the Maisons Du Monde website

7. Handmade midcentury modern TV stand by Moutinho Store

Plenty of options from small makers on Etsy but I am drawn to this one. Purely because of the versatility.

Yes it’s a TV stand but it could also be a coffee table or side table. But it will take a TV and that simple/stylish design also leaves room for your media accessories below too. Less is more with this one.

For a handmade item well priced at £242.72 as well. Note that you can choose your wood finish as well. Also do check out the company’s other designs too.

Find out more at the Moutinho Store Etsy website

8. Fjord retro two-door TV unit at Maisons Du Monde

There are a couple of finishes available for this one which should take a bigger TV than the one shown in the pictures.

Part of a larger Scandi-inspired Fjord range this is a modest-sized retro unit that does its job whilst looking good. The latter thanks mainly to the splashes of colour on the doors.

Space for your TV added space for accessories and cupboard space too. It offers a lot within its most footprint. £270 for this.

Find out more at the Maisons Du Monde website

9. Quilda retro TV storage unit with sliding doors

Another that’s part of a larger range. But it works as a standalone unit too – and it’s in the sale right now.

The Quilda range is one of my favourites and you can find out about it here. Basically great for kitting a house out in a mid-20th century style.

Or just have a look at this which has tapered legs storage for a TV storage behind those sliding doors and holes for your cables. As I said in the sale and now just £262.50.

10. Midcentury modern teak TV unit at Tikamoon

Frustratingly this isn’t pictured with a TV on top. But that is its purpose.

Of course it could double up as a sideboard and if you are in the market for one with a 1950s Scandinavian vibe this is the sideboard for you.

But it is a TV unit with a strong look thanks to the clean lines and skinny legs. Also present are three drawers for magazines remote controllers and other small objects plus a large cupboard space enclosed by two sliding doors to accommodate routers consoles and DVD players for example. TV on top of course.

£899 is the price of this one.

Find out more at the Tikamoon website

11. Barcelona media cabinet at Olivia’s

A premium piece with a midcentury modern vibe. Very appealing.

The unit is all about the wood finish and the matching wood legs. If you love wood you’ll love this.

As for functionality there are two doors for storage and the centre section for media appliances. Oh lets not forget the marble top which makes the unit look like a pricey piece. Not that it’s a cheap one. You can get this for £648.

Find out more at the Olivia’s website

12. Portobello solid oak midcentury modern TV unit at Maisons Du Monde



This is a thing of beauty and something with a big presence too. Yes a bigger version of the unit a few places above.

As well as offering a designated area for your screen the Portobello has so many other options for storage too. Darers for your media (or anything in fact) as well as plenty of shelves for display. All with a strong midcentury modern vibe. Like all of the Portobello range.

£973 seems reasonable considering the size of this thing.

13. Atlas TV stand by Corrigan Studio

This one looks rather like the West Elm unit at the top of the listing. Except it happens to be a little smaller and a lot cheaper.

Different colours for this one but all are capable of holding a Tv up to 55 inches in size. Of course it also works as a standalone piece of midcentury modern furniture either as a cabinet or compact sideboard complete with three drawers a side cabinet and adjustable shelving along with cable management slots.

£355.99 for this.

14. Topim vintage TV unit at La Redoute

All for £440.

Find out more at the La Redoute website

15. Jenson TV stand at Made

Available in light or dark wood and also as part of a larger midcentury modern furniture range. But I’m looking right now at the design here.

I prefer the dark finish but have a look at the light wood if that’s more your thing. Oh yes there’s also a corner unit too if you need that. But this one has the look the space for a TV storage underneath and cable management space.

£399 is the price.

Find out more at the Made website

16. Twist vintage TV stand at Maisons Du Monde

I know a lot of you love a hairpin leg. so this design might well appeal.

£183 looks good value.

19. Nordmood 1960s-style TV stand

The maker does so many variations on this theme in terms of dimensions and colours. So do have a browse if the idea of one of these grabs you.

I can see why it would. Understated and stylish it has a modest footprint a black and copper colour scheme and legs that match up perfectly with the upper shades. A storage area both on top and inside.

£369.05 for the one pictured here.

£249 for this.

Find out more at the Made website

28. Auden Apartment Media Console at Joybird

There is a bigger version of this but the compact Auden appeals to me personally.

I think it’s because I’m conscious of space. I don’t have a lot and I guess many of you don’t either. So this is a better unit than the long one. But have a look at that if you have a wider area to fill.

Love the angled legs on this one the 1960s look the cupboard space and the open area for storing things as well. A good surface area as well despite the size. As I write this is also discounted. Currently it is $1595.

Find out more at the Joybird website

29. Jimi Vintage corner TV unit at La Redoute

Something small in size and small in price too.

That’s a good thing on both counts. First off the corner unit makes life a lot easier if you have modest space and a corner for your TV to sit in. The Jimi based on the popular coffee table has a white surface a shelf and some long wooden legs for support. it does the job without dominating the space in your home.

And at £152 it’s a reasonable price too.

Government’s plan for local content legislation has been seen as one way of rebalancing the scales.

In a statement ExxonMobil disclosed that at the end of 2020 the total Guyanese workforce supporting ExxonMobil Guyana’s overall activities was more than 2300. Since 2015 more than GY$77.6 billion has been spent with more than 800 Guyanese companies for goods and services ranging from food to engineering.

Critics of the PSA say that Exxon and its tier one contractors have to urgently train more Guyanese to take up specialised positions within the oil and gas industry.

In its statement on Thursday ExxonMobil Guyana said it has made its submission to the government on the draft local content policy restating its commitment to effective initiatives to help build a globally competitive workforce and supply base.

A written submission was made after engagement with officials from the Ministry of Natural Resources recently.

“We are committed to growing local content that will generate broad and sustainable economic development while supporting safe development of the nation’s oil and gas resources” said ExxonMobil Guyana President Alistair Routledge in the release.

“We are pleased that the government continues to seek broad input and collaboration to develop an approach suited to Guyana’s unique situation and national development objectives.

“Local content policy or legislation should be informed and supported by appropriate economic labour and industrial baseline studies…It is essential that when driving local content in one sector actual and projected national capacity is taken into consideration to avoid negatively impacting other sectors of the economy” Routledge said.

“Prior experience around the globe demonstrates that overly aggressive local content regulations and mandates can have unintended negative consequences on the development of projects industry and the broader economy” he warned.

ExxonMobil Guyana Local Content Advisor Devon Seeram said that the company works closely with its prime contractors to ensure that they are equally committed to developing local content and that their local content plans are effectively implemented.

“Since our first discovery in 2015 we have made significant progress creating jobs growing the number of local suppliers we work with and increasing our local spending” Seeram said. Guyanese businesses and ExxonMobil have built local content together and we believe that additional progress is both possible and necessary as the oil and gas sector continues to grow.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlbnRyYWxmaWZldGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvMTkyMDg1OTAuZmxhcmluZy1tb3NzbW9ycmFuLWV4eG9ubW9iaWwtMTQwbS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LXByZXNlbnRzLWNsZWFyLXBhdGh3YXktY29tcGxpYW5jZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flaring at Mossmorran: ExxonMobil £140m investment presents 'clear pathway for compliance',"The multi-million investment into the ExxonMobil Fife Ethylene Plant will begin next month in a move designed to reduce the impact of flaring and improve site reliability.

Environmental watchdog SEPA (Scottish Environmental Protection Agency) says the complex now has a ""clear pathway to compliance"" as 1000 workers deliver more than 300000 hours to improve the facility.

Installation of a noise reducing flare tip and ExxonMobil's commitment to installing a fully enclosed ground flare in 2022 will reduce the use of the elevated flare by 98 per cent the company says.

The move follows Final Warning Letters the submission of a report to the Crown Office for consideration of prosecution in July 2020 in relation to the flaring at the Mossmorran complex during April 2019 and a series of stringent regulatory requirements and permit variations on both operators requiring defined actions.

The announcement comes as SEPA publishes Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) best practice review which will lead to community participation in the design of a site monitoring network enhanced visibility of compliance and monitoring reports and a new online regulatory hub.

The best practice review was commissioned by SEPA in May last year to share good practice and advise on any further actions that may be taken to drive compliance at the Mossmorran site.

The review was part of a package of measures announced by SEPA including an independent technical assessment of the ground flare installation timeline from ExxonMobil Chemical Limited the publication of ambient air quality monitoring reports and support for Fife Council’s review of community liaison structures.

From the recommendations of the Irish Environmental Protection Agency best practice review some nine actions are already underway by SEPA a further eight will be taken forward one will be considered and two are rejected.

Key recommendations will see SEPA’s programme of environmental monitoring extended with community participation in its design enhanced visibility of regulatory monitoring results and investment in a refreshed online community information hub.

""At SEPA we’ve been clear that compliance with Scotland’s environmental laws is non-negotiable that flaring at the Mossmorran complex was unacceptable and must become the exception rather than routine"" said Terry A’Hearn chief executive of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency said.

“We’ve also been clear that our actions present a clear pathway to compliance for the industrial complex and that what mattered to communities was actions rather than words.

Mr A'Hearn added: ""Communities across Fife have the right to a future where flaring is the exception rather than routine. Robust regulation takes time but through our work and the significant investment by site operators hope and a clear pathway to compliance is now in sight for local communities who can be assured of our enhanced vigilance over this important period and beyond.""

Laura Burke director general of the EPA also stated: “Following our review we have considerable confidence in SEPA’s approach to ensuring compliance at the Mossmorran complex.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc21vZy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8wNC9mb3NzaWwtZnVlbC10YXgtcHJvZ3JhbXMtZW1pc3Npb25zLWNsaW1hdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fossil Fuel Tax Programs to Cut Emissions Lead to Lots of Industry Profit Little Climate Action,"The fossil fuel industry and its investors have financially benefited from tax policies and subsidies designed to reduce the emissions from oil gas and coal — sometimes without taking the action required to tackle climate change.

Recently claims have been surfacing of companies taking the taxpayer money offered to incentivize these actions but not following through on reducing their emissions. In March for example Reuters reported that Congress has opened an investigation into problems with the government’s “clean coal” tax credit. This is after Reuters revealed that financial institutions including Goldman Sachs were making huge profits off the program despite it not effectively reducing emissions.

Now companies such as ExxonMobil are lobbying against transparency efforts when it comes to reporting their emissions for an existing carbon capture tax credit.

And the industry is also increasingly calling for a national carbon tax to be introduced. In March the American Petroleum Institute (API) said it supports efforts to put a price on carbon — this is a reversal from its position a decade ago when it was opposed to a bill that would have introduced a cap and trade program to limit carbon emissions.

Introducing a carbon tax would allow polluters to continue to produce carbon they would just have to pay a price to do so.

These market-based approaches to limiting climate emissions however raise concerns about their overall effectiveness. They provide an opportunity for companies to reap the financial benefits of climate action without actually delivering the emission reductions. This makes them incredibly popular with the fossil fuel industry.

“It’s naive of us to think that all of a sudden the oil and gas industry is going to put forward policies that are going to keep fossil fuels in the ground” Jim Walsh senior energy policy analyst for environmental NGO Food and Water Watch told DeSmog.

Politicians meanwhile are pushing to further expand the carbon capture tax credit program (known as 45Q). And the clean coal tax credit is up for renewal at the end of 2021. This is despite both programs having failed to achieve their climate goals while delivering large financial returns to large banks and insurance firms and fossil fuel companies.

NEW: @MittRomney leans in on carbon tax to spur clean energy technology breakthroughs. I interviewed Romney about his interest in a carbon tax which is very real and why he thinks it can be a second ""pillar"" of the Republican innovation agenda https://t.co/44sdn55LOA — Joshua Siegel (@SiegelScribe) March 19 2021

For these tax credit initiatives to be successful there needs to be better government oversight and the industry needs to take more serious action to tackle its emissions.

At the moment in order to obtain these tax credits companies rely on the use of carbon capture and storage technology as a way of reducing emissions. But for these types of solutions to be truly successful the right technology needs to exist on a scale large enough to be widely used.

Currently carbon capture and storage which aims to scrub carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and permanently lock it underground is not commercially viable. In September 2020 energy consulting group Rystad predicted that the 10 commercial scale carbon capture projects planned for Europe have good odds of being operational by 2035.

At the same time Rystad noted that carbon capture technology is facing economic competition from an existing proven method to eliminate carbon emissions from power production: renewable energy.

In December Bloomberg reported that ExxonMobil had halted plans for its carbon capture project in Wyoming due to the financial “fallout from Covid-19.” This is despite the company noting that “a recent change to the U.S. tax code would help overcome that hurdle [how to make money on carbon capture] with lucrative credits for safe storage” Bloomberg wrote.

Even despite carbon capture being unproven and Exxon abandoning its project in Wyoming North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer (R) expressed his strong support of the expanded carbon capture tax credit program in a January press release: “Carbon capture is the future of reliable low emissions energy and North Dakota is a national leader in the development and use of this technology. With the administration’s long-awaited guidance finalized investors can now take advantage of the carbon capture tax credit with confidence and clarity.”

Past Failures

Market-based solutions to reduce emissions are not new. California has a carbon cap and trade program that began in 2013. And in 2009 a coalition of Eastern states created the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) to cap carbon emissions with companies being able to purchase emissions allowances.

The results of these market-based approaches however are not encouraging and indicate a willingness of the industry to take the tax credits but not bother with reducing emissions. A 2019 ProPublica investigation of California’s cap and trade program found that the biggest oil and gas companies in the state were actually polluting more under the cap and trade program than they were before they joined the program. This result makes it clear why the oil industry is so supportive of a national market-based approaches like a cap and trade program.

API Pres. & CEO @mj_sommers: ""As our industry accelerates efforts to advance groundbreaking technologies reduce emissions and drive transparent and consistent climate reporting we urge lawmakers to support market-based policies that foster innovation.” https://t.co/HrKwsHK0Bm — American Petroleum Institute (@APIenergy) March 30 2021

And while the RGGI program has coincided with a reduction of emissions for the states involved the New York Times reported in April 2019 that it was “unclear” if this was due to the program or to other factors such as the lower cost of renewable energy new technologies and natural gas replacing coal power.

Given the oil and gas industry’s history of weak financial oversight past challenges with tax incentives and the industry’s efforts to mislead the public on the existence and importance of tackling climate change moving to a new system of carbon taxes or cap and trade to limit carbon emissions — which in a 180-change the industry now strongly supports — appears to be poised for failure.

The American Petroleum Institute is considering backing a carbon tax — but only to prevent ambitious regulation of greenhouse emissions. We need to keep fossils fuels in the ground. https://t.co/KvrL2ssqJq — Center for Bio Div (@CenterForBioDiv) March 4 2021

The Questionable Benefits of 45Q

In 2008 a new program known as the 45Q tax credit started providing financial incentives for carbon capture and sequestration. The program gave companies $20 a metric ton for capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) and injecting it into underground rock formations that would theoretically store the CO2 forever.

In 2018 the program was renewed and companies now get more money per ton of CO2 stored; this will increase to $50 a metric ton by 2026. The program also offers tax credits for companies that inject CO2 into oil reservoirs in a process called enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

In April 2020 however Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) expressed his concern about the failure of the program offering tax credits for carbon capture in a letter to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) urging the agency to take action against companies gaming the system with respect to the 45Q tax credit.

In a press release Sen. Menendez said that the industry was taking over $1 billion in tax credits without providing evidence of actually complying with the program in an “apparent failure of the fossil fuel industry to act in good faith.”

Menendez’s assertions are based on evidence provided in an April 2020 memo by the Inspector General for the Tax Administration about the 45Q program.

According to that memo ten companies accounted for 99.9 percent of the just over $1 billion total handed out in tax credits with the remainder claimed by 662 other companies.

@SenJohnBarrasso offered no comment last month after a IRS Inspector General investigation revealed a massive $900M tax scam at the heart of #45Q. Put that in that in your articles. https://t.co/rACMywT9mZ — John Noël (@noel_johnny) May 29 2020

The review found that of these ten companies 87 percent of the claims occurred when the companies “were not in compliance with the EPA.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires companies claiming the 45Q tax credit to quantify the amount of carbon their projects have captured and stored. While small errors are expected in tax filings having the majority of the credits given to out-of-compliance companies signifies an almost complete failure for the program.

Seven of the top ten program participants did not even “submit a monitoring reporting and verification (MRV) plan.” This part of the 45Q program is intended to verify whether carbon dioxide is actually captured and stored delivering the promised climate benefit.

The names of the companies are not listed in the memo; regulations specify that this information is not available to the public.

DeSmog reached out to Sen. Menendez’s office the IRS inspector general’s office and the Department of Energy for information about the identity of the ten companies highlighted in the report. The DOE directed DeSmog to the IRS. DeSmog spoke with IRS counsel Maggie Stehn who could not comment but said the IRS communications department had been notified about the request. The IRS inspector general’s office and Sen. Menendez’s office did not reply by time of publication.

The new 45Q regulations were finalized in January and state that while commenters requested the documents detailing a company’s compliance — known as lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (LCA) reports — be made public to increase transparency the IRS chose to allow companies to keep the reports secret.

Proper oversight and enforcement is key to the success of these solutions. But so far oil gas and coal companies have taken taxpayer money without documenting that they have effectively captured and stored carbon and continue to work to stop efforts at transparency in reporting.

Clean Coal Tax Program Problems

The coal industry also has enjoyed tax incentives to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) which are produced when burning fossil fuels and are harmful to human health. If companies burn a specific type of low-emission coal and reduce their NOx emissions they receive a tax benefit: $7.30 for each ton of coal burned.

As Sen. Cramer told Reuters in 2018: “The tax credit program is bridging the divide to make coal clean and beautiful.”

While this program is designed to decrease harmful emissions it still results in coal being burned which increases carbon dioxide emissions. A study by the group Resources for the Future estimated that carbon emissions increased as a result of this program.

And a 2018 Reuters investigation found that while the refined coal production tax credit program was used by companies to claim tax credits the program failed to reduce emissions. According to Reuters this was due to two main failures: relying on the industry to fulfill the requirement to reduce emissions and lack of enforcement.

Coal producers sprayed a bunch of chemicals on their coal to make it “cleaner.” It didn’t reduce pollution but it did allow coal companies to write off billions on their taxes. @Reuters https://t.co/8BwLPzEZxi — Caleb Heeringa (@CalebHeeringa) March 16 2021

One huge flaw in the refined coal production tax credit according to Reuters was that instead of tracking actual emissions produced by burning the specially designated coal the companies were allowed to show in laboratory settings that burning the coal reduced NOx emissions in the lab.

Unfortunately in the real world the investigation found that in many cases burning that same “clean” coal did not reduce NOx; instead the companies burning the coal often increased these emissions. Still the companies treating the coal — often backed by large financial institutions — got “a tax credit of $7.30 for each ton burned.” According to Reuters the tax benefits were claimed by major financial institutions including Fidelity Investments Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.

A.J. Gallagher for instance touted the huge profits it was making on clean coal tax credits on a March 2018 investor relations call. “Our return on investment is staggering” the company’s CFO Douglas Howell told analysts in the March 14 call. “Oh 200 percent 300 percent 400 percent 500 percent.”

Financial institutions are able to claim these credits in addition to coal companies a January 2021 article by S&P Global explains because these companies invest in the infrastructure to chemically treat the coal to make it qualify for the tax credit. They then buy coal from coal producers treat it and often sell it to coal power producers for less than they paid for it because the profit is made in the tax credit.

This refined coal tax credit program expires at the end of 2021 but its beneficiaries are lobbying for it to be continued. Lobbyists for Gallagher are working to get the tax credit extension as S&P reported.

As Reuters reported in March Congress has now begun an investigation into the refined coal tax credit program.

The Risk of Market-Based Solutions

Oil and coal companies along with major financial institutions strongly support the continuation of the 45Q and refined coal tax credit programs. Lobbying has continued with efforts to expand the 45Q program and to renew the refined coal tax credit — and to weaken oversight.

In September 2020 InsideClimate News reported on ExxonMobil’s efforts to limit oversight of the 45Q program noting that Exxon’s team of lobbyists “has fought relentlessly to do away with a requirement that companies claiming the credit submit monitoring plans to the Environmental Protection Agency.”

With the poor track record of market-based programs to reduce emissions while enriching program participants it is understandable that the fossil fuel industry is now supporting national market-based policies to address carbon emissions. But not everyone agrees that market-based solutions are the way to reduce emissions.

Mark Jacobson professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University told DeSmog that eliminating the use of fossil fuels is a more effective way to reduce carbon emissions than using market-based solutions.

“Carbon taxes being pushed by the oil and gas industry just like their push for carbon capture — it’s just useless scams” Jacobson told DeSmog. “They are just not anything that will actually help solve the problems.”

Jacobson pointed to renewable portfolio standards as a more effective program; these incentivize increased renewable energy production — thus replacing carbon intensive power production with renewable — resulting in large emissions reductions.

Another advantage of renewable portfolio standards is it helps eliminate the chance for companies to manipulate the systems because that instead of offering financial incentives to fossil fuel consumers to reduce emissions it drives investing in clean renewable energy projects that do not produce carbon emissions.

The past failures of market-based climate approaches in the U.S. serve as a stark warning of what to expect if fossil fuel industry lobbyists get their latest wish and convince politicians to allow them to keep doing business as usual — while working to move to a national carbon pricing system.

As Jacobson noted policies like this including putting a price on carbon “allow polluters to keep polluting and pay the tax.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vbndvdmVucy1pbmR1c3RyeS5jb20vaXNzdWVzLzIwMjEtMDMtMDEvdmlld19mZWF0dXJlcy9ub253b3ZlbnMtc3RlcC11cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nonwovens Step Up,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nonwovens-industry.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /issues/2021-03-01/view_features/nonwovens-step-up/ (Caused by SSLError(SSLError(1, '[SSL: UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION_DISABLED] unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled (_ssl.c:1006)'))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vbndvdmVucy1pbmR1c3RyeS5jb20vaXNzdWVzLzIwMjEtMDMtMDEvdmlld19mZWF0dXJlcy9ub253b3ZlbnMtc3RlcC11cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9tYXJrZXRzL3FhdGFyLXBldHJvbGV1bS10by1mdWxseS1vd24tcWF0YXJnYXMtZnJvbS1qYW4tMjAyMi1hcTI1ZmlmbNIBY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9tYXJrZXRzL3FhdGFyLXBldHJvbGV1bS10by1mdWxseS1vd24tcWF0YXJnYXMtZnJvbS1qYW4tMjAyMi1hcTI1ZmlmbD9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qatar Petroleum to fully own Qatargas from Jan 2022,"Qatar Petroleum (QP) said it will become the sole owner of 100% of the Qatargas Liquefied Natural Gas Company Limited (QG1) assets and facilities on January 1 2022.

QP added the move comes as a result of its decision not to renew the TG1 joint venture upon the expiry of the relevant agreements on December 31 2021.

Established in 1984 QG1 is a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and affiliates of Total ExxonMobil Marubeni and Mitsui. QG1 was the pioneering LNG project to be developed in Qatar whose success has paved the way for the development of Qatar’s LNG industry leading to where it stands today.

Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi the Minister of State for Energy Affairs the President and CEO of Qatar Petroleum said: “The takeover by Qatar Petroleum will conclude more than 25 years of successful operations of QG1 from which the first ever Qatari LNG cargo was exported. This is a momentous event that highlights Qatar Petroleum’s efforts to further enhance the utilization of our natural resources for the benefit of our country and its current and future generations as well as to continue serving the world’s need for cleaner energy.”

“I would like to thank our valued partners Total ExxonMobil Marubeni and Mitsui for their efforts in the development and operation of QG1 over the past three decades. Each one of them has played an instrumental role in the success of QG1. In particular I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Total for being a foundation shareholder from inception and for their valuable contributions throughout this journey; to ExxonMobil for stepping in at a critical juncture of the project and leveraging their experience to help making the project a reality; and to Mitsui and Marubeni for their valuable contributions in securing anchor offtakes for the project and for their great support during the early phases.

“Thanks and appreciation are also due to Chubu Electric QG1’s foundation customer for their key role in anchoring this project as the primary LNG buyer as well as to the other Japanese buyers and of course the country of Japan as a whole. Furthermore I would also like to sincerely thank QatarGas operating company leadership and employees for their excellent work and dedication that made this company a success over the last 25 years.

“This event marks the start of the next chapter in QG1’s history which we hope and believe will be even more successful than the last chapter and we look forward to serving our customers for the next three decades from this world-class asset” Al-Kaabi added.

With a production capacity of approximately 10 million tons per annum of LNG QG1 facilities will continue to be operated by Qatargas on behalf of Qatar Petroleum and will play an important role in supplying LNG to the world’s markets in a safe and reliable manner. – TradeArabia News Service"

That man is Frederick Wallace Smith – Founder CEO President of FedEx – and the story can only be described as extraordinary.

It was the mid-70s. The only time when what you’re about to hear was deemed even remotely acceptable. During the third year of FedEx operating as a business the company found itself in a dire financial situation.

After a make-or-break business loan fell through it seemed as though the future of FedEx was written in stone. The kind of stone they place above a grave. But Frederick Smith refused to go down without a red-hot fight. The man had served as a Captain in the US Marine Corps after all – and during the Vietnam War no less. Surrender clearly wasn’t in his vocabulary.



At this point in time our hero reached his crossroads moment. Smith took FedEx’s last US$5000 to Las Vegas – where dreams are born and slaughtered every five minutes – to put it all on the line. At the blackjack table there was a turn of good fortune… US$5000 became US$27000.

Enough to cover the company’s $24000 aviation fuel bill with change to spare. In fact this very punt managed to keep FedEx alive for another week. Needless to say it paid off. One week stretched to two two became four and soon after Smith successfully raised US$11 million for the company.

In 1976 FedEx reported its first profits amounting to US$3.6 million. Four years after profits almost exceeded US$40 million with gross revenue at close to half a billion. Fast forward to the present day FedEx has an international presence with a market cap of over US$63 billion and revenue just shy of US$70 billion (as of: Q4 2019). Definitely not too shabby for a risky arvo in Vegas.

Believe it or not this is just one of many fascinating details surrounding the formation of FedEx. The initial inception of FedEx’s concept occurred to Frederick Smith while he was attending Yale. There he submitted a paper on overnight delivery service in the information era for his economic class (for which he received a C grade). And while this doesn’t sound like that groundbreaking of an idea keep in mind this was in 1962 back when doctors were telling pregnant women to smoke and questioning whether people of colour deserved human rights.

In 2014 Frederick Smith was named the 26th Greatest Leader in the World by Fortune Magazine. As of 2017 he holds a net worth of US$5.4 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3ZWVrLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDQvMDMvbmlrZS1oYXMtcGFpZC1uby1mZWRlcmFsLWluY29tZS10YXhlcy1mb3ItdGhlLXBhc3QtdGhyZWUteWVhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Has Paid No Federal Income Taxes for the Past Three Years,"The Seb Coe building contains a Stumptown Coffee Roasters location just for Nike employees and visitors. (Sam Gehrke)

Nike hasn't paid a cent in federal income taxes for three years.

And the Beaverton sportswear giant—which regularly spars with cultural conservatives—can largely thank former President Donald Trump for its good fortune.

That’s the finding of a new study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy which reports that Nike—a company that generated $4.1 billion of taxable revenue in the past three years—hugely benefited from a tax bill championed by President Trump.

The study named 55 major corporations that didn't pay taxes last year including gas and oil companies software companies and food companies. Nike and the shipping company FedEx are the two biggest names on the list as The New York Times reported Friday morning.

The report was released as President Joe Biden discusses a corporate tax overhaul that would fund his infrastructure and green energy plan. Biden's plan would eliminate tax breaks that result in some companies paying an effective tax rate of zero.

Nike used several major deductions and write-offs that the 2017 tax bill allowed in its corporate framework resulting in a tax rebate for the company of $109 million on pretax income of $2.8 billion.

One of those write-offs was a federal research and experimentation credit that allows companies to write off money funneled toward research initiatives and projects.

In November the company notified state officials it was laying off 700 employees at its world headquarters in Beaverton.

Nike representatives did not respond to a request for comment from WW on the report.

Along with opening Nike's books the report highlights a paradox: Oregon's flagship company gains social capital from championing progressive values and equity (and outraging the right wing) but it quietly benefits from the economic policies of Republicans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzQvMy8yMjM2NTMzMC9hbWF6b24tYXBvbG9neS1wZWUtYm90dGxlcy13b3JrZXItd2FyZWhvdXNlLXVuaW9uLXBvY2Fu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon apologizes for lying about pee — and attempts to shift the blame,"On Wednesday last week the @amazonnews Twitter account tweeted the following back to Representative Mark Pocan:

This was an own-goal we’re unhappy about it and we owe an apology to Representative Pocan.

First the tweet was incorrect. It did not contemplate our large driver population and instead wrongly focused only on our fulfillment centers.

If any employee in a fulfillment center has a different experience we encourage them to speak to their manager and we’ll work to fix it.

Second our process was flawed. The tweet did not receive proper scrutiny. We need to hold ourselves to an extremely high accuracy bar at all times and that is especially so when we are criticizing the comments of others.

Third we know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed.

This is a long-standing industry-wide issue and is not specific to Amazon. We’ve included just a few links below that discuss the issue.

Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide we would like to solve it. We don’t yet know how but will look for solutions.

But the project’s proximity to a cultural site that is sacred to many Native Americans has historic preservation officials and tribal leaders anxious about its impacts.

The Apex Clean Energy company’s proposal would install about 55 turbines for the Big Bend wind project and solar panels on more than 480 acres of nearby land for the Red Rock solar project. Together it would be the first wind-solar hybrid farm in Minnesota a state that has committed to moving its energy resources away from fossil fuels as a way to mitigate the state’s contributions to climate change.

The project proposed in 2017 is working its way through the regulatory process. On Thursday evening the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission hosted a virtual meeting to gather public input around the scope of the project’s environmental review. Comment touched on a range of concerns from the height of the turbines to potential impacts on the environment and on property values for residents nearby.

A possible major hurdle is the project’s proximity to the Jeffers Petroglyphs historical and cultural site near Comfrey — home to an estimated 5000 sacred rock carvings made over the span of 7000 years on an outcropping of Sioux quartzite. Today it remains an active site of prayer and ceremony for many Native American people.

Several tribal nations the Minnesota Historical Society and Apex have been discussing the concerns over the project for more than a year. Cheyanne St. John historic preservation officer for the Lower Sioux Indian Community said she hopes that state regulators will recognize the importance of the site to Native people — and the potential implications if the project is greenlit for its proposed location.

At issue is the Big Bend wind turbines not far from the petroglyph site. While tribal leaders and community members say they aren’t opposed to renewable energy St. John and others are concerned that the project would disrupt the landscape of the area — and how some people use the site for spiritual practices.

“This is nothing new for tribes to try to convince people that our landscapes are significant important to us” St. John said. “This is a battle that we have been fighting for generations.”

The Jeffers Petroglyphs site is managed by the Minnesota Historical Society. Site manager David Briese said many people visit the site to pray and place offerings on the petroglyphs. He’s concerned that the project might interfere with how visitors experience the site.

“Wind energy is good but it also impacts the way people perceive this space and how this space is used” Briese said.

“Some people are going to see the wind turbines and think it’s great and it’s progress towards a cleaner energy which it is. But the people that pray here it impedes how they practice their religion or their spirituality.”

Apex Energy’s initial plans called for the nearest turbines to be built about 2 miles from the Jeffers Petroglyphs site but the company adjusted its plans in response to some of the complaints.

As the proposal stands now the turbines would now be as close as 5.2 miles from the petroglyph site. In order to compensate for the energy generation capacity lost by moving those turbines the company said it would need to increase the amount of energy produced in the wind farm — and that would mean installing taller towers with larger blades.

Leaders at the Minnesota Historical Society think 5 miles is still too close — and are now concerned about the height of the turbines. The Historical Society the Upper Sioux Community and the Lower Sioux Indian Community are asking state regulators to establish an 8-mile buffer around the petroglyphs. And they’re asking Apex to reconsider raising the height of the turbines.

In a statement the company said it has worked with local and tribal leaders to assess the area for cultural impact.

“This active participation of tribal representatives has been crucial in the design of a project that minimizes impacts to this important cultural site and Apex will continue to work with tribes and other stakeholders as the permitting process moves forward” the statement said.

Historical Society community and outreach director Ben Leonard said that while he understands the need for renewable energy development in Minnesota that development also needs to maintain the integrity of historical sites like the petroglyphs.

“You can’t really tell the history of Minnesota — especially the history thousands of years ago — without talking about Jeffers and experiencing Jeffers” Leonard said. “It’s that important.”

In a statement an Apex spokesperson said the company chose the area near the Jeffers Petroglyphs site because of “verified wind and solar resources the strong support of local landowners and residents minimal environmental impacts and access to transmission lines.”

The reception to the project at Thursday’s public meeting was mixed. Some logged on to the video chat specifically to vocalize their support. Among them was Cottonwood County Commissioner Norman Holmen.

“We have had the unanimous votes on these on this project and the solar project and just want to go online publicly to acknowledge that we do support the project” Holmen said. “They have been received positively and we have not heard basically any negative feedback on them at our meetings.”

Ann Peschges one of the commenters at Thursday’s public meeting disagreed. She said she lives within a mile of the proposed wind farm.

“This is not just a project to us. This is where we’ve lived for decades” Peschges said. “I mean some [families] have been here for ... 150 years and they feel like they’re going to be shoved out.”

Another attendee Davis Harder who said he lives in the middle of the proposed project site is concerned about the potential environmental impacts the turbines might have on local wildlife particularly eagles — and he was concerned about conserving prairie land.

“[It’s] the last remaining fragments of prairie in this part of the state” Harder said. “It’s an important feature to kind of preserve. It’s one of those few areas where you can kind of feel like you’re in a prairie still whereas most of it’s ag land now.”

Kevin Pranis of Laborers International Union North America joined the meeting in support of the project saying the combined wind and solar farms would afford opportunities to the trades industry and offer jobs and apprenticeships. But he also acknowledged an importance to striking a balance.

“In order to head where we’re heading on energy and have reliable energy we’re going to need to figure how to both accept those impacts and also address local concerns and try to maximize the benefits of these projects as much as possible” he said.

The public comment period for the PUC’s environmental scoping closes on April 30. The PUC is expected to make its final regulatory decisions on the project sometime in early 2022. Apex Energy hopes to have the hybrid project online sometime in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9mbGludC8yMDIxLzA0L21hbi1sYXVuY2hlcy1jYW1wYWlnbi10by1wcmV2ZW50LXBvc3NpYmxlLW5ldy1taWQtbWljaGlnYW4tc29sYXItZmFybS1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24uaHRtbNIBjwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9mbGludC8yMDIxLzA0L21hbi1sYXVuY2hlcy1jYW1wYWlnbi10by1wcmV2ZW50LXBvc3NpYmxlLW5ldy1taWQtbWljaGlnYW4tc29sYXItZmFybS1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24uaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man launches campaign to prevent possible new mid-Michigan solar farm construction,"SHIAWASSEE COUNTY - A man has launched a campaign to raise awareness defend his neighbor’s property rights and prevent the construction of a possible new solar farm situated between Lennon and New Lothrop.

With work underway on one project Ranger Power has taken interest in expanding its solar farms exploring new areas north of the current construction site in Shiawassee County and toward the more populous area of New Lothrop.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xhc3N0aXJlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzAzL2F1c3RpbnMtaG9wZS1vdXRkb29yLWdhbGxlcnktc2NoZWR1bGVkLWZvci1zdW1tZXItMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Austin's 'HOPE' Outdoor Gallery Scheduled For Summer 2021,"There’s a new a 17-plus acre outdoor gallery coming to Austin this summer. Described by its organizers as the largest earthen-built structure in the history of Texas the open-air cultural events center art park and technology gallery called HOPE is located off Dalton Lane near the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (ABIA). It was designed by Chioco design LLC.

Its name is based on the original HOPE Outdoor Gallery on Baylor Street a few miles Southeast of the ABIA which was built on the foundation of a failed development project from the 1980s. Then HOPE Campaign Executive Producer Andi Scull created a temporary art installation where muralists and community groups interacted and created the first being a mural by Shepard Fairey. A wall from the original Baylor Street location will become a part of the new park as well asa concrete walkway bearing the names of local Austin residents and art supporters of the project.

The project began in June of 2019 and was paused in part due to the Coronavirus pandemic but also to consider the economic impact and opportunities it could have on the Austin creative community.

“When SXSW 2020 was canceled the future for the events and production industry in Austin was uncertain” states Andi Scull HOPE Outdoor Gallery founder and creative director. “Our team saw the importance of taking the time to listen and see that we could be more supportive of the creative class in our city by including more economic and educational aspects to our outdoor art park and tech gallery. We agreed that waiting to see the impact this would have on all the cultural arts groups would be critical too. We’re so grateful to be able to open our art park for Austin and the creative community.”

After studying the site which contained dirt and debris from Austin’s robust construction economy Antonio Madrid one of HOPE’s Austin partners along with the design team decided to use the dirt that was “rich with Austin history” to build the park’s walls as part of their sustainability approach. The new park’s walls made with 40000 earth blocks each weighing 38.5 pounds relate to the HOPE team’s project theme“THESE WALLS BRING US TOGETHER.”

According to organizers some highlights of the project will include the following:

Solar panels from Kinect Solar and First Solar covering the entire “H” of the park

Solar installation with CAM Solar including job training for women and minorities

Rainwater collection stations and rooftop areas

Repurposed walls signage and materials from the original site

Recycled and collected paint with Austin Resource Recovery

Creative gardens and bee apiary development

3D printed fixtures from garbage from re:3D

Retail programming and partnerships for the creative community

Storage space for emergency relief and partner needs

There will also be a dozen repurposed shipping containers at the park that will create opportunities for retail stores gallery spaces nonprofit office spaces storage areas and the new HOPE Market for Sunday programs that is part of the branding of the original HOPE farmers market.

The four letters of HOPE’s layout will be visible from above Austin and will contain multiple visual and gastro options overseen by Austin restauranteur and HOPE partner CK Chin.

“The outdoor gallery concept is utopian not because every artist gets along but because it yields diversity by providing an opportunity for those with creative drive and ingenuity rather than power and resources” says Shepard Fairey acclaimed graphic artist social activist and longtime supporter of HOPE. “Empowerment is infectious and the electricity from a space like the HOPE Outdoor Gallery creates a chain reaction of excitement and participation. Whether one is there to take an art class take part in a charity event party or paint a wall there is no question that the HOPE Outdoor Gallery is a community incubator.”

Importantly scientists believe that it is a comet which has never passed near a star until it came close to our own.

2I/Borisov was first detected in 2019 when it came close to the solar system. Researchers found that 2I/Borisov came from an interstellar space and its behaviour nearly confirms that it is a comet. Prior to this comet another celestial object from interstellar space the Oumuamua – a pancake shaped object – had been detected.

What is Interstellar Space?

“Scientists define the beginning of interstellar space as the place where the sun’s constant flow of material and magnetic field stop affecting its surroundings. This place is called the heliopause. It marks the end of a region created by our sun that is called the heliosphere” NASA wrote defining interstellar space.

The heliosphere is created by a constant flow of particles and a magnetic field created by the sun its speed flow is around 670000 miles per hour. This stream of flow is called the solar wind.

The solar particles inside the heliosphere are hot but they are in lesser concentration. Outside this sphere the particles become colder and more concentrated. This marks the beginning of interstellar space. Here the number of cold particles increases and the magnetic field from the sun no longer exists. However there would be a magnetic field originating from another star in interstellar space.

What is a Comet?

Again according to NASA comets can be defined as “frozen leftovers from the formation of the solar system composed of dust rock and ices. They range from a few miles to tens of miles wide.”

When a comet comes near the sun it gets heated up and can throw gases and dust which appear as a glowing head the size of which can be larger than a planet. This process forms a tail that can stretch for millions of miles.

Scientists have discovered two new ways that 2I/Borisov is different from any other known comets. The findings were published in two papers one in Nature Communication and the other in Nature Astronomy on March 30.

In one of the studies scientists used the European Observatory’s Very Large Telescopes (VTL) located in the Atacama Desert Chile. They analysed the scattering of light from the dust particles in of 2I/Borisov's coma – the enveloping of dust and gas that surrounds the core of the comet. The scientists found that the light from the coma was very polarised. This suggested that the comet could be more pristine than others and that it has not been affected by particles from gas clouds and energy since it has not passed near a star.

Prior to this the only other comet that has polarised light was Hale-Bopp which appeared in 1997. “Hale-Bopp rarely went close to the sun. We think that before its apparition in 1997 it did it only once about 4000 years ago so the material at its surface when we observed it was only slightly processed by the sun”said Stefano Bagnulo an astronomer at Armagh Observatory in Ireland and the lead author of the first study.

Alberto Cellino a researcher from the Astrophysical Observatory of Torino Italy and an author of the first study was quoted saying: “The fact that the two comets are remarkably similar suggests that the environment in which 2I/Borisov originated is not so different in composition from the environment in the early solar system.”

The other paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy basically showed that 2I/Borisov has experienced gravitational stirring. It happens when gravity acts on a passing body and stirs up the material.

The detection of the new comet is important in our understanding of the formation of the solar system. Comets like 2I/Borisov which have not passed close to the sun are of special interest because the material they are made up of is the same as when the solar system had been formed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90ZWNobmV3cy5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIxLzA0LzA0L3N1bmdsaWRlci1idWlsZHMtb24tbGVnYWN5LW9mLXNvbGFyLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sunglider builds on legacy of solar aircraft,"A remotely piloted solar aircraft has demonstrated it can hover in the stratosphere to provide cellular networks in isolated areas. It also demonstrated remote sensing and observation capabilities.

That aircraft is the Sunglider. AeroVironment Inc. of Simi Valley Calif. which has a long history of working with NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards Calif.

The two groups have collaborated in efforts to complete preliminary flight tests to prepare for reaching ever more complex goals with solar powered aircraft. Sunglider is a product of HAPS Mobile Inc. which is a subsidiary of Softbank Corp. and minority-owned by AeroVironment.

AeroVironment has been working on solar aircraft for more than 40 years. The solar powered and human piloted Gossamer Penguin flew on July 25 1980 from Roger’s Dry Lakebed near Armstrong. During the next four decades the company’s remotely piloted family of solar-powered aircraft made ever higher altitude flights and capability demonstrations. The Helios Prototype reached a record altitude for a propeller-driven vehicle of 96863 feet on Aug. 13 2001 beating a previous record set by the company.

Many of AeroVironment’s solar powered aircraft such as the Pathfinder Pathfinder-Plus Centurion and Helios flew as part of NASA’s Environmental Research and Sensor Technology program managed at Armstrong. An initial goal of that program was to develop science instruments for studying the stratosphere. Another focus became development and demonstration of technology for enabling a new class of aircraft capable of flying high altitude long duration Earth science and environmental missions.

Adding to the legacy

The Sunglider follows in the traditions of AeroVironment’s history in solar remotely piloted aircraft but is considered a high-altitude platform system or HAPS vehicle. It is with Sunglider that the company flew to 62500 feet for more than five hours during a 20 hour mission on Sept. 21 2020. Solar batteries power the aircraft during the day and collect and store energy for use at night.

The Sunglider is very long with a wingspan of 262 feet. By comparison a Boeing 747 has a wingspan of about 229 feet. It also has 10 electric motors that propel the aircraft at about 40 mph.

“Sunglider’s motor technology has advanced through multiple generations of improvement since the Pathfinder-Plus and the Helios Prototype” said Peter De Baets AeroVironment senior director. “As a result we have an increase in efficiency and capability. As an example Helios was a much lighter aircraft and needed 14 motors. Sunglider only needs 10. That gives you an idea of how much more capable today’s materials and technologies are.”

The September mission based at Spaceport America in New Mexico had three focus areas. The first was connectivity acting as a central communication point in a network De Baets said. The aircraft’s cellular network payload linked teams in Tokyo New Mexico and Silicon Valley. The two other goals were validating aircraft systems operating in the stratosphere and confirming operations.

Before the flight operations moved to New Mexico the AeroVironment team brought the Sunglider then called Hawk30 for multiple initial low altitude flight tests at Armstrong in 2019.

“Those flights verified the basic performance and handling characteristics that showed us we could operate the aircraft safely and effectively” said Nick Plumb AeroVironment program manager. “We expanded the aircraft’s flight range for verification and validation of our guidance navigation and control systems as well as our aerodynamics and aeroelastic stability. It really gave us confidence that we had an airplane that would get to the stratosphere successfully and safely. We learned a lot during our time at NASA Armstrong and it prepared us well to go to high altitude.”

What’s next

The AeroVironment team continues to expand the duration that Sunglider can fly and fine tune the aircraft to prepare for offering commercial services.

“Technology maturity needs to continue and much of that happens through flight test” Plumb said. “You learn a lot every time you fly.”

Sunglider has benefited from improvements in materials electronics and solar-electric propulsion technologies. However there are still some items that will have to happen before Sunglider will be able to accomplish its intended missions.

For example AeroVironment is working on a major effort with NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley California on regulations and standards development for this class of high flying aircraft.

“A lot of concepts from manned aviation or even typical unmanned aerial vehicles do not carry over to HAPS in a traditional way such as safety risk reliability maintenance checks and pilot in command” De Baets said. “We will have to look at a new way of doing collaborative traffic management and sense-and-avoid specific standards for electric drive train and risk of loss per flight hour.”

Concepts for how to pilot a future group of these vehicles that act like a satellite in providing a telecommunications network in remote places is also ongoing. In that situation a single pilot could fly multiple aircraft together De Baets explained. Those ideas will be advanced with partners such as the Federal Aviation Administration and regulatory agencies worldwide to grow and harmonize operations.

Experience counts

Sunglider takes advantage of all the lessons AeroVironment’s team has learned from its solar powered aircraft.

“We have a core team that designed and flew Pathfinder and Helios” De Baets said. “We continued to work on high altitude long endurance aircraft and we are able to leverage decades of expertise — from recent grads to experienced professionals. It’s something that really sets AeroVironment apart from others: people have really long careers here. It really changes the dynamic for the better.”

Lessons learned from the past design decisions and aircraft operations allow the team to know why decisions were made and fine tune the approach to challenges.

“It’s hard to point to any area of the Sunglider and not see the influence of AeroVironment’s heritage” De Baets said. “Even the telecommunication payload mission for the Sunglider stratospheric flight had origins in a mission we flew with the Helios Prototype.”

That’s not to say everything always goes as planned. The Helios Prototype was lost on its last mission on June 26 2003. A review board concluded events unfolded from an inability to predict using available analysis methods the aircraft’s increased sensitivity to atmospheric disturbances such as turbulence following aircraft configuration changes required for the long-duration flight demonstration.

AeroVironment’s team learned from those lessons which have led to successful aircraft designs such as the Sunglider.

John Del Frate who was an ERAST program manager and project manager for several of the aircraft said he has watched the technology evolution since the program ended in 2003.

“I’m personally very excited to see this team continue work started back during the ERAST days” he said. “The vision we all had then was exactly what Sunglider is all about. Our hope was that new battery solar cell and composites technologies would allow the concept to break through the barriers faced by Helios.”

De Baets and Plumb say Sunglider’s future is sunny which is a great forecast for a solar powered vehicle.

“What is fascinating is time and tech have caught up with ability to explore the stratosphere De Baets said. “Very few vehicles fly in the stratosphere with significant payload capability and we will have the ability to maximize the opportunities offered by the airspace. The goal: affordable persistence. We are helping to develop the foundation for these operations.”"

This season he has appeared in 38 games and is averaging 17.0 points 5.4 assists 4.6 rebounds and 1.82 steals (2nd in NBA) in 31.7 minutes per game. In Holiday’s 35 starts the Bucks have amassed a 25-10 record. He is shooting a career-high 50.9% from the field to go with 39.0% from the three-point arc and 81.6% from the free throw line on the season. Holiday is one of four players in the NBA (J. Butler N. Jokić F. VanVleet) to be averaging at least 16.0 points 5.0 assists 4.0 rebounds and 1.5 steals per game this season. “Jrue is one of the top guards in the NBA and we are thrilled to sign him to this extension” said Bucks General Manager Jon Horst. “Adding him to our team has made us better on both ends of the floor. He’s an elite defender and an impactful offensive player with the ability to score shoot and facilitate. Beyond basketball Jrue and his wife Lauren have already demonstrated the real impact they’re willing to make in our community through the Jrue and Lauren Holiday Fund. “We’ve worked extremely hard to build a team that can sustain success while competing for championships and Jrue is a significant part of our core. Wes Edens Marc Lasry and Jamie Dinan deserve all the credit for their leadership and continued commitment toward building a team that will compete at the highest level.” Holiday was named the 2019-20 Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year last season which is voted on by NBA players and recognizes the player deemed the best teammate based on selfless play on- and off-court leadership as a mentor and role model to other NBA players and commitment and dedication to his team. In January he received the NBA Cares Community Assist Award in recognition of his efforts to provide support for those impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Jrue and Lauren partnered with the Wisconsin Women’s Business Initiative Corporation to identify small women- and Black-owned businesses most in need of assistance. “We are grateful for the time we’ve been able to spend learning about the Bucks organization our team and the greater Milwaukee community” said Jrue and Lauren Holiday. “We appreciate how Jon Coach Bud and the entire staff along with our teammates and fans have supported us since the trade to Milwaukee. We have a special group that wants to put in the work and compete for a championship every year. “We look forward to working closely with our fans and the community as well as continue to provide more opportunities and resources with our JLH Fund throughout Milwaukee. We’re incredibly blessed to stay here and we believe Milwaukee will be home for our family for many years to come.” Overall Holiday holds career averages of 15.9 points 6.3 assists 3.9 rebounds and 1.5 steals in 751 career games (675 starts) and is a career 45.6% shooter from the field 35.7% from three and 77.9% from the free-throw line. Originally selected by the 76ers with the 17th overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft out of UCLA Holiday played the first four seasons of his career in Philadelphia earning an All-Star selection in his final season. Holiday spent the last seven seasons with the Pelicans where he averaged 17.6 points 6.8 assists 4.2 rebounds and 1.5 steals over 415 games (364 starts) and left as the franchise’s all-time leader in career three-pointers made with 628. He has also appeared in 30 playoff games throughout his career making 27 starts with both the 76ers and Pelicans. In the postseason Holiday is averaging 17.0 points 5.5 assists 4.5 rebounds and 1.4 steals per contest.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDQzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkL3N0YXJidWNrcy1iYWtrdC1iaXRjb2luLWFwcC81MDctMDM1MjA2NjktMjhkNC00ZmM5LTk4MzQtNDk5OTQyY2RiODA50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks customers can pay with bitcoin using Bakkt app,"The Bakkt App allows consumers more flexibility as to how they use their digital assets including rewards and loyalty points the company said.

Business for them has seen a dramatic turnaround from the first three months a year ago when the coronavirus pandemic shut down cities and dealerships across America. Now with safety protocols in place and used car prices up new car sales spiked in the first quarter of 2021.

“Both our stores set records” said Chad Wilson general manager of Wilson Ford in Saginaw Mich. and Midland Ford. “We’ve had the Midland store since 1991 and the Saginaw store since 2018. I don’t know that we’ve ever seen numbers like this.”

What’s selling? “Everything” he said.

“The only explanation that I can even muster is that cars are 2021’s version of toilet paper in 2020” Wilson said. “We are taking a lot of retail orders because we don’t have anything (in stock). Normally between our two stores we’d have 150-180 F-series in stock. I think right now there might be 10. I do think there’s an element of fear of missing out.”

Ongoing production shutdowns related to parts shortages and COVID-19 have led to smaller supplies of vehicles globally.

Ford reported a 1% increase in total sales in the United States from a year ago to 521334 according to sales data released Thursday. The automaker saw a 5.1% increase in truck sales to 277233 and a 14.3% increase in SUV sales to 216899.

Sales highlights for first quarter include:

All-electric Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Powerboost Hybrid with 25980 F-150 Powerboost Hybrids at 7176 and 3949 in March alone F-Series saw its best start in 15 years up 24.5% with 203797 pickups Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E totaled 29970

Overall Ford saw sales climb with Explorer Expedition F-Series Ranger E-Series Transit Connect and Lincoln Aviator and Navigator.

“Our customers are really embracing our new electrified vehicle lineup” said Andrew Frick vice president of Ford sales in the U.S. and Canada.

General Motors reported Thursday its first-quarter new car sales grew 4% in the U.S. with 642250 new vehicles during the first three months this year compared with the same period a year ago. Stellantis hadn’t yet reported its quarterly sales data.

Used car prices are high so trade-in transactions work great for buyers these days especially when paired with new vehicle incentive discounts.

“As of yesterday neither store had an Edge still in stock” Wilson said. “All the 2020 Escapes were gone. We’ve seen a couple 2021s getting dropped off. Over the last month we saw four to five Expeditions show up and none lasted a couple days. Explorers as fast as you get it goes. I’ve never seen a market where things turn this fast. Nobody came in and said they weren’t buying.”

Meanwhile Jeff King vice president and general manager at Bozard Ford Lincoln in St. Augustine Fla. said “Volumes are at or very close to records in every department trucks and used cars both at Ford and Lincoln. For a dealer that sells 70 F-150s a month we’ve got 14 in stock. Supply is very low but demand seems to be at record highs.”

Buyers seem to have saved up money over the past year through less travel fewer restaurant visits and fewer commutes to work dealers said.

“Americans when we’ve got money in our pocket we want to spend it and reward ourselves” King said. “Salesmen are running after the transport trucks when they show up to see if their customers’ vehicles are on them.”

His recent customer trade-ins include Range Rovers a Maserati and an Aston Martin.

Ford General Motors and Stellantis have been reporting high transaction prices based on demand exceeding supply.

“Every manufacturer is under stocked market demand is strong and most dealers are turning their inventories very quickly” said Thad Szott co-owner of Szott Auto Group in White Lake Charter Township Mich. which sells Ford Jeep Toyota Chrysler Dodge and Ram Trucks. “High demand lower supply low interest rates and strong credit availability create stronger consumer flexibility. Many consumers settled for their second third or fourth choice and those that won’t settle are placing custom orders.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoZS1lbmQtb2YtYW4tZXJhLWhlcmVzLXdoeS1mb3JkLWlzLWRpc2NvbnRpbnVpbmctdGhlLW1vbmRlby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The End Of An Era: Here's Why Ford Is Discontinuing The Mondeo,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoZS1lbmQtb2YtYW4tZXJhLWhlcmVzLXdoeS1mb3JkLWlzLWRpc2NvbnRpbnVpbmctdGhlLW1vbmRlby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcnF1ZW5ld3MuY29tLzM3NjkvbGF0ZXN0LWZvcmQtYmFja3VwLWNhbWVyYS1yZWNhbGwtc2ltaWxhci1vbmUtbGFzdC15ZWFy0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9ycXVlbmV3cy5jb20vMzc2OS9sYXRlc3QtZm9yZC1iYWNrdXAtY2FtZXJhLXJlY2FsbC1zaW1pbGFyLW9uZS1sYXN0LXllYXIvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Latest Ford Backup Camera Recall Is Similar To One Last Year,"Follow us today...

Sometimes you have to wonder about certain recalls. For example last year (2020) Ford recalled more than 600000 vehicles to repair the circuit board module in faulty backup cameras. And now the automaker is pulling back another 38000 SUVs for apparently the same problem.

Ford has also had one of its strongest-selling 2021 vehicles recalled the Mustang Mach-E. I discussed the recall of the Mustang Mach-E here.

2nd Recall For Similar – If Not Same – Issue

In the 2020 recall Ford recalled the 600000 vehicles because the backup camera modules could either have blanked out or they might have had distorted images. The issue affected the backup safety system which could have left drivers unable to see obstacles in the rear. Meanwhile the ongoing Takata front airbag inflator recall that has gone on for the last several years continues to wreck its havoc on automakers like Ford and others.

It's funny but we could have used the same release from last fall on this issue. The issue is that the 38000 SUVs are the products of 2020-21 and not earlier. Torque News was the earliest media site to call out Ford on the camera issue and it is now the only media site we know of that has called it out again with the new recall.

Specifically the recall is for a reversing camera module that may be intermittent. An intermittent is perhaps the most frustrating issue in electronics as it may not show up for a long time and then bang it's there. Suddenly it will likely leave again and show up again – and likely will.

Ford notes that the problem caused by this issue is that it could result in a loss of a rearview camera image when the vehicle is in Reverse. It means there are two issues: 1. The cameras are trouble-prone; and 2. The cameras do not comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and require a fix by Ford.

Ford Unaware Of Any Crashes Injuries

In a news release Friday the automaker is not aware of any crashes or injuries related to this issue. This action affects 34975 vehicles in the U.S. and federal territories 3053 in Canada and 379 in Mexico. The affected vehicles rolled off the assembly line at Chicago Assembly Plant between Oct. 19 2018 to Dec. 7 2020.

Dealers will begin notifying customers on May 19. To fix the problem dealers will update the image processing module software. Ford's reference number for the recall is 21C09.

As noted this isn't the first recall in the last year or so regarding Ford vehicles that Torque News reported on the issue. Last fall the manufacturer recalled 600000 vehicles due to a similar – if not the same – issue. Ford recalled those vehicles because their backup cameras could either have gone blank or show distorted imaging. It could cause safety systems tied to the video modules to fail to see people or obstacles behind them. And Ford has had other major recalls as detailed by my colleague Jimmy Dinsmore.

Block is selling three of the cars used in his Gymkhana video series through broker LBI Limited.

One of those cars is the 2011 Ford Fiesta rally car used in Gymkhana 3 which was Block's first video with Ford after his switch from Subaru. The car started out as a production 2011 Ford Fiesta ST before being heavily modified for racing and YouTube stardom by Swedish firm Olsbergs MSE.

Those modifications included a 2.0-liter turbo-4 engin in place of the stock 1.6-liter turbo-4. That engine produces 600 hp and 660 lb-ft of torque which is sent to all four wheels through a paddle-shifted 6-speed sequential gearbox. The Fiesta can do 0-60 mph in about 2.0 seconds according to the listing.

The Fiesta remained Ford's default rally car for several years so it's not surprising that Block has more than one in his collection. Alongside the Gymkhana 3 Fiesta Block is also selling a 2013 Fiesta used in Gymkhana 6 Gymkhana 8 and Terrakhana. This is also the car he raced in the 2013 Global Rallycross Championship winning at Las Vegas.

Aside from the two-door hatchback body style (which was never available in the U.S.) the 2013 Fiesta is mechanically similar to the earlier version with some improvements that got the 0-60 mph time below 2.0 seconds according to the listing.

The third car in the sale is a rare 1986 Ford RS200 a mid-engine homologation special for the legendary Group B era of the World Rally Championship. Just 200 were built to meet homologation requirements and the car had a very brief competition run. After multiple deadly crashes (including one involving an RS200) Group B was banned after the 1986 season making the Ford obsolete after just one racing season.

The RS200 started out with a 1.8-liter turbo-4 but Block's car has one of 24 2.1-liter ""Evo"" motors built in anticipation of the 1987 WRC season. It's currently tuned to produce 700 hp on pump gasoline and 800 hp on racing fuel according to the listing. The RS200 has a $550000 asking price but prices for the other two cars aren't listed.

Block is already taking advantage of his free-agent status showing off a Skoda Fabia R5+ rally car last month. But he may not be done with Ford as he discussed a Fox-body Mustang project. Either way he'll soon have three spaces in his garage to fill.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9jYXIuY28udWsvY2FyLW5ld3MvZWxlY3RyaWMtY2Fycy90YWtpbmctY2hhcmdlLXZ3LWlkLTQtYW5kLWZvcmQtbXVzdGFuZy1tYWNoLWUtbWVldC1wb2xlc3Rhci0y0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taking charge: VW ID 4 and Ford Mustang Mach-e meet Polestar 2,"Well that felt quick. It seems like only yesterday that the original Nissan Leaf and the Peugeot iOn first emerged their tiny batteries and puny electric motors making for an interesting glimpse at what the future of mass personal transport might look like.

Fast forward to 2021 and those early efforts don’t look so novel at all. In fact with the sale of new petrol and diesel cars set to be banned in the UK from 2030 their status as harbingers of a new electrified era now looks pretty ironclad. Seemingly overnight the entire new car market from the affordable end to the not-so-affordable end has been hit by a deluge of battery-powered alternatives to the once dominant internally combusted norm.

For better or for worse EVs’ prominence among the UK f leet will continue to grow. Sales and consequently market share are on the back of solid attainable mainstream offerings going to go only one way: up.

So the questions are: what do those real-world characters look like today? And are they already in good enough shape to really kick-start more widespread EV adoption ahead of the looming 2030 ban or is there still a hell of a lot of work to be done?

Well as far as the mainstream is concerned it’s hard to get more mainstream than Volkswagen and Ford. These automotive leviathans perhaps aren’t quite as mobile or quick to the punch as a certain Californian firm but the cogs have really started turning in the past year with regards to their respective electrification programmes.

Volkswagen struck first with the launch of the ID 3 but that family hatchback isn’t the car that’s really going to help the German firm dominate this new electrified era. Instead that will be the new ID 4. Not only is it set to capitalise on Europe’s ravenous appetite for relatively affordable premium-feeling crossovers; but also with production sites in China and the US it’s the car that will spearhead Volkswagen’s EV campaign in those crucial markets. That makes it a huge deal.

Ford meanwhile has gone down a similarly SUV-shaped route with its inaugural series-production EV but the journey has been rather more controversial. This of course is because of the name it chose. By going with Mustang Mach-E Ford isn’t mincing its words. Not only does that hallowed name bring with it an elevated status of image-based desirability but also in addition to the levels of practicality and user-friendliness it must possess to succeed as an SUV there has to be a healthy serving of driver appeal too."

And not just anyone: Viet Dinh the Fox Corporation’s chief legal officer and close friend of Fox’s chief executive Lachlan Murdoch had brought on a team of lawyers to investigate “the potential improper use of Fox data” by top 21st Century Fox executives he suspected of leaking to Disney while the terms were still being hammered out a Fox spokeswoman said. The studio’s president Peter Rice and the company’s general counsel Gerson Zweifach protested that they were merely conducting normal transition planning — and that Mr. Dinh was being so paranoid he might blow up the transaction.

The episode didn’t scuttle the deal. But the previously unreported conflict between the studio executives and Mr. Dinh a sociable and relentless Republican lawyer who was the chief architect in 2001 of the antiterrorism legislation known as the Patriot Act offers a rare glimpse into the opaque power structure of Rupert Murdoch’s world. The nonagenarian mogul exercises immense power through News Corp and the Fox Corporation in driving a global wave of right-wing populism. But basic elements of how his media companies run remain shrouded in mystery.

In the case of the Fox Corporation the questions of who is in charge and what the future holds are particularly hazy. The company minus its studio is now a midsize TV company adrift in a landscape of giants like Disney and AT&T that control everything from cellular phone networks to streaming platforms film and television. Fox’s profits are dominated by Fox News. Lachlan Murdoch’s more liberal brother James who no longer holds an operational role in the family businesses has made clear he’d like to see a change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcmV0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzQvNC8yMjM0MDAyMS9pcy1kYW5hLXBlcmluby10aGUtYW50aWRvdGUtZm9yLWRvbmFsZC10cnVtcC1zbHVtcC1mb3gtbmV3cy1nZW9yZ2UtYnVzaC1jb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUtbWVkaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Dana Perino of Fox News the antidote to the post-Trump network rating dip?,"Dana Perino stands outside the News Corp. building in New York on Sunday March 21 2021. Perino released her book “Everything Will Be Okay: Life Lessons for Young Women (From a Former Young Woman)” in March.

As expected cable news networks lost viewers after Donald Trump left office but competitors who hoped Fox News would disappear with the 45th president were disappointed.

Even amid an industry-wide “Trump slump” Fox still reigns in the latest Nielsen ratings in part because of programming changes made after Joe Biden won to include a larger role for Dana Perino a former press secretary for President George W. Bush whose star has continued to rise amid the turmoil and corporate politics that often engulf cable news.

If you turn on Fox News in the morning Perino is there holding forth with perfectly coiffed hair and tales of relatable imperfection throughout two hours of “America’s Newsroom.” Tune in late afternoon and she’s there too tossing out bon mots like a modern-day Dorothy Parker on the news panel “The Five.”

She’s also called on for commentary at other times in the day such as after Biden’s first press conference. She hosts “Dana Perino’s Book Club” on the network’s streaming service Fox Nation and lately is even omnipresent on other media promoting her new book.

In short it seems that when the “Trump slump” met Dana Perino Perino prevailed.

Fox executives consider her an “impact anchor” someone with both gravitas and sparkle and she was untouched by the sexual-harassment scandals that rocked the company five years ago.

In fact she’s the antithesis of the controversy the polar opposite of Bill O’Reilly the former Fox personality fired for sexual harassment in 2017 said Robert Thompson professor of radio television and film at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.

She is enjoying heightened visibility at an age when some female news anchors have been replaced by younger women and Perino 48 is not afraid to bring attention to her age. Her new book “Everything Will Be Okay” is subtitled “Life Lessons for Young Women (From a Former Young Woman).”

In the book Perino returns to her Mountain West roots to offer advice for America’s young women who she believes are suffering “quarter-life crises” well into their thirties. Her advice ranges from the practical (how to find a role model) to the ethereal (how to achieve serenity) and how to grow into a daunting new job when your boss is the president of the United States and almost a foot taller than you. (Bush is 6 feet; Perino 5.)

The 43rd president was one of her favorite mentors. And now she’s passing his advice on to others along with her own.

Gift from a father

Midway through a conversation about growing up in Colorado and Wyoming a siren shrieks on the street outside Perino’s Manhattan apartment.

“Did you hear that?” Perino says exultant. “The city is back. The city is back!”

Perino’s enthusiasm for the piercing sounds of the city shows how long it’s been in the grip of COVID-19. And also that you can take a girl out of the Mountain West and make her a New Yorker — albeit a New Yorker who prays for people she makes eye contact with on city streets as she reveals in her new book:

“May whatever you’re going through ease up on you for today. ... May there be peace in your heart today. ... May you be safe and secure. ... May you know you are loved and cared for by God.”

Praying for passers-by Perino writes is “a helpful exercise that has become a habit and I think I’m better off for it.”

“It certainly got me out of comparing my bag to her bag and her coat to my coat and her cool dog to my — Who am I kidding? No dog beats out Jasper.”

Jasper is the Hungarian Vizsla so famous to Fox News viewers that he was the subject of Perino’s 2016 book “Let Me Tell You About Jasper... .” He’s an occasional in-studio guest and a frequent star on Perino’s Twitter feed where he is much more popular than her queso. (Perino says a picture she posted of the dish in 2019 is the closest thing to a scandal she’s encountered.)

Today Jasper is napping next to Perino as she talks about her latest book her time working with former President Bush and why she has a heart for mentoring young women. (Among her life lessons: “Reach back to what your parents taught you about religion and faith” and “Stay in touch with your people.”)

Although Perino hasn’t lived in the Mountain West since finishing graduate school she can’t tell her story without traveling there in her mind to the farm where her great-grandparents dug a well and built a small house in Newcastle Wyoming to fulfill the requirements of the Homestead Act of 1862 to the quarter horses and cattle that members of her family still raise to pot roast and Jergens lotion and vacation Bible school and the other wholesome snippets of memory that coalesce into one: growing up loved in a family that prized knowledge.

They are lessons she brings to the set of Fox News — even when the “set” was a green screen in her spare bedroom thanks to COVID-19.

Perino credits her father for giving her a love for information and her ability to convey and dissect it rapidly. The family lived in Denver and later Parker Colorado and subscribed to two newspapers — the Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post — as well as multiple magazines. Beginning in third grade Perino’s father required that she read two articles every day and to be prepared to discuss the relevant issues at dinner. “It was brilliant training” Perino says.

“When I worked for President Bush I had just explained my point of view on something (while we were) on Marine One and as the president was thinking it over I had this flashback to the kitchen table and I was thinking about how helpful it was for my dad to have started that tradition with me. It set me up to be able to present my ideas and defend them through critical thinking and in front of a dominant male figure.

“Did my dad think all that through? No. But he loved the news so much” she said. The family church-going Lutherans would go to services early on Sunday so they could make it home in time to watch “Meet the Press.” On Sunday evenings Perino’s father would set a timer on the stove so that she would remember to watch “60 Minutes.”

Before she was in high school Perino had announced to her parents that she planned to be a news anchor. In high school she developed her leadership and communication skills on the debate team and student council and she went to the University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo (now Colorado State University-Pueblo) on a scholarship and later to graduate school at the University of Illinois Springfield.

Inadvertently the decision to attend a small state school turned out to be a propellant to Perino’s success. “I had a bit of an inferiority complex when it came to my education when I was at the White House at least at first” she said.

“They’d all gone to Harvard or Yale or Stanford. When I said I’d gone to USC they thought I meant I was a Trojan and I was ‘Oh no we were the Indians in Pueblo Colorado’” she said laughing.

“One of the ways I found to set myself apart to catch up was that I always wanted to be the most well-read person in the room. And when I was the White House press secretary I would make sure that everyone in the room knew that I was the most well-read person in the room. And that gave me a measure of power.”

Having developed a voracious appetite for knowledge because of the lessons of her father it wasn’t a chore for Perino to put in the time to read. There was also a direct line from Perino’s parents to the “compassionate conservatism” that made Perino want to work for Bush when he became president.

In the early 1980s Perino’s parents belonged to a church volunteer group that helped refugees from Russia Estonia Vietnam and Cambodia settle in Denver. Perino and her sister tagged along as their parents delivered appliances and other goods to refugee families. Her parents also taught the refugees basic skills such as how to use the city’s bus system. It was one of the meaningful experiences of her childhood Perino said and the lesson stuck. Conservatism and compassion could be entwined.

“So when George W. Bush goes to run for president and he refers to himself as a compassionate conservative my ears perked up. I was like ‘Oh that’s me.’ It really spoke to me” she said.

The experiences of childhood also come to mind when Perino grapples today with issues like immigration. Fox like many conservative news outlets has taken a hard line in its coverage of immigration at the southern border calling the current situation a crisis and criticizing the Biden administration for not showing more of the conditions at the border in recent weeks.

The border Perino says is a “huge problem” that she believes could be relieved with more border security and enforcement of visa terms and verification of employees.

“If we were more willing to use e-Verify then there would be more acceptance for the other traditional type of immigration that we’ve had in this country — for refugees for example.”

But while Perino a veteran of White House policy meetings is comfortable criticizing the president she holds back when asked about the performance of the current president’s press secretary Jen Psaki.

“I love the fraternity of press secretaries and part of that is a code of support. I’ve never criticized one I always try to support them. I think Jen Psaki brings a ton of experience to the job” she said.

Then again this is Dana Perino mentor of young women and giver of advice and that advice sometimes spills out unbidden.

“I think when it comes to this issue — is there a crisis on the border? — a better way for (Psaki) to answer that might have been to say ‘Of course there’s a crisis on the border — there’s been a crisis on the border for decades and we’re trying to fix it.’

“Instead every day (the press asks) ‘Is it a crisis? Is it a challenge? Is it a catastrophe?’ And I feel that the president and Ron Klain the White House chief of staff owe her a better answer. If I were her I would pour gasoline on my forehead and threaten to light a match if they didn’t give me a better answer.”

The ‘quarter-life crisis’

Perino is long past her “quarter-life crisis” but she believes that many young women in America are being crippled by a period of angst that begins in their mid-20s and is now following some women into their 30s and beyond.

A quarter-life crisis she says is marked by uncertainty indecision and a sense of failure despite many successes. Young women may feel they’re not advancing as quickly as they should be in their careers or despairing that they haven’t yet married and had a family. Consequently they suffer from a paralyzing lack of confidence that keeps them from achieving their goals.

Perino says she’s been there felt that and a friend from a church singles’ group in Washington D.C. helped her move past it with some advice from the Bible.

Perino wrote that she had begun to despair that “there was no way I was going to make my goal of having two children with a cute home in a good neighborhood with secure finances and I assumed no real worries in the world.” But then the friend reminded of two words that Jesus said: “Fear not.”

“And” the friend continued ”he means it. Everything is going to be OK. Let God work his plan and let go of yours.”

God’s plan as it turned out was much different from what a younger Perino had imagined. God’s plan involved marriage to an older man she met on a plane (when they met she was 25 he was 43); two (now adult) stepchildren not biological children; and not one cute home but two. (In addition to the New York apartment they rent Perino and her husband Peter McMahon own a home in Bay Head New Jersey.)

Her marriage was shockingly unexpected not only to Perino but to her family coming as it did 11 months after meeting McMahon on a plane. After a quick cross-Atlantic courtship the couple eloped in England with two strangers as witnesses. (Her parents didn’t learn that their daughter had gotten married until they all had dinner together in the U.K. a few weeks later.) Perino and McMahon will celebrate their 23rd anniversary in September. She has said that she still gets “little stomach flips” when meeting her husband after work and that there are six keys to their enduring marriage: faith gratitude grace commitment love and surrender.

Another significant cleaving from Perino’s plan for her life occurred the day she showed up at the White House in 2007 intending to submit her resignation.

At the time she was deputy press secretary and didn’t see any room for advancement despite working hours that felt nonstop. She told Ed Gillespie one of Bush’s other advisers that she wanted to speak with him and he said he wanted to speak with her too. When they met she told Gillespie to go first and he said the president wanted to promote her to press secretary later that week.

“I’d be honored” she told him. She never told him she’d planned to resign and Gillespie never knew until he read the story in her first book published in 2015.

“Immediately I knew with just a snap of the finger that my life had changed dramatically for the rest of my life” she said.

And it did. As press secretary she accompanied Bush to more than 50 nations and her name became a household word. After Bush left office she started a public-relations agency and with friends launched a nonprofit that facilitates “minute mentoring” for women. (Among her bits of advice: “If you’re ever in a situation where someone says ‘I need to talk to you too’ always let them go first.”)

But she became even more famous when Fox News came calling.

‘You don’t have to have a plan’

Perino began at Fox as a contributor in 2009 then in 2011 became a panelist on “The Five” a free-wheeling conversation on the day’s news that airs from 5-6 p.m. Eastern.

Perino was hired by Roger Ailes the controversial CEO credited with inventing the network’s personality-driven format with a conservative point of view often presented by beautiful women with blond hair and great legs.

Ailes who died in 2017 resigned in 2016 after a lawsuit by former Fox personality Gretchen Carlson triggered other accusations of sexual harassment. Perino was not among the women who made accusations against Ailes.

“He did hire me. I learned a lot from him. He gave me chance to be myself” she said adding that “The Five” was Ailes’ idea.

“I never had any problems at all with Roger Ailes. I recognize that many did. ... I feel good about the company where we are today. That’s not to sweep anything under the rug but to recognize it and to be honest about it but also to move on.”

It’s been challenging for Fox to move on given the relentless coverage of Ailes even after his death to include a book “The Loudest Voice in the Room” by Gabriel Sherman a 2019 Showtime miniseries based on that book and the partly fictionalized film “Bombshell” also released in 2019.

But the network’s ratings dominant in cable news for nearly 20 years have been resilient largely because of viewer loyalty to personalities like Perino.

Thompson the professor of radio television and film at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University has observed that unlike CNN which built a network around breaking news Fox built its brand on personalities that people wanted to watch even on slow news days.

And Fox viewers like Dana Perino.

“The Five” has doubled its viewership since its launch in 2011 and the show Perino anchored from 2017-2020 “The Daily Briefing” was the leader in its time slot among cable networks according to Nielsen ratings.

Fox executives gave Perino even more airtime when they added her to “America’s Newsroom” with Bill Hemmer in January.

In an email Jay Wallace president and executive editor of Fox News Media said the show “sets the news table for us each day” and that the network values Perino’s experience and insights.

“Dana is an impact anchor who has proven she can get newsmakers and lawmakers — from both sides of the aisle — to speak with her” Wallace said. That was clear this week when Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg appeared on the show to discuss Biden’s infrastructure proposal.

But Wallace said that Perino’s new role was not a calculated move to counter the predicted “Trump slump” but rather made in conjunction with other programming changes made to coincide with a new administration.

“History tells us the country’s mood and temperament tends to change with the arrival of a new president not to mention with a new balance of power on Capitol Hill so we are always strategizing ways to capture changing interests and viewer consumption” Wallace said.

Fox Corp. CEO and executive chairman Lachlan Murdoch has said that like MSNBC saw its role during the Trump administration Fox now has a job to call out Biden when he needs to be called out. “And you know you’ll see our ratings really improve from here and will do so for at least the next four years” Murdoch said.

For once Perino doesn’t have her eye on a higher prize. With a great job a fulfilling marriage and a good dog she says she is content with her life having decided that the most important thing in life isn’t having a plan but being willing to accept what God puts before you. That’s part of her advice for young women.

“Young women in my experience are hungry for advice and they will work very hard but they want you to give them the plan.” But that’s not how it happens she says.

“Every time there was career advancement for me I didn’t plan it. It took me by surprise. Now I’m prepared and I’m willing to take a risk and not say no to a great new opportunity but I couldn’t plan it all. And that’s the great gift when you realize it will all be OK you don’t have to have a plan. You just have to be ready.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS05NDMyOTA3L0lzLUJpZGVuLVJFQUwtcmVhc29uLUxhY2hsYW4tTXVyZG9jaC1sZWZ0LUxBLUF1c3RyYWxpYS5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTk0MzI5MDcvYW1wL0lzLUJpZGVuLVJFQUwtcmVhc29uLUxhY2hsYW4tTXVyZG9jaC1sZWZ0LUxBLUF1c3RyYWxpYS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Biden the REAL reason Lachlan Murdoch left LA for Australia?,"Lachlan Murdoch his supermodel wife Sarah and their three children quietly arrived in Australia from Los Angeles last month.

And while no reason was given for the family's return Down Under a new report has claimed that it was the political climate in the US that helped make the decision for the family to leave LA in favour of their Sydney home.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald the family 'felt the cold winds of political change' when Joe Biden assumed power over Donald Trump after the family-owned Fox News appeared to favour the Republican Party throughout the election campaign.

The family completed the mandatory quarantine period for international visitors by remaining confined to their luxury home in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

The Murdochs bought the beautiful Georgian mansion in Sydney's Bellevue Hill in 2009 for $23 million and then reportedly spent $11.67 million renovating the property.

They also purchased an adjoining property for more $4.4 million in 2018. In the current Sydney market the estate would be worth closer to $50 million.

Despite their life in Los Angeles where Lachlan is Executive Chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation the couple has always maintained the home in Sydney where they first met in the late 1990s before marrying in 1999.

However he clarified the handrails were only at the bottom two rows to ease the transition to ground level. One audience member said they were very long wide stairs and climbing down at the end was “terrifying”.

Is Murdoch just biden his time in Sydney? Was it fallout from the divisive US election which resulted in Lachlan Murdoch bringing his family to Sydney for an extended stay? Sources in Los Angeles inform PS that Murdoch’s family including his three children had all felt the cold winds of political change when Democrat President Joe Biden assumed power. The election result has proven especially troublesome given the family-owned Fox News had been such ardent supporters of the Republican Trump administration. Lachlan Murdoch is the CEO of Fox Corp and the company’s Fox News division is currently facing two defamation lawsuits in the US over its coverage of the 2020 presidential election: a $US2.7 billion case filed by electronic voting firm Smartmatic and a $US1.6 billion case brought for similar reasons by Dominion Voting.

Murdoch remains defensive of the company’s stance even in the face of criticism from within his own family most famously from brother James Murdoch. Lachlan Murdoch pictured with wife Sarah. Credit: Photo: Darrian Traynor Last month he defended Fox’s pro-Trump stance calling the news channel Mr Biden’s “loyal opposition” in a Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom investors conference. The Murdochs who bought a magnificent new $215 million pile in Bel Air just over a year ago with friends telling PS it was closer to their children’s schools have become deeply embedded in the privileged elite world of California’s super rich many of whom are Hollywood power players and ardent Democrats and Biden supporters. “I heard things got pretty rough especially for the kids at school” a Los Angeles source told PS speaking on the grounds of anonymity. “The school communities here are very close knit and it extends into the wider families and the circles and parties they all go to. That Hollywood set is very pro-Democratic. They are mostly big fundraisers for Biden so you can imagine how well it went down when one of their classmates’ dads is at the helm of the biggest anti-Biden machine in the country.”

The Murdoch pad in Bel Air Los Angeles. Credit: Exactly if and how that anti-Trump/Murdoch sentiment played out on the school grounds or within the local PTA for the Murdochs is not clear however PS was told they had returned to Sydney for “family reasons”. The Murdoch family takes its security very seriously and has done for decades. Given the unprecedented political unrest in the United States Australia and Sydney’s comparable peace calm and stability would be a welcome panacea for any young family. Meanwhile Lachlan Murdoch’s first appointment out of his two-week home quarantine in Bellevue Hill was to drop in on his troops at News Corp’s Holt Street bunker.

PS’s moles report a very fit and relaxed looking Murdoch wearing a snazzy suit with ultra-white trainers swept through the building taking many of his troops by surprise. His return home will also coincide with plans the company is hatching to launch a new news subscription streaming service which PS can reveal will be called Newsflash. It is in effect a bundling of all the Murdoch media’s news offerings at a reduced subscription fee akin to what the company has with its Binge and Kayo offerings. Newsflash could also better maximise the company’s more expensive talents including Alan Jones on Sky who is yet to recreate the audience impact he once enjoyed for so long on 2GB’s talkback airwaves. The concept of Jones streaming to people’s smartphones had one observer jesting to PS this week: “Is that a parrot in your pocket or are you just happy to hear me?” Star turn for up-and-comer Jess Bush

Australian actress Jess Bush. It’s been a steep learning curve on all things Star Trek for former Sydney model and actor Jess Bush who has just landed the role of a lifetime and is shooting a top-secret mega-budget new series of the iconic science-fiction show in Toronto. While it is unclear if she will be donning pointy Spock ears for her as-yet-unnamed character Bush told PS her audition process for Star Trek: Strange New Worlds – which is set on the famous Starship Enterprise in the years before Captain Kirk took the helm – was “entirely virtual”. Speaking from the set Bush explained: “Because of the pandemic I wasn’t able to fly over to the States for the final stages of auditioning to meet the director and producers which is what usually happens. It all felt totally surreal until I actually put my feet on the ground in Toronto a month after getting the call. Stepping out of a trailer into the snow feels pretty surreal too!” Bush who grew up in Brisbane had been living in Sydney for nine years and landed roles in Home & Away after first appearing in Australia’s Next Top Model back in 2011.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMixQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L3J1Z2J5L3N1cGVyLXJ1Z2J5L3J1Z2J5LW5ld3MtMjAyMS1uc3ctd2FyYXRhaHMtY29hY2gtbWljaGFlbC1jaGVpa2Etc3VwZXItcnVnYnktd2FsbGFiaWVzLXJ1Z2J5LWF1c3RyYWxpYS1zY290dC1qb2huc29uLW5ld3MvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS8yNDFkYjVkOThjNTljMjk5NWQxZTg5ZGNkZWRjZGIyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rugby news 2021: NSW Waratahs coach Michael Cheika Super Rugby Wallabies Rugby Australia Scott Johnson ...,"He didn’t so much as rule out a return entirely but as it stands former Wallabies coach Michael Cheika won’t return as the Waratahs’ saviour – not while Scott Johnson remains as Rugby Australia director of rugby anyway.

With the Waratahs coaching gig open following Rob Penney’s sacking a week ago any number of candidates have been raised to take over at season’s end.

Thus far only national women’s sevens coach John Manenti has publicly stated he wants the role but others including current interim co-head coach Jason Gilmore Darren Coleman and men’s sevens coach Tim Walsh could also apply.

Former assistant Simon Cron coaching under Steve Hansen in Japan last week ruled himself out because of the unfortunate timing of Penney’s sacking which came less than a month after he decided to stay on at Toyota where current Wallabies captain Michael Hooper and former All Blacks skipper Kieran Read are based.

While Waratahs great Chris Whitaker said following his side’s heartbreaking 24-22 defeat on Friday he hadn’t had the time to consider whether he will apply given the “uncomfortable” and “difficult” nature of the previous week.

On Saturday the 2014 Super Rugby-winning Waratahs coach was asked about his conversations with NSW CEO Paul Doorn after it was revealed the duo had spoken.

“We’ve had a casual conversation” Cheika told Channel 9. “I don’t think my ideas are the ultimate ideas. I just gave a few ideas of what I’ve experienced in the past and what’s worked for us and what might work for NSW and understanding its DNA a little bit more.

“I’d do anything to help them get back on track. It was a wonderful experience coaching NSW I loved every minute of it the highs and the lows. I think we can get back to that pretty quickly with this team.

“They have made some decisions now and they need to show some leadership going forward to get them right.”

Pushed on whether he would like to be involved in some capacity at the Waratahs Cheika said the timing as it stands wouldn’t be right.

“I think that it’s not the time for me to be coaching the Waratahs” Cheika said.

“It’s maybe a little bit too fresh [and] raw. Also from a national point of view they don’t need me in that space probably at this point. They [Wallabies coaches] need some clean air . . . without the name from the last four or five years because it’s been a huge thing for me.”

Although it’s understood Cheika has aspirations to coach the Wallabies one day again Cheika is enjoying being out of the coaching spotlight for the time being after the ugly ending to his six-year tenure with the national team.

The 2015 World Rugby coach of the year who took the Wallabies to the World Cup final that same year felt like he should have resigned at the end of 2018 when then-CEO Raelene Castle brought in Johnson over the top of him as DOR.

Cheika felt like Johnson’s appointment in the crucial World Cup year undermined his role as head coach and allowed for his players to question his authority and decision making.

Meanwhile Whitaker said he was “proud of the effort” of his side following their gallant 24-22 win over the Brumbies at the SCG.

The Waratahs fought back from 10-0 down and 24-10 at halftime to keep their opponents scoreless in the second half but a conversion miss from Will Harrison after regular time meant they failed to send the match into golden try.

Whitaker was visibly emotional after a tumultuous week and said that the former head coach could take some credit for their improved showing.

“It was uncomfortable” Whitaker said.

“Rob can take a lot of that credit. As [captain] Jake Gordon said it was a tough old week. We were probably lucky that the Brumbies game came around so quickly because it didn’t give the boys too much time to think about it it was just about preparing for the Brumbies week. The boys still talked to Rob a bit so he can take a lot of credit for that.”

The Waratahs have the bye this week before finishing the season with matches against the Force and Rebels."
FOX,Fox Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMDQvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvZm94LW5ld3MtdmlldC1kaW5oLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Lawyer Behind the Throne at Fox,"LOS ANGELES — In early 2019 as the Murdoch family completed the $71 billion sale of 21st Century Fox to Disney executives at the movie studio learned that someone was reading all their emails.

And not just anyone: Viet Dinh the Fox Corporation’s chief legal officer and close friend of Fox’s chief executive Lachlan Murdoch had brought on a team of lawyers to investigate “the potential improper use of Fox data” by top 21st Century Fox executives he suspected of leaking to Disney while the terms were still being hammered out a Fox spokeswoman said. The studio’s president Peter Rice and the company’s general counsel Gerson Zweifach protested that they were merely conducting normal transition planning — and that Mr. Dinh was being so paranoid he might blow up the transaction.

The episode didn’t scuttle the deal. But the previously unreported conflict between the studio executives and Mr. Dinh a sociable and relentless Republican lawyer who was the chief architect in 2001 of the antiterrorism legislation known as the Patriot Act offers a rare glimpse into the opaque power structure of Rupert Murdoch’s world. The nonagenarian mogul exercises immense power through News Corp and the Fox Corporation in driving a global wave of right-wing populism. But basic elements of how his media companies run remain shrouded in mystery.

In the case of the Fox Corporation the questions of who is in charge and what the future holds are particularly hazy. The company minus its studio is now a midsize TV company adrift in a landscape of giants like Disney and AT&T that control everything from cellular phone networks to streaming platforms film and television. Fox’s profits are dominated by Fox News. Lachlan Murdoch’s more liberal brother James who no longer holds an operational role in the family businesses has made clear he’d like to see a change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcmV0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzQvNC8yMjM0MDAyMS9pcy1kYW5hLXBlcmluby10aGUtYW50aWRvdGUtZm9yLWRvbmFsZC10cnVtcC1zbHVtcC1mb3gtbmV3cy1nZW9yZ2UtYnVzaC1jb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUtbWVkaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Dana Perino of Fox News the antidote to the post-Trump network rating dip?,"Dana Perino stands outside the News Corp. building in New York on Sunday March 21 2021. Perino released her book “Everything Will Be Okay: Life Lessons for Young Women (From a Former Young Woman)” in March.

As expected cable news networks lost viewers after Donald Trump left office but competitors who hoped Fox News would disappear with the 45th president were disappointed.

Even amid an industry-wide “Trump slump” Fox still reigns in the latest Nielsen ratings in part because of programming changes made after Joe Biden won to include a larger role for Dana Perino a former press secretary for President George W. Bush whose star has continued to rise amid the turmoil and corporate politics that often engulf cable news.

If you turn on Fox News in the morning Perino is there holding forth with perfectly coiffed hair and tales of relatable imperfection throughout two hours of “America’s Newsroom.” Tune in late afternoon and she’s there too tossing out bon mots like a modern-day Dorothy Parker on the news panel “The Five.”

She’s also called on for commentary at other times in the day such as after Biden’s first press conference. She hosts “Dana Perino’s Book Club” on the network’s streaming service Fox Nation and lately is even omnipresent on other media promoting her new book.

In short it seems that when the “Trump slump” met Dana Perino Perino prevailed.

Fox executives consider her an “impact anchor” someone with both gravitas and sparkle and she was untouched by the sexual-harassment scandals that rocked the company five years ago.

In fact she’s the antithesis of the controversy the polar opposite of Bill O’Reilly the former Fox personality fired for sexual harassment in 2017 said Robert Thompson professor of radio television and film at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.

She is enjoying heightened visibility at an age when some female news anchors have been replaced by younger women and Perino 48 is not afraid to bring attention to her age. Her new book “Everything Will Be Okay” is subtitled “Life Lessons for Young Women (From a Former Young Woman).”

In the book Perino returns to her Mountain West roots to offer advice for America’s young women who she believes are suffering “quarter-life crises” well into their thirties. Her advice ranges from the practical (how to find a role model) to the ethereal (how to achieve serenity) and how to grow into a daunting new job when your boss is the president of the United States and almost a foot taller than you. (Bush is 6 feet; Perino 5.)

The 43rd president was one of her favorite mentors. And now she’s passing his advice on to others along with her own.

Gift from a father

Midway through a conversation about growing up in Colorado and Wyoming a siren shrieks on the street outside Perino’s Manhattan apartment.

“Did you hear that?” Perino says exultant. “The city is back. The city is back!”

Perino’s enthusiasm for the piercing sounds of the city shows how long it’s been in the grip of COVID-19. And also that you can take a girl out of the Mountain West and make her a New Yorker — albeit a New Yorker who prays for people she makes eye contact with on city streets as she reveals in her new book:

“May whatever you’re going through ease up on you for today. ... May there be peace in your heart today. ... May you be safe and secure. ... May you know you are loved and cared for by God.”

Praying for passers-by Perino writes is “a helpful exercise that has become a habit and I think I’m better off for it.”

“It certainly got me out of comparing my bag to her bag and her coat to my coat and her cool dog to my — Who am I kidding? No dog beats out Jasper.”

Jasper is the Hungarian Vizsla so famous to Fox News viewers that he was the subject of Perino’s 2016 book “Let Me Tell You About Jasper... .” He’s an occasional in-studio guest and a frequent star on Perino’s Twitter feed where he is much more popular than her queso. (Perino says a picture she posted of the dish in 2019 is the closest thing to a scandal she’s encountered.)

Today Jasper is napping next to Perino as she talks about her latest book her time working with former President Bush and why she has a heart for mentoring young women. (Among her life lessons: “Reach back to what your parents taught you about religion and faith” and “Stay in touch with your people.”)

Although Perino hasn’t lived in the Mountain West since finishing graduate school she can’t tell her story without traveling there in her mind to the farm where her great-grandparents dug a well and built a small house in Newcastle Wyoming to fulfill the requirements of the Homestead Act of 1862 to the quarter horses and cattle that members of her family still raise to pot roast and Jergens lotion and vacation Bible school and the other wholesome snippets of memory that coalesce into one: growing up loved in a family that prized knowledge.

They are lessons she brings to the set of Fox News — even when the “set” was a green screen in her spare bedroom thanks to COVID-19.

Perino credits her father for giving her a love for information and her ability to convey and dissect it rapidly. The family lived in Denver and later Parker Colorado and subscribed to two newspapers — the Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post — as well as multiple magazines. Beginning in third grade Perino’s father required that she read two articles every day and to be prepared to discuss the relevant issues at dinner. “It was brilliant training” Perino says.

“When I worked for President Bush I had just explained my point of view on something (while we were) on Marine One and as the president was thinking it over I had this flashback to the kitchen table and I was thinking about how helpful it was for my dad to have started that tradition with me. It set me up to be able to present my ideas and defend them through critical thinking and in front of a dominant male figure.

“Did my dad think all that through? No. But he loved the news so much” she said. The family church-going Lutherans would go to services early on Sunday so they could make it home in time to watch “Meet the Press.” On Sunday evenings Perino’s father would set a timer on the stove so that she would remember to watch “60 Minutes.”

Before she was in high school Perino had announced to her parents that she planned to be a news anchor. In high school she developed her leadership and communication skills on the debate team and student council and she went to the University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo (now Colorado State University-Pueblo) on a scholarship and later to graduate school at the University of Illinois Springfield.

Inadvertently the decision to attend a small state school turned out to be a propellant to Perino’s success. “I had a bit of an inferiority complex when it came to my education when I was at the White House at least at first” she said.

“They’d all gone to Harvard or Yale or Stanford. When I said I’d gone to USC they thought I meant I was a Trojan and I was ‘Oh no we were the Indians in Pueblo Colorado’” she said laughing.

“One of the ways I found to set myself apart to catch up was that I always wanted to be the most well-read person in the room. And when I was the White House press secretary I would make sure that everyone in the room knew that I was the most well-read person in the room. And that gave me a measure of power.”

Having developed a voracious appetite for knowledge because of the lessons of her father it wasn’t a chore for Perino to put in the time to read. There was also a direct line from Perino’s parents to the “compassionate conservatism” that made Perino want to work for Bush when he became president.

In the early 1980s Perino’s parents belonged to a church volunteer group that helped refugees from Russia Estonia Vietnam and Cambodia settle in Denver. Perino and her sister tagged along as their parents delivered appliances and other goods to refugee families. Her parents also taught the refugees basic skills such as how to use the city’s bus system. It was one of the meaningful experiences of her childhood Perino said and the lesson stuck. Conservatism and compassion could be entwined.

“So when George W. Bush goes to run for president and he refers to himself as a compassionate conservative my ears perked up. I was like ‘Oh that’s me.’ It really spoke to me” she said.

The experiences of childhood also come to mind when Perino grapples today with issues like immigration. Fox like many conservative news outlets has taken a hard line in its coverage of immigration at the southern border calling the current situation a crisis and criticizing the Biden administration for not showing more of the conditions at the border in recent weeks.

The border Perino says is a “huge problem” that she believes could be relieved with more border security and enforcement of visa terms and verification of employees.

“If we were more willing to use e-Verify then there would be more acceptance for the other traditional type of immigration that we’ve had in this country — for refugees for example.”

But while Perino a veteran of White House policy meetings is comfortable criticizing the president she holds back when asked about the performance of the current president’s press secretary Jen Psaki.

“I love the fraternity of press secretaries and part of that is a code of support. I’ve never criticized one I always try to support them. I think Jen Psaki brings a ton of experience to the job” she said.

Then again this is Dana Perino mentor of young women and giver of advice and that advice sometimes spills out unbidden.

“I think when it comes to this issue — is there a crisis on the border? — a better way for (Psaki) to answer that might have been to say ‘Of course there’s a crisis on the border — there’s been a crisis on the border for decades and we’re trying to fix it.’

“Instead every day (the press asks) ‘Is it a crisis? Is it a challenge? Is it a catastrophe?’ And I feel that the president and Ron Klain the White House chief of staff owe her a better answer. If I were her I would pour gasoline on my forehead and threaten to light a match if they didn’t give me a better answer.”

The ‘quarter-life crisis’

Perino is long past her “quarter-life crisis” but she believes that many young women in America are being crippled by a period of angst that begins in their mid-20s and is now following some women into their 30s and beyond.

A quarter-life crisis she says is marked by uncertainty indecision and a sense of failure despite many successes. Young women may feel they’re not advancing as quickly as they should be in their careers or despairing that they haven’t yet married and had a family. Consequently they suffer from a paralyzing lack of confidence that keeps them from achieving their goals.

Perino says she’s been there felt that and a friend from a church singles’ group in Washington D.C. helped her move past it with some advice from the Bible.

Perino wrote that she had begun to despair that “there was no way I was going to make my goal of having two children with a cute home in a good neighborhood with secure finances and I assumed no real worries in the world.” But then the friend reminded of two words that Jesus said: “Fear not.”

“And” the friend continued ”he means it. Everything is going to be OK. Let God work his plan and let go of yours.”

God’s plan as it turned out was much different from what a younger Perino had imagined. God’s plan involved marriage to an older man she met on a plane (when they met she was 25 he was 43); two (now adult) stepchildren not biological children; and not one cute home but two. (In addition to the New York apartment they rent Perino and her husband Peter McMahon own a home in Bay Head New Jersey.)

Her marriage was shockingly unexpected not only to Perino but to her family coming as it did 11 months after meeting McMahon on a plane. After a quick cross-Atlantic courtship the couple eloped in England with two strangers as witnesses. (Her parents didn’t learn that their daughter had gotten married until they all had dinner together in the U.K. a few weeks later.) Perino and McMahon will celebrate their 23rd anniversary in September. She has said that she still gets “little stomach flips” when meeting her husband after work and that there are six keys to their enduring marriage: faith gratitude grace commitment love and surrender.

Another significant cleaving from Perino’s plan for her life occurred the day she showed up at the White House in 2007 intending to submit her resignation.

At the time she was deputy press secretary and didn’t see any room for advancement despite working hours that felt nonstop. She told Ed Gillespie one of Bush’s other advisers that she wanted to speak with him and he said he wanted to speak with her too. When they met she told Gillespie to go first and he said the president wanted to promote her to press secretary later that week.

“I’d be honored” she told him. She never told him she’d planned to resign and Gillespie never knew until he read the story in her first book published in 2015.

“Immediately I knew with just a snap of the finger that my life had changed dramatically for the rest of my life” she said.

And it did. As press secretary she accompanied Bush to more than 50 nations and her name became a household word. After Bush left office she started a public-relations agency and with friends launched a nonprofit that facilitates “minute mentoring” for women. (Among her bits of advice: “If you’re ever in a situation where someone says ‘I need to talk to you too’ always let them go first.”)

But she became even more famous when Fox News came calling.

‘You don’t have to have a plan’

Perino began at Fox as a contributor in 2009 then in 2011 became a panelist on “The Five” a free-wheeling conversation on the day’s news that airs from 5-6 p.m. Eastern.

Perino was hired by Roger Ailes the controversial CEO credited with inventing the network’s personality-driven format with a conservative point of view often presented by beautiful women with blond hair and great legs.

Ailes who died in 2017 resigned in 2016 after a lawsuit by former Fox personality Gretchen Carlson triggered other accusations of sexual harassment. Perino was not among the women who made accusations against Ailes.

“He did hire me. I learned a lot from him. He gave me chance to be myself” she said adding that “The Five” was Ailes’ idea.

“I never had any problems at all with Roger Ailes. I recognize that many did. ... I feel good about the company where we are today. That’s not to sweep anything under the rug but to recognize it and to be honest about it but also to move on.”

It’s been challenging for Fox to move on given the relentless coverage of Ailes even after his death to include a book “The Loudest Voice in the Room” by Gabriel Sherman a 2019 Showtime miniseries based on that book and the partly fictionalized film “Bombshell” also released in 2019.

But the network’s ratings dominant in cable news for nearly 20 years have been resilient largely because of viewer loyalty to personalities like Perino.

Thompson the professor of radio television and film at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University has observed that unlike CNN which built a network around breaking news Fox built its brand on personalities that people wanted to watch even on slow news days.

And Fox viewers like Dana Perino.

“The Five” has doubled its viewership since its launch in 2011 and the show Perino anchored from 2017-2020 “The Daily Briefing” was the leader in its time slot among cable networks according to Nielsen ratings.

Fox executives gave Perino even more airtime when they added her to “America’s Newsroom” with Bill Hemmer in January.

In an email Jay Wallace president and executive editor of Fox News Media said the show “sets the news table for us each day” and that the network values Perino’s experience and insights.

“Dana is an impact anchor who has proven she can get newsmakers and lawmakers — from both sides of the aisle — to speak with her” Wallace said. That was clear this week when Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg appeared on the show to discuss Biden’s infrastructure proposal.

But Wallace said that Perino’s new role was not a calculated move to counter the predicted “Trump slump” but rather made in conjunction with other programming changes made to coincide with a new administration.

“History tells us the country’s mood and temperament tends to change with the arrival of a new president not to mention with a new balance of power on Capitol Hill so we are always strategizing ways to capture changing interests and viewer consumption” Wallace said.

Fox Corp. CEO and executive chairman Lachlan Murdoch has said that like MSNBC saw its role during the Trump administration Fox now has a job to call out Biden when he needs to be called out. “And you know you’ll see our ratings really improve from here and will do so for at least the next four years” Murdoch said.

For once Perino doesn’t have her eye on a higher prize. With a great job a fulfilling marriage and a good dog she says she is content with her life having decided that the most important thing in life isn’t having a plan but being willing to accept what God puts before you. That’s part of her advice for young women.

“Young women in my experience are hungry for advice and they will work very hard but they want you to give them the plan.” But that’s not how it happens she says.

“Every time there was career advancement for me I didn’t plan it. It took me by surprise. Now I’m prepared and I’m willing to take a risk and not say no to a great new opportunity but I couldn’t plan it all. And that’s the great gift when you realize it will all be OK you don’t have to have a plan. You just have to be ready.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS05NDMyOTA3L0lzLUJpZGVuLVJFQUwtcmVhc29uLUxhY2hsYW4tTXVyZG9jaC1sZWZ0LUxBLUF1c3RyYWxpYS5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTk0MzI5MDcvYW1wL0lzLUJpZGVuLVJFQUwtcmVhc29uLUxhY2hsYW4tTXVyZG9jaC1sZWZ0LUxBLUF1c3RyYWxpYS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Biden the REAL reason Lachlan Murdoch left LA for Australia?,"Lachlan Murdoch his supermodel wife Sarah and their three children quietly arrived in Australia from Los Angeles last month.

And while no reason was given for the family's return Down Under a new report has claimed that it was the political climate in the US that helped make the decision for the family to leave LA in favour of their Sydney home.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald the family 'felt the cold winds of political change' when Joe Biden assumed power over Donald Trump after the family-owned Fox News appeared to favour the Republican Party throughout the election campaign.

The man most likely to take over his father Rupert's global empire arrived in Australia last month via private jet.

The family completed the mandatory quarantine period for international visitors by remaining confined to their luxury home in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

The Murdochs bought the beautiful Georgian mansion in Sydney's Bellevue Hill in 2009 for $23 million and then reportedly spent $11.67 million renovating the property.

They also purchased an adjoining property for more $4.4 million in 2018. In the current Sydney market the estate would be worth closer to $50 million.

Despite their life in Los Angeles where Lachlan is Executive Chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation the couple has always maintained the home in Sydney where they first met in the late 1990s before marrying in 1999.

However he clarified the handrails were only at the bottom two rows to ease the transition to ground level. One audience member said they were very long wide stairs and climbing down at the end was “terrifying”.

Is Murdoch just biden his time in Sydney? Was it fallout from the divisive US election which resulted in Lachlan Murdoch bringing his family to Sydney for an extended stay? Sources in Los Angeles inform PS that Murdoch’s family including his three children had all felt the cold winds of political change when Democrat President Joe Biden assumed power. The election result has proven especially troublesome given the family-owned Fox News had been such ardent supporters of the Republican Trump administration. Lachlan Murdoch is the CEO of Fox Corp and the company’s Fox News division is currently facing two defamation lawsuits in the US over its coverage of the 2020 presidential election: a $US2.7 billion case filed by electronic voting firm Smartmatic and a $US1.6 billion case brought for similar reasons by Dominion Voting.

Murdoch remains defensive of the company’s stance even in the face of criticism from within his own family most famously from brother James Murdoch. Lachlan Murdoch pictured with wife Sarah. Credit: Photo: Darrian Traynor Last month he defended Fox’s pro-Trump stance calling the news channel Mr Biden’s “loyal opposition” in a Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom investors conference. The Murdochs who bought a magnificent new $215 million pile in Bel Air just over a year ago with friends telling PS it was closer to their children’s schools have become deeply embedded in the privileged elite world of California’s super rich many of whom are Hollywood power players and ardent Democrats and Biden supporters. “I heard things got pretty rough especially for the kids at school” a Los Angeles source told PS speaking on the grounds of anonymity. “The school communities here are very close knit and it extends into the wider families and the circles and parties they all go to. That Hollywood set is very pro-Democratic. They are mostly big fundraisers for Biden so you can imagine how well it went down when one of their classmates’ dads is at the helm of the biggest anti-Biden machine in the country.”

The Murdoch pad in Bel Air Los Angeles. Credit: Exactly if and how that anti-Trump/Murdoch sentiment played out on the school grounds or within the local PTA for the Murdochs is not clear however PS was told they had returned to Sydney for “family reasons”. The Murdoch family takes its security very seriously and has done for decades. Given the unprecedented political unrest in the United States Australia and Sydney’s comparable peace calm and stability would be a welcome panacea for any young family. Meanwhile Lachlan Murdoch’s first appointment out of his two-week home quarantine in Bellevue Hill was to drop in on his troops at News Corp’s Holt Street bunker.

PS’s moles report a very fit and relaxed looking Murdoch wearing a snazzy suit with ultra-white trainers swept through the building taking many of his troops by surprise. His return home will also coincide with plans the company is hatching to launch a new news subscription streaming service which PS can reveal will be called Newsflash. It is in effect a bundling of all the Murdoch media’s news offerings at a reduced subscription fee akin to what the company has with its Binge and Kayo offerings. Newsflash could also better maximise the company’s more expensive talents including Alan Jones on Sky who is yet to recreate the audience impact he once enjoyed for so long on 2GB’s talkback airwaves. The concept of Jones streaming to people’s smartphones had one observer jesting to PS this week: “Is that a parrot in your pocket or are you just happy to hear me?” Star turn for up-and-comer Jess Bush

Australian actress Jess Bush. It’s been a steep learning curve on all things Star Trek for former Sydney model and actor Jess Bush who has just landed the role of a lifetime and is shooting a top-secret mega-budget new series of the iconic science-fiction show in Toronto. While it is unclear if she will be donning pointy Spock ears for her as-yet-unnamed character Bush told PS her audition process for Star Trek: Strange New Worlds – which is set on the famous Starship Enterprise in the years before Captain Kirk took the helm – was “entirely virtual”. Speaking from the set Bush explained: “Because of the pandemic I wasn’t able to fly over to the States for the final stages of auditioning to meet the director and producers which is what usually happens. It all felt totally surreal until I actually put my feet on the ground in Toronto a month after getting the call. Stepping out of a trailer into the snow feels pretty surreal too!” Bush who grew up in Brisbane had been living in Sydney for nine years and landed roles in Home & Away after first appearing in Australia’s Next Top Model back in 2011.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMixQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L3J1Z2J5L3N1cGVyLXJ1Z2J5L3J1Z2J5LW5ld3MtMjAyMS1uc3ctd2FyYXRhaHMtY29hY2gtbWljaGFlbC1jaGVpa2Etc3VwZXItcnVnYnktd2FsbGFiaWVzLXJ1Z2J5LWF1c3RyYWxpYS1zY290dC1qb2huc29uLW5ld3MvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS8yNDFkYjVkOThjNTljMjk5NWQxZTg5ZGNkZWRjZGIyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rugby news 2021: NSW Waratahs coach Michael Cheika Super Rugby Wallabies Rugby Australia Scott Johnson ...,"He didn’t so much as rule out a return entirely but as it stands former Wallabies coach Michael Cheika won’t return as the Waratahs’ saviour – not while Scott Johnson remains as Rugby Australia director of rugby anyway.

With the Waratahs coaching gig open following Rob Penney’s sacking a week ago any number of candidates have been raised to take over at season’s end.

Thus far only national women’s sevens coach John Manenti has publicly stated he wants the role but others including current interim co-head coach Jason Gilmore Darren Coleman and men’s sevens coach Tim Walsh could also apply.

Former assistant Simon Cron coaching under Steve Hansen in Japan last week ruled himself out because of the unfortunate timing of Penney’s sacking which came less than a month after he decided to stay on at Toyota where current Wallabies captain Michael Hooper and former All Blacks skipper Kieran Read are based.

While Waratahs great Chris Whitaker said following his side’s heartbreaking 24-22 defeat on Friday he hadn’t had the time to consider whether he will apply given the “uncomfortable” and “difficult” nature of the previous week.

On Saturday the 2014 Super Rugby-winning Waratahs coach was asked about his conversations with NSW CEO Paul Doorn after it was revealed the duo had spoken.

“We’ve had a casual conversation” Cheika told Channel 9. “I don’t think my ideas are the ultimate ideas. I just gave a few ideas of what I’ve experienced in the past and what’s worked for us and what might work for NSW and understanding its DNA a little bit more.

“I’d do anything to help them get back on track. It was a wonderful experience coaching NSW I loved every minute of it the highs and the lows. I think we can get back to that pretty quickly with this team.

“They have made some decisions now and they need to show some leadership going forward to get them right.”

Pushed on whether he would like to be involved in some capacity at the Waratahs Cheika said the timing as it stands wouldn’t be right.

“I think that it’s not the time for me to be coaching the Waratahs” Cheika said.

“It’s maybe a little bit too fresh [and] raw. Also from a national point of view they don’t need me in that space probably at this point. They [Wallabies coaches] need some clean air . . . without the name from the last four or five years because it’s been a huge thing for me.”

Although it’s understood Cheika has aspirations to coach the Wallabies one day again Cheika is enjoying being out of the coaching spotlight for the time being after the ugly ending to his six-year tenure with the national team.

The 2015 World Rugby coach of the year who took the Wallabies to the World Cup final that same year felt like he should have resigned at the end of 2018 when then-CEO Raelene Castle brought in Johnson over the top of him as DOR.

Cheika felt like Johnson’s appointment in the crucial World Cup year undermined his role as head coach and allowed for his players to question his authority and decision making.

Meanwhile Whitaker said he was “proud of the effort” of his side following their gallant 24-22 win over the Brumbies at the SCG.

The Waratahs fought back from 10-0 down and 24-10 at halftime to keep their opponents scoreless in the second half but a conversion miss from Will Harrison after regular time meant they failed to send the match into golden try.

Whitaker was visibly emotional after a tumultuous week and said that the former head coach could take some credit for their improved showing.

“It was uncomfortable” Whitaker said.

“Rob can take a lot of that credit. As [captain] Jake Gordon said it was a tough old week. We were probably lucky that the Brumbies game came around so quickly because it didn’t give the boys too much time to think about it it was just about preparing for the Brumbies week. The boys still talked to Rob a bit so he can take a lot of credit for that.”

The Waratahs have the bye this week before finishing the season with matches against the Force and Rebels."

“We were early entrants in the Indian mutual fund industry and have remained a part of the industry even while many other global asset managers decided to leave” Sapre said in the letter to investors.

“Please let me assure you we have no plans to exit our India business. Any speculation suggesting otherwise or any rumours around sale of our business in India are incorrect and simply that—rumours.”

However the letter did not deny reports of discussions with Indian authorities. “Our engagement with government authorities in India and globally is also something we and many companies do as a matter of course. We have endeavored to keep all stakeholders including the relevant government and diplomatic authorities appropriately informed of developments and will continue to do so” it said.

The letter said the fund house had the “greatest respect” for and “full confidence” in Sebi. The NAVs (net asset values) of all six schemes exceeded their closing value on April 23 2020 and all the schemes are now cash positive it said.

The fund house manages around ₹60000 crore of assets in India (as of February 2021). Nearly ₹1874 crore of cash is available for distribution to investors from the six schemes as of March 31. Around ₹9122 crore was distributed to investors in February 2021.

The Supreme Court had appointed SBI Funds Management Pvt. Ltd in February to oversee the winding up of the six schemes.

Last month SBI MF submitted a standard operating procedure (SoP) to the court for disposal of the Franklin assets. The letter added that Franklin has directed its efforts to “supporting SBI Funds Management Pvt. Ltd (SBI MF) the liquidator appointed by the SC in monetising the portfolios of these schemes and returning monies to investors at the earliest while preserving value.”

Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund said its six shut schemes have received ₹15776 crore from maturities pre-payments and coupon payments since closing down in April 2020.

The schemes — Franklin India Low Duration Fund Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund Franklin India Credit Risk Fund Franklin India Short Term Income Plan Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund — together had an estimated ₹25000 crore as assets under management.

Tringale has been a regular name on PGA Tour leaderboards since his debut season in 2009 but 296 events down the line and he is still looking for his first tour victory.

Cameron Tringale: Could his wait for PGA Tour glory finally be over?

In 2014 Tringale finished tied second at The Barclays at the end of the season which was arguably his best performance on the PGA Tour to date and the current World No.89 then followed that up with a respectable 15th place finish in the Tour Championship.

The 33-year-old American hit the bar again in 2015 when finishing second to Justin Rose at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans before finishing second again in the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open the same year.

These runner-up finishes are as close as the Californian has come to victory on the PGA Tour however he did win a limited field team event alongside Jason Day in 2015 at the Franklin Templeton Shootout.

Tringale's best finish so far this season came with a third at the RSM Classic in November behind winner Robert Streb.

Tringale has been faultless so far in the Valero Texas Open this week following rounds of 66 and 69 to vault him to the top of the leaderboard after 36 holes. It marks only the second time in his career in 297 starts that he has had the lead after two rounds on the PGA Tour.

While still searching for that elusive first win Tringale is an extremely experienced tour player who has amassed $13127013 during his time on the PGA Tour and a win in Texas this week would come as no surprise to many.

Spieth followed up his opening 67 with a 70 to stay just two shots behind and very much in touch for his first victory since the 2017 Open Championship.

England's Wallace also lies just two shots back as he goes in search of his maiden win on the PGA Tour despite having won four times on the European Tour.

Willard trying to navigate his way through the dangerous modern day Mekong of the American mall – the term actually refers to the collapse of brick-and-mortar stores. More than 100 retailer chains including iconic names like Sears and JC Penney have filed for bankruptcy since 2015.

While most fingers point at Amazon (AMZN) as the primary culprit behind the destruction of the American strip mall Main Street America the retail apocalypse is another example of evolve or die. Margins are tight so companies looking to survive are searching for ways to eke out value anywhere along the supply chain. One emerging avenue is through something called reverse logistics.

What is the Cost of Reverse Logistics?

One definition of reverse logistics is that it covers everything that happens to a widget after the sale. In most cases it simply refers to the processing of returned items from ugly Christmas sweaters to that cubic zirconia diamond engagement after you caught your future bride-to-be with your ex-best friend. In other words the reverse of buying is returning and it applies in both traditional retail and e-commerce. There’s even a Reverse Logistics Association (who knew?) that represents this sector of the industry supply chain.

Returns cost retailers $428 billion in 2020 alone representing more than 10% of all U.S. retail sales according to the National Retail Federation. The problem is even bigger for e-commerce where online returns more than doubled last year from 2019 – about 18% or $102 billion was sent back out of the $565 billion of stuff purchased online in 2020.

Of course there are other knock-on effects of returned merchandise such as the loss of state sales tax and more worthless crap ending up in landfills. And those costs don’t account for the reverse logistics machinery required to process manage and dispense all of that unwanted stuff back into the supply channel in some form or fashion.

Sounds like a problem in need of automation through machine-learning algorithms. Let’s talk about Optoro and its SmartDisposition technology.

Reverse Logistics Using AI

Founded in 2010 the Washington D.C.-based startup has raised $244.4 million which doesn’t include an undisclosed investment by a small artisanal Swedish meatball maker called IKEA. The international retailer also announced in December 2019 a partnership to implement Optoro’s returns optimization technology in 10 IKEA distribution centers 50 retail stores and the Customer Support Center in the United States. Other noteworthy investor names attached to Optoro include venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Revolution (the latter has participated in eight rounds if you include its growth-stage arm) investment firm and DGI darling Franklin Templeton (BEN) and the United Parcel Service (UPS) among others.

So what kind of reverse logistics platform can you build with a quarter of a billion dollars?

Optoro’s SmartDisposition platform “leverages machine learning alongside customizable business logic to understand demand for each returned unit and route it to its most profitable channel.” In other words the algorithms figure out if the item can just be re-shelved or shuffled off to an off-price retailer (the sort of place where Quasimodo might shop for swimwear). The widget could also land on Amazon or eBay as well as Optoro’s own eCommerce land for misfit toys called BULQ which features merchandise from companies like Groupon and Target. Another option is a tax-deductible thrift store donation.

A key component of the system is the company’s Dynamic Pricing Engine which “uses key data inputs alongside client-specific business goals to estimate SKU-level demand curves price elasticities and optimal market pricing.” The dynamic pricing algorithms reportedly analyze daily sales on every item then alter unit-level remarketing prices based on actual market demand. It looks something like this:

Optoro partnered with a San Francisco-based startup last year on the customer-facing end of the returns platform. Founded in 2014 Returnly has raised about $30 million in funding to date to develop tech focused on reverse logistics for eCommerce customers. The platform also employs machine-learning algorithms to make real-time returns policy decisions which the company claims saves its clients money on expenses associated with reverse logistics while building customer loyalty at the same time. Proprietary shopper data product type return score return value shipping variables and the merchant’s own business rules feed into Returnly’s algorithm.

Use Cases for Optoro’s Reverse Logistics Solutions

The real question of course is whether Optoro is returning value on returning merchandise. Let’s look at some use cases.

An undisclosed online marketplace for home remodeling and design employed Optoro to automate eCommerce returns routing goods directly from customers to Optoro’s B2B BULQ marketplace (a B2C version called BLINQ appears to be defunct even though it’s still mentioned on the website). Optoro says more than 91% of the retailer’s returns have been resold via Optoro’s proprietary resale channels and the program has increased net recovery (versus cost) by more than 150%. Further tweaks to the partnership over time have seen the exception rate for returns drop by more than 55%. The net recovery rate for the program also increased by 25% from year one to year two.

Optoro also has partnerships with companies like eBay and Groupon. For example the former program is called BULQ on eBay which allows sellers to purchase and resell liquidation lots on the eBay marketplace. Once the lot is purchased sellers pull product information from the lots and create individual listings to edit review and publish directly to their eBay store. Groupon has been a partner for about five years with Optoro handling the reverse logistics at the company’s Groupon Goods business which generates about $1 billion in annual sales.

There’s also an environmental angle to all of this that should please ESG-type investors. For instance Optoro claims its technology helped clients keep 96% of returned and excess inventory out of landfills in 2020:

IKEA in particular is all about projecting a do-gooder corporate persona. In 2019 for example the retailer resold 38 million products through its As-Is specialty shop with a goal of being fully “circular” by 3030 – meaning nothing goes to waste. Optoro figures to play an outsized role such as routing more than 3000 lbs of products from four IKEA stores to Goodwill in 2020. The program is expected to include all 50 U.S. IKEA mega-churches of retail in the future.

Conclusion

We first profiled Optoro almost exactly two years ago in our article about inventory management systems and the company seems to have created one of the leading solutions for reverse logistics since then. Other customers include Best Buy Staples and Bed Bath & Beyond among others. It appears to be a solid business model on the surface though we wonder how the potential softening of consumerism in the United States could affect the long-term health of this model.

Millennials are more interested in avocado toast than acquiring stuff to fill high-rent apartments that they share with three other people. The pandemic helped further unleash workers from their offices allowing many to be mobile and work in Mumbai if they want. The retail apocalypse may not entirely be Amazon’s fault as we (anecdotally at least) see something of a shift in consumption that no longer supports the Sears Roebuck catalog of yesteryear. However the $12.5 trillion Americans spent in 2020 (down $500 billion from the year before because of you-know-what) on durable and nondurable goods and services will only tick up if only due to population growth. But how those dollars are spent is changing and we’ll see if Optoro’s algorithms can keep up.

Alvarado is the first Miner to earn this honor that recognizes deserving and talented metallurgical engineering students who exhibit an interest in the heavy metals manufacturing industry.

The Ellwood Group provides industry expertise in steelmaking forging machining welding casting and distribution. The company manufactures and markets metal working components to an array of industries worldwide to include oil and gas aerospace defense transportation and infrastructure among others.

Alvarado will receive a $15000 scholarship along with a paid internship at one of Ellwood’s U.S. business units during the summer of 2021. The purpose of the scholarship is to promote the study of materials science and metallurgical engineering.

Stella Quiñones Ph.D. chair of the Department of Metallurgical Materials and Biomedical Engineering and UTEP Distinguished Teaching Professor Freeport-McMoRan Distinguished Chair in Metallurgical Engineering praised Alvarado for being an active classroom participant even through remote learning. Quiñones said she was impressed by how Alvarado led class discussions in a focused professional and helpful manner. She added that the student often asked intricate questions that elevated her peers and made them more marketable for industry.

Outside the classroom Alvarado is a member of the Metallurgical Materials and Biomedical Engineering (MMBME) Student Advisory Board who has helped students through the current challenges of virtual learning. She said communication between students as well as with faculty is critical to their success.

“Gina is one of the top students in the metallurgical and materials engineering program and this is not solely due to her outstanding academic performance … Gina is the perfect choice for the Ellwood scholarship and will benefit greatly from the internship experience that is a component of the scholarship” Quiñones said. “She is the ideal student to represent UTEP as she embarks on this outstanding professional experience.”

Alvarado said her interest in materials science and metallurgy stemmed from her love of science specifically chemistry and physics. She shared her fascination with how science relates to materials and added that she believed that there will be opportunities in the future to create new alloys through metallurgical engineering to meet people’s needs and enhance daily life.

The aspiring engineer said she hoped that her Ellwood internship would reinforce the concepts she has learned through her materials science and metallurgical engineering courses and involve her in industrial applications. She said she was excited to get hands-on experience and to learn from industry professionals who will serve as her mentors. She said that her UTEP education and training prepared her well for this opportunity.

Alvarado said she plans to use her scholarship to pursue master’s and doctoral degrees.

“This opportunity feels like years of effort are finally paying off. I feel extremely happy and honored to be the first UTEP student to be awarded the Ellwood internship and scholarship” Alvarado said. “This opportunity will help my academic and career aspirations tremendously as I will gain invaluable experience and financial assistance to continue my education. I think I will be able to learn and implement new engineering concepts from this great opportunity so that after graduation I can become a successful engineer with a more focused and sought-after expertise.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a group of three at the front in the final stages of the 1.Pro race with Astana-Premier Tech’s Alexey Lutsenko attacking to join Valverde and teammate Luis León Sánchez who was the final rider remaining from the late break up the front. However when Valverde attacked on the steep Ibarra 'wall' climb with two kilometres to go there was little either could do.

“We followed our plan and we did not do any mistakes on the road” said directeur sportif Giuseppe Martinelli. “We attacked in the right moment and Luis Leon Sanchez went away in the right breakaway which had all chances to go to the finish. Well in the end there are a few teams who cooperated pretty well in front of the peloton chasing the break hard inside the last 20 kilometres. I think we were the best team today but one rider was just stronger in the final.”

Lutsenko came second behind Valverde while Sánchez took third moving one step down from his second place on the podium when the race last ran in 2019 instead of the step up he was looking for. Omar Fraile made it three in the top ten with ninth and Astana-Premier Tech won the best team classification.

It is the second time this year that the team has secured two steps on the podium with Aleksandr Vlasov and Ion Izagirre coming in behind winner Max Schachmann (Bora-Hansgrohe) on a chaotic final stage of Paris-Nice. Still given the team is looking for its first victory this season and in the last edition of the race Sánchez also had to settle for second a single podium step – as long as it was the right one – would have been a far more welcome outcome.

“Once again I was close to a victory but missed it” said Sánchez. “Of course I am a bit disappointed because I did my best today but it was not enough. The team was perfect and the guys did an amazing job for me providing the best moment to attack. Everything went well in our late breakaway and I made my attack on the last big climb but later Valverde was able to join me. Together with Alexey we tried to play our cards but it did not work out.”

Lutsenko was returning to racing after his crash on the final day of Paris-Nice where after initially riding on he abandoned later in the stage

“I recovered pretty well after my crash at Paris-Nice and since then I’ve done a big amount of work to come back in form for this part of the season” said the 28-year-old rider from Khazakstan. “I suffered a bit in the first half of the race while later I felt much better so I was up there in front for the decisive part.”

Lutsenko caught Valverde and Sánchez at a little over three kilometres to go and then continued on to try and pull out an advantage.

“Together with Luis Leon we did our best I tried to attack on the descent but it did not work. Well it was a good chance to win this race and we did all we could for that but this time Valverde was just stronger” said Lutsenko. “However I am happy with my performance and now I am looking forward to the next week at Itzulia Basque Country. The main goal is still the same – to build up my form for the Ardennes but if I see a chance to fight for a stage win I will try to use it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc295YWNpbmNhdS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8wNC9saXZlLWJsb2ctYmVzdC00LTQtdGVjaC1kZWFscy1vbi1sYXphZGEtYW5kLXNob3BlZS1tYWxheXNpYS14cnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Live Blog: Best 4.4 2021 tech deals on Lazada and Shopee Malaysia,"If you missed the previous 27.3 sale not to worry.

Mars 2019. AIC PRESS

D'après un communiqué du Cabinet royal diffusé ce 4 avril a eu un conversation téléphonique ce dimanche matin avec le roi Abdallah II de Jordanie. L'appel a été l'occasion pour le monarque marocain de se rassurer de la situation actuelle en Jordanie en basant sur les données partagées avec lui par le roi jordanien.





A cette occasion souligne le communiqué du Cabinet royal Mohammed VI a renouvelé son entière et naturelle solidarité et son soutient total à toutes les décisions prises par Abdallah II afin d'instaurer la sécurité et stabilité dans son pays. Cet entretien téléphonique intervient en concrétisation des forts liens historiques et familiaux unissant les deux Souverains et les deux Familles royales et des liens entre les deux pays et les deux peuples frères conclut-on.





Pour rappel ce 3 avril une vingtaine de personnes ont été arrêtées pour « menace à la stabilité de l'État ». On fait notamment mention de comploteurs ayant souhaité un coup d'État contre le roi de Jordanie Abdallah II. Le Maroc par le biais de sa diplomatie avait immédiatement publié un communiqué où il apportait son soutien au roi jordanien.

These shifts brought several consumers online for the first time and led existing e-commerce users to increase their online shopping frequency. To understand how much consumers have shifted towards digital during the pandemic Euromonitor International analysed results from multiple consumer surveys. Here are three key takeaways:

Shopping more across all categories

Almost every industry explored saw a double-digit percentage point increase in consumers making digital purchases between the early 2020 fielding of the Lifestyles Survey and the late March 2020 fielding of the Digital Consumer Survey. Comparing those results with the most recent Lifestyles Survey fielded in January and February 2021 shows consumers have pulled back slightly from digital from a year ago though in general much of the pandemic-inspired digital shift remains.

Besides shopping more in already familiar categories consumers turned to the online channel across a broader range of products and services. The percentage of minimal online shoppers – connected consumers who did not use digital during the research and purchase steps in the consumer journey or only used digital to shop for one category – dropped significantly between the early 2020 and early 2021 fielding of the Lifestyles Survey. In turn there was a sharp rise in the number of heavy online shoppers.

Digital shoppers skew younger

Connected consumers aged 30-44 years are the most frequent users of the digital channel across all industries. The 30-44 age group which consists of the oldest millennials and youngest Gen Xers are largely digital natives who are comfortable using the internet and devices across their lives. Unlike their younger counterparts who have had their entire life unfold in the digital era the 30-44 group has greater spending power that boosts e-commerce value growth.

While the 30-44 age group has the highest penetration of digital spenders they also posted the greatest percentage point increase in digital spend during the COVID-19 pandemic in the consumer electronics and appliances and beauty health and personal care industries. Their younger cohorts the 15-29 age group led expansion in the foodservice travel and apparel and footwear industries as this consumer subset increased their spending overall.

Mobile continues its march

Across most industries explored in this analysis a greater percentage of connected consumers turned to smartphones in comparison to computers to execute e-commerce purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the stationary nature of many consumers during the pandemic the fact consumers turned even more towards their mobile devices to execute such purchases indicates how much this device has become the centre of the consumer’s world and commerce activities. Prior to COVID-19 Euromonitor International forecasted that 2020 would mark the first time that more than half of all digital commerce spend globally would be executed using a mobile device and the crisis only further reinforced this shift.

During the pandemic consumer behaviour evolved changing their relationship with the digital channels used to research and shop for products. Consumers are increasingly connecting with brands virtually taking advantage of livestreaming for purchases and demanding new technology and delivery methods that support the e-commerce boom.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNodXJjaG9mamVzdXNjaHJpc3Qub3JnL3N0dWR5L2dlbmVyYWwtY29uZmVyZW5jZS8yMDIxLzA0LzExbmVsc29uP2xhbmc9ZW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Welcome Message,"Welcome to general conference and to the privilege of hearing the voice of the Lord.

My dear brothers and sisters and friends throughout the world I offer my personal welcome to this general conference. We gather as a great global family desiring to worship our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Thank you for joining with us.

This last year has been one for the record books. No doubt we have each learned things we did not know previously. Some lessons that I knew before have been written on my heart in new and instructive ways.

For example I know for sure that the Lord directs the affairs of His Church. He said “I will show [you] that I am able to do mine own work.”1

Often my counselors and I have watched through tear-brimmed eyes as He has interceded in extremely challenging circumstances after we had done our best and could do no more. We do indeed stand all amazed.

I also understand better now what He meant when He said “Behold I will hasten my work in its time.”2 Over and over again I have rejoiced as He has directed and executed the hastening of His work—even during a global pandemic.

My dear brothers and sisters the strength of the Church lies in the efforts and ever-growing testimonies of its members. Testimonies are best cultivated in the home. During this past year many of you have dramatically increased the study of the gospel in your homes. I thank you and your children will thank you.

The huge project to renovate the Salt Lake Temple continues. From my office I have a front-row seat to watch the work taking place on the temple plaza.

As I have watched workers dig out old tree roots plumbing wiring and a leaky fountain I have thought about the need for each of us to remove with the Savior’s help the old debris in our lives.

The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of repentance.3 Because of the Savior’s Atonement His gospel provides an invitation to keep changing growing and becoming more pure. It is a gospel of hope of healing and of progress. Thus the gospel is a message of joy! Our spirits rejoice with every small step forward we take.

Part of the gathering of Israel and a very important part is the charge for us as a people to be worthy and willing to help prepare the world for the Second Coming of the Lord.

As we listen to the messages that have been carefully prepared by our leaders under the direction of the Holy Ghost I invite you to pray to identify the debris you should remove from your life so you can become more worthy.

I love you my dear brothers and sisters and testify that our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son know and love you individually. They stand ready to assist you in every step forward you take. Welcome to general conference and to the privilege of hearing the voice of the Lord.

H3Africa is trying to fix it,"H3Africa Consortium 2020

DNA is an incredibly revealing thing. Just by looking at someone’s DNA it’s possible to determine what kind of health problems that person is predisposed to. This kind of information is even more powerful when gathered en-masse and used to provide health insights into entire populations of people.

Recommended Videos

But there’s a problem. Despite the fact that genetic information is more abundant and accessible than ever the vast majority of the DNA that scientists use for large-scale studies comes from people of European descent. African DNA is deeply under-collected and under-researched in comparison. Since Africa is the root of human evolutionary history this information gap poses a significant obstacle to understanding how our bodies and diseases function.

But thankfully the genetic research community is aware of this problem and a number of organizations have sprung up to address these disparities.

The roots of the imbalance

“About 80% of participants in genome-wide association studies have European ancestry right now” Alicia Martin a geneticist at the Broad Institute tells Digital Trends. “That’s a huge problem and it emanates from a lot of different causes.”

Some of the biggest ones she says have cultural roots. Black Americans for example have historically been subject to racist practices in medicine and are therefore often less likely to trust people in medicine. Bias is of course likely part of this problem as well as researchers may simply draw from communities they’re already familiar with. Another reason is that Europe is relatively homogenous so it’s easier to study DNA from people with European ancestry.

Martin says there are concrete examples of how this disparity causes problems in health research — like the fact that predicting health outcomes is four to five times more accurate for people with European ancestry than for people with African ancestry. Furthermore she says this isn’t just a problem for people with African ancestry it’s a problem for everyone.

“Africa has more genetic diversity than any other continent in the world and there’s a lot that we just do not understand about diverse African genomes” says Shawneequa Callier a bioethicist at George Washington University. “There’s still a lot we don’t understand about the genomes of African Americans as well.”

“Humans originated in Africa” adds Martin. “That means African ancestry populations tend to be the most valuable for understanding the genetic basis of disease and understanding the causes of disease from a genetics perspective because we’re able to hone in on specific genetic variants more accurately just as a function of this human history” Martin says. “There’s a lot that African ancestry populations can teach us that we’re simply not learning because of these study biases.”

Essentially we can better get to the root of the health problems we all face with African DNA because Africa is where everything started.

Bridging the genomic gap

One organization working to fix this issue is H3Africa: An initiative focused on studying the genetics of people in Africa. It essentially funds the building up of genetic research infrastructure in Africa and trains researchers in Africa to do the work.

“With initiatives like H3Africa — where there’s funding for investigators in Africa to engage in genomics research to research issues related to scientific priorities in Africa the funding rules require that the investigators in Africa are the first to publish data or that they have a certain time period that will help them be the first to publish their data –those are steps in the right direction” Callier says.

H3Africa isn’t alone either. Recently Nigerian startup 54gene has begun working with hospitals in Africa to collect African DNA samples that can be used for genetic research. There’s also the All of Us Research Program from the National Institutes of Health which aims to collect 1 million or more DNA samples from Americans to help benefit medical research. Part of the program’s core mission is to make sure that its database is representative of the American people which means it won’t be disproportionately DNA from people with European ancestry like we’ve seen in the past. But even with this increased interest and attention in African DNA Martin says there’s still more work to do to address this problem.

“With African ancestry populations it would be great if they could participate more in these studies but they need to be offered to participate in these studies and there needs to be trust built to ensure that these genetic tests are not going to be misused in any way” Martin says. “It would be great if there was a building of research capacity within different communities to empower let’s say African American investigators to be key leaders of genetics research into African Americans.”

This problem won’t be easy to fix but if the genetic research community further invests in diversifying our DNA databases helps more people with African ancestry get involved in this work and elevates people with African ancestry who are already involved in these projects then we should be able to greatly improve these databases. Addressing this problem will not only benefit people with African ancestry but will benefit genetic research overall."

SUBSCRIBE From Newton to Matisse Junko Yoshida Colors are light's suffering and joy. ― Johann Wolfgang von Goethe I’ve been in love with Henri Matisse since I was 14. I didn’t then know the artist’s name but I knew what I liked. His contrasting colors inspired me. Take his “View of Collioure” (c.1905). This image evokes the pointillism of Seurat and Signac who often juxtaposed similar hues on the canvas. But they never blended colors. Matisse was much bolder both in brush strokes and color choice. His genius was in creating the sense of a hot day by building up brush strokes of pure color. He often left parts of the canvas white to let light shine through. Neo-impressionist artists sought almost obsessively to infuse air and light into their paintings. We still wonder however how these artists chose colors. Was it merely a matter of whim? Wrong. These artists had an invaluable tool: a color wheel developed by French scientist Michel Chevreul. Matisse became very skilled with Chevreul’s chromatic diagram. Chevreul’s wheel has 72 separate elements offering artists a range of nuance and “complement” – two colors situated opposite from each other. Besides the three primaries — red yellow and blue — Chevreul included mixtures of orange green and violet and six further secondary mixtures. He subdivided the resultant sectors into five zones. All the wheel’s radii separated into 20 segments to accommodate different brightness levels. Color theory dates to the 1660s when English physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton began experimenting with sunlight and prisms. While in quarantine during the Plague Newton held a glass prism in the path of a sunbeam shining through a hole in the blind of his darkened room. He found that white sunlight splits into red orange yellow green cyan and blue. Further he discovered that combining the light bands of his rainbow — red green and blue — regenerates white light. Newton saw color as a scientific measurement. Goethe then went on to connect color science with art. Interested in its physiological effect he postulated color as a subjective experience. Each viewer he said perceives colors differently. Matisse took Goethe to the extreme. In his Red Room for example Matisse thrust his warm red colors forward relegating the cool greens and blues to the background. His colors create a new dimension a visual tension and an intensity that no previous artist had ever achieved. Planet Analog × EE Times Into Analog?

READ LATEST STORIES NOW Chameleons Go to War Anne-Françoise Pelé Chameleons and cephalopods which include octopuses cuttlefish squid and nautiluses are often described as the quick-change artists of the animal kingdom. Their color-changing ability has inspired a literature character in Shakespeare’s Hamlet and movie characters like X-Men’s Mystique. It is now the art of war that is experimenting with colors. A chameleon's color changeability is among the best in nature and the most versatile. Some chameleon species can vary their coloration and patterning through combinations of red orange pink purple blue turquoise yellow green and black. Of course these enigmatic lizards can’t match any background. If a chameleon walks on a chessboard it won’t mimic the black and white sequence! It’s also a common misconception that chameleons change their skin colors to camouflage with their surroundings. They usually do it to regulate their body temperature. A cool chameleon may turn dark to absorb more heat while a warmer chameleon may turn pale to reflect the sun's heat. Back to a serious cause: war. French military vehicles are covered in a black green and brown pattern for camouflage in the wooded landscapes of Europe. Before these tanks trucks and carriers are dispatched in other parts of the world they are immobilized for several days to be repainted in ochre for desert areas or grey for urban operations. The reaction time is dramatically reduced and the range of camouflage patterns available aren’t always discreet. France’s Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) has launched the Caméléon project to develop a dynamic camouflage system for vehicles to adjust to their surroundings in real time. A camera records the environment while an image analysis algorithm identifies the colors and patterns. A spectral reflectivity technology is used to dynamically change the colors of the tiles covering the vehicle to replicate the colors and patterns of the environment. The camouflage system also reduces the infrared signature perceived by enemy cameras. DGA expects to equip life-size vehicles by 2026 and is working to make the technology more flexible so that it can be integrated in the fabric of the military uniform. In 1914 hundreds of thousands of Piou Piou i.e. French young soldiers marched bravely “Pour la France” unaware that their garance-red pants and kepi were flamboyant targets for enemy fire. One century later lessons of the past have inspired progress and invisibility is power. Chameleon troops will soon be deployed incognito to the battlefields. A Paean To a Non-Existent Color Brian Santo Do you remember the spasm of cognitive dissonance you experienced the first time you heard someone insist that brown does not exist? But maybe you haven’t had this discussion yet? Of course brown exists. Maybe you’ve got a brown Kia Sorento sitting in your garage or maybe you’ve got a pair of brown brogues or maybe your hair is brown. Ah but we both know what the visible swath of the electromagnetic spectrum looks like don’t we? And we both know that brown simply ain’t there. But wait — no doubt you learned how to mix paints in grammar school? Mix up blue and yellow and red and you always get some shade of brown or another – QED! Well okay but if brown doesn’t exist in the spectrum did you ever really create brown in any objective sense? Color theory doesn’t provide a definitive answer. First there are multiple theories of color and each has its own distinct explanation of what brown is and isn’t (“It’s a composite color!” “It’s a subtractive color!” “It’s less-saturated orange!”). Which theory makes the most sense can depend on what you’re actually doing. Coloring fabric? Painting? Filming? At a certain point the difference depends on that which is being perceived and — whoops — now you’re obliged to investigate human perception. Go down that rabbit hole and if you’re not careful you may find yourself defending the Hickethier cube against those barbarians who think the ridiculous Munsell sphere is useful or vice versa. Maybe brown is just in our heads but that means it is still in fact somewhere. Sadly brown too often gets disparaged. Crayola had the same 64 colors for years and then the first one they retired? Burnt umber. “Brown-Eyed Girl” is one of the Great All-Time Singles but at least one member of every cover band you will ever meet will admit if pressed that they hate it because they end up getting requests for it four or five times every night. UPS gave up on “What Can Brown Do For You?” in favor of “We ♥ Logistics” (ugh…) and even the Cleveland Browns’ helmets are mostly orange. I find brown can be comforting like the color(s) of earth or satisfying like a rich coffee or soothing tea or as blissful as chocolate. I miss burnt umber crayons. And after I send this I’m going to go listen to “Brown-Eyed Girl” and I plan to bop around my office when I do. Holi: The Festival of Colors Nitin Dahad People of Indian origin around the world last week celebrated the annual festival of colors. Though many consider it a religious festival it’s become a fun occasion where people eat drink and be merry and throw bright colored powders at each other. Putting religion aside as with many celebrations in Hindu philosophy it signifies the triumph of good over evil. Indians always celebrate any festival with good food and Holi is no exception. In addition the throwing of colors is mandatory but something I have never understood why. In the early 1990s I was once in India for a visit which coincided with Holi so I was invited to celebrate the day at the famous Madh Island beach in Mumbai. Though reluctant I agreed to go along since we didn’t really get to experience such festivals on that same grand scale living in the UK. That day I understood the ferocity with which Indian people celebrate Holi. On the drive to and from the beach our car would every now and then be pelted with colors. And on the beach itself everywhere you turn you’d see colors of all sorts flying at you or a pair of hands would be smothering your face and hair. It was like one huge pillow fight with the pillows made from material so thin that they would burst on any swinging movement to release and spray colors in all directions. For several days afterwards despite many showers and hair washing the remnants of the color remained in various shades in my hair. That was the one and only time I experienced Holi in India. Now however you don’t have to be in India to celebrate. Over the last 15 years it’s become a bigger festival among the Indian diaspora around the world. It’s even gone mainstream with the pop band Coldplay playing Holi in their video for the song Hymn for the Weekend. In London the Rajasthani community which I belong to also celebrate it in a big way every year. While it was not possible in 2020 or 2021 because of the pandemic I am sure celebrations will be back with a vengeance for Holi in London in 2022. Enjoying EE Times Weekend?

SUBSCRIBE Tom Shea: ‘Get As Much Practical Business Exposure As You Can’ This weekend we chat to Tom Shea President and CEO of Panasas. Tom has more than 20 years of experience in business and engineering leadership in the storage industry. He has led software and hardware teams in both public and private companies and has managed teams through periods of transition exponential growth and successful public offerings. He joined Panasas in 2014 as chief operating officer and was appointed CEO in 2020. Prior to that Tom was vice president and general manager of software solutions at SanDisk. He also worked as vice president and general manager for WAN optimization at Blue Coat Systems and was president and chief executive officer at Gear6. Tom holds a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California Berkeley. Image: Panasas What personal projects will you be working on this weekend Tom? On weekends I try to take a break from the world of software and hardware. I love any DIY project that allows me to be creative and work with my hands. Mechanical and/or woodworking projects are very satisfying to me. Thinking about design options and finding the right tools for the job are half the fun. And these are usually projects with no deadlines which is a nice change. What are the best and worst things about being a CEO? Our customers in technical computing and HPC are doing amazing things in life sciences manufacturing climate energy scientific research etc. I love being exposed to the work they do and knowing that we can play an important part in the success of their projects. So for me spending time with customers and partners is a highlight. As far as downsides of the role I tend to throw myself into areas that need work problems that need to be solved areas where I can make an impact. It is gratifying work in the long run but on any given day it leaves very little time to think about and enjoy all the things that are going well. Who is your favorite musician writer or artist? I am a big fan of Mark Twain. I love the way that he uses satire and humor to deliver social commentary. I have read and reread many of his original works. That said about 10 years ago University of California released Volume 1 of his autobiography compiled from various essays and writings throughout his life. My daughter gave me a copy for my birthday. It is such a physically large intimidating looking 800 page hardcover book that I must confess I have not gotten around to starting it yet. They have since released Volumes 2 and 3 so now I am really behind the curve. What was your first job in the industry? I spent my time at UC Berkeley preparing to be an ASIC designer. After graduating in 1987 I joined Adaptec in the company’s early days planning to stay on that track. After several months in the role however I got hooked on writing kernel level software to get our systems up and running. Everything I have done in my career since then has been focused on building powerful software and leveraging partnerships for the hardware needed to create amazing system level products. I still love working with hardware but I found system level software to be a different and much better way for me to satisfy that passion. It is great to have a career plan but don’t be afraid to change course as you get more exposure to the outside world. What advice would you give to early-career engineers? It will always be important to build great products but these days it takes much more than that for a company to be successful and win. I would advise engineers to get as much practical business exposure and customer interaction as you can along the way. It will give you invaluable perspective and ultimately benefit your company and your career.

~

On 1st February 2006 the Swiss manufacturer MOWAG AG issued a Press Release stating: “On January 27 2006 the Belgian Government announced that the MOWAG Piranha IIIC had been selected from five candidates for the delivery of up to 242 vehicles and related logistics support with a total contract value of over EUR 500 million for the Belgian Army’s Armoured Infantry Vehicle Programme. This sales success in Belgium represents the largest single order ever awarded from a European NATO member in the history of the Swiss technology-based company. Deliveries will commence in 2007 and will extend to 2015 for the total quantity including options.”

That same day the General Dynamics HQ in Virginia issued a release stating: “The Belgian government has selected the Piranha IIIC 8×8 light armoured vehicle produced by MOWAG GmbH a part of General Dynamics European Land Combat Systems for its Armoured Infantry Vehicle (AIV) programme. AIV will serve as the cornerstone of the transformation of the Belgian Army into a lighter more deployable lethal survivable and sustainable force.

“The programme which includes a maximum of 242 vehicles and related logistics support has an approximate value of $604 million (Euro 500 million) if all options are exercised. General Dynamics European Land Combat Systems is a business unit of General Dynamics.”

The Belgian order covered seven different variants: Infantry Carrier Armoured Personnel Carrier with Medium Calibre Gun Direct Fire Command Post Engineering Ambulance and Recovery. The initial batch was for 138 vehicles to be delivered from 2007 to 2012 and it was anticipated that if all options were exercised the remaining 104 would be delivered by 2015. Piranha IIIC was accepted for Belgian service in 2008 and according to later information released by the Belgian MoD the final fleet breakdown was

99 APCs for the transport of ten soldiers

32 Fire Support Vehicles with 30 mm weapon system

40 Direct Fire Vehicles with 90mm cannon

24 Command Vehicles

12 Ambulances

17 Repair and Recovery Vehicles and

18 Engineer Vehicles.

The Belgian Government in the early years of the new millennium – well before the shock 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia and then its 2014 expansionism into Ukraine – decided to cash in on the perceived post-Cold War ‘peace dividend’ by replacing its tracked armour inventory with wheeled armour (coincidentally also by 2014). A decade before this decision Belgium had ended conscription thereby reducing a Corps-sized conventional force with a high proportion of conscripts to an all-professional Division and then eventually to just a Motorised Brigade plus a Special Operations regiment. The first step in this process was the adoption of the Austrian 6×6 Pandur I in 1996 as a reconnaissance vehicle followed by the introduction of the Piranha IIIC 8×8 for the main infantry force a decade later.

In 2019 we had the good fortune to work with Belgium’s Bataillon de Chasseurs Ardennais who at that time were supplying a company group contribution with integral Engineers and Fire Support to the British-led multinational eFP (enhanced Forward Presence) NATO Battle Group Estonia (BG EST). In addition to the standard APC version known as the Fuselier of FUS in Belgian service the Chasseurs contingent also had Command Post Engineer Fire Support Direct Fire and Ambulance variants in Estonia and in subsequent parts of this mini-series we will try to briefly look at all of these.

General Motors has doubled up on its electric vehicle (EV) offering with an announcement on Saturday of its second all-electric Hummers.

GM already announced its upcoming EV Hummer pickup which is scheduled to go on sale this fall — its first model of the American classic in 11 years.

Hummer is the latest brand to jump on the electrification bandwagon with Volkswagen also gearing up to take on Tesla with its Mission T project.

Herbert Diess Volkswagen's CEO has committed to offering a fully electric vehicle for each of its stable of brands including Audi Bentley and Porsche by 2025.

Duncan Aldred global vice president of GMC said in a statement: ""The GMC Hummer EVs were envisioned to be the most capable and compelling electric supertrucks ever.""

Following a similar pricing structure to that of the pickup the base model SUV comes in at about $80000. A special Edition 1 launch model — with its ""extreme off-road package""— costs $110595.

Pricing varies based on the range and battery size of the vehicle.

GM said it will produce the highest-priced models in early 2023 with the less expensive versions coming in spring 2024.

These latest Hummer models will be competing against several other vehicles including Tesla's 'Cybertruck' a futuristic-looking EV pickup that joins the roster of the company's sports cars. The Cybertruck made headlines at its launch after its ""armour glass"" windows shattered twice during CEO Elon Musk's presentation.

Last fall when General Motors revealed the GMC Hummer EV electric pickup Duncan Aldred head of the Buick and GMC brands told CNN Business “There will be an SUV so watch this space.”

That space is now filled. GM revealed the GMC Hummer EV SUV on Saturday in a 60-second commercial narrated by LeBron James shown during the Houston-Baylor NCAA Final Four basketball game. A longer version of the commercial appears on the GMC.com website.

The GMC Hummer EV SUV is about nine inches shorter than the pickup version. GM

The Hummer EV pickup and SUV will be among the first vehicles from GM using a new electric vehicle battery system that will be the basis for dozens of new models over the coming years. General Motors recently announced it hopes to produce nothing but zero-emission vehicles by the year 2035.

With these models GM is entering the market with attention-grabbing high-performance off-road vehicles that defy common stereotypes of electric vehicles as slow and fit only for running errands around town. The approach is similar to that of Ford with the Mustang Mach-E. The Mach-E a performance-oriented crossover SUV that went on sale late last year has taken sales away from electric vehicle market leader Tesla.

The Hummer EV SUV is smaller with a nine-inch shorter wheelbase (the distance from the front to the rear wheels) than the pickup which should give it better off-road maneuverability. It will not have the Hummer EV pickup’s maximum available 1000 horsepower though.

Like the Hummer EV pickup the SUV will be available with four-wheel steering including the ability to drive diagonally – a feature called “crab walk.” Four wheel steering also gives the SUV a small turning circle for a vehicle its size. GM claims it will be able to U-turn in a smaller area than a Mustang Mach-E despite having a 10-inch longer wheelbase.

The SUV will also have “Extract Mode” with which the vehicle can raise itself by as much as six inches to climb over obstacles and removable roof panels to provide an open-air driving experience. Once removed the panels can be kept in storage space under the SUV’s hood.

Drivers will be able to accelerate slow down and stop the SUV in both on-road and off-road situations using just the accelerator pedal alone according to GM. Normal two-pedal driving using the accelerator and brake pedals can be used though.

The SUV has two rows of seats that can fit up to five people. There are currently no plans to offer a three-row version GM executives said.

The GMC Hummer EV SUV will have removable roof panels. GM

Depending on the specific version the four-wheel-drive SUV will be powered by either two or three electric motors. Three-motor versions will be available with at most 830 horsepower. That’s less than the 1000 horsepower available in the pickup but still almost twice the power of a gasoline-fueled GMC Yukon Denali. The SUV will be able to go from zero to 60 miles an hour in as little as 3.5 seconds.

The reduced maximum power is simply because of the SUV’s smaller size said Brook. With a shorter overall length there was less room for batteries and therefore less power could be added.

Special navigation software will enable drivers to select off-road driving routes taking into account the driving range remaining in the SUV’s batteries. Drivers will also be able to monitor energy consumption as they drive off-road using detailed satellite maps according to GM.

If someone does run out of power say while they’re out on the trail Hummer EV vehicles will be able to recharge one another. They will also be able to provide power for tools and accessories.

Versions with the largest available battery packs should be able to drive more than 300 miles before needing to recharge according to GM.

The top levels of the GMC Hummer EV SUV will have less maximum horsepower than the truck but just as much torque a measure of raw pulling power. GM

The GMC Hummer EV pickup will go into production by the end of this year but the SUV won’t be available until early 2023. A special First Edition model which will have three motors and 22-inch wheels will cost $110595. Lower priced versions will be available later. A 625-horsepower two-motor version with a range of over 250 miles will be available in 2024 for a starting price of about $80000. GMC is accepting $100 refundable deposits for the Hummer EV SUV online a spokesperson said. However GM executives said Monday that reservations for the First Edition model were sold out shortly after they became available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9jYXJzL2dlbmVyYWwtbW90b3JzLzIwMjEvMDQvMDMvZ21jLWh1bW1lci1ldi1zdXYtMjAyNC1wcmljZS83MDQ5ODU4MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GMC reveals Hummer EV SUV: See the price features,"General Motors is expanding its GMC Hummer EV lineup by adding an SUV version that will start at over $100000.

GMC revealed the 2024 Hummer EV SUV on Saturday evening during the NCAA’s Final Four telecast in a new commercial film narrated by LeBron James.

The SUV will offer many of the same capabilities and off-roading features as the Hummer EV pickup making them the most "" capable and compelling electric supertrucks ever” said Duncan Aldred vice president of Buick and GMC.

“The new Hummer EV SUV is the next chapter offering more options for customers to tailor the truck to their lifestyles while continuing to encourage them to forge new paths with zero emissions"" Aldred said.

Hummer EV prices and production

The Hummer EV pickup goes into production at Factory Zero in Detroit and Hamtramck this fall. GMC has about 10000 preorders for the pickup which starts at $112595. Subsequent editions will come out starting in 2022 but the cheapest edition still starts at nearly $80000.

The just-revealed Hummer EV SUV also is pricey.

When production on it begins in early 2023 the SUV Edition 1 will start at $105595. It will have an expected range of 300 miles on a full charge GM said in a statement.

When equipped with the available Extreme Off-Road Pack the starting price for the SUV jumps to $110595 with an expected range of 280 miles on a full charge.

GM is not disclosing which plant will build the Hummer SUV.

GM will offer a variety of Hummer EV SUV editions in the future starting at a lower price than Edition 1. GM said a Hummer EV SUV Edition 2 2x and 3x will start at $79995 $89995 and $99995 respectively.

The Edition 2 has a range of 250 miles the 2x and 3x have a range of 300 miles each on a full charge.

EV SUV features

The new reveal ad focuses on the SUV’s capability and signature Hummer EV features including Extract Mode and CrabWalk.

Extract Mode causes the air suspension system to raise the vehicle almost 6 inches.

CrabWalk can rotate all four wheels at the same angle to move the vehicle diagonally to get out of tight spots when off-roading.

One of the driving forces behind CrabWalk was former racer and now GM engineer Mike Colville. Many of Hummer's unique features came from Colville's own garage and the cars he built to withstand the rugged racing of Ultra4.

The Hummer EV SUV will be powered by GM's next-generation Ultium battery technology. The Edition 1 allows customers to equip it for maximum driving range or maximum off-road capability but it comes standard with 22-inch premium wheels assist-steps and floor liners.

The Extreme Off-Road package adds 18-inch wheels and 35-inch off-road tires underbody armor and rock sliders to support the body and doors while off-roading and UltraVision3 with underbody camera views and more.

UltraVision uses front and rear underbody cameras with live views that help drivers navigate obstacles and place wheels on and off the trail. The underbody cameras which were invented by GM engineer Christopher Stanek in his free time using plastic goggles and duct tape are protected from damage and have a wash function to clear debris.

New design new technology

The SUV’s design is rugged and includes a new rear design with mounted full-size spare tire.

It will have a 126.7 inch wheelbase giving it ""expected best-in-class off-road proportions"" with a tight turning circle of only 35.4 feet.

Inside a similar five-passenger layout from the pickup remains and includes a large rear cargo area. It will have the standard Infinity Roof with removable panels I-Bar and rear drop glass.

The Ultium Drive System delivers up to 830 horsepower and 11500 pound-feet of torque enough power to go from 0-60-mph in about 3.5 seconds GM said.

Additionally all Hummer EV models will have the enhanced version of Super Cruise GM's hands-free driving system that can be used on more than 200000 miles of enabled roads in the U.S. and Canada.

The Hummer EV will have new automatic lane changing feature where the system can determine when a lane change is optimal and initiate the maneuver while following signaling protocols.

The SUV version is no surprise considering that GM teased it last November during Barclays Global Automotive Conference. The conference was done virtually from GM's Design Dome at GM's Global Technical Center in Warren.

CEO Mary Barra and Doug Parks executive vice president of Global Product Development sat next to the then-yet-to-be-revealed GMC Hummer SUV during the presentation for Wall Street and the media to see. At that time the vehicle was presumed to be a 2023 model year.

The money came with her name: she is the granddaughter of Roy Disney who with his brother Walt founded the Walt Disney Company in 1923. Disney 61 refuses to say how much she has but acknowledges she would have been a billionaire in her own right had she not realised in her 20s that it was her fortune that was making her miserable and decided to start giving it away.

She has been donating to good causes ever since – $72m (£52m) and counting mostly to groups helping women in prison women living with HIV and victims of domestic violence. But giving it away is no longer enough. She wants the tax collector to take more money not only from her but from “all of the absurdly rich people across the world”.

“We’ve long known that the world is hugely unequal” says Disney. “But now the pandemic has really shown it to all of us and no one in all conscience can continue to ignore it.” Disney is speaking over Zoom from San Francisco. Today she looks more hippy chic than heiress: her light-brown hair falls in long gentle curls and there is a discreet peace dove tattooed on the inside of her wrist.

“It is like when your kids have a bath and you pull the plug out and slowly all the little toys at the bottom are revealed” says Disney. “That is what has happened here: now we all know what is going on under the surface.” As well as killing more than 2.5 million people the pandemic and global lockdown response has plunged some 150 million more into “extreme poverty” according to the World Bank. The Washington-based institution described Covid-19 as “a heat-seeking missile speeding toward the most vulnerable in society”.

“Throughout the pandemic the poorest have been forced to continue going to work risking their lives while the rich stay at home” Disney says. “And those going to work in life-saving essential jobs are paying more [proportionally] in tax than the wealthy who are safe at home.”

Disney worries that society risks slipping back into a “Dickensian world” unless the really rich realise “we are all humans at the end of the day and we need to look after each other. You know these billionaires are modern-day miserly Ebenezer Scrooges. Because they are looking straight at Tiny Tim and saying: ‘No fuck you I won’t pay for your crutches’” she says. “It may sound extreme but they really are.”

Abigail Disney is part of a small but growing group among the super-rich calling for a wealth tax to help fund the recovery from the pandemic. The Patriotic Millionaires movement of which she is a longstanding member and key spokesperson started in 2010 with only a handful of signatures on a 163-word open letter including the musician Moby and Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream co-founder Ben Cohen. It has grown into a global organisation with more than 200 members including Chuck Collins heir to the Oscar Mayer hotdog fortune; Morris Pearl a former managing director at BlackRock; Danish-Iranian billionaire Djaffar Shalchi; and Sir Stephen Tindall the founder of New Zealand’s largest retailer the Warehouse Group. They describe themselves as “proud traitors to their class” united in their concern about the “destabilising concentration of wealth and power”.

These members argue that instead of leaving the super-rich to splash their billions on philanthropic vanity projects such as opera houses and museums higher taxes should be used to fund public services welfare and tackle growing inequality. Disney wants taxes on the super-rich to fund universal medical treatment and education in the US and throughout the world. This week she will help launch the UK and European chapter of Patriotic Millionaires pressuring world governments to “raise taxes on people like us. Immediately. Substantially. Permanently”.

Disney does not have a fixed idea of exactly how a wealth tax should work or at what rate it should be set; she just wants it to start now. “Yesterday is not soon enough” she says as her dog Forkie a morkie (a cross between a Maltese and Yorkshire terrier) crashes into her tablet. (Her other dogs are called Quincy and RBG after Ruth Bader Ginsburg; Disney was a fan of the late supreme court judge who she described as “the soul of social change”.)

Wealth is meant to feel like the magic answer right? But after a certain point it starts not being true

Of the wealth tax Disney says: “I think it should kick in at around $50m [£36m] and up. Something has to say: ‘OK you’re fine. Right now we need to figure out how to help all the people who aren’t fine and your money is going to pay for it.’”

An annual wealth tax of just 2% on those with more than $50m – as proposed by US senator Elizabeth Warren – would raise more than $4tn enough money to overhaul the entire US public education system. Warren amended her plan this month to call for a 3% “Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act” targeting people with more than $1bn to help pay for the economic pain the pandemic has caused. “The ultra-rich and powerful have rigged the rules in their favour so much that the top 0.1% pay a lower effective tax rate than the bottom 99%” Warren said. “And billionaire wealth is 40% higher than before the Covid crisis began.”

Disney says she “loves” Warren and dismisses arguments from those on the right who claim a wealth tax would drive the rich overseas. “It would not prevent anyone from wanting to live in the United States and would not prevent anyone from being wildly more wealthy than anyone ever needs to be.” In her ideal world there would be a cap on personal wealth but even she thinks that is too radical an idea to propose making into law. “I think there is such a thing as too much money” she says. “And I think that’s a billion. In fact I don’t really know how you couldn’t figure out how to live a very nice life on $999m. So anything over a billion feels to me like a mistake.” In Disney’s fantasy universe the world’s billionaires – there are now 2189 according to a report by Swiss investment bank UBS – would be declared “the winners of capitalism” but would not be able to make any more money.

The UBS study shows that billionaires (the top 0.000028%) “did extremely well” during the coronavirus pandemic growing their fortunes to a record high of $10.2tn (£7.8tn) more than three times the annual economic output of the UK. Elon Musk the maverick co-founder of electric car company Tesla who was the 35th richest in the world pre-Covid is now the second-richest person ever to have lived behind Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. Both men have fortunes of more than $180bn each – roughly twice the GDP of Kenya.

Disney realised she had too much money when she was studying first at Yale University and then for a PhD in English literature at New York’s Columbia University in the early 1980s. “Inheriting a fortune can fuck you up it really can” she says. “I spent my 20s and 30s trying to dig out from under the anxiety and guilt that came with it. People don’t like it when wealthy people talk about this because wealth is meant to feel like the magic answer to every question right? ‘If only I had XYZ money everything would be all right’ – and that is true for poor people.

“But after a certain point it starts not being true.” She falters slightly searching for the right words. “Money becomes its own preoccupation. I think of it as like a really fancy dog that you have to constantly be brushing. And so you get sucked into it. From the time I was 21 years old I spent far too much time with accountants lawyers and estate attorneys talking about and thinking about my money: where it was why it was there did it need to change and what the tax implications would be.”

Disney talks about how growing up she and her siblings (she has two brothers and a sister) never had to queue for anything. “You know if you never have to stand in line it makes you act differently” she says. “And you begin to wonder about everything. Are people more interested in what you have to say because of what you have? Are they letting you think you’re funnier than you really are? Having no one who will tell you the truth about yourself… I mean that really corrodes.”

It was around this time that Disney’s family morphed from very rich to uber-rich. Michael Eisner had taken over as chief executive of the Disney company which had been struggling for years after the deaths of Walt and Roy Oliver Disney in 1966 and 1971 respectively. Eisner turned its fortunes around by revitalising its animation division and buying up Marvel Pixar and Lucasfilm. Soon Disney was producing critically acclaimed and money-spinning films: Beauty And The Beast (the first animated film to be nominated for a best picture Oscar) and The Lion King. Disney’s share price soared throwing off huge dividends to Abigail’s father Roy Edward Disney a major shareholder. In 1994 alone Eisner was paid a record-breaking $203m.

Suddenly Abigail says her family changed. Her dad bought a private plane: not a small jet but a Boeing 737 with queen-size beds and an onboard shower. She rebelled by refusing to get on the plane and by starting to give her money away.

Disney lives most of the time in New York with her husband Pierre Hauser. They met at Yale and were married at Columbia University’s St Paul’s Chapel. Their joint charity the Daphne Foundation aims to end poverty in the city. A nameplate on Disney’s desk reads: “Feminist AF”. She also runs the documentary company Fork Films producing or providing funding for films about issues she believes in such as Pray The Devil Back To Hell about a female-led peace movement in Liberia; and Crip Camp about a summer camp for people with disabilities recently nominated for an Oscar. “I’m sort of like a deliberately terrible businesswoman” she says explaining that her loss-making projects are a way of giving money to creative people who need it.

If you’re making more than £200000 a year you should be paying more tax. It is not going to make you poor is it?

As she has grown more confident Disney has begun speaking up against pay inequality at the Walt Disney Company describing then-chief executive Bob Iger’s $65m paycheque in 2018 as “insane”. “If your CEO salary is 700 600 500 times your median workers’ pay there is nobody on earth – Jesus Christ himself isn’t worth 500 times his median workers’ pay” she said at the time. Iger now Disney’s executive chairman actually earned 1424 times the median Disney worker’s pay that year – almost triple Abigail’s guesstimate. He defended it as “a one-time grant” for his role in overseeing Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox and at a Vanity Fair event in 2019 acknowledged that the country needed to address inequality. “I think we have to figure out if there’s a tax plan that makes sense that transfers more wealth from a small set of individuals to a larger set of individuals” he said.

The Walt Disney Company’s lowest-paid staff began seeking Disney out as their potential saviour. One worker whose job was to dress up as Cinderella in the “magic happens” parades wrote that she couldn’t afford to pay her rent and was sleeping in her car. “It kills me” Disney says “because as a child I went there with my grandfather. Now I may have rose-tinted glasses when looking back but there was an almost reverence for him and he had such a rapport with the people who worked there. He would be horrified.” Disney says unskilled labourers like many of the thousands working at Disneyland and Disney World are effectively “endless unnamed interchangeable parts that can be replaced at any time”.

Her activism enraged her parents who worshipped at the shrine of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher’s neoliberal capitalism. Both her parents were alcoholics: Roy Edward died in 2009 and her mother Patricia in 2012. “My parents were quite conservative and so we were in conflict a lot” she says. “I have a brother and a sister who are very very supportive and are right there with me.”

Though Disney doesn’t fly by private jet she still leads a life of unquestioned luxury with a taste for expensive wines at exclusive restaurants (when they’re open) and designer shoes. She says her biggest extravagance is her home in Ireland a 15th-century castle that sleeps 26 people. Soon after we speak Disney Hauser and their dogs embark on a new adventure: driving across the US in a van joining the craze that has exploded in popularity during the pandemic. “Haven’t left the city yet but we are already sacked out and happy. #vanlife” she wrote on Instagram alongside a picture of her and Hauser glued to their phones in the back of the van.

The Patriotic Millionaires group has no membership card or secret handshake but members need assets of at least $5m or an annual income in excess of $1m to join. Founder Erica Payne a political strategist who worked on Bill Clinton’s inaugural committee has said that as well as being rich and progressive the members have another thing in common: they all “hate the name”.

“Every time we have a gathering we have 30 minutes set aside so they can bitch about it” she said last year. “And then at the conclusion of the 30 minutes I tell them we’re not going to change the name.” It was designed to attract attention particularly from those on the right in the US: “You’re patriotic and you’re a millionaire.”

Six British millionaires have so far signed up to the UK chapter demanding that the government urgently address inequality here. They describe “shocking” Office for National Statistics data showing that the richest 1% of Britons hold almost a quarter of the nation’s wealth at a time when poverty is rising. London recently overtook New York as home to the highest concentration of dollar millionaires in the world: about 875000 people or one in 10 while 2.5 million Londoners are classified as living in poverty.

The British members set out their purpose in July last year in an open letter under the banner Millionaires for Humanity with other signatories including the screenwriter and director Richard Curtis: “No we are not the ones caring for the sick in intensive care wards. We are not driving the ambulances that will bring the ill to hospitals. We are not restocking grocery store shelves or delivering food door to door. But we do have money lots of it. Money that is desperately needed now and will continue to be needed in the years ahead as our world recovers from this crisis.”

Among them is Gemma McGough 40 from Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire who made millions from the sale of a startup exploiting wireless technology. When I speak to her over video in her home office she is juggling running a new company with home-schooling three children.

McGough wants the government to tax her – and other high earners – at a rate as high as 75% to help the country’s pandemic-ravaged public finances. “The economy is so damaged from Covid I am happy to pay my share” she says. “If you’re making more than £150000 or £200000 a year you should be paying more. If you’re earning £200000 paying a higher rate of tax on earnings above that is not going to make you poor is it?”

Currently the highest tax rate in the UK is 45% on earnings above £150000. But many of the highest earners also use complex schemes to legally reduce the amount they pay. The chancellor Rishi Sunak used the budget to raise billions of pounds by freezing tax thresholds and thus dragging 1.3 million middle-income earners into higher tax brackets angering backbench MPs. Instead the group argues more should be taken from the super-rich. McGough and the other British Patriotic Millionaires would also like to see a big increase in inheritance tax and capital gains tax plus a new wealth tax.

Three prominent economists recently recommended the introduction of a one-off tax on anyone with more than £500000 in assets including property. The Wealth Tax Commission suggests a 1% tax on those individuals for five years could raise £260bn – enough to fund the NHS for a year. Such taxes are beginning to be introduced in Argentina Bolivia and Morocco to help pay for the recovery. In Norway about 500000 people pay an 0.85% charge on their assets above the value of about £125000. The prospect of such a tax in the UK is rich people’s second-biggest fear after the virus according to Knight Frank’s wealth report. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Sunak have both dismissed the suggestion.

McGough says she finds it hard to understand wealthy people fighting not to pay more tax. “It is an issue of morality: why are we comfortable with the wealthy continuing to get wealthier? If we allow it to go on ultimately there will be civil unrest” she says.

McGough whose mother was a cleaner and father a painter-decorator grew up poor: her family did not have a car until she was 10 and there was no central heating. She shone at school but her parents asked her to get a job to help with the rent rather than go to university. By chance her first job at 16 was in the soon-to-be booming world of radio frequency technologies. “It just really suited me” she says. “I went on to start a business doing it.” Back then her “motivator was to make money” because she desperately wanted to go travelling. Her first big trip was in an overland truck from Victoria Falls on the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia to South Africa.

McGough was so busy building her company which certified new RF technology products that she didn’t get a chance to think about how much money she was making – until advisers kept offering to help her lower her tax bill with creative accounting. “It is quite a toxic environment but you’re busy. It’s only afterwards that you realise it always seemed wrong. There should be pride in being a higher-rate taxpayer. Now my politics are very leftward leaning.”

She says rich people who are known to avoid tax should be seen as “social pariahs … a national disgrace not heroes”. Some of the wealthiest Britons are no longer based in the UK which allows them to make significant tax savings. Sir James Ratcliffe the UK’s richest person and a high-profile Brexiter last year quit Britain for tax-free Monaco. It has been estimated that the move will ultimately save him £4bn in tax payments. Other rich Britons who have moved to Monaco include the former Topshop boss Sir Philip Green and his wife Tina; the property billionaires Simon and David Reuben; John Hargreaves the founder and chairman of Matalan; and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton. In 2019 John Caudwell the billionaire founder of Phones4u vowed to join them in Monaco if Labour was elected and raised taxes.

Like Disney McGough says her parents “struggle” with her views. “They were very excited that I became such a success and very proud of that” she says. “But after I sold the business and became much more socialist they found it hard to understand the shift. When you are poorer the pursuit of money is important and it was seen that I had won the game of life. “Yes you have won but there are still people living on the streets people living in circumstances you can’t imagine across the world” she says. “You can’t consider yourself a winner when losing has such terrible outcomes.” McGough says her parents are slowly coming round. “They are happy that I’m doing what I want but they do find it odd.”

Gary Stevenson 34 is another member of the UK branch of Patriotic Millionaires. He made his first million when he was 24 betting on the outcome of Greece’s financial crisis in 2011. He was a senior economist at Citibank and placed a series of bets that would pay out if global inequality increased. The bets made him he claims the most profitable Citibank trader in the world that year earning it $35m. He made the same bet on yawning inequality in 2012: again it paid out.

“It put me in a weird space” he says wearing a grey hoodie in his minimalist kitchen in Limehouse close to the heart of the City of London. “I was making loads of money from the fact that the world economy is going to be fucked for ever. I rolled it around in my head for a year or two before deciding I had to quit.”

Stevenson says the decision was hard because making a lot of money had been all he wanted to do. “I was quite poor growing up – we lived in a small terrace house by the railway line in Ilford and as a family we couldn’t afford for me to go on school trips and stuff. You get judged on how much money you have so I went out and made it a lot of it.”

After he quit banking Stevenson went on to study economics at the University of Oxford to learn more about what could be done to redress global inequality. He didn’t find the answer among the spires. “It’s just a bunch of posh people in caps worried about continuing to be rich” he says. “Change isn’t going to come from there.” Stevenson believes increasing tax on the wealthy is the only answer. “The problem is that rich people save most of their income so it does not trickle back into the economy. Whereas ordinary people spend most of their income. Companies are only going to expand if they are spending.

I want to live in a world where everyone can help themselves and can get those high-paying jobs like I had

“Tax is the most important thing it’s the only way that poorer people can have a chance of catching up” he says. “I’m not talking about huge taxes on high earners like doctors or lawyers I’m talking about going after the families who have been keeping their money for ever. These families have hundreds of millions of pounds and money makes money so it’s just going up and up. I was paying 45% tax on my earnings but the Duke of Westminster was paying next to nothing on his billions of inheritance.” The heirs of the sixth Duke of Westminster paid no inheritance tax on the bulk of his £8.3bn family fortune after his death in 2016. His son Hugh Grosvenor 30 inherited the title and became one of the world’s richest people as the major shareholder of global property company Grosvenor Estates which owns swathes of properties in the West End Mayfair and Belgravia in London as well as estates in Cheshire Lancashire and Scotland.

Stevenson dismisses arguments that the Patriotic Millionaires could follow the example of people such as Bill Gates or MacKenzie Scott former wife of Jeff Bezos who gave away almost $6bn last year donating through philanthropy rather than higher taxes. He admits he could help his friends from comprehensive school back in Ilford who are working as teachers fashion designers and actors. But he says “helping them individually isn’t enough. I want to live in a world where everyone can help themselves. Where people from poor backgrounds can get those high-paying jobs like I had.”

Stevenson won’t say how much money he has now only that he has “enough to retire and not work again”. He hasn’t given much to charity but says he is using his money to push for economic change. The only way to do this he says will be if the majority of people are told how badly the decks are stacked against them “and they get really fucking angry about it. People don’t realise how rich the rich are and that the rich don’t pay much tax” he says. “People think I’m a billionaire people think I’m like Jay-Z. But I’ve got nothing compared to the truly rich.”

For her part Abigail Disney thinks low-paid workers are already very angry and that change will only come if the rich turn on each other. “My grandfather would never have paid himself over 1000 times what his median worker was being paid” she says. “There were no laws against him doing it it was just not an acceptable thing to do. He certainly wouldn’t have been put on the cover of magazines and told he was a genius.” Iger has graced the cover of Fortune and Time magazine. “This is who we are worshipping now” Disney says. “The norms have shifted and the country will follow the tone set by business – that’s always been the way in American life.”

Disney says more rich and powerful people are joining the movement in spirit if not always formally signing up. “People want to take society back to a fairer time before it’s too late” she says. “But the question is will they have the courage to go up against their own class? That’s the hardest thing in the world to do – for a liberal to criticise liberals for a businessman to criticise businessmen. I know from personal experience; I have made myself very unattractive to the wealthy. But we need them to start calling each other out.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA0LTA0L2Rvbi10LWxldC1jaGluYS1taW50LXRoZS1kaWdpdGFsLWN1cnJlbmN5LW9mLXRoZS1mdXR1cmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | Don't Let China Mint the Money of the Future,"What is the money of the future?

The technology enables an unprecedented opportunity for managing the issuance of currencies.

There is a distinction between digital currencies in the broad sense and cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technology. Most money is already digital — it exists only as entries in computer databases. Central banks have different measures and controls for the amount of physical cash in circulation versus the amount of money held in bank accounts and elsewhere.

Most central banks have already regulated instant payment systems where consumers and businesses can use mobile handsets to make digital payments. Both mobile network operators and the banking system are driving this huge business. In China the world’s largest mobile payment market the value of transactions reached 347 trillion RMB (US$53.04 trillion) in 2019 — almost four times the country’s GDP. The total value of transactions skyrocketed in 2020 due to the pandemic.

As digital technologies develop and evolve central banks in Asia are grasping the opportunities.

Thailand has been one of the leaders in digital payments with a focus on immediate interbank transfers between individuals and at point of sale using QR codes mobile and account numbers. The Bank of Thailand supported the ‘PromptPay’ initiative in 2017 and encouraged Thai banks to realise large cost savings from the reduction of cash use. Around 70 per cent of Thai bank account holders signed up to PromptPay which is also used by small retailers who no longer need to handle cash.

Singapore has long been a leader in instant payments and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was one of the first Asian central banks to conduct detailed technical studies on domestic cryptocurrencies. ‘Project Ubin’ explored domestic and cross-border clearing and settlement.

With its huge population and low use of banks and cards China has been pushing digital instant payment and QR scanning for years. AliPay and WeChat Pay each claim almost 1 billion active users of their bank account-based instant transfer systems — introducing some systemic risk if either of them failed.

But what about a central bank digital currency or a central bank cryptocurrency? Central bank digital currency can increase competition and reduce risk in mobile payments speed up digitalisation to reduce cash costs and reduce money laundering via ‘controllable anonymity’.

Despite numerous rumours the intention to launch Singapore’s central bank digital currency is yet to be officially announced. Meanwhile both China and Cambodia have launched cryptocurrencies seeking greater financial inclusion but on vastly different scales.

The National Bank of Cambodia launched Bakong in October 2020. Available to retail customers this peer-to-peer funds transfer service supports transactions in Cambodian riel or US dollar. Bakong has reportedly brought onboard almost a third of the Cambodian population (5 out of 17 million). The low barriers to entry boosted financial inclusion which could have a real impact on economic activity as observed in other parts of the world.

Meanwhile since starting the project in 2014 the People’s Bank of China has moved rapidly towards launching the world’s first major sovereign digital currency — the digital yuan. This should be an easy sell to consumers used to instant digital cash enabling the government to fine-tune domestic monetary policy by directly controlling the amount of non-cash funds available to the economy. There are already real-world digital yuan operations in major cities including Shenzhen Chengdu and Suzhou where customers obtain digital yuan via banks.

But the rest of Asia is lagging.

Indian parliament is expected to vote soon on cryptocurrency regulation perhaps banning all private cryptocurrencies and creating a legitimate framework for a Reserve Bank of India digital currency. The Philippines — the first country in Asia to embrace mobile payment with Smart Money in 2001 — has not capitalised on its early lead. Larger ASEAN countries such as Indonesia are not at the forefront. The Jakarta Post recently claimed that Indonesia is in ‘no hurry over digital currency’.

While over 80 per cent of central banks around the world have experimented with cryptocurrencies China is leading the world in central bank digital currency deployment along with Cambodia while Singapore has cautiously positioned itself to be a major player using a different approach. More Asian central banks may find themselves under pressure to issue digital currencies not least because of their potential to become reserve currencies in international trade.

Countries that have been heavily investing in digital payment technologies and central bank digital currency development will soon reap the benefits. They are likely to see growth in economic activity driven by practical ease-of-use and savings of time cost and effort. Other countries need to accelerate their investment and learn from China and Singapore else risk being left in the monetary dark ages.

The future of money is here and governments need to embrace it.

If you regularly send and receive international payments you probably know how expensive these cross-border transactions can get. This is mainly due to several middle parties involved in processing these transactions. Sometimes as many as five institutions.

This setup not only affects the cost of the transactions it also increases the transaction duration. Expectedly the more institutions involved in processing a payment the longer it will take and the costlier it will get.

There is an obvious way to solve the two challenges – reduce the number of intermediaries involved in a transaction and dispense with arbitrary costs added as margin on top of exchange rates.

This article will focus on a financial technology (fintech) company that has successfully implemented the two solutions. Wise (which recently rebranded from Transferwise) has managed to offer superfast international money transfers at a fraction of its competitors’ cost.

History of Wise

Wise was initially launched as TransferWise back in 2011. The two Estonian co-founders Kristo Käärmann and Taavet Hinrikus were looking for a cheaper way to transfer money between their bank accounts. Both lived and worked in the UK. Taavet an employee of Skype at the time was paid in Euros while Kristo was paid in Pounds by Deloitte.

Interestingly Taavet needed to exchange his Euros for Pounds and Kristo needed Euros instead of Pounds. To solve their small problem they decided to swap the funds at market rates. Taavet would deposit the calculated Euro amount into Kristo’s Estonia bank account and Kristo would send his GBP funds to Taavet’s UK account.

The idea was simple but it was the seed of their business venture that would later be TransferWise. The company still operates with this premise to this day.

It has opened multiple accounts in several countries. When two parties need to transfer funds the sender deposits them into their local Wise bank account. Wise then calculates the equivalent sum in the recipient’s local currency using mid-market rates. Then Wise will deposit the calculated sum into the recipient’s bank account through the Wise bank account present in the recipient’s country.

Both transactions qualify as “local” transfers making them cheaper and fast. No money crosses borders and intermediaries are kept to a minimum. Additionally as mentioned above Wise keeps the currency conversion costs low by applying a mid-market conversion rate.

Since its launch in 2011 Wise has expanded services to cater to the needs of its growing customer base. These services include a business account a debit card and a multi-currency account supporting more than 50 currencies in over 150 countries.

Wise Features and Services

At its core Wise is a money transmitting service provider. It offers two main products: a multi-currency account and funds transfer both locally and internationally. The former is free while the latter accounts for 100% of the revenues. The revenues are also split between foreign exchange fees and transaction processing fees.

The features discussed in this section only serve to complement the two main services offered by Wise.

With Wise customers can send money across borders in more than 66 countries. The process is simple – specify the amount of funds to send and the service will calculate the costs upfront. The fees are transparent and minimal.

Next provide the recipient’s details including their name address and bank account details. You can then authorize the transfer allowing Wise to withdraw funds from your bank account connected to it or a debit/credit card to facilitate the transfer.

Wise will provide estimates on the time frame for sending the funds. It breaks down the process into the respective stages and estimates each step. It also shows a graphic of the flow of the funds on your account. The same information is sent to the recipient’s account (if they are Wise customers otherwise a link is sent to their email for tracking the transfer).

However this process only applies to small and medium sums of money. There is the possibility of sending large amounts. In this case Wise uses more stringent ID and transaction verification measures to process the transaction as provided for by law. It is an attempt to curb money laundering. Therefore to send large amounts you will need extra verification documents as requested by the service provider.

#2 Multi-currency account

Wise’s multi-currency account (formerly called borderless account) allows users to hold and transact in multiple currencies including crypto. Currently Wise supports ten currencies with virtual bank account details allowing customers to receive funds in these specific currencies.

Another 56 currencies are also supported but these only allow for conversions and withdrawals to respective local bank accounts. This means that receipts are only supported in 10 currencies but conversions can be done in any supported currency on all Wise accounts.

Here’s the list of the ten currencies that support receipts through unique bank account details:

British pound Australian dollar US dollar Canadian dollar Euro Hungarian forint New Zealand dollar Turkish lira Singapore dollar Romanian lei

For a complete list of all supported currencies and countries refer to this page.

Watch the video: The Wise borderless account – How it works

With the TransferWise Borderless account you can hold money in 40+ different currencies and get personal banking details for the 10 currencies listed above. The account comes with a connected debit card which lets you spend all over the world without extra fees.

Despite its impressive multi-currency support it’s important to differentiate a Wise account from a bank account. They are not the same and as we mentioned earlier Wise is only a money-transmitting service.

Therefore with a Wise account you miss out on banking facilities such as overdraft loan and interest-earning savings. You can keep as much money in your Wise account for free and for as long as you want but it won’t earn any interest.

#3 Wise Business account

The Wise Business account is a multi-currency account designed specifically for corporate clients. Just like the retail account Wise Business also offers features such as access to multi-currency bank accounts able to receive funds in up to 8 major currencies.

Customers can also process invoices make payments to more than 70 countries request and manage multiple debit cards and more conveniently manage their business’ funds using Wise’s mobile application.

Extra features necessary for modern-day business customers such as API integrations mass payouts and access through the Wise mobile apps are also included. It however doesn’t offer an online payment solution such as you would find with a PayPal or Revolut Business account.

Here’s a detailed look at the extra features available to the Wise Business account holders:

API integrations – an API (application programming interface) is a way for customers to integrate their applications to work with another application. In this case a Wise business customer can use the Wise API to connect their applications and interact with the Wise business account without logging in. With a Wise API businesses can automate receipts and payments such as invoice payments payroll and standing order executions. They can also track exchange rates and make automatic conversions at favorable rates.

Mass payouts – a common business need in which customers have to send multiple payments to their teams of freelancers or contractors investors and suppliers. Most payment processors such as PayPal offer similar services but with Wise the costs are much cheaper and the process faster. Wise calls it the batch payments tool. It offers a similar experience to sending a single payment with a multi-currency account and similar features such as a payment tracker and delivery estimator.

Banking integrations – Wise may not be a bank but it does offer a complimentary service to banks which often transfer funds across borders. The business claims savings of up to 8x the regular international money transfer costs. This service supports payments to at least 80 countries that use the more than 50 currencies supported. This can be easily achieved using the API integrations and bank customers do not have to interact with Wise to achieve their goals.

The Wise Business account is not just a payments platform. Businesses also have to process receipts. The account allows for eight different virtual bank accounts that support international receipts with eight different currencies. This is unlike the multi-currency account which supports ten. The two that are not supported with the Business account are the Canadian dollar and the Turkish Lira.

With a Business account you can also hold and convert between 56 currencies.

#4 Wise International Business Debit Card

The Wise debit card is available to both retail and business customers. With the Wise Business account it’s possible to order multiple debit cards for several employees.

Wise’s debit card.

To use Wise’s debit card (provided by MasterCard) you need to finance your Wise account. It takes the money out of respective balances. For instance if the expense is in US dollars the card will use the US Dollar balance for the payment.

If the US Dollar balance is insufficient to fund the payment the card automatically uses another currency balance with the most favorable exchange rate against the US dollar. The system automatically exchanges this currency into the USD balance before funding the expense.

The Wise debit card offers several convenient features such as card management using the Wise App. You can quickly authorize payments track expenses freeze and unfreeze them whenever necessary. For cards associated with a business account extra features such as setting spending limits tracking business expenses and controlling payment methods are also enabled.

Watch the video: How does the Wise debit card work

Video explains how does the Wise debit card work.

Generally most MasterCard-provided debit cards are accepted worldwide by millions of merchants and ATMs. However the Wise debit card has geographical limitations for several countries and currencies.

Customers can only use the card in countries using the currencies supported on the multi-currency and business accounts. This is about 66 currencies used across approximately 150 countries. Check out this page for the coverage limitations of your Wise debit card.

#5 Wise Mobile App

The Wise mobile app is an extension of the Wise web interface allowing users to interact with their accounts on the go. Available on the Google Play Store for Android devices and Apple’s App Store for iOS devices.

Is Wise Safe? Compliance & Security

When talking about compliance and security regulations come into focus. Laws are always variable and dependent on the entity and the local authorities. Wise is registered and headquartered in the United Kingdom as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI). It is regulated under the EMI laws as specified by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

In all other markets that it operates it adheres to local regulations. For instance in the United States it’s regulated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency; in Singapore by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS); in Australia by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA); and in Belgium by the National Bank of Belgium (NBB).

Wise is a fully regulated entity and despite the difference in policies across all its markets the company has strived to comply with every applicable law.

In terms of safety Wise takes a different approach to banks. Given that it is not a bank in the first place it doesn’t have to protect client funds through financial protection schemes. Instead it opts to safeguard customer funds. Safeguarding entails segregating between customer and business operating funds. This way the customer funds are protected against company operation risks.

Wise stores the customer funds in established institutions in respective countries in which it maintains bank accounts. For example in the US it uses JP Morgan Chase; in the UK it uses Barclays; Deutsche bank in Germany and so on. Since these deposit locations are financial institutions they must use financial protection schemes to protect their customers’ funds. This is double protection for Wise.

Finally Wise complies with the EU-specific data protection and privacy regulations commonly referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These regulations prescribe how institutions collect and process customers’ personally identifiable information (PII).

Wise.com takes extra steps to offer related products to its customers at no additional cost. This shows the level of commitment the company is taking to ensure that their customers’ needs are met. Here are the extra services they provide to their clients:

How to Open a Wise Account

Step 1. Signup for a Wise account

Creating an account with Wise is simple and straightforward. Go on the Wise homepage here on the top-right is the ‘Register’ button. Clicking on it will bring you to this dialog box.

You’ll notice two options to choose from on the signup page that determine whether you open a personal (consumer) account or a business account. We will focus on the personal account in this guide. The two-minute video below explains how to open an account with Wise. All you need to have to start is one form of ID and your phone or laptop camera.

Watch the video: How to create and use it – easy guide

Stephanie from our Wise customer support team will walk you through it step by step.

Step 2. Account verification

When it comes to verification the two accounts will require different documents. Once you fill in the signup form details Wise will send you a verification email and code to your email account and phone respectively. Make sure to use an active phone number.

Wise adheres to global KYC regulations and will require various proofs of your identity as part of the verification process.

For a personal account

Here’s what you will need to verify your personal account:

ID document – there are three documents accepted for identity verification. These are a national identity card a valid international passport or a valid driver’s license.

Proof of address document – this has to match your ID name. Documents accepted for address verification include utility bills bank statements local government-issued tax documents vehicle registration details or license photo (if your government includes your address on the license.)

For a business account

Business accounts are a bit more complicated and for that reason require more documents to verify the business. Some documents you’ll need to verify your business account include:

Business registration documents showing the company’s location line of business online presence (website and social media pages if available) company owners and directors together with their contact details.

Proof of directorship of the applicant. If you’re not the director you’ll need to prove your legal capacity to open a business account on behalf of the company. This stage is similar to opening a personal account and all the documents listed above may be requested here.

Verification takes 1-2 business days for the personal account and 2-3 days for the business account. It’s typically shorter if the documents are in order but these are the expected timelines.

Step 3. Account activation

To activate your Wise account you’ll need to deposit some initial funds into your account. That amount is about $20 or £16 currently. This applies to both personal and business accounts.

For the business account however it will be a non-refundable one-time fee. But for the personal account these are your funds you are depositing which you’ll be able to send or spend once they are received in your account. According to Wise these initial funds are used to create unique bank account details for the various currencies through which you can receive funds.

Step 4. Send and Receive Money

After successfully creating your account you’ll obviously want to send or receive funds. Sending is straightforward. There is a conspicuous green button on the top left corner just below the Wise logo after logging in. Click the button to start the transfer setup process.

Watch the video: How to send and receive money abroad with Wise

This video shows how to send and receive money abroad with Wise.

When sending in the above field you have the option to select the amount to send in GBP or the exact amount you would like the recipient to receive. If you input one the other amount automatically adjusts with transfer costs included.

Know your wire’s cost before you send money.

In the ‘Amount’ screen you can choose between two options – to send between two currencies i.e. an international transfer or to send the same currency. The former option will be a little more expensive due to the currency conversion costs involved.

In the screen above you’ll also notice that Wise shows the fees involved in the transfer as well as an estimate of the time it will take to send the funds. It also highlights the amount of savings you will receive by opting to transact through Wise over its main competitors. The exchange rate shown is the mid-market rate locked for the stated hours meaning that this is the rate at which the funds will be exchanged if the transaction is processed within that provided timeline.

You can provide the recipient’s email address in the recipient details section if you lack the banking details. Wise will then send the receiver an email asking for their bank details before releasing the funds. If you happen to have the details input them in and proceed to review the transaction.

At the review step you have the option to add a reference ID for your recipient to track the transaction easily. Authorize the transfer and you are done.

Wise will provide a timeline animation showing the transfer’s progression and the estimated time to reach your target. The exact details are shared with your recipient through email.

Sending a large amount of money is a little more complicated. You will need extra documents to verify your identity and the origin of the funds. This could be for instance a title document and sale agreements for a property sale matching the buyer details to the person sending the funds. Various transactions will require different proof documents but generally any legal documents used during the legal transfer of value may be requested.

Wise Fees

Back in March the team announced it would be opening the ballpark at 100% capacity with safety and health protocols in place

The Rangers' new home opened in 2020 but fans were not allowed to attend regular season games during the abbreviated season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A limited amount of fans however were able to attend the NLCS and World Series games at the ballpark.

Now the team is looking forward to welcoming fans at home games this season starting with the April 5 opener against the Toronto Blue Jays.

The Rangers posted a Twitter thread of what attendees need to know about the home opener before the 3:05 p.m. first pitch.

Inside Globe Life Field fans will be required to wear masks and all concession and vendors have instituted “contactless payment.” All of it is part of a larger effort to make attending the game as safe as possible.

Why the Rangers are opening doors to full capacity Monday despite risks,"ARLINGTON — Rangers ownership built Globe Life Field to be a national showcase to help put the team on center stage in baseball and the sports world. The ballpark will become that showcase Monday but probably not under the circumstances the owners intended.

After a year of the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the American way of life the Rangers’ decision to open their stadium to 100% of capacity makes them the test case for the next steps in the return to normalcy.

They are attempting to be the first American pro sports team to allow a full house. If the 40518-seat stadium sells out it is expected to be the largest publicly documented attendance at an event since the virus shuttered the country in March of last year. There were about 1000 tickets left as of Saturday.

All eyes will be on the stadium though not necessarily on the action on the field between the Rangers and Toronto.

Can the game be pulled off safely without becoming a superspreader event among fans or players whose families may be among the crowd?

Or even as vaccination rates go up is it too early and merely a risky money grab for a team without much on-field optimism?

After a sharp decline COVID-19 cases in the U.S. have started to climb again as more contagious variants spread. The increase prompted the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Rochelle Walensky last week to say she had feelings of “impending doom” about another surge. She urged the public to “please hold on a little while longer” and continue to follow public health guidelines.

COVID-19 cases have ticked up in Dallas County as well but they remain on the decline in Tarrant County according to CDC data. Globe Life Field is in Tarrant County.

“We know there is going to be a lot of attention on us” said Rob Matwick the Rangers’ executive vice president of business operations.

The move has the backing of Gov. Greg Abbott who opened Texas to 100% without restrictions last month and of a large number of fans. Abbott is expected to be at Globe Life Field on Monday and to take part in the festivities.

And then there are local public health experts the CDC’s social-distancing recommendations and well the president of the United States.

“That’s a decision they made” President Joe Biden said in an ESPN interview Wednesday. “I think it’s a mistake. They should listen to Dr. [Anthony] Fauci the scientists and the experts. But I don’t think it’s responsible.”

Fauci is the nation’s top infectious-disease expert.

“We obviously have no control over either the public health officials or the state of Texas” MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told ESPN on Thursday. “We worked closely with the Rangers and encouraged them to adopt the additional safeguards like masks and the Rangers were extremely cooperative in that regard.”

It was an acknowledgment not an endorsement.

Previous events

The Rangers are moving ahead with the decision based on a unique confluence of conditions.

They have experience hosting numerous events albeit at reduced occupancy since last May that included the World Series and the National Finals Rodeo. They had significant demand for opening day tickets as part of season-ticket packages for their new stadium in 2020 which fans were asked to roll over to 2021 because of the pandemic. They can open the roof and “garage doors” at the ballpark to increase ventilation and the ventilation system already uses highly rated MERV 13 air filters.

They have already moved nearly 450000 fans through the stadium for the earlier events including a crowd of 17587 for a day of college baseball in February. That amounts to 43.4% of the stadium’s capacity though it is unclear if that many people were ever in the building at the same time. Tickets were sold for the day but three games were played over the course of the day.

Rangers officials have prepared.

And they believe this is essentially a one-time event because ticket sales drop sharply after opening day and usually until school is out in the summer.

The Rangers will add several sections featuring socially distanced pod seating after opening day which will slightly reduce capacity. While team officials won’t reveal advance ticket sales they indicated they expected the stadium to be about half full for the games against Toronto that follow on Tuesday and Wednesday.

For the Rangers full occupancy allows them to meet a contract with fans that has sat in limbo for more than a year. With demand for the grand opening of the stadium high before 2020 the Rangers sold lots of mini-ticket plans that included the ability to buy tickets for the opener. When the pandemic forced clubs to shut down to fans the Rangers urged fans to roll their ticket commitments into 2021. Most did with the promise that the home opener was still included. Matwick stressed that the club was working on an individual basis with customers who are still not comfortable coming to the park.

But there is more to it than that. Baseball as an industry claimed losses of more than $2 billion last year. Teams took financial baths resulting in pay and job cuts. The Rangers largely avoided mass job eliminations but employees were among the first to take a pay cut. There are finances to recoup.

And while it may make more sense for other teams to simply keep increasing occupancy as the year goes on the Rangers stand to host their biggest crowds early. Opening day is almost always a guaranteed sellout. The novelty of the stadium may keep attendance above 20000 per game early in the season.

Also the highest-profile opponents visit early. San Diego the youngest most exciting team in the majors is here next weekend. The Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees with the largest fan bases visit in late April and May. If there is money to be made it’s early.

As the season progresses and the team as expected falls off there will be little demand. The schedule is also particularly unattractive for big crowds. The Rangers are not at home on Memorial Day July Fourth or Labor Day all big baseball days.

With a rebuilding team which is coming off four consecutive losing seasons and projected to have a franchise-worst fifth consecutive loser interest wanes quickly.

‘Voluntary compliance’

Colorado’s Coors Field currently has the second-largest allowed attendance in MLB at 21470 which is 42.6% of its capacity. Houston is allowing up to 50% (about 20600). Most other stadiums are between 20% and 33% but are open to allowing larger crowds as local threat levels drop.

The Rangers will also go above the State of Texas’ recommended precautions mandating that fans wear masks except when actively eating and drinking. Fans who don’t comply will be warned first and then subject to ejection.

“Based on our experience at past events we expect there to be good cooperation and adherence” Matwick said. “Our guest services staff is well-trained. We always seek voluntary compliance when a rule is not being followed and that’s almost always what happens.”

To fully enforce such a rule though forces a lot of seasonal employees many of whom are retired to make judgment calls. A fan has a beer in his hand — who doesn’t at a baseball game? Is that actively drinking?

TV shots from the Rangers’ exhibition games Monday and Tuesday against Milwaukee which drew a total of 23770 fans showed plenty of people with food in the vicinity but unmasked.

“It is not a game unless we are eating and drinking at that game” said Erin Carlson director of graduate public health programs at the University of Texas at Arlington and a lifelong Rangers fan. “So to put a mask requirement in place for a stadium is a perfectly noble intention. But the reality of it is that fans will not be wearing masks at the stadium because the stadium experience involves eating and drinking throughout the game. So we’ll be unmasked and seated with inches of distance between us and the next person while we are yelling and singing.

“That’s a pretty high-risk activity I would say.”

The Rangers say that except when fans are in the seating bowl on opening day they will meet the CDC’s recommended 6-foot social distancing recommendation. That includes ingress and egress concessions (all cashless) and lines for restrooms. There will be no standing-room tickets sold for opening day and fans will not be allowed to congregate in the many areas designed for just that in the new stadium.

“We are also adhering to the MLB’s health and safety protocols” Matwick said “which leave the number of fans permitted to state or local guidance.”

Those protocols are not strict enough according to some medical experts.

The Texas Medical Association has deemed going to a sports stadium among the riskiest activities during the pandemic along with going to a bar and attending a religious service with 500 or more people.

The CDC says people attending a game should remain 6 feet away from those outside their households and wear masks at all times. But at full capacity stadium seating does not allow for that much separation.

“It’s concerning because that is not in accordance with current public health guidelines for stadium reopenings” Carlson said.

“It’s not a get-out-of-jail-free card to be outdoors” Carlson added. “We still have to have some distance because even if we’re outdoors it doesn’t change the fact that we’re going to have droplets coming from our lungs through our mouths and outside. So if you’re in close enough proximity to breathe in those droplets whether you’re indoors or whether you’re outdoors you will be breathing in somebody else’s droplets.”

Masks reduce that risk but Carlson doubts fans will be wearing masks in the stands.

Concerns hardly stop with the possibility that this could turn into a superspreader event for fans.

Outbreak risks

There is a strict set of protocols for MLB players and tiered staff to better isolate them one of which is installing plexiglass plates over dugouts and bullpens to further separate players from fans. But players’ families are now allowed into stadiums. If they aren’t socially distanced it could increase the possibility of a COVID outbreak running through a team’s clubhouse.

Outbreaks within clubhouses played havoc with last year’s early-season schedule. MLB has already postponed the season-opening series between the Washington Nationals and New York Mets because of “contact tracing within the Nationals organization.” Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association announced four positive tests for the week that ended Friday.

It was evidence of how fast things can change. The league had done a superb job of keeping the virus in check through spring training with only 34 positives among 78500 tests (0.04%) since intake testing before spring training.

The issue of players’ families’ safety was raised to MLB through the Players Association.

“I think there are a lot of things going on behind the scenes that the joint committee is working on” Rangers players rep Kyle Gibson said. “I think we’re throwing this all together really quick and I think there’s probably multiple reasons for that. I think that both [MLB and the Players Association] are doing the best thing that they can do. Do I think there’s some logistical things that need to be addressed? One thousand percent. Do I think they’re all going to be addressed right away? Probably not.

“Both sides are working very hard” he added. “Both sides are doing the best they can to make this as safe of a season as possible in certain regards. They’re trying to make it as fun for the fans as possible in all regards. And they’re trying to make sure they keep our families as safe as possible. They are juggling a lot of things.”

Stadium employees will also be required to wear face coverings. Gloves and face shields are available for employees who want them. Vaccinations are encouraged but the Rangers can’t mandate them. Employees who are not comfortable returning to work do not have to club officials said but the officials didn’t indicate whether the employees’ positions would remain open to them.

“If I go to the game that’s a special treat” Carlson said. “That’s a couple of times during the season but those families are at every game. The workers are at every game and that increases your risk.”

Ultimately the risk of opening a stadium at full capacity is unknown because studies have not yet been conducted in those settings said Dr. John Carlo former medical director of Dallas County Health and Human Services.

He suggested fans assess their own personal risk and risk tolerance before attending a game. Can they afford to take several days off from work if they get sick? Do they have underlying conditions that can make symptoms severe or do they live with someone who does? Have they been vaccinated?

“If you have been fully vaccinated and you are concerned only about the risk to yourself then go to the game and enjoy it. Live again” Carlson said. “But if you have others in your life who have not been vaccinated then that’s where we still need to be very vigilant.”

The Texas Rangers are scheduled to make a bold move for their home opener Monday that has some medical experts and President Joe Biden concerned.

Globe Life Field in Arlington will be the first Major League Baseball stadium to reopen at full capacity -- roughly 40000 seats -- since the pandemic began. The move comes a month after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ended the state's mask mandate and asked businesses to reopen fully citing declining COVID-19 cases and vaccination numbers.

In a statement released on March 10 Neil Leibman the team’s president of business operations said the Rangers were encouraged by the governor's orders and were taking measures to ensure fans were safe including requiring masks except for while eating.

Following Monday's home opener the stadium will have sections that allow fans to watch with ""distanced seating.""

“We will continue to monitor developments and implement the necessary public health measures” Leibman said in a statement.

The Houston Astros Texas' other MLB team will only be operating at 50% of Minute Maid Park's roughly 41000 seat capacity for April. The stadium will also require masks for fans when they're not eating.

Dr. Emily Landon an associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago told ABC News last month that baseball and other outdoor sports provide better protection for crowds than indoor arenas since it's harder for air particles to linger.

While she said the decision by MLB teams to reopen their games to fans was safe she warned that the Rangers' full capacity reopening was riskier due to the sheer number of people crowded together.

The country is still seeing thousands of cases a day particularly from the virus variants Landon noted.

""You don’t know who is going to come in with COVID-19"" she told ABC News.

Biden weighed in on the Rangers' plans during an interview with ESPN last week calling the move ""not responsible.""

""They should listen to Dr. [Anthony] Fauci the scientists and the experts. But I think it's not responsible"" the president said.

Biden warned about potential surges citing the jumps in European nations that have reopened and reiterated that vaccinations need to increase before businesses can reopen fully.

""We have to get to the point where enough people have taken the vaccine so we diminish the possibility for it to spread"" he said.

The seven-day average of new daily cases in Texas has decreased from 7693 to 3667 between March 1 and April 1 according to the state's health department. As of Sunday 28% of Texas residents have received one vaccine dose and 16% are fully vaccinated according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Nationally about 32% of adults have received one shot and roughly 18% are fully vaccinated according to the CDC."

The Wall Street behemoth plans to offer the financial product to clients in its private wealth management group that targets high-net-worth individuals families and endowments with at least $25 million to invest according to CNBC.

Mary Rich the newly-named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division says the bank wants to eventually offer a “full spectrum” of investments in BTC and other cryptocurrencies amid rising demand for the emerging asset class.

“We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients and that is something we expect to offer in the near term.”

People familiar with the matter reveal that the bank is now securing the green light from regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the New York Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS).

Rich tells CNBC that their clients are seeking exposure to Bitcoin both as a hedge against inflation amid a turbulent macroeconomic backdrop and as an asset that may be at the forefront of a technological revolution.

The report comes as another banking giant Morgan Stanley reveals in a filing with the SEC that 12 of its mutual funds may indirectly invest in the leading cryptocurrency through cash-settled futures contracts and Grayscale’s Bitcoin trust. Rich says Goldman Sachs is looking to offer similar Bitcoin investment funds.

“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be but I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

But Goldman is also one of the world's largest financiers of the fossil fuel industry and its actual record does not appear to live up to its pro-green rhetoric.

In 2006 for example the same year Al Gore's film ""An Inconvenient Truth"" framed climate change as a ""planetary emergency"" Goldman distinguished itself as an early bird in climate action. It launched the Center for Environmental Markets  partnering with a cohort of academic institutions corporations and NGOs to ""catalyze much-needed capital flows towards environmentally beneficial solutions"" and made the first in a series of promises to scale down its involvement in the fossil fuel industry.

Two years later at the nadir of the Great Recession Goldman began buying into carbon capture  technology that can trap carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it elsewhere often underground. The company also introduced ESG (or environmental social and governance) considerations into its funds and portfolios in order to ""ethicize"" its investment framework — to the extent of course that its bottom line would allow.

Since then Goldman has rolled out a ""sustainability"" fund for climate-inclined impact investors and pledged to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in ""sustainable finance projects."" It is also constantly revising its Environmental Policy Framework and produces sweeping sustainability reports on an annual basis. Goldman Sachs in other words has virtue-signaled in just about every form of corporate theater imaginable when it comes to environmentalism.

But even as overwhelming evidence continues to demonstrate that fossil fuel companies contribute to the vast majority of global emissions Goldman has done very little to jettison fossil fuels in any material way.

According to Goldman's filings with the SEC in every year since 2016 roughly 10 to 15 percent of Goldman's loans and lending commitments have been in what it calls ""Natural Resources and Utilities"" which a company representative told Salon reflects the energy sector. Last year Goldman Sachs had the highest loan exposure to oil and gas of any major investment bank with 11.2 percent of its total loans in the sector. Salon asked for a comprehensive list of the bank's holdings but a representative declined.

Goldman also routinely rates oil and gas extraction companies favorably encouraging its clients to rally behind non-renewable energy despite its own rhetoric about the environmental ills of the sector. Last July for example Goldman put seven big oil and gas companies on its ""Conviction Buy List"" a collection of stocks the bank expects to outperform the market. In December of last year Goldman upgraded ExxonMobil to a ""buy"" rating for the first time since 2016 and since then the oil giant's stock has risen from about $38 to just under $60 per share. Most recently in February the bank's analysts touted the ""50 percent upside potential"" over the next year of several European Big Oil stocks including Galp BP Total and Repsol.

The unavoidable conclusion is that Goldman Sachs both in terms of its business financing and its financial guidance has not walked the walk in terms of seeking change on climate policy.

In early March however Goldman along with several of its industry rivals — including Bank of America JPMorgan Wells Fargo and Citigroup — announced one of its boldest plans to date. The bank said in a statement that it would be ""aligning [its] financing activities with a net zero by 2050 pathway."" Broadly speaking ""net zero"" refers to net-zero carbon emissions meaning that the amount of carbon emitted by an institution is equivalent to the amount it takes out of the atmosphere.

Many environmental advocates however have pointed out that it's not clear what Goldman's promise actually amounts to. Kate Mackenzie a fellow at the Center for Policy Development told Salon ""An important question is: what kind of net-zero pathway?"" Many such ""pathways"" she explained involve carbon capture technologies; some make use of renewable energy and some utilize a mixture of both. Net zero in essence could mean a whole host of things not all of them equally consequential.

Goldman Sachs may intend for example to continue financing carbon-intensive businesses while ""offsetting"" its emissions with ""negative emissions technologies"" (NETs) or by ""reforestation"" (i.e. planting lots of trees). But as Simon Lewis has noted in The Guardian such ventures often serve as no more than accounting tricks. ""Emitting carbon at the same time as building solar capability"" he wrote ""does not equal zero emissions overall."" Some emissions are harder to remove from the atmosphere than others. So if businesses are not targeting their own actual emissions then they may not be operating at net-zero strictly speaking.

There is also significant doubt about whether NETs are economically and scientifically scalable. One glaring problem with reforestation is that there is not enough open space in most countries to grow the millions of hectares of trees needed to achieve substantial carbon capture. Forests also take time to mature meaning that the effect of reforestation would be too weak in the initial stages of the forest's growth — and some or many newly-planted trees may die as the effects of climate change wreak havoc on the biosphere. So if part of Goldman's path to net-zero involves reforestation the question then becomes how the bank intends to measure the changing carbon sequestration rates until 2050 (i.e. when Goldman will in theory have decarbonized completely) and whether those rates will even come close to offsetting the company's investments in big emitters.

It's also possible that Goldman's pathway does not involve additional NETs but some form of divestment. Fossil fuel divestment a practice first put forth about a decade ago can be an impactful symbolic gesture and send a political signal to the market as Dr. Maximilian Horster ISS ESG's Head of Climate Solutions told Salon. But Horster also said that divestment is weak as an accountability mechanism: If someone sells a fossil-fuel asset the logic of the market dictates that someone else will buy it. ""If a company's value drops because everyone is selling its stock"" he explained ""the company will just buy back the stock.""

Horster argued that the best thing an asset manager can do to achieve net-zero is simply to stop lending money to fossil fuel companies — an option that Goldman does not appear to have contemplated. ""By no longer lending money"" Horster explained banks could ""drive up the cost of capital for those businesses. We have to be much more surgical about what real-life economic impact you can have for each asset class.""

As of December 12 percent of Goldman's loans and 18 percent of its lending commitments were in the energy sector. So the bank will have to move far past divestment to comprehensively decarbonize its business.

There is also the question of how Goldman as a major shareholder in all kinds of corporations will engage with its portfolio companies to help them meet their respective climate targets. The Rev. Kristen Spalding senior program director at Ceres a nonprofit that focuses on climate-friendly investment solutions said that Ceres ""expects to see targets not only on the investment side but also on the engagement side.""

For asset managers like Goldman Spalding explained ""Those targets should be about lining the companies that they hold with the same science-based trajectory — a temperature trajectory. I would expect their engagement policies should reflect the need to vote for or against resolutions that advance that company's agenda.""

Goldman hardly has a spotless record when it comes to advancing shareholder advocacy on climate change. According to a Guardian report from 2018 when Goldman Sachs partnered with billionaire Paul Tudor Jones to unveil an ethically-focused exchange traded fund ( JUST ETF ) the bank blocked numerous environmental reforms proposed in shareholder resolutions. Despite being the second highest polluting company in the world Chevron scored a position in the fund as its 17th largest holding ( out of 450 ). Proxy voting records show that 14 Goldman funds shot down six out of seven proposals that sought to improve Chevron's climate record including the nomination of a director with an environmental background the preparation of a decarbonization report and greater transparency in company lobbying activities.

Another sobering reality is that the time horizon of Goldman's purported commitment simply is not adequate to the scale of the disaster. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently posited that the average temperature of the Earth may increase by 1.5°C in the next five to seven years. According to climate scientist Kevin Anderson a mere 4°C net increase in the global temperature will ""devastate the majority of ecosystems"" and is ""incompatible with an organized global community."" This reality poses a colossal challenge for financial institutions looking to make a meaningful impact on climate change and evinces the need for aggressive interim targets.

""The work isn't done with the pledge"" said Horster. ""We as a civil society need to hold banks accountable every year. They need to make sure that carbon removal becomes scalable and the time for that is long before 2050.""

""We would expect to see clear interim targets"" echoed Spalding. ""If you don't see an interim target it's not meaningful.""

Goldman has promised to ""set interim business-related climate targets by the end of 2021."" But the bank has not outlined what those targets will be or how it plans to reach them. Previous targets set by Goldman have been flimsily premised. In its Environmental Policy Framework from 2005 Goldman promised to ""achieve carbon neutrality across our own operations from 2015 onwards and target 100 percent renewable power to meet our global electricity needs by 2020."" In the company's latest statement from March 2021 it claims to have delivered on this promise.

But according to a carbon emissions report conducted by APEX Companies Goldman consumed 549940 megawatt-hours of energy in 2018 alone. That number corresponds to roughly 50000 times average household energy consumption in the northwestern U.S. according to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council . In terms of corporate comparisons Goldman consumes more than eight times as much energy as Blackrock  but is less than three times its size. Goldman has said it is still ""progressing toward [its] goal of 100% renewable power.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtaGlyZXMtZXhpdHMtYmxhY2tyb2NrLWpwbW9yZ2FuLWdvbGRtYW4tY2l0YWRlbC1zZWN1cml0aWVzLTIwMjEtNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street People Moves: Carey Halio Paul Bodnar Brett Redfearn,"Insider is compiling Wall Street people moves each week.

Here's a rundown of news on hires exits and promotions from the past week. Are we missing anyone? Let us know.

No sooner had President Joe Biden’s $1.9tn stimulus package passed than attention turned to his next big spending bill for infrastructure — and the tax rises that are likely to pay for it.



For equity markets the corporate tax increases proposed by Democrats to fund the $2tn package could get quite costly quickly according to analysts’ projections. Goldman Sachs calculated that Biden’s tax plan would knock 9 per cent off earnings per share for companies in the S&P 500 next year.



Under Biden’s plans laid out last week the US corporate tax rate would rise from 21 per cent to 28 per cent a sharp reversal from the cuts rolled out during Donald Trump’s presidency. The proposal would also add a global minimum tax of 21 per cent determined on a country-by-country basis to target tax havens.



Communication services and information technology are likely to be among the biggest losers from the tax package given the sectors’ exposure to higher taxes on foreign dealings. Goldman expects both to take about a 10 per cent hit on earnings next year owing to the jump in corporate and global tax rates alone. The bank’s estimates were based on a plan set forth during the presidential campaign which included similar tax increases.

For tech groups in particular higher taxes are another blow for a sector that until recently underpinned an unprecedented rally on Wall Street. Savita Subramanian head of US equity & quantitative strategy at Bank of America said tech shares have come under pressure this year from rising borrowing costs which decrease the value of future cash flows that are heavily baked into the valuations of the sector’s high flyers.



“That suggests to me that these are areas of the markets that are more at risk than they have been for a while” Subramanian noted.



So far however markets do not seem to have pencilled in tax rises said Mike Mullaney director of global markets research at Boston Partners.



“Taxes are going to go up” Mullaney said. “We just don’t know the extent of what they’re going to look like yet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcm9iZXJ0LXJlZmZraW4tY29tcGFzcy1jZW8tcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtY2FyZWVyLXJpc2Utam9iLWhpc3RvcnktMjAyMS000gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9yb2JlcnQtcmVmZmtpbi1jb21wYXNzLWNlby1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS1jYXJlZXItcmlzZS1qb2ItaGlzdG9yeS0yMDIxLTQ_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What drives the success of Robert Reffkin who took Compass public,"Robert Reffkin grew up in Berkeley CA with his mom who is now a Compass agent.

Robert Reffkin may soon be the youngest Black billionaire in the US after taking his real-estate startup Compass public on Thursday.

The 41-year-old cofounder and CEO has risen to prominence quickly. From growing up in Berkeley CA with a single mom to becoming a White House fellow and rising through the ranks at Goldman Sachs before launching Compass here are some things to know about the up-and-coming executive.

The women in his life have inspired him

Reffkin grew up in Berkeley CA as an only child with a single mom who is now a real estate agent for Compass. In a LinkedIn post Thursday after his company went public on the New York Stock Exchange Reffkin said ""I started Compass because of my mom Ruth a single mom who embodies the entrepreneurial spirit.""

Today Reffkin lives in New York City with his wife Benis Reffkin who is a business and life coach. He dubbed her the ""most important person"" in his life and an inspiration in a LinkedIn post from Mother's Day 2019 that documented how she lived the American Dream. The couple have three kids together.

He's been a founder before

Reffkin started his first business when he was just 15 years old according to an article from Columbia College Today. Backed by babysitting and bar mitzvah money the young founder started a DJ company called ""Rude Boy Productions"" that brought in a total of $100000 by the time he graduated from high school the article said.

In later years Reffkin founded two philanthropic educational groups prior to starting Compass. One is Success Academy Charter Schools a school system for low-income Black and Hispanic students in New York City that helps diminish educational disparities.

He's turned his running hobby into a way to help others

He rose through the ranks on Wall Street but took a chance on a career pivot

Reffkin graduated from Columbia University in just under two years according to Fortune which placed him on the 40 under 40 list in 2014. He then became the youngest business analyst ever hired at McKinsey & Company where he spent two years before returning to his alma mater to get his MBA and then going back to Wall Street as an associate at Lazard.

He then rose through the ranks at Goldman Sachs eventually becoming the chief of staff for Gary Cohn the former president and chief operating officer of Goldman. But he left the storied Wall Street firm in 2012 to start his company.

Real estate isn't his forte but he's known to confidently try new things

Reffkin left his banking career to start up Compass with the tech entrepreneur Ori Allon. But sources told Insider previously he didn't actually know much about the industry he was trying to disrupt saying he had a rudimentary knowledge and didn't know the difference between a co-op and an apartment.

Doing things he's uncomfortable with is just part of his personality though. One person said he's lacked experience in almost everything he's ever done but that's part of what makes him an ""extraordinary person.""

His former boss Cohn said Reffkin just has an ""aura of confidence.""

He has big ambitions for his career which could include public office

In 2005 he was a White House fellow under the George W. Bush administration where he served as the special assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury John Snow.

Mark J. Halliburton 38 was charged with murder and unlawful possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon in the homicide of Monica J. Mills 43 late Sunday in a parking lot at Bishop Noll Institute Lake Criminal Court records show.

Halliburton has not yet entered a plea. He was being held without bail at the Lake County Jail.

Hammond police found Mills of East Chicago unresponsive and suffering from a gunshot wound inside her blue 2000 Ford Focus after responding about 10:20 p.m. to the private Catholic school 1519 Hoffman St. for a report of a gunshot victim according to court records.

Mills was taken to St. Catherine Hospital where she was pronounced dead police Lt. Steve Kellogg said.

As officers continued to investigate Halliburton exited an apartment building to the east of the crime scene and approached police as he talked on the phone court records state.

Halliburton claimed Mills was his girlfriend and that two males approached the Ford and shot her through a passenger-side window.

Halliburton appeared ""extremely shaken"" and ""started to become incoherent while officers spoke to him"" court documents say.

Police learned Halliburton's relative lived nearby and that he had called another relative and said he and Mills were fighting over a gun which ""went off"" records state.

Detectives obtained surveillance video of the area which showed a bright flash of light emanating from Mills' car before a person exited from the passenger side and ran to the driver's side according to documents.

The person ran from the car to the apartment building across the street multiple times before police arrived.

At no point did investigators observe two suspects as described by Halliburton in the video court records state.

Mills' relative told police Halliburton recently sent several text messages about a gun Mills purchased in March at Deb's Gun Range.

In the messages Halliburton allegedly said Mills better give him the gun or the money and that he was ""not playing."" At one point he directed Mills' relative to drop off the gun at his relative's apartment just east of Bishop Noll records allege.

Police executed a search warrant at the apartment and found a Girsan brand 9 mm semi-automatic pistol hidden above a vent in the basement records state.

Halliburton told detectives during an interview Monday he paid Mills an extra $100 to purchase the firearm for him because he cannot legally own a gun due to his 2010 felony conviction for dealing in cocaine records state.

Halliburton claimed he and Mills were sitting in her car and he was pulling up his jogging pants when the gun came out of its holster and accidentally went off.

Halliburton said he made up a story about two suspects shooting Mills because he was scared according to court records.

Bishop Noll Principal Lorenza Jara Pastrick said Monday the shooting was not connected to the school in any way and offered condolences to Mills' family.",,,,,,,,,,,,

For anyone that already has their bot: once attached are the spike strips removable? I'm thinking that the bot mode might look a bit cleaner with the strips removed and the planet mode pinchers tucked in downward.

If anyone would post a picture of how that would look that would be very cool. Posted by thefunkybat on April 3rd 2021 @ 4:17pm CDT

I'm more for the left removed with the robot mode looking cleaner. That said when I first watched a Japanese review including the 30 min. long transformation (he was *really* careful and showing off connection points) I was aghast of how the entire shell is just collapsed on his back and legs. What really got me though was the soft rubber spike strips just... hanging loose. I got over the first much less the second.



I was reminded of peeling mandarins really



:EDIT: Just an addition I'd like to make: whoever designed the rings and their transformation has to be a mathematician specialising in circular geometry. He deserves an award!

I think I'm liking the removed spikes but maybe not the horns pointed down (I thought they would tuck in more).



I'm trying to decide whether or not to keep mine. Bought it when I was employed and had (presumably) steady funds; now I'm unemployed and money is tight.

Plus a bunch of the smaller Unicrons I have kicking around. They're all going on top of a short and wide book shelf that should be plenty deep for the the big guy. It's going to be a process since I'm redoing the entire room and most stuff is in boxes and a lot of stuff has bled into the hall and living room but it'll look great when it's done!

My Unicron finally came in. And it was within a larger box so it's in perfect condition! But I have nowhere to put said box so it just goes in the basement.



Grey maw or no grey maw in person he is a sight to behold! I haven't finished assembling him yet just gonna enjoy him in planet mode for a bit.



For Armada ... wouldn't it be Thrust Sideways and Nemesis Prime? It's not quite the same as the other unholy trios but it's still three right?

Yeah Triple seems to be the common price online. I had to laugh when I saw the 20K price though. As the seller tries to justify what is essentially a 900% mark up on the highest sellers. By saying Unicron is limited to 10000 pieces. Posted by AllNewSuperRobot on August 23rd 2021 @ 12:10pm CDT

I still see toys of all brands and from all era's at stupidly high insane prices. I'm not sure what the logic is. If they hope some rich person will just ""buy it now"" without doing research or what...



I've been watching a couple items for several months they slowly creep down in price occasionally. But I would think paying months and months worth of listing fees would eventually make the item not worth selling. Posted by o.supreme on August 23rd 2021 @ 12:17pm CDT

It all depends on how big or small scale they are as sellers. Ebay commonly gives out seller incentives like no Listing fees for your first 50 or 100 Listings within a month or something similar so there is a good chance these ridiculously high listings are not costing them anything. I haven't paid a Listing fee in over a year because of this. It all depends on how big or small scale they are as sellers.

That's true I guess it's when you actually sell something that they stick-it to you. I'm not a power seller by any means but the last few items I sold while there were no listing fees it seems like almost 25% of the profit went to eBay. Also since they broke off working with PayPal getting paid is more of a pain as well. Posted by o.supreme on August 23rd 2021 @ 12:52pm CDT

A discussion in the Studio Series 86 thread got me to try something with my Unicron.



I took a few random large Headmaster heads and placed each of them on top of Unicron's body in lieu of Unicron's own noggin. The heads of Titan class Scorponok Titan class Grand Maximus (TR Fort Max mold) and Car Robots Brave Maximus (G1 Fort Max mold) all just sit very loosely on Uncron's body as expected.



BUT the Robots in Disguise 2001 Megatron Megabolt mold (the one based on Beast Machines Megatron's big floating head) actually sits rather snuggly on Unicron's body. I tried it both with and without the spider legs and the legs actually help to secure it in place! The rear legs rotated upward line up rather well with Unicron's collar the middle legs rotated to point backward wrap around the collar's front edges and the front legs just rest on the top of Unicron's chest.



This means that one of (if not the ) most accomplished Megatrons ever has a toy that can actually interact with the Unicron toy in a somewhat decent fit allowing him to appear to possess Unicron's body yeeeeesss. Posted by Sabrblade on November 15th 2021 @ 10:46am CST

Well there are a lot less of them particularly in South Walton. The rate of overdevelopment in our area should be a major cause for concern.

It seems that every week there is a massive new land clearing many of which are making way for large multi-family apartment buildings and condos. Not only will this lead to an environmental crisis there seems to be no thought given to local infrastructure to handle this rapid growth.

Sadly it appears that greed is taking precedence over preserving the quaint and natural beauty that makes this area truly special. At this rate our unique community will be overrun in the name of the ‘almighty dollar’ and we will be left with a real life Paradise Lost.

Ramos probably most famous for his roles in Hamilton and A Star Is Born was poised for a huge summer of 2020 but due to the pandemic that summer has been pushed back a year. His role of Usnavi In the Heights is certainly a star-making performance but was pushed back. However he is still seen as an inevitable force in the coming years. This blockbuster Transformers project will certainly help his rise.

In addition to Ramos current insiders say that the studio is looking for a female lead to play opposite of Ramos.

Hasbro and Paramount have significantly changed their approach with the Transformers films. After huge financial success but little critical success with the five Michael Bay-directed films the studio has been going in a new direction.

Travis Knight’s Bumblebee got good reviews and they are going with a similarly interesting director in former Creed II helmer Steven Caple Jr while the script is written by Joby Harold based on early scripts by Matt Holloway Art Marcum and Ken Nolan.

Even the leads of Hailee Steinfeld and Anthony Ramos are at similar stages in their rising careers and are not akin to a huge A-list actor like Mark Wahlberg. There are not even hard feelings between Bay and the studios as Bay has stayed on board to producer both of these projects.

It is certainly interesting to see the continuing evolution of this franchise and it looks like they are giving projects to people that really care about the material. The Transformers franchise is also working on many other projects including an animated film as well as a sequel to 2018’s Bumblebee.

The untitled Transformers film is set to hit theaters on June 24 2022."

It is a publicly owned hospital that boasts good care at lower prices than most and still flourishes financially.

Nonetheless New Hanover County is selling the hospital to one of the state’s biggest health care systems. The sale has stoked concerns locally that the change in ownership will raise fees which would not only leave patients with bigger bills but also eventually filter down into higher health insurance premiums for Wilmington workers.

Hospital consolidation has been a consistent trend unabated by recessions bountiful times or even a pandemic. The New Hanover sale which requires only the approval of the state attorney general for completion prompts the question: If Wilmington’s self-sufficient medical center cannot stand alone can any public hospital avoid being subsumed into the large systems that economists say are helping propel the cost of American health care ever upward?

“We project the prices will go up they’ll probably lay off employees after a couple of years and the hospital will decline in terms of its quality” said Dale Smith a retired Wilmington businessman who opposed the sale. Applying his professional experience buying chemical companies to the hospital industry Smith said: “A very large percentage of mergers and acquisitions like 90 percent never succeed in fulfilling their initial goals.”

The public hospital — those owned by counties cities or other local government entities — is an increasingly endangered species numbering 965 out of 5198 according to the American Hospital Association. While the total number of hospitals in the nation dropped by 4 percent between 2008 and 2018 the number of state or local hospitals decreased by 14%.

Many have been absorbed by large systems. Over the previous 14 years the percentage of markets where one health care system treats more than half the cases grew from 47 percent to 57 percent. In 2017 nine out of 10 hospital markets met the federal definition for being highly concentrated.

While the industry says larger systems allow hospitals to run more efficiently numerous studies have found that charges to insurers and patients are higher from hospitals with more market power. One study calculated the premium to be 7 percent to 9 percent; another study found 12 percent.

“There is a growing consensus that hospital mergers do lead to higher prices” said Christopher Whaley a policy researcher at the Rand Corp. a research organization.

Novant and backers of the sale disagree that prices will increase more than they would have otherwise. “We looked into the future and we felt we needed more resources” said Spence Broadhurst who was the co-chair of the committee the county created to evaluate the medical center’s future. “We were pretty convinced that the risk of doing nothing was significant.”

While the coronavirus inflicted serious financial damage on many hospitals by forcing them to postpone elective surgeries and improve infection control the outbreak has not stymied mergers and acquisitions. In the third quarter of 2020 Kaufman Hall a Chicago firm that advises companies on such deals identified four substantial health care transactions tying the highest number the firm has seen in a single quarter.

“In 2021 and beyond even more activity in M&A is expected” said Anu Singh a managing director at Kaufman Hall.

Consolidation has been marching rigorously through North Carolina. Seventy-four percent of North Carolina general hospitals belong to systems more than any other state except Hawaii Maine and Rhode Island according to a KHN analysis of 2018 data from the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Since then in the western part of the state the investor-owned chain HCA purchased the nonprofit Mission Hospital in Asheville; in the middle Greensboro-based Cone Health merged with Sentara Healthcare into a 17-hospital system; and on the coast Novant Health is buying New Hanover.

Both the Mission and New Hanover sales provoked substantial community blowback. New Hanover opened its doors in 1967 in the midst of the civil rights movement as Wilmington’s first integrated hospital. It grew to become the nation’s third-largest county-owned hospital serving seven counties in southeastern North Carolina.

But unlike many public hospitals the medical center makes money: $110 million in the fiscal year ending in September 2019 which translated to an enviable 10 percent surplus. It is the largest county-owned system that does not require taxpayer subsidies.

Despite its market leverage as the only general hospital in Wilmington New Hanover charged private insurers less than did the 24 other North Carolina hospitals for which Whaley and his Rand colleagues could assess inpatient and outpatient prices from 2016 through 2018. New Hanover’s prices were 13 percent lower than UNC Health’s 15 percent lower than Novant Health’s and 32 percent lower than Atrium Health’s according to the Rand data.

New Hanover has also demonstrated its ability to provide care to Medicare beneficiaries thriftily without sacrificing quality: In the first six months of 2019 its accountable care organization or ACO earned a $3 million bonus from Medicare for saving more money than the government expected according to federal data. Novant’s ACO did not reduce costs enough to earn a bonus.

“This is not your typical county hospital. This is a fairly high-functioning hospital with high-quality care and reasonable prices” said Barak Richman a professor of business administration at Duke Law School.

But leaders in New Hanover County and the medical center announced in 2019 they were exploring either selling the hospital or joining a larger health care system. They said they feared the hospital needed more capital and help to keep up with the surging population growth in the region and medical advances including costly technologies.

The county’s request for proposals drew many suitors including Novant and Atrium which had been battling for dominance throughout North Carolina’s regional health care markets. Novant’s winning bid which the county accepted last October will pay the county $1.5 billion. The county will use most of the money to fund a new nonprofit endowment to bolster community health but will keep $350 million. Novant pledged to invest an additional $3.1 billion to build and upgrade medical facilities and equipment in the region and it said it would create a branch of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine at New Hanover.

“We knew we wanted more” said John Gizdic president and CEO of New Hanover. “We wanted to do more; we wanted to be more.”

Along with the hospital the sale includes other medical facilities the county owns under the medical center’s umbrella: smaller hospitals for children rehabilitation and mental health on the medical center’s campus; a nearby orthopedic hospital a physicians’ group and outpatient centers; and its contract to manage Pender Memorial Hospital owned by an adjacent county.

Carl Armato Novant’s president and chief executive noted in an interview that Novant already owns the nearby Brunswick Medical Center which refers some patients to New Hanover and he said provides affordable health care. “The two organizations have a unique cultural alignment” he said.

Even some opponents of the deal acknowledged that New Hanover was not guaranteed to remain financially strong. “Owning and running a hospital has got some serious wind in its face” said Bertram Williams III an investment adviser whose father was a surgeon who helped found New Hanover. “There’s a lot of things coming down the pike making it more and more complicated to manage a hospital and keep it above water.”

Williams said he expected Novant would need to recoup the money it is spending on the deal. “That money’s got to be repaid” he said. “It’s going to come from local payers. We know it’s going to be higher costs there’s no question about that. Might there be higher costs anyway? Probably.”

The sale of the medical center removes the direct leverage local consumers had in influencing the hospitals’ prices. Novant agreed to create a local hospital board with a majority of members living in the service areas but the board’s role will not extend to setting prices.

“Novant Health what they’re proposing to do sounds just too good to be true” said Howard Loving a retired naval officer who questioned the sale. “To my mind the first thing that’s going to unravel is there’s two years with the doctors who are there now [and then] Novant will have the ability to decide who gets to stay and who gets to go.”

State Treasurer Dale Folwell said he expects that as part of Novant New Hanover will press for higher rates from the health care fund that covers state employees and teachers which Folwell’s office oversees.

“I’m their largest customer” he said. “I know we should expect quality to go down access to go down prices to go up. And when that happens public service workers get hit the worst.”

Novant disputed that its takeover would lead to higher costs. “Novant Health has a track record of lowering the cost of care to patients compared to other healthcare systems in North Carolina” the organization said in a statement. Novant also noted that more low-income people will qualify for free or lower-cost care under Novant’s charity care rules than under New Hanover’s.

Unpersuaded opponents of the sale said the county did not take a serious enough look at finding other ways to raise capital without losing control of the hospital.

“They said the future is scary and unknown” Smith the retired businessman said. “The counterargument is Why don’t we wait and see what the future holds?”

“Once this is done” he added “you can never go back.”

Latinos in their 30s and 40s have died from the virus at nearly 11 times the rate of white people the same age in Virginia. Hospitalizations were 2.6 times higher. Part two will be published next Sunday.

Victor de la Barrera waited until he could no longer breathe.

At first the tightness in his chest happened only when he coughed. Then when he walked too quickly. Then every time he stood up.

“You need to go to the hospital” his family doctor said.

“Yes” his wife Flory pleaded. “Let’s go.”

The 49-year-old pastor resisted. He wasn’t sick enough. He was under the age of 65 and had no medical conditions placing him at high risk of a severe bout of coronavirus.

“Maybe a little extra weight but that was it” he reasoned.

And when state orders barring 50 people from gathering indoors became 10 the Richmond church Victor presided over for more than 14 years — Iglesia Pentecostal Filadelfia — closed.

Services went virtual. Sermons preached social distancing. Mask-wearing. Hand washing.

It wouldn’t be enough. The pandemic decimated the country’s Latino neighborhoods with younger Latinos facing an overwhelming number of hospitalizations and deaths — a pain testing but not breaking the pastor’s faith.

By the end of April less than two months since Virginia’s first COVID-19 case his entire family tested positive. The only one with chills and labored breathing was him.

“We need to go” Flory said. “Now.”

This time there was no pushback.

On May 8 their daughters drove them to Johnston-Willis Hospital where no-visitor policies meant the farthest they could go was right outside the doors while both their parents were wheeled inside to adjacent rooms.

As he lay on the cushioned bed in the intensive care unit tentacles of tubes poking out of each side of his body the physician gave him the news.

If one more hour had passed he likely wouldn’t have lived.

“Listen” he told Victor gently. “This is severe.”

“Really?”

“Yes” he repeated. “Your wife isn’t as bad. She could go home in maybe an hour.”

He would be right behind her right? They would leave how they entered: together with his daughters waiting outside the hospital doors. Yes that’s how the story would go. That’s the story they would tell.

Then the physician turned to Victor and shook his head as if in response to the thoughts still making him believe his lung aches were temporary.

“We need to put you on a ventilator to help you breathe” the doctor said. “If we don’t do it it will be difficult. It will be difficult for you to make it.”

One of the final moments Victor remembers is how he nodded weakly and masked with oxygen to live a little longer.

His wife said goodbye through the window.

‘God will save him’

Forty days — the length of Noah’s Ark flood and the amount of time Jesus was tempted by the devil in the desert

“That’s what we can give him before we have to consider disconnecting” the nurses said.

They told Flory on day 30 six days away from when they would have celebrated 23 years of marriage. Ten nights to pray he and everyone in his situation would wake up and stay alive.

Nurses FaceTimed the family as his condition seemingly deteriorated the three women huddling around the tiny screen imploring him to fight. To not leave them so he could be there when his youngest daughter Flory graduated high school.

“We need you” they cried. “You’re going to be OK OK?”

The only response was the intermittent beeping of the heart monitor.

Doctors prepared them for the somber reality that if he won this battle there was no guarantee he would ever speak or walk again.

The longer a patient is on a ventilator the slimmer the chances of recovering become. Victor’s odds were at a 5-to-10% probability.

In the first months of the pandemic there were too many unknowns and even the most well-equipped hospitals struggled to treat an unpredictable virus when the severity and challenges varied with each person. They still do.

For the sickest COVID-19 patients whose lungs essentially stopped functioning how could they manage their breathing? If the state’s hospitals had less than 3000 ventilators and around 1500 people hospitalized each day would they need to start rationing care?

When Victor was admitted on May 8 almost 200 COVID-19 patients in Virginia were on a ventilator. Three-and-a-half weeks prior there were 302 people relying on the calibrated breathing machine to keep their airways open.

Hospitals would not reach numbers like these again until the day after Christmas. The all-time high came on Jan. 14 at 366.

Three days later Virginia reported a case increase of nearly 10000. The share of ventilators in use wouldn’t dip below 200 for more than a month.

When Victor was in a medication-induced coma heavily sedated to increase stability and health care workers weighed how to extinguish the infection without killing him data gauging the gravity of each patient’s illnesses was scarce. No one knew who might live or die.

“There is a continuum of severity for COVID-19 infections” said Jeff Caldwell vice president of communications for HCA Healthcare the umbrella company for Johnston-Willis Hospital. “It’s difficult to predict which patients will be most severely impacted.”

Due to privacy policies and federal law requiring the protection of patient health information Caldwell couldn’t comment on specifics about Victor’s stay.

But patterns quickly emerged he said. Black and Latino residents were filling ICUs an aftermath of working front-line jobs having underlying conditions and being more likely to live in crowded housing.

His wife Flory came to this conclusion quickly. Nearly every day news traveled of another Latino pastor who had contracted the virus. Within a year 85% of Victor’s church would too.

Grief became woven into their mobile home community’s day-to-day lives like another tenuous and invisible sickness she said. The congregation left messages raised money for his family to help with bills sent trays of food to easy Flory’s worries.

But the stress came at nightfall when her stomach clenched with dread and all she could do was cry and plead for God to bring her husband home.

By day 34 Flory was sure science had failed her.

“I can’t be in the room with him but you can” she told the physician. “So I beg you. Pray for him. Pray for him because I have faith that God will save him.”

She didn’t know what else could.

“I can do that” he assured her. “Is it OK if I pray for him in my language? I don’t know how to pray in Spanish.”

Flory grinned.

“No te preocupes” she said. “Don’t you worry. The Lord hears them all.”

‘You’re a COVID-19 survivor’

On day 35 Victor opened his eyes.

“Do you know what day it is?” a nurse asked. “It’s June 13. You are a warrior.”

Tears welled in his eyes as he realized he couldn’t remember how he got there or where he lived. The breathing tube made him unable to speak and his body was held down to ensure limited movement to protect his oxygen levels. His mouth dry and sore could barely withstand two drop of water dabbed onto his lips for hydration.

Then the memories returned. Tomorrow was his and Flory’s anniversary. And he would miss it like he missed his daughter’s graduation. Like he missed his daughter’s 18th birthday.

“I’m so sorry” he said wishing they could hear him. “I’m so sorry I couldn’t be there. Please forgive me.”

He couldn’t go home yet to tell them. Instead a series of eating and respiratory tests followed in the next two weeks to determine whether his system escaped the virus.

For the first breathing evaluation he needed to sustain his oxygen levels without help. He had already failed once.

“Go go go!” nurses cheered. “You got this. One more.”

Victor couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t move his limbs. He knew his kidneys heart lungs and organs were working as hard as they could but feared his body would give out in the moment he needed it.

He exhaled one final time before collapsing into the nurse’s arms and praying God pulled him through.

Then slowly the doctor looked him in the eyes and raised his thumb up.

“Pasaste la prueba” he said. “You passed the test. You’re a COVID-19 survivor.”

That was the day he began to learn how to live again.

Eight days post-intubation he could eat. By day 13 he took his first steps. By day 16 he got up from the hospital bed on his own.

Nights were still the loneliest he said when his view was the ceiling and his mind began hallucinating that he would never see his family again.

“I want to go home” he told God. “Show me the way home.”

On the morning of June 29 Victor told the doctor of his latest improvement: marching to and from the bathroom without help.

“Really?” the doctor asked. “Well that’s great. Because you’re going home today.”

That night Victor dressed himself and using only a cane walked out of the hospital.

Nine months later

The nurses and doctors said they didn’t know why Victor survived. On average people with COVID-19 in HCA Healthcare hospitals stay about one week said spokesperson Caldwell. They’ve also seen a broad range up to a month or more.

Victor says it was God telling the medical providers to not give up on him.

His community his church didn’t either. From the moment he was hospitalized family from his home state of Morelos Mexico texted and called every day. They rallied around him without being asked he said.

“It reminded me what it means to live” he said tearfully in a recent afternoon.

Flory remodeled their home while he was intubated purchasing a sofa Victor wouldn’t struggle to lay in and widening the space for him to have room to move with a walker.

This was where he would recover she said. This was where he would come back to her.

Physical and mental rehabilitation are among the most painful and extensive parts of reclaiming the body that hospitalization has deteriorated.

Post-intubation Victor relearned how to walk up steps and tie his shoes. He struggles to run and his lungs might never be the same.

But he takes the wins when he can like being able to play the bass at church again after his fingers stuck together and were too weak to strum the chords. Or putting on his Sunday suit and leather dress shoes for church to be a pastor again — to offer comfort to congregants desperately trying not to collapse after a year that stripped them down.

“People find support peace answers to much of what’s happening here. The church has become their refuge” Victor said. “The heart needs that sanity even if it’s just through your faith.”

Especially when job losses hospitalizations and deaths continue to happen in Latino communities Victor said. The last COVID-19 funeral he went to was in January.

Victor begs his congregation to follow state guidelines so there’s no more to go to. So there’s no more anniversaries graduations and birthdays missed.

Easter

Nine months after nearly dying from the virus he prepared his Sunday sermon to celebrate Jesus’ resurrection from the dead and was reminded of his first thought upon waking up.

“If you had one more minute of your life given back to you how would you take advantage of it?”

The answer for him was easy. He would call his family and make sure they knew he loved them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jdXJldXMuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzU1Njc1LXBvaW50LW9mLWNhcmUtdWx0cmFzb3VuZC1kaWFnbm9zaXMtb2YtYS1jcm9obnMtZGlzZWFzZS1yZWxhdGVkLWludHJhYWJkb21pbmFsLWFic2Nlc3MtaW4tdGhlLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1kZXBhcnRtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Point-of-Care Ultrasound Diagnosis of a Crohn's Disease-Related Intraabdominal Abscess in the Emergency Department,"Please choose I'm not a medical professional.

Picture: Keith Heppell

It is hard to escape Dylan Whitaker’s upbeat nature.

A boundless enthusiasm and positivity shines through when in conversation and you can get an impression of how that could be beneficial in the coxes’ seat for Cambridge University for the 75th Women’s Boat Race.

You also get a sense of how that character helped him through some difficult times during the pandemic in January and February.

There were more than just the stresses of being a fifth year medical student at King’s College and trialling virtually for the Light Blues for Whitaker who answered a call for volunteers from the clinical school to help on the ICU wards at Addenbrooke’s Hospital as Covid-19 case numbers and hospitalisations rose.

“On a Friday from about 7pm I would start my night shift going into the hospital and working as a HCA [healthcare assistant] fetching stuff for the nurses rolling all the Covid patients” says the 23-year-old.

“It would go all the way through the night until about 7am I would then get home have a few hours sleep before jumping on Zoom to watch an erg or cox race pieces for all the athletes in their own bedrooms gardens or wherever they were.

“I would get a few hours free time because I was back in the hospital at 7pm Saturday night for another 12-hour shift.”

Just to add a little context Whitaker’s hours at clinical school were from 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday and the sporting endeavours on virtual training sessions were in many ways an assessment by rowers and coaches to try to earn the right to cox the Blue boat.

Those two alone come with high demands so with the added emotional toll of being on the Covid ICU unit at Addenbrooke’s on top you have to wonder how he coped mentally.

“In terms of time it was busy but in terms of mentally I’ll be honest it was really hard” he admits.

“At the time I don’t think I realised how much of an impact it had on me. It was very much a case that the job needs doing get it done.

“You’re in an environment where everyone is working very hard but it’s not just working hard they are very dedicated it’s day in day out.

“To be there at 1.30am washing a patient in a dark ICU where everyone is kitted up and you can’t see anyone’s faces it’s pretty horrifying if I’m honest.

“To then finish the shift go to bed wake up and cox the erg put on your coxing face your brave face the face that says ‘today we’re going to beat Oxford we’re going to go as fast as we can’ having that natural born excitement that comes out of racing is tough.

“At the time I didn’t really realise what it was like.

“It all crescendoed on our first day back at rowing. It brought everything back up and the squad around me were amazing. The coaching and support staff were amazing.

“It took a bit of time to deal with it mentally and process it mentally to get myself to a stage where I’m able to talk about it.

“What I’m really able to do is tap into that and be proud of the work I’ve done.”

The experience during the pandemic has reinforced Whitaker’s belief in his chosen profession.

As a medical student he has always had the utmost respect for those working within it and that sentiment has only been strengthened.

“What has really inspired me is that the healthcare profession as a whole the doctors the nurses the HCAs the cleaners everyone when it is crunch time when it really matters that they will be there” he says.

“They don’t quit. Not once did I see anyone quit. Some of those darkest worst nights they always had each other’s back.

“It’s been a huge eye opener into what it is like to be around those sort of people in the healthcare environment. It has absolutely doubled down that I know I’m in the right career.”

It has been a long-held ambition of Whitaker to pursue medicine which came through an interest in healthcare and giving something back but it could very well have been at Oxford rather than Cambridge.

He admits to spending “a lot of daydreaming time” about going to Oxford to follow in the footsteps of a cousin in the year above but at the last minute he felt his application looked better from a Cambridge perspective.

The rest as they say is history and when in the city as a fresher one of the ‘done things’ is to try out at the college boat club.

For Whitaker it was the social aspect that appealed rather than the sporting side but one thing soon led to another.

Having learned to cox in his first year he steered the King’s first boat in his second and then enquired about trialling for CUWBC.

He was part of a pool of 10 coxes that started the campaign for the Light Blues and was one of the last four standing by the turn of the year earning selection for the lightweight women’s Blue boat in 2019 and was chosen to steer the openweights Blue boat last year before the race was cancelled.

An added bonus for Whitaker is that he has been able to transfer lessons learned in rowing to benefit his medical studies.

“My own soft skills my own self-confidence the way I feel and the way I carry myself has massively changed since I’ve started rowing and come into this high-performance environment” he says

“I have to manage my time efficiently I don’t have time to waste. Also I feel far more confident interacting with patients.

“If you can tell a group of very strong motivated women exactly how you want something to be done you can see how that translates to being able to communicate with patients.”

Those rowing colleagues also provided invaluable support to help Whitaker get through the difficult months offering someone an ear away from the hospital environment and even the coxing selection.

It is why lining up in the Light Blues crew on Easter Sunday will be particularly special for Whitaker.

“I feel really lucky that a good number of those people that were there for me through dark months are going to be in the boat with me on April 4 – it is amazing” he added.

“To have those people who have really pulled me through it through these last few tricky months to be on the start line with them will be a massive achievement for all of us.”

Hotels have adjusted service during the pandemic

As you’d expect hotels have adjusted their service protocols during the coronavirus pandemic both as a cost saving measure and also to limit interaction between employees and staff. Among other things we’ve seen hotels:

Eliminate daily housekeeping

Either cut in-room dining altogether or serve it in to-go bags

Eliminate some in-room amenities ranging from minibars to coffee machines

Close bars restaurants and other outlets

In the short term there’s nothing wrong with that and all of this is reasonable enough. The problem becomes that when changes are made they’re often not reversed. Just look at the concept of airline fuel surcharges or the fact that we still can’t take most liquids through security nearly two decades after 9/11.

The new normal of hotel room service

Hiltons will become “higher-margin businesses”

While the hotel industry has no doubt struggled a lot in the past year Skift has some interesting facts on how the financials of some hotels have improved. Looking at the US industry big-picture:

Full-service hotels have lowered their financial breakeven point from 47% occupancy in 2019 to 30% occupancy in 2020

Limited service hotels have lowered their financial breakeven point from 43% occupancy in 2019 to 36% occupancy in 2020

In other words hotels don’t need to fill as many rooms to breakeven which shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Hotels have lowered operating costs by getting rid of amenities and reducing staffing. As you can see we’ve seen the margins improve most at full-service hotels since they have the most amenities and staffing to cut.

Surely you’re thinking “well once things get better proper hotel service will resume right?” It would appear not. Hilton CEO Chris Nassetta said the following during a recent investor call:

“The work we’re doing right now in every one of our brands is about making them higher-margin businesses and creating more labor efficiencies particularly in the areas of housekeeping food and beverage and other areas. When we get out of the crisis those businesses will be higher margin and require less labor than they did pre-Covid.”

So yeah a focus for Hilton is making hotels higher-margin businesses and creating more labor efficiencies specifically with housekeeping and food & beverage. The intent here is pretty clear — many of the cuts that have been made during the coronavirus pandemic are here to stay.

Don’t expect daily housekeeping to be a standard amenity at hotels in the future and expect some of the food & beverage “efficiencies” to stick around.

Will daily hotel housekeeping ever return as a standard amenity?

Will the competitive landscape allow this?

No matter how you slice it the intent here is bad news for hotel guests and especially bad news for those working in the hotel industry since it sounds like there will be fewer jobs. Every business wants to be higher-margin and Hilton’s CEO is making it pretty explicit that many of the current cuts will stick around.

Let’s be clear the focus here isn’t on offering better value. That’s to say that hotels aren’t looking to cut costs and lower rates but rather they’re looking to charge the same but offer less.

What’s my take on all of this?

Ultimately the hotel industry is competitive and I don’t think the landscape will allow hotel groups to go quite as far as Hilton is inferring here though I do think some things won’t return to pre-coronavirus service levels

I’m probably in the minority but personally I think it’s reasonable enough if daily housekeeping never fully returns with the exception of luxury hotels; I have no interest in having someone in my room every day and the entire system just seems inefficient and unnecessary

Room service and minibars have not been much of a money maker for the hotel industry though they are nice amenities to have; I wouldn’t be surprised to see minibars replaced with grab-and-go options in the lobby and to see room service permanently delivered in to-go packaging

While I’d be sad about room service changes when I’m staying at hotels in the US I typically use a food delivery service to order food anyway since it’s cheaper gives you more variety and the food is typically better

Will hotel minibars survive the pandemic?

Bottom line

Hotels have significantly cut service during the pandemic both to cut costs and to minimize contact between people. Hilton’s CEO is now suggesting that the hotel industry will be higher-margin going forward creating more labor efficiencies in the areas of housekeeping and food and beverage.

Personally I think the hotel industry will be permanently transformed but not as radically as Hilton’s CEO is hinting at. Ultimately consumers still have certain expectations and if Hilton doesn’t offer what guests want other brands will.

What’s your take on how hotel service will evolve post-pandemic?

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

Strategic divestitures and a focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels position Host for competitive advantage.

Recent acquisitions signal a forward-looking growth strategy amidst a challenging economic landscape.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands. Despite a slight decrease in net income from $291 million in Q1 2023 to $272 million in Q1 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc demonstrated a 6.5% increase in total revenues reaching $1471 million. Operating profit surged by 17.3% and the operating profit margin under GAAP improved by 180 basis points to 19.8%. Adjusted EBITDAre also saw an 8.8% increase indicating a solid operational performance. The company's strategic divestitures of its interests in European and Asian joint ventures along with other U.S. properties reflect a focused approach to optimizing its portfolio.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Story continues

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

The Company maintains a robust balance sheet and completed several transactions in March and April of 2024. These transactions include:

Net draws of $215 million on the revolving credit facility (including a $300 million draw in March as well as a $65 million draw and $150 million repayment subsequent to quarter end).

HOTEL BUSINESS MIX UPDATE

The Company’s customers fall into three broad groups: transient group and contract business which accounted for approximately 61% 35% and 4% respectively of its full year 2023 room sales.

The following are the results for transient group and contract business in comparison to 2023 performance for the Company's current portfolio:

Quarter ended March 31 2024 Transient Group Contract Room nights (in thousands) 1314 1103 172 Percent change in room nights vs. same period in 2023 (1.9 %) 4.1 % 7.5 % Rooms revenues (in millions) $ 456 $ 324 $ 35 Percent change in revenues vs. same period in 2023 (4.7 %) 5.3 % 18.2 %

This spend is separate from payments for capital expenditures which are considered investing activities.



Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

The acquisition price represents a 12.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 7.4 percent on the property’s 2024 estimated results. Other terms were not disclosed.

The property is expected to be among Host’s top-25 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results with expected combined RevPAR of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $585502 further improving the quality of the company’s portfolio.

“We are excited to add the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown to our portfolio and establish a presence in one of the country’s most exciting cities"" Host Hotels & Resorts President and CEO James Risoleo said in a statement. ""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added six international gates and eight satellite gates and another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway with completion expected in 2028.

Supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville with most projects in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. Host believes the Property is differentiated from the future supply as a result of its central location and diversified product offerings that provide distinct value propositions to customers. The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTE1Mzc0NTIwL2hvc3QtaG90ZWxzLWJ1eXMtMS1ob3RlbC1uYXNodmlsbGUtZW1iYXNzeS1zdWl0ZXMtZm9yLTUzMC1taWxsaW9uLWNhc2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels Buys 1 Hotel Nashville Embassy Suites for $530 Million Cash,"Host Hotels & Resorts bought the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for $530 million in an all-cash deal.

Unveiled during the NCAA’s Final Four basketball tournament via a commercial narrated by LeBron James the GMC Hummer EV SUV is an electric heavyweight that will get people talking.

The model follows in the footsteps of the pickup and features a familiar front end with an illuminated grille that is flanked by slender headlights. Below there’s a beefy skid plate and prominent D-rings.

https://youtu.be/HwLvqvcWEos

Moving further back the model has bulging fenders and an upright windscreen. The Infinity Roof carries over from the pickup and features removable Sky Panels that can be stored in the frunk. However the big news is the fully enclosed rear end which has a full-size spare tire out back.

While the model looks good in standard form owners will be able to extensively customize the SUV as nearly 200 accessories will be available at launch. The model can also be equipped with an Extreme Off-Road package which we’ll talk about shortly.

The five-seat interior largely carries over and drivers will find a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster as well as a 13.4-inch infotainment system. The model also has a floating center console rugged switchgear and the Super Cruise semi-autonomous driving system.

The latter allows for hands-free driving on more than 200000 miles (321869 km) of compatible roadway in the United States and Canada. Hummer is also using the “enhanced” version of Super Cruise and this allows for automated lane changes.

Like the pickup the SUV is based on GM’s Ultium platform and will be launched in an exclusive Edition 1 trim. It will go into production in early 2023 and start at $105595.

For an additional $5000 customers can add an Extreme Off-Road package which features 18-inch wheels wrapped in 35-inch off-road tires. The package also includes rock sliders underbody production a front eLocker and virtual rear lockers. Other highlights include heavy-duty ball-spline half shafts and an UltraVision system that provides an assortment of off-road camera views.

The Edition 1 has a tri-motor powertrain that develops up to 830 hp (619 kW / 842 PS) and 11500 lb-ft (15592 Nm) of torque. It will enable the SUV to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in approximately 3.5 seconds.

There’s no word on why the SUV isn’t getting a 1000 hp (746 kW / 1014 PS) variant like the truck but the model will have a range in excess of 300 miles (483 km). However the Extreme Off-Road package cuts that distance to 280+ miles (451 km).

A few months later in the spring of 2023 Hummer will launch 2X and 3X variants. The 3X has the same powertrain as the Edition 1 but loses some of its special features and has a lower base price of $99995.

The 2X will start at $89995 and have a dual motor powertrain that produces up to 625 hp (466 kW / 634 PS) and 7400 lb-ft (10033 Nm) of torque. GMC didn’t say how fast this version will be but the model will have a range in excess of 300 miles (483 km) just like its more powerful siblings. The 2X and 3X will also be offered with the aforementioned Extreme Off-Road package.

In the spring of 2024 GMC will launch an entry-level 2 variant for $79995. While it has two electric motors that produce a combined output of 625 hp (466 kW / 634 PS) and 7400 lb-ft (10033 Nm) of torque the model features 400V charging technology and a smaller battery pack that allows for 250+ miles (402+ km) of range. However customers will be able to upgrade to 800V technology and a larger battery pack that provides 300+ miles (483+ km) of range.

Speaking of performance GMC said we can expect “impressive departure and breakover angles” as well as a tight turning circle of 35.4 feet (10.8 meters). The latter is possible thanks to a 4 Wheel Steer system that comes standard on the 2X 3X and Edition 1.

We’ll have more to say about the GMC Hummer EV SUV on Monday so stay tuned for full details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy93YXRjaC10aGlzLTE4MDAtaHAtdG95b3RhLXN1cHJhLXBvcC1hLXdoZWVsaWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch This 1800-HP Toyota Supra Pop A Wheelie,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy93YXRjaC10aGlzLTE4MDAtaHAtdG95b3RhLXN1cHJhLXBvcC1hLXdoZWVsaWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vaHAtbG92ZWNyYWZ0LWNvc21pYy1ob3Jyb3ItY29taWMtcmVjb21tZW5kYXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Comics To Read If You Love H.P.

Best Buy is currently hosting a sale on the 2021 HP Envy x360 13 convertible for $300 USD off the original launch price of $1000. Unlike many other laptop deals this particular model is the latest from HP and not some last generation system that retailers are trying to get rid off.

The most notable aspects of the HP Envy x360 13 are the aluminum chassis 512 GB NVMe storage Thunderbolt 4 support and latest Intel Core i7-1165G7 Tiger Lake CPU. The Envy series in general sits well above the cheaper Pavilion series which are often thicker and mostly plastic.

The biggest drawback to the configuration on sale is its measly 8 GB of non-expandable system RAM. Owners would be stuck with low RAM capacity for the life of the system which is a huge bummer for multi-tasking and other RAM-heavy applications like games or picture-editing software.

We've yet to review the 2021 HP Envy x360 13 and so we can't provide our personal take on the chassis."

It may help with Covid-19 too.,"Imagine you’re a scientist who needs to discover a new antibiotic to fight off a scary disease. How would you go about finding it?

Typically you’d have to test lots and lots of different molecules in the lab until you find one that has the necessary bacteria-killing properties. You might find some contenders that are good at killing the bacteria only to realize that you can’t use them because they also prove toxic to humans. It’s a very long very expensive and probably very aggravating process.

But what if instead you could just type into your computer the properties you’re looking for and have your computer design the perfect molecule for you?

That’s the general approach IBM researchers are taking using an AI system that can automatically generate the design of molecules for new antibiotics. In a new paper published in Nature Biomedical Engineering the researchers detail how they’ve already used it to quickly design two new antimicrobial peptides — small molecules that can kill bacteria — that are effective against a bunch of different pathogens in mice.

Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter Twice a week we’ll send you a roundup of the best ideas and solutions for tackling the world’s biggest challenges — and how to get better at doing good. Sign up here.

Normally this molecule discovery process would take scientists years. The AI system did it in a matter of days.

That’s great news because we urgently need faster ways to create new antibiotics.

Why antibiotic resistance is such a huge problem

When new antibiotics are introduced they can have great even lifesaving results. Since penicillin was discovered in 1928 kicking off the modern era of antibiotics we’ve come to rely on them to treat killers like tuberculosis and to keep us safe when we undergo procedures like C-sections or joint replacements.

But experts have warned that we’re now entering a post-antibiotic era — a time when our existing antibiotics are becoming pretty much useless. We’ve created this crisis by overusing antibiotics in the treatment of crops farm animals and humans.

The more we overuse antibiotics the more bacteria have a chance to adapt to our drugs morphing into antibiotic-resistant superbugs that render our drugs ineffective.

And according to a new report from the Pew Charitable Trusts the Covid-19 pandemic has aggravated the problem. Doctors have been even more inclined to unnecessarily prescribe antibiotics to patients. Even though Covid-19 is a viral illness and antibiotics don’t work on viruses doctors have been giving patients these drugs to protect against secondary infections while they’re in the hospital — even before they know if the patients have infections or not.

Nowadays in the time it takes you to read this article one person in the US will die from an infection that antibiotics can no longer treat effectively because of our antibiotic overuse. And over the course of the year 700000 people around the world will die from drug-resistant infections. That annual death toll could rise to 10 million by 2050 a major UN report warned unless we make some radical changes.

Big Pharma and biotech companies haven’t been creating new antibiotics because it takes many years and lots of funding to do the research and development. Most new compounds fail. Even when they succeed the payoff is small: An antibiotic doesn’t sell as well as a drug that needs to be taken daily. For many pharma companies the financial incentive just isn’t there.

But if you can use AI to do this work quickly and cheaply? Well that just might change the calculus.

How IBM’s AI system works

IBM’s new AI system relies on something called a generative model. To understand it at its simplest level we can break it down into three basic steps.

First the researchers start with a massive database of known peptide molecules.

Then the AI pulls information from the database and analyzes the patterns to figure out the relationship between molecules and their properties. It might find that when a molecule has a certain structure or composition it tends to perform a certain function. This allows it to “learn” the basic rules of molecule design.

Finally researchers can tell the AI exactly what properties they want a new molecule to have. They can also input constraints (for example: low toxicity please!). Using this info on desirable and undesirable traits the AI then designs new molecules that satisfy the parameters. The researchers can pick the best one from among them and start testing on mice in a lab.

As one of the co-authors of the IBM paper Aleksandra Mojsilović told me “You have the knobs to turn and you get the molecule that satisfies the properties.”

The IBM researchers claim that their approach outperformed other leading methods for designing new antimicrobial peptides by 10 percent. They found that they were able to design two new antimicrobial peptides that are highly potent against diverse pathogens including multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae a bacterium known for causing infections in hospital patients. Happily the peptides had low toxicity when tested in mice an important signal about their safety (though not everything that’s true for mice ends up being generalizable to humans).

Broader applications from Covid-19 treatments to climate change solutions

This isn’t the first time AI has shown promise at solving longstanding problems in biology. Last year the AI research lab DeepMind cracked the “protein folding problem” — the challenge of predicting which 3D shape a protein will fold up into — which has stumped biologists for 50 years and which has implications for drug discovery. Another exciting highlight: MIT researchers discovered a new type of antibiotic by training their AI to predict which molecules would have bacteria-killing properties.

The IBM research differs from MIT’s in an important way: Rather than training their AI on molecules that we know have antimicrobial properties (as MIT did) IBM trained theirs on a much broader database of all the known peptides that exist in nature. That’s the difference between starting out with around 100000 data points and around 1.7 million data points.

The advantage of the latter is that you end up with an AI system that’s “more creative and generalizable” according to Mojsilović. “We don’t want to be constrained to just antimicrobials. We really want to make a very generic tool that can be used in so many ways” she told me.

Right now for example her team is working to figure out how the AI system might design treatments for Covid-19. When the pandemic came along she explained “We continued to say we can use the same algorithms but now we’re going to search a little differently — for something that looks like a molecule that can bind to a Covid target.”

In a blog post the IBM researchers noted that while they’re excited about how the AI system can potentially accelerate antibiotic discovery and keep antibiotic-resistant bacteria at bay they’re also hopeful that the system can have much broader applications. They envision it helping scientists “to discover and design better candidates for more effective drugs and therapies for diseases materials to absorb and capture carbon to help fight climate change materials for more intelligent energy production and storage and much more.”

It’s not like this AI system will magically solve any of these problems on its own. But it advances a computational strategy for problem-solving that could yield really exciting benefits and possibly save a lot of lives.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9hLWktbGF3LTczMDNkYTc0MDAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A.I.

The Hospital: Life Death and Dollars in a Small American Town

by Brian Alexander

St. Martin’s Press 310 pp.

The first remarkable thing about Brian Alexander’s new book The Hospital is that he managed to pull off an exception to this seeming iron law of U.S. health care. He never explains exactly how but in early 2018 he persuaded the CEO and board of a small community hospital in rural Bryan Ohio to give him fly-on-the-wall access to their struggling institution—and complete freedom to write up what he witnessed.

For the next year and a half Alexander attended long rounds of anguished and divisive strategy sessions. Administrators and board members fought with consultants and each other over how to bring in enough revenue to avoid having to shut down or sell out to a big hospital chain. As Alexander became embedded in the hospital’s day-to-day operations he gained the confidence of harried doctors and nurses as well as patients and their loved ones.

Alexander’s previous book Glass House: The 1% Economy and the Shattering of the All-American Town was about the economic decline of his hometown of Lancaster in central Ohio so he had some advantages in penetrating Bryan’s tightly knit social networks. His career as a journeyman feature writer for publications like The Atlantic and Outside also left him practiced in capturing small but unforgettable details about the many different characters he met in Bryan.

In one plot line Alexander traces the tragic arc of a local man named Keith Swihart. When in his early 20s Swihart faints while working on an assembly line at an auto parts factory. Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes he often goes without the insulin his doctor prescribes because even with company-sponsored insurance he can’t afford it. Then in the 10 years following the Great Recession Swihart faces a series of layoffs and crappy jobs with ever-lower wages and ever-higher-deductible insurance. The grinding downward mobility leaves him and his family exposed to such high medical costs that they can’t afford even routine health screening. Swihart loses his wife to cervical cancer which wasn’t caught until it was too late. Then as a grieving widower and single dad he winds up losing his eyesight and enduring an amputation in the hospital after complications from his poorly managed diabetes land him in the ER.

But Alexander does not let the sad story end there; he also shows how the amputation affected the local pathologist who was left to deal with Swihart’s discarded body parts. “Shannon Keil opened the cottage cheese tub containing Keith’s toes and part of his foot” he writes. “Corruption had invaded the tissue seeped into the bones oozed its way up the metatarsals until they became pliable decayed and no longer able to support a man.” Alexander uses this image as a symbol for the entire U.S. health care system. “What a fucking failure” he later quotes the pathologist as saying explaining that she didn’t mean Swihart or the medical procedure but the malevolent “forces” within our health care system and beyond “that had swept his toes into that small tub.”

Alexander’s understanding of just what those forces are and how they operate beneath the surface of events is the second most remarkable thing about this book. While it takes talent and enterprise to go out into the hinterlands and bring back stories full of pain and pathos plenty of literary journalists have done that. But Alexander also brings to his writing a deep understanding of the larger economic political and social trends that are slowly crushing the lives of the people he met in Bryan and of people like them all over this country. In his telling Bryan becomes a microcosm of American sickness in all its dimensions.

Alexander begins his story at the beginning. The land on which Bryan sits was once part of the Great Black Swamp as it was referred to in pioneer days. The landscape was bleak and boggy and barely inhabited but it was flat which meant that it would become a favored route for early railroads as they pushed westward. Industry soon followed the rails and by the 1920s Bryan had become a small but prospering manufacturing center looking to become a modern progressive metropolis. Reaching that goal would require a modern progressive hospital and the town’s boosters soon came together to advocate for one. “Theirs was the vision of a hospital as public good and community asset” Alexander writes. “There was little mention of money except that the lack of it would be no barrier to treatment.”

But like their counterparts in many other small communities across the country Bryan’s boosters soon found the cost of their dream prohibitive. Alexander does a masterful job of explaining the underlying reasons why.

As in so many other places the gutting of Bryan Ohio’s economy meant that by default its hospital became the largest local employer as well as virtually the only remaining source of upper-middle-class jobs.

During this era other countries such as Germany were crafting large social insurance programs. These systems spread the cost of health care across the whole population thereby guaranteeing hospitals adequate revenue regardless of the income of their patients. But doctors in the United States fearful of reductions to their autonomy and earning power organized into a powerful lobby that opposed not only any kind of national health insurance program but even private plans that could make health care more affordable. In 1929 after two doctors in Los Angeles formed a practice that covered all health care costs for a fixed monthly subscription fee of $1.50 the wrath of other area medical professionals on whom they depended for referrals was so extreme that the Los Angeles Medical Association expelled the two doctors. Other physicians who experimented with similar payment plans were denied hospital privileges or were otherwise professionally shunned.

Meanwhile America’s dominant unions and large employers also opposed any role for government in providing health care to everyone. A spokesman for the National Association of Manufacturers said that “there is no greater reason for giving free medical service than free food.” Samuel Gompers president of the American Federation of Labor argued that if workers were just paid the wages they deserved they could afford to buy their own health care without relying on employers or the government. Both labor and capital joined with doctors in vilifying any effort to spread the cost of health care using the enduring epithet “socialized medicine.”

In the absence of a national health care plan the problem of how to provide care to people who couldn’t afford it had to be finessed. When Bryan finally got its own hospital in 1936 it was not a straightforward public institution like the town’s schools library or police department. Rather like most hospitals in the country today it was a weird uniquely American hybrid: a nonprofit institution incorporated as a charity that provides some contingent care to the needy but effectively operates as a workshop for profit-seeking doctors and health care entrepreneurs. Bryan’s hospital would become an enormous source of local pride. But though it benefited from myriad forms of community support—from fund-raising drives to exemptions from local property taxes—it remained in essence a private corporation in the business of marketing medical services.

As Bryan prospered along with most middle-American towns and cities during the decades after World War II this contradiction was problematic but workable. In the 1960s millions of kids owned Etch A Sketches which were all built in Bryan by the Ohio Art Company. Another local firm called ARO flourished by selling breathing masks for high-altitude pilots and later for NASA astronauts. Mohawk Tools made industrial drill bits and other cutting devices used by carmakers and aircraft manufacturers. Good-paying factory jobs at these and other local firms typically came with generous employer- or union-sponsored health care plans that paid out whatever physicians and hospitals determined was a reasonable fee for their services. By charging newly flush doctors for office space the hospital had little trouble maintaining its margins while still being able to treat charity cases.

But by the end of the 1970s the financing of independent community-based hospitals like Bryan’s was becoming increasingly difficult especially in the deindustrializing heartland. First cheap imports hit the U.S. auto industry hard including Bryan’s auto parts suppliers. Then beginning in the Reagan era financial deregulation and the federal government’s retreat from antitrust enforcement set off a frenzy of mergers acquisitions and leveraged buyouts that further decimated Bryan’s locally owned firms. ARO got bought out by Todd Shipyards which raided the manufacturer’s pension funds and then sold the stripped-down firm to the corporate giant Ingersoll Rand which in turn moved all of its remaining operations to North Carolina. A Canadian corporation acquired Etch A Sketch reducing Ohio Art to a remnant of its former self. An Irish firm bought out Mohawk Tools.

“There was a time when on spring and summer Friday afternoons” Alexander writes “people in Bryan could stand outside look toward the county airport and watch the private planes streak overhead.” But Alexander continues as Bryan’s local firms failed or came under the control of distant corporations “the planes stopped flying the country clubs’ fairways grew over with weeds and empty windows faced the town squares.”

As in so many other places the gutting of Bryan’s economy meant that by default its hospital became the largest local employer as well as virtually the only remaining source of upper-middle-class jobs. The town tried desperately to attract new businesses with tax giveaways and other subsidies. To persuade the midwestern home repair chain Menards to place a distribution center at the edge of town Bryan built a new road. But even when public subsidies attracted new employers the companies typically paid little more than the minimum wage and offered minimal health care benefits. The hospital’s CEO complained to Alexander that Menards was “a real problem for us” because three-quarters of Menards employees treated by the hospital were either on Medicaid which pays hospitals low reimbursement rates or lacked insurance altogether which meant no reimbursement or lots of bad debt.

Meanwhile as more young and ambitious people left Bryan in search of better prospects the remaining population served by the hospital grew older and sicker. This increased the demand for some profitable treatments like heart surgery and chemotherapy which helped the hospital’s margins. But the hospital could not find a way to expand the kind of medical services that Bryan’s downwardly mobile population most needed: services like helping patients to better manage their diabetes overcome their alcohol and opioid addictions or avoid falling victim to the growing epidemic of mental illness.

This remained true even after the expansion of Medicaid and private insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The ACA did bring more revenue to the hospital but not enough to end the constant need to raise money. “We are seeing more bad debt than we were before [the passage of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion] from people who do have health insurance” the hospital’s chief financial officer told Alexander. So the ACA wound up doing little to reorient the practice of medicine away from chasing dollars and toward providing the services most needed by the community. This is no doubt partly why Donald Trump’s attacks on the ACA and established politicians resonated deeply in Bryan. In Williams County where Bryan is located he took 69 percent of the vote in 2016.

Alexander portrays everyone involved in trying to save Bryan’s hospital as largely motivated by a combination of local pride and idealistic dedication to the health care needs of their community. But given the perverse incentives under which the hospital was forced to operate it became nearly impossible to reconcile its mission and its margins. Facing threats from bondholders as its reserves dwindled the hospital was increasingly desperate to bring in more revenue. Yet all the most pressing medical needs identified by the local health department were ones that make little or no money.

Facing threats from bondholders as its reserves dwindled the hospital was desperate to bring in more revenue. Yet the most pressing medical needs identified by the local health department—primary care pediatrics mental health—were ones that make little or no money.

“Pediatrics primary care obesity mental health and dentistry all affected a lot more people” Alexander writes “but none of them were big moneymakers like a cath lab or radiation oncology were. They didn’t spin off lots of lab tests either. Good dental care could prevent heart attacks but treating heart attacks and placing the stents used to prevent another one made profits.” Following the advice of industry consultants the hospital attempted to increase its “efficiency” by investing more in health care services that bring in the most money while neglecting those that create the most health.

It gets worse. By the time Alexander arrived in Bryan in 2018 the hospital was also facing an increasingly mortal threat from two other failures of public policy. Deregulation of Wall Street and lax enforcement of antitrust laws had not only led to the loss of locally owned businesses; they had also made Bryan’s hospital vulnerable to takeover by giant health care conglomerates.

As Alexander explains two big hospital chains in the region one expanding out of Toledo to the east and another expanding out of Fort Wayne Indiana to the west had been gobbling up small hospitals like Bryan’s for more than a decade “in a crazed rush to consolidate before they could be targeted themselves by even bigger predators.” And each time antitrust regulators failed to block another hospital merger the power of the big over the small grew.

Alexander provides a salient example of how this power imbalance compounds over time. When the hospital in Bryan needs to buy a stent for a patient’s clogged coronary artery the best price it can get for the device is around $1400. But bigger hospitals can obtain the same stent for as little as $750 because their market power gives them a stronger negotiating position with the manufacturers and distributors of stents and other medical supplies.

The same raw power dynamics now set prices and allocate resources at every level of the health care sector. Drug companies pharmacy chains medical device makers and insurance companies merge with each other to gain more leverage over hospitals and doctors’ practices. Hospitals and physicians in turn consolidate into still bigger integrated health care oligopolies so they can push their consolidated suppliers around while also vanquishing their competitors. In the process any hospital that remains small and independent becomes almost hopelessly vulnerable to the ones that have consolidated. Those of us who are mere consumers of health care bear the cost of consolidation in the form of rampant health care cost inflation evaporating choice and declining quality of service.

When Alexander finished his reporting in Bryan just a few months into the COVID-19 crisis conditions were deteriorating. Inflamed by Trump’s disinformation and a deepening distrust of government much of the local population along with large swaths of America rejected mask wearing and flouted social distancing orders. Ohio’s chief public health official found gun-toting protestors on her lawn after a Republican state legislator called her “an unelected Globalist Health Director.” Meanwhile Bryan’s hospital hemorrhaged money as it halted elective surgeries lab tests and imaging and it more than doubled the number of hospital beds to accommodate COVID-19 patients. “Money bled out as if from a gushing wound” Alexander writes. By August 2020 the hospital had lost $10 million though reportedly it later recouped this loss with emergency government payments.

Just as the coronavirus crisis was intensifying a new CEO at the hospital decided it would be best for Alexander to leave so that is where his fly-on-the-wall insights end. But the pandemic has likely increased the already huge financial pressure on Bryan’s hospital to close or sell out to a big corporate chain. Large rich health care systems have the reserves to easily endure the financial strains brought on by the pandemic. But for small independent hospitals like small independent businesses generally surviving COVID-19 has become far less likely so the monopolization of health care and the wider economy continues to accelerate. Upon completing this book it occurred to me that it would be fitting to include it in a time capsule so future generations might learn just how the promise of American life faded on our watch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tb29yZXN2aWxsZXRyaWJ1bmUvbmFtZS9nZW9yZ2Utc3Byb3VsLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTc0MzMyMTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,George Sproul Obituary (1948 - 2021) - Mooresville NC - Mooresville Tribune,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/mooresvilletribune/name/george-sproul-obituary?id=7433215 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tb29yZXN2aWxsZXRyaWJ1bmUvbmFtZS9nZW9yZ2Utc3Byb3VsLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTc0MzMyMTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Somehow inexplicably Intel failed to publish drivers for Rocket Lake's integrated graphics ahead of the processors' launch last week. They haven't provided an excuse yet probably because there isn't any: by all accounts Rocket Lake's integrated graphics is a clone of old hardware and doesn't need updated drivers - just certification.

Update (April 5): Intel has re-released its latest graphics drivers (27.20.100.9316) which will recognize and install normally in Rocket Lake desktop CPUs.

Intel's graphics drivers are usually available on their downloads website but if you search for the 11900K or its siblings then all you get is the Performance Maximizer utility. If you download the Intel Graphics driver installer it says it can't find a match for your hardware. That's a bit annoying when you're paying over $600 for a new processor.

Reviewers including ourselves were provided with pre-release drivers ahead of the embargo and those who tested the integrated graphics didn't find any anomalies. OEMs have also had access to drivers. As far as we're aware the integrated graphics inside the Rocket Lake processors branded as the UHD 750 are functionally identical to the integrated graphics inside last year's mobile Tiger Lake processors. Common sense says that the drivers don't need a significant rewrite.

Lisa Pearce Intel's Director of graphics software engineering says that the drivers will be made available to the public by Monday.

Update: Driver to be posted by Monday AM and will update this thread when it's available --- Lisa Pearce (@gfxlisa) April 2 2021

But luckily if you've brought a Rocket Lake processor and don't have a video card to pair with it you don't need to wait until Monday to play CS: GO at 30 fps. Here's a workaround:

4 Reviews Intel's first meme CPU - The Core i9-11900K

Intel just released its 11th Gen processors. You can check out our review of the Rocket Lake-S chips here. In short the new processors offer up to 20% more performance than the last-generation parts in certain workloads but fail to definitively best AMD’s Zen 3 offerings on any meaningful level. This is why the release of these CPUs might seem puzzling to some but I think there is a method to Intel’s madness. Over the last year the PC hardware world has been shaken by what can only be described as massive supply shortages. Very high demand which was spurred on by a global pandemic was part of the problem. Over-reliance on a few global foundries such as TSMC and Samsung Foundry was another facet of the issue. However while most semiconductor companies were struggling to keep up with demand Intel seemed to be doing fine supply-wise. And this is how Intel has found itself in a position that it is in right now: Currently Intel is offering significantly better-priced consumer products than AMD its main competitor in the CPU space. In this piece I would like to present to you the current pricing of gaming Intel and AMD CPUs in France Germany Russia and the US. What this exercise will reveal is that Intel’s current pricing is more competitive than AMD’s in the key Western markets. The reason for this is that Intel is able to keep up with demand much better than AMD. All of the recently released Intel chips are in stock and readily available while AMD’s most competitive offerings the latest Ryzen 9 processors are really hard to come by in the West. However things are even worse for AMD when it comes to its mid-range consumer offerings because its latest Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 CPUs are significantly overpriced when compared to similarly capable Intel counterparts. What is more it is becoming increasingly clear that Intel has decided to start competing against itself since Intel’s 11th Gen CPUs are very comparable in terms of value to the now lower-priced 10th Gen parts. Some say that this is madness but I think there is a method to this madness but more on that point later. First let us look at the current CPU pricing situation in the aforementioned countries. All of the retailers that I have chosen for this comparison sell CPUs online meaning that anyone in their respective country can relatively easily purchase a CPU through these retailers.

We are going to start with a major Russian retailer known as DNS. It sells PC hardware and pre-builds. You can buy a CPU online from this retailer in any major Russian city. In the screenshot below you can see that the Intel Core i9-10900 has a lower price tag than the significantly less capable AMD Ryzen 7 3800XT. As a matter of fact the Ryzen 7 3800XT costs slightly more than the new Intel Core i7-11700K (OEM). This is an example of Intel competing against itself since the last-generation AMD chip is basically irrelevant and therefore can be taken out of the equation. You can click here to go to DNS’s website if you want to see how other AMD and Intel chips are positioned in Eastern Europe. The older AMD Ryzen 7 3800XT is very poorly priced

And it is not only the Ryzen 7 3800XT that is not optimally positioned on DNS's website. The Ryzen 7 5800X is also in a bit of a bind since it has to compete against the 10th Gen deca-core Intel CPUs.

The octa-core AMD chip has to go toe-to-toe with deca-core Intel processors

4 News In the following screenshot you can see how AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X is positioned on DNS's website. The hexa-core 5600X is competing against the octa-core i7-10700KF and the new i7-11700F. The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X offers two fewer cores than similarly priced Intel CPUs

Here is another screenshot to demonstrate how Intel positions its CPUs at least when it sells them to its largest retail partners/pre-builders. The Ryzen 7 5800X (OEM) has a very similar price tag to the Core i9-10850K (OEM) on DNS’s website. The Ryzen 7 5800X (OEM) has to do battle with the Core i9-10850K (OEM)

The boxed version of the Ryzen 7 5800X has to compete with the Core i9-10900KF and the new Core i9-11900F. The positioning of the Ryzen 7 5800X is not super competitive

Another noteworthy observation of mine is that DNS is currently not selling the outrageously overpriced Core i9-11900K which says a lot about the Core i9-11900K. Howbeit DNS does offer the Intel Core i9-11900 likely because Intel pays DNS for the inclusion of its promotion material. So it is more of a marketing exercise than a CPU selling exercise for DNS. But the fact that the Core i9-11900K did not make the cut at one of the largest hardware retailers/pre-builders in Russia is quite telling.



Intel's marketing material for the Core i9-11900 on dns-shop.ru

Now we are going to take a look at the CPU pricing in Germany and France. Since the positioning of Intel and AMD CPUs in the two aforementioned countries is quite similar to what we have seen in Russia I am just going to quickly breeze through a few notable comparisons.

Intel’s new six-core flagship Core i5-11600K (no cooler) sells for 281 Euros (~$330) on cyberport.de. To access cyberport.de your IP address needs to be located in a German-speaking country

The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X (with the cooler) currently goes for 344 Euros (~$400) on cyberport.de. If you are a German PC hardware enthusiast you are probably familiar with Cyberport

The new Intel Core i7-11700 (with the cooler) retails for 351 Euros (~$410) on cyberport.de. Cyberport sells PC hardware online in Germany and Austria

The Intel Core i7-10700K (no cooler) costs only 327 Euros (~$380) on cyberport.de at the moment. Right now the Intel Core i7-10700K costs less than the Ryzen 5 5600X on cyberport.de

The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is currently priced at 444 Euros (~$520) on cyberport.de. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is not very well-positioned in Germany

The 10-core Intel Core i9-10850K costs 53 Euros (~$60) less than the 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 5800X on cyberport.de. Intel is offering some value here

On www.materiel.net (French website for CPU hardware enthusiasts) Intel's CPUs are better priced than AMD’s as well.

The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X retails for 400 Euros (~$470) on www.materiel.net While the Intel Core i5-10600KF is 100 Euros (~$118) cheaper The Intel Core i7-10700KF costs 165 Euros (~$195) less than the AMD Ryzen 5 5800X on www.materiel.net The AMD Ryzen 5 5800X is pricey in France

Finally we are going to take a very quick look at the pricing situation in the US. On amazon.com the Intel Core i5-11600K (no cooler) is already discounted to 265 Dollars (~€225) whereas the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X (with the cooler) is priced at 399 Dollars (~€340). And the much more capable Intel Core i9-10900F is currently on sale for 349 Dollars (~€295). Pricing-wise things are not looking good for AMD in the US or in Germany or in France or in Russia. I would be surprised if AMD is faring any better in China and Southeast Asia. The Intel Core i9-10900F is a good deal right now on amazon.com

From all the price comparisons that I did over the past two days I was able to draw a few conclusions the first of which is that Intel seems to be competing against itself more than against AMD because AMD’s products are just overpriced at the moment. Second the latest Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 processors are widely available but they are priced uncompetitively. The latest Ryzen 9 CPUs which are AMD’s most competitive offerings are rather hard to come by in the West at this particular point in time. Howbeit Intel’s HEDT parts are starting to look like very compelling options when compared to the overpriced Ryzen 9 5000-series CPUs. Intel seems to be closing in on AMD from every direction leaving no breathing room for AMD in any segment. The fact that you can currently get 4 more physical cores for about 50 Dollars less if you choose to buy a gaming CPU suitable for the RTX 3000-series GPUs from Intel on Amazon goes to show just how real Intel has gotten about competing with AMD in the consumer space. Intel is a meme no more except for the Core i9-11900K of course. However in all fairness to Intel the i9-11900K seems more like a collector’s edition item than an actual CPU that Intel intends sell to the wider public. It is the last of its kind the last purely monolithic design from Intel. All future desktop CPUs from Intel are likely to feature the new tile design combing high-performance cores with high-efficiency cores starting with the Alder Lake parts. Intel seems intent on building new chips using its Foveros 3D packaging technology meaning no more purely monolithic designs. This is why I am willing to give Intel a bit of a pass on the Core i9-11900K. Another conclusion would be that it is likely that things are about to get even more interesting in the consumer CPU space. The battle between the Alder Lake parts and the next-generation Zen CPUs is the one to watch. It is probably going to be close bloody and brutal with both Intel and AMD bringing the best they have to bear on each other. And as to why Intel has decided to start competing against itself my theory is that Intel wants to crowd out AMD. It is trench warfare now with neither AMD nor Intel having the clear technological edge. AMD’s Zen 3 chips are only 5% faster than their Rocket Lake-S counterparts according to our cumulative productivity scores. These are not meaningful margins. All in all Intel seems to be trying to close up the ranks and leave no niche however marginal behind. Whatever your needs are there is no need to turn to AMD Intel has got you covered. At least that is the feeling I get now that Intel offers a wide range of competitively priced CPUs for any budget. Intel seems to be willing to do whatever it takes to claw back as much market share from AMD as it can.

The Amrhein family started with a jewelry business which dates back to 1921 and later added the bridal shop and a winery. Though the bridal shop shares space with AmRhein’s Fine Jewelry that aspect of the business will not be affected and remains open.

As the family prepares to celebrate the 100th anniversary this year members began to reflect on what they wanted the business to look like going forward said Jacquelyn Amrhein-Sells the marketing manager.

“We just decided that we wanted to focus on our passions which are jewelry and wine” she said.

Still it was a difficult decision. Amrhein-Sells said that the bridal store had played a role in at least 3000 weddings and that brides stayed in touch becoming like family.

“It was a lot of joy to be able to work with new brides new families coming together and celebrating that with them” she said. “It was an honor to be a part of that be a part of their new beginning together.”

The store has been busy the last few weeks as it offered remaining gowns at a discount. In addition to local shoppers customers have come from North Carolina and Tennessee to take advantage of the sales Amrhein-Sells said.

“We’re happy that our decision has been a big benefit for them to be able to have their dream wedding and save money on their dress and veils and things like that” she said.

The bridal and jewelry shops currently share space on Ogden Road near Tanglewood Mall. The Amrhein family recently sold the building which Amrhein-Sells said will be subdivided.

AmRhein’s Fine Jewelry is staying put for now leasing space in the building but she said the family is still exploring options for its brick-and-mortar showroom.

“The only big change that we’re making right now is that the bridal store is closing” Amrhein-Sells said. “And it’s not going to affect any of our other businesses that we currently have.”

Intel

Intel recently announced that it will spend $20 billion to build two new fabs in Chandler Arizona—yet another addition to Arizona's growing presence in semiconductor manufacturing.

Intel currently operates four fabs in the United States. In addition to its site in Arizona it also has manufacturing operations in Massachusetts New Mexico and Oregon. Overseas Intel has fabs in Ireland Israel and China.

“Intel is and will remain a leading developer of process technology a major manufacturer of semiconductors and the leading provider of silicon globally” says newly-appointed Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger.

Intel also said that it will act as a foundry for fabless companies with a new division Intel Foundry Services citing Amazon Google Microsoft and Qualcomm as potential customers. The foundry services division will offer its services in both the U.S. and Europe positioning itself as an alternative to Asian chipmakers such as TSMC.

According to Gelsinger Intel’s foundry business will manufacture a range of chips in a market he reckons will be worth $100 billion by 2025 including those based on Arm technology which has historically competed with Intel’s x86 technology.

GlobalFoundries

In early March GlobalFoundries confirmed plans to invest $1.4 billion in 2021 in its global manufacturing capacity. In a typical year GlobalFoundries spends hundreds of millions to expand its production capacity but the growing demand for chips has prompted the world’s fourth-largest chip manufacturer to step on the gas and deliver faster growth.

According to Reuters the $1.4 billion will be equally split between its sites in Dresden New York and Singapore and is expected to lead to a production capacity increase of 13% this year and 20% next year.

Speaking to Reuters GlobalFoundries CEO Thomas Caulfield cited COVID-19 as the catalyst behind the company’s accelerated expansion plans. “The adoption of technology that would normally have taken a decade happened in one year in 2020 because of COVID-19” he said. Prior to the pandemic the chip industry was headed for 5% growth over a five-year window but this has since doubled.

Should demand continue to grow GlobalFoundries may look at building a new plant adjacent to its current Malta New York plant after securing a purchase option agreement for 66 acres of undeveloped land last year. However a decision to build a fab there can only be made if the U.S. Congress funds a set of measures to incentivize U.S. chip manufacturing.

SK Hynix

Outside of the U.S. SK Hynix has been given the green light to build a new 120 trillion won ($106.35 billion) fab complex by South Korean authorities. The complex where the first fab is expected to come online in 2025 after production begins later this year will primarily focus on the production of DRAM for PCs mobile devices and servers using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography.

The 4.15 million square-meter complex will be located near Yongin 50 kilometers south of Seoul and house four fabs which in total will have a planned capacity of around 800000 wafer starts per month. This will make the site one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturing hubs.

The complex will be SK Hynix’s second major DRAM site in South Korea after the company’s DRAM hub near Icheon that is home to its M10 M14 and M16 fabs the latter of which was completed at the beginning of February."
ICE,Intercontinental Exchange,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtbmV3LXlvcmstc3RvY2stZXhjaGFuZ2VzLW1hc3NpdmUtcG9zdC1jb3ZpZC1xdWVzdGlvbi0xMjA2MzI3NjYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The New York Stock Exchange's massive post-COVID question,"A year ago last week March 23 2020 to be exact as COVID-19 was beginning to ravage America the New York Stock Exchange closed its trading floor and moved to all electronic trading. It was the first time in 228 years that the floor was closed but markets remained open. (The floor and trading were both shuttered for two days after Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 and four days after 9/11 more on the latter later.)

The move was said to be temporary and as it turned out the floor was completely shut for the next two months only to reopen in May at 25% capacity. And that’s more or less where things stood until recently when Yahoo Finance has learned the exchange opened up to 50% capacity meaning some 160 brokers and traders are working the floor of the biggest stock market in the world (with listed companies worth some $32 trillion.) Still a small fraction of the thousands who traded there only a few decades ago.

That all-electronic trading at the NYSE went off without a hitch—and during such a wild and crazy 12 months to boot—is both a positive and a negative for the exchange. On the one hand the past year showcased the NYSE’s remarkable technology. Bravo NYSE! On the other hand it makes us realize once and for all that the guys in the funny jackets—the floor brokers specialists and traders—were exactly what we thought they were a colorful anachronism.

NEW YORK NEW YORK - MARCH 20: Traders some in medical masks work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 20 2020 in New York City. Trading on the floor will temporarily become fully electronic starting on Monday to protect employees from spreading the coronavirus.

I don’t begrudge nor do I mean to disparage the men (and it has been almost entirely men) who worked or still work on the floor of the NYSE. (Full disclosure one of my grand uncles and a first cousin once removed owned a seat on the exchange and were specialists for Sprint and some other stocks.) What I’m really saying is that middlemen including those at the NYSE are a dying breed in our economy as technology and the internet have no use for them.

And now as the NYSE looks to go back to work the jobs being brought back to the exchange have been shown to be redundant. As such the positions on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this American institution this epicenter of capitalism are inexorably going the way of bank tellers travel agents and newspaper delivery boys. When the NYSE fully acknowledges this what its plan is and what becomes of the trading floor are all unknown.

“There are floor haters” counters Peter Tuchman a trader for Quattro Securities. “There are press people who are not happy about the floor — just a stick up their a—. Everybody's business has been compromised by technology — publishing news media technology has come into all of our worlds. I don’t know why everybody thinks the floor is a waste of time. That it’s just a show. I think that’s all horse sh—. What the investment community said to us when we were closed is they were thrilled markets were open and tradeable but volatility and price discovery and liquidity were compromised by the lack of human beings.”

A note about Peter Tuchman who’s been working on the floor since 1985. Peter is known as the most photographed person on Wall Street because well with his animated expressions and his distinctive hair styles he takes a great picture. (He’s not a bad quote either as you can see.) I remember decades ago before I knew who he was I just called him Market Dude. Tuchman has become the very personification of the floor the NYSE and even stock trading writ large.

When asked about going all electronic last year NYSE Chief Operating Officer Michael Blaugrund acknowledges it went well but said “we did miss the human judgment and flexibility when the floor was closed. It saves investors money providing more accurate prices and lower volatility. We found the floor when open saves investors about $10 million a day.”

With all due respect to Peter and Michael maybe.

If I had a nickel for every time someone at the NYSE from the CEO down to a junior clerk explained to me that human trading added an element of fairness and liquidity that machines can’t match I could have retired long ago. I do remember thinking during the Nasdaq’s botched Facebook IPO in 2012 ""hmm maybe they have a point."" But that was an aberration and furthermore no one really knows if humans could have prevented those problems.

Truth be told floor trading has been a bit of a buggy whip for quite some time. By 2007 most exchanges around the world had done away with in-person trading and the so-called ""open outcry"" system (which is exactly what it sounds like it is.) And indeed the NYSE began to pull in its horns around then closing an additional trading floor that year and the Stock Exchange Lunch Club (infamous for reactionary practices) a year earlier. By 2017 only 10% of the NYSE’s volume was reportedly done in person. I remember someone years ago describing the floor to me as ""the world's longest funeral.""

“The New York Stock Exchange long ago became an electronic market” said James Angel associate professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business focused on markets and financial exchanges. “The New York Stock Exchange floor for many years has been mostly a media presence” he said. Asked whether human interaction provides value for trading: “You would need a very powerful microscope to see the difference” Angel responded.

Tuchman and Blaugrund would tell you if they had a nickel for every time someone told them that the trading floor and the NYSE’s landmark Beaux Arts building at 11 Wall Street and 18 Broad Street (it’s two structures) was nothing more than a very expensive albeit effective marketing platform for the exchange they too could have retired long ago. But it certainly is that an awesome-looking trading floor with what is essentially an exclusive old-school club upstairs replete with a stunning board room a signature antique clock a secret dining room an enormous Faberge vase (said to be the largest Faberge piece in the world) framed Civil War bonds a Warhol a Led Zeppelin guitar and lord knows what else. Honestly the whole thing is very cool. People i.e. CEOs senators heads of state and civilians alike all love to see this stuff.

So even if you accept that in-person trading does benefit investors you also have to accept that it isn’t much it’s less every year and that most of the value of physical exchange is for marketing.

Recently though we found out that the NYSE is contemplating leaving the space and in fact leaving New York City altogether or at least threatening to. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal NYSE president Stacey Cunningham warned the exchange might leave over a proposed financial transaction tax.

“The New York Stock Exchange belongs in New York. If Albany lawmakers get their way however the center of the global financial industry may need to find a new home…We’ve proved by pandemic-driven necessity that we can close the physical trading floor on a moment’s notice and maintain service without missing a beat.”

Cunningham mentioned Florida and Texas as tax-friendly states and lawmakers from both states wasted no time telling Cunningham to come on down the taxes—and the weather—are fine.

For some more context here remember that the Intercontinental Exchange bought the NYSE in 2013. (The company’s stock ticker ICE has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years btw.) ICE’s CEO is billionaire Jeff Sprecher husband of former Georgia U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler. It’s been a rocky time for the couple who came under fire for stock trades made after Loeffler was privately briefed early last year as a government official regarding the dangers of the COVID pandemic. (A Senate Ethics Committee probe later cleared the couple.) Loeffler lost her high profile Senate race to Raphael Warnock and she sold her WNBA team the Atlanta Dream after clashing with players over their support for Black Lives Matter.

Before I comment more on the disposition of the exchange and its trading floor I want to go into some NYSE history by no means all of it because that could and does fill many books but just a few interesting bits. You might know how the exchange was founded in 1792 by 24 brokers who gathered underneath a buttonwood tree in downtown Manhattan to hammer out some principles. Fun fact: One of the signers of the Buttonwood Agreement which of course the NYSE displays was Leonard Bleecker the namesake of Bleecker Street.

Before its august buildings were constructed NYSE trading took place in a number of locations including the Tontine Coffee House all settings for countless panics runs crashes and routes as well as melt-ups crazy rallies and blow outs. The exchange has been and continues to be a real-time roller coaster scorekeeping mechanism of the American economy. What could possibly be wilder than that?

Besides the market action though the New York Stock Exchange has witnessed a full assortment of historical drama: A massive unsolved bombing in 1920 nearly in front of the exchange which killed 40 people. (It was a horse-drawn wagon bomb. Can you imagine?) On the other side of things there was the time Abbie Hoffman and his band of Yippies invaded the gallery of the exchange in 1967 and showered the floor with dollar bills.

And remember the New York Sack Exchange? That was the name given to the New York Jets ferocious defensive line Gastineau Klecko Salaam and Lyons who were invited to ring the opening bell at the NYSE in November 1981.

For the 1987 movie “Wall Street” Oliver Stone received rare permission to shoot on the NYSE floor during trading hours. (Sidenote: My other favorite Wall Street movie “Trading Places” was shot in 1982 in the COMEX at 4 World Trade Center—the filmmakers were first turned down by the Chicago Merc—on a weekend because Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd were too much of a distraction during market hours.)

On Aug. 4 1995 Maria Bartiromo (before she went all deep Fox) became the first journalist to report live from the floor of the exchange where she was often bumped and jostled sometimes intentionally it seemed in the then mayhem that often consumed the floor. Those were the days my trader friends.

The following decade brought us the Shakespearean mega scandal over the $188 million pay package given to then NYSE CEO Dick Grasso with billionaire and NYSE director Ken Langone as Grasso’s ally. Those two warred bitterly against their nemesis then New York State Attorney General Elliot Spitzer. In the end Grasso won because a judge ruled that when the NYSE went from a nonprofit to for profit corporation NYSE no longer fell under the state’s purview.

Along the way I had a few NYSE experiences too. I’ve rung the bell there twice once wearing a top hat. (Of course all kinds of other riffraff besides me have been bell ringers: A few of my favorites: Snoop Darth Vader and Mr. Potato Head.) But my most memorable NYSE experience actually took place about a mile and a half away from the exchange at 5 Penn Plaza on Monday September 17 2001 the day the stock exchange resumed trading after 9/11.

First remember the exchange never opened on Tuesday 9/11 and then was closed the rest of the week because of the immediate dangers from the site of the terrorist attack just blocks away as well as for Americans and the economy to get their bearings. And so reopening the exchange was the stuff of the highest drama—and it happened to be my very first day working for CNN.

At around 8:45 a.m. I entered the building which was near Madison Square Garden and was directed up to a floor with a terrace facing south overlooking the still smoldering ruin of what used to be the Twin Towers. I was shown over to two directors' chairs one occupied by the anchor Paula Zahn. We were introduced and Paula asked me “Do you know about the stock market and all that because it’s not my area of expertise.” Affirmative I answered. “Oh” she added “we’re going to Lou Dobbs who’s on the floor of the exchange. Are you good with that?” Also affirmative. (This was before Dobbs went all deep Fox.) Paula and I chatted a bit (we would work together for a number of years after) until the director counted us in to the market open at 9:30 a.m. I knew it was going to be a bloodbath and it was. And Paula Lou and I covered it live. The Dow fell 684 points a 7.1% decline (airlines and insurance stocks fared even worse) a record at the time for biggest one session loss.

It was a day I will never forget. But I know that a million other people have a million other powerful memories of the NYSE too. That’s why the physical NYSE and its trading floor really are a thing.

NEW YORK NY - SEPTEMBER 11: Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange participate in a moment of silence in remembrance of the events of September 11 2001 on September 11 2015 in New York City. Throughout the nation people are holding somber gatherings and memorial events to reflect on the 14-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that resulted in the loss of nearly 3000 people. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)

And it can’t just disappear. So says the exchange at least.

First the NYSE’s Blaugrund confirmed that the exchange was looking to go back to full capacity. ""We certainly intend to but we don’t have a timeline.” he said. “Hopefully we can get back to an ordinary course of business sometime this year.”

What about the future?

“Unequivocally we're going to continue to have an active robust floor as part of the NYSE” Blaugrund said. “The floor itself adds a lot of value to issuers and investors. It is a core part of our DNA.""

Really? But how can the exchange justify the expense of the process of human interaction never mind maintaining the building (which it owns but still?) Blaugrund hints at something in the works: “We’re investing in a new generation of technology for the floor brokers and for our options trading floor” he said. “All will come online over the next 24 months. This is something that’s part of our past and present but also part of our future.”

Hmm I’m intrigued.

Fifty years ago February 8 1971 to be exact the Nasdaq began operations as the world's first electronic stock market. Yep the Nasdaq kind of figured it out from the get go. Tellingly it’s even not apparent who the key personalities were in creating the exchange. (It appears Gordon Macklin for one was instrumental.) Contrast that with the 24 signers of the Buttonwood Agreement from the 18th century. That contrast speaks volumes to the different paths the NYSE and Nasdaq have taken.

Of course the NYSE has now gone whole hog following Nasdaq's technology lead. But even as the Nasdaq has pooh-poohed the NYSE as an in-person dinosaur the all-tech exchange has added more pizazz and real-time features to its Times Square MarketSite headquarters over the years. With the giant neon video billboard the bell-ringing the meeting rooms the huge new cocktail space and terrace Nasdaq spends a fortune on in-person New York City marketing too. So what does that tell you?

Kenny Polcari chief executive of Kace Capital Advisors who worked on the floor of the NYSE for 38 years until he left in 2019 reminisced a bit about his time on the floor: “I was there during what I would consider the greatest period for markets: The 80s and 90s and early part of the 21st century because it was energetic exciting. It was 5500 type-A personalities in the place. It was everything you could possibly imagine about being at the heart of capitalism.

“Could you make the argument it’s all electronic and we don’t need it? Of course you could” Polcari said. “People can say [the exchange] doesn’t matter; it does matter. [Executives from] a listed company whose market is the New York Stock Exchange still absolutely love to go there. They love to bring their business there their company there to show it off. It says something about who you are as a company when you are listed at the New York Stock Exchange. It’s part of the fabric of the nation and it’s got this presence that people around the world are just amazed with. It is an incredible American institution.”

But will there be people on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 20 years Kenny? “No I don’t think so” he said. “I’m not sure there will be people on the floor in five years.”

Then what will be there? Though the NYSE is loath to admit it the exchange does need the physical presence for…gulp...marketing. Will the exchange ever own up to the floor just being that? And would that make the floor less of a thing?

As the NYSE now returns to work from its COVID winter this is its $32 trillion problem to figure out.

Upper West Siders treated themselves to ice cream long before the likes of Emack and Bolio’s and Shake Shack came along. The building at 302 Columbus Avenue at 74th street offers a window into the neighborhood’s sprinkle-covered past.

At the top of the red brick façade of 302 Columbus Avenue sits a black triangular rooftop. And on its front spelled out in white block letters a sign reads “The J.M. Horton Ice Cream Company.” Although it’s been converted into residential apartments with a Lenwich sandwich shop on the ground floor the building was originally home to the “largest ice cream manufacturer in the world.” James Madison Horton an Upper West Sider himself (at the time of his death he lived on west 126th) bought a small New York based ice cream company in 1865. Horton renamed the firm (previously Jacob Fussel and Company) and expanded the business.

The J.M. Horton Ice Cream Company had tremendous success. By 1893 Horton claimed to provide 3/5ths of all of New York’s ice cream and the company produced more than 3 million gallons annually. Horton supplied ice cream to railroad dining cars transatlantic liners festivals and of course to private New York City events. The business was featured in New York’s great industries: exchange and commercial review embracing also historical and descriptive sketch of the city its leading merchants and manufacturers published in 1884:

The features of distinguished enterprise in the development of the varied resources of the metropolitan city of New York have no more fitting or more satisfactory representatives than the famous J.M. Horton Ice Cream Company. The perfection and popularization of the delicious confection of ice cream is greatly due to the energetic and conscientious exertions of Mr. J.M. Horton the talented president who embarked in the business with the laudable intention of making his house the greatest in the world in his line and it is a satisfaction to be able to say that he and his colleagues have fully succeeded and the J.M. Horton Ice Cream Company to-day stands unrivaled in its line head and shoulders above all competitors and with an international reputation for supplying the purest and most palatable ice cream ever manufactured.

By 1897 302 Columbus appeared in advertisements listed as a branch of the company (see image below).

When the bottom fell out of North American stock markets a year ago few investors would have imagined how unsettled the world would remain a year later even after a massive financial rebound.

People were in panic mode back in February and March of 2020 recalls Candice Bangsund portfolio manager for Fiera Capital.

“Investors were liquidating their portfolios aggressively in response to the uncertainty and the unprecedented nature of the pandemic” she said in an interview. “As a result a lot of investors likely missed the corresponding upturn that ensued.”

When Bangsund and other market-watchers look back at the past year a reminder for nervous investors to hang on for the long term even during the wildest market gyrations is an often-repeated takeaway.

The The Toronto Stock Market lost 38 per cent of its value in four weeks in early 2020 including three days in which it fell by more than 1000 points. On March 23 it plunged to a low of 11172 points.

“March was particularly crazy” said Colin Cieszynski chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. “It was hard to get a read on anything because markets were gyrating so much.

“Forget about day to day from hour to hour.”

Unprecedented moves by global central banks to cut interest rates to rock-bottom levels and subsequent fiscal stimulus prevented a depression and provided needed support for the rebound and very lucrative market conditions that currently exist.

Investors were not expecting that type of unprecedented policy response said Bangsund.

“The timing and the magnitude of the support completely exceeded expectations and has been a key source of that upswing that we saw through 2020.” By August of 2020 markets were well into rebound territory.

Now stock indexes have gone on to set record highs — the S&P 500 closed above 4000 points for the first time on Thursday — with analysts predicting continued growth throughout the year.

“At the end of the year things were actually positive and a relatively good year. Obviously it was a roller-coaster ride of a generation or a lifetime” said Allan Small senior investment adviser at IA Private Wealth.

Technology led during the downturn as companies tied to people working from home prospected. Ottawa based Shopify Inc. became the most valuable company on the TSX as retailers rushed to open online versions of their stores. The technology sector also provided a defensive tool to offset declines when markets soured.

But like Bangsund Small believes some Canadian investors missed out on the recovery by bailing out too soon or moving to defensive positions.

“I think those that bailed fully they were sorry they did. Those that hung into the market obviously they were rewarded for doing so.”

Small said he was able to convince all of his clients to at a minimum stay the course while many increased their investments.

“All my clients were happy they did and for those that added they were even happier.”

The number of Canadian stock market transactions surged throughout 2020 according to monthly trading statistics from the TMX which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange TSX Venture Exchange TSX Alpha Exchange and Montreal Exchange.

The number of transactions more than doubled to 57.5 million while their value surged almost 80 per cent to $350.8 billion in March from $195.4 billion in March 2019. For all of 2020 the value of transactions increased 34 per cent to $2.5 trillion.

Similar growth was seen across North American stock exchanges particularly from retail investors interested in technology and life sciences.

Sales of mutual funds and ETFs (exchange traded funds) also increased although they dipped during the depth of market sell-off according to data from the Investment Funds Institute of Canada.

The past year reinforces why people were wise to invest throughout the turmoil said Crystal Maloney head of equity research at CIBC Asset Management.

“If you aren’t invested during these key times of recovery you can give up a lot of your long-term returns as we’ve seen time and time again.”

The level of trading activity is a good indication that people were positioning more defensively last year and then switched to the reopening trade in anticipation of vaccine development and inoculations she said.

While the financial market response to the onset of the pandemic was not typical it would have been understandable if markets had fallen even more sharply than they did said Eric Lascelles chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management.

“Indeed it was a source of some frustration for savvy investors that there was not a juicier buying opportunity last spring” he said in an email.

The stock market normally significantly overreacts to economic shocks but this time the response was more rational than usual.

That’s because the market learned important lessons from the prior decade when equities fell too far during the global financial crisis. And this time the pandemic was inherently artificial with governments restricting activities and providing unprecedented stimulus that curtailed distress.

While a market rebound well in advance of the underlying economy is normal the degree of enthusiasm was unusual so soon after a recession he said.

“We expect further rapid growth over the next few years and ultimately little scarring” Lascelles said adding that while valuations are high by historical standards they are attractive compared with the ultra low-yield bond market.

“In other words the risk premium enjoyed by equity-holders remain sufficiently large to make current valuations tolerable and likely sustainable.”

On Monday the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) celebrated the beginning of trading of the UAE’s flagship crude oil as the key futures contract on the IFAD commodities exchange in a move that marks a major change in how Abu Dhabi prices its crude exports.

The ICE Murban Futures are physically-delivered contracts with one futures contract equalling 1000 barrels of Murban crude delivered from Adnoc’s storage terminal in Fujairah. The rise of Murban as a freely traded crude similar to Europe’s Brent or US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) will not only allow the energy industry and its customers with a more favourable and transparent pricing mechanism but also open up the UAE’s treasured oil to increased access around the world — making it more appealing to refiners in key markets.

Of course IFAD is also supported by current customers and concession holders for Murban crude — such as BP ENEOS GS Caltex PetroChina Shell and TOTAL. Significantly IFAD contracts will be cleared at ICE Clear Europe along with other global oil benchmarks such as ICE Brent ICE WTI and ICE (Platts) Dubai thereby allowing its customers to benefit from associated margin offsets at the exchange.

Alongside the fact that the crude grade makes up more than half of the UAE’s total output the IFAD trading paves the way for the emergence of Murban as a new benchmark for the oil industry setting the bar for pricing oil in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) region. Indeed with Brent’s output declining Murban could well surpass existing benchmarks in the future.

While the UAE has taken great strides in diversifying its economy over the years with a demonstrated goal of depending less on oil the Murban trading on IFAD also reflects the country’s keenness to optimise its crude assets and create new opportunities within the hydrocarbon sector – which accounts for around 30 per cent of its GDP – alongside its long-term green investment strategies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvc2V4LWFuZC10aGUtY2l0eS0zLXVucmVhbGlzdGljLWVsZW1lbnRzLXNob3ctYXNpZGUtY2Fycmllcy1maW5hbmNlcy5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Sex and the City': 3 Unrealistic Elements of the Show Aside From Carrie's Finances,"Carrie Bradshaw’s finances make no sense. Most ‘Sex and the City’ fans can agree with that. Her financial health wasn’t the only unrealistic element of the series though. In fact several moments left fans speechless because they were so unbelievable.

Sex and the City was provocative for its time. It was among the first shows to offer a realistic portrayal of sex and dating in a big city. Still the show was not without its problems. While most fans note that Carrie Bradshaw’s finances make no sense other elements of the series are completely unrealistic too.

Everyone on Sex and the City acted like the subway was a last resort

Sex and the City star Sarah Jessica Parker has lived in Manhattan for most of her adult life and Michael Patrick King calls the Village home. Still they allowed the show’s characters to act as if the subway was an absolute last resort. In six seasons Carrie took the subway exactly once and that was only because she was late to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.

New York City | Archive Photos/Getty Images

While Carrie and her pals acted as if only the fiscally challenged take the subway that couldn’t be further from the truth. The subway system is the most efficient way to navigate Manhattan. Everyone from celebrities to stockbrokers utilizes the system every single day. Financial savings are an afterthought. If Carrie and her pals really took cabs everywhere they would not only be broke but they would also have been perpetually late.

Carrie Bradshaw remaining friends with Mr. Big after her affair was completely unrealistic

Carrie and Mr. Big’s affair in season 3 ruined not only Big’s marriage to Natasha but it ended Carrie’s relationship with Aidan Shaw. The following season Carrie and Aidan got back together. Their renewed romance was completely relatable but the storyline fell short when Carrie couldn’t seem to understand why Aidan would be bothered by her maintaining a friendship with Big.

To make the storyline even less realistic Aidan and Mr. Big ended up marginally friendly when all was said and done. Fans point out that Carrie was incredibly naïve to think that meeting up with Mr. Big one-on-one while dating Aidan was an appropriate thing to do. After decades of dating in Manhattan her naivety was incredibly unrealistic.

Sex and the City fans point out that Charlotte York’s apartment was unrealistic

Charlotte York was desperate to be a “Park Avenue Princess.” She achieved that dream when she married Trey MacDougal and moved into his Park Avenue apartment. After less than a year of marriage the couple filed for divorce. Trey in a show of goodwill gave Charlotte the condo and moved out. While Trey’s gesture was meant to show that deep down he was a good guy just not the right guy for Charlotte it was unrealistic.

Sarah Jessica Parker and Kristin Davis | Bill Davila/FilmMagic

Trey’s apartment technically was not his to give away. His mother Bunny MacDougal pointed out that the apartment wasn’t Trey’s but rather it belonged to the MacDougal family. It seems incredibly unlikely that a single telegram from Trey would lead to Bunny giving up the family apartment. It becomes even more dubious when you remember that Charlotte signed a prenuptial agreement that outlined what she would get if the couple were to divorce. The apartment was never included in that document."

Shares of the company were up about 4% in aftermarket trading.

Demand for IFF's products held as consumers stretched their budgets to shop for food ingredients to prepare more meals at home which led to consumer goods manufacturers restocking their inventory.

Benefits from significant price hikes taken in the past quarters helped IFF in countering still-high labor and manufacturing costs.

International Flavors & Fragrances posted adjusted profit of $1.13 per share for the quarter ended March 31 compared with analysts' estimate of 87 cents per share according to LSEG data.

The company further gained from the divestiture of its Savory Solutions and cosmetic ingredients units as well as its pharma unit which IFF said it would sell to French plant-based ingredients maker Roquette.

The company's quarterly volumes grew mid-single digits while improving nearly across all businesses.

The company now expects annual sales to be at the high end of its prior forecast range of $10.8 billion to $11.1 billion. It also sees full-year volumes at the high end of its prior expectation of flat to 3% rise.

IFF's fiscal 2024 pricing is expected to increase about 1% compared with its prior forecast of a decline of 2.5%.

For the first quarter the company posted net sales of $2.90 billion compared with analysts' average estimate of $2.78 billion.

The company also said its finance chief Glenn Richter has planned to retire in December 31 2024."

Citizens hit the streets in protest. They threw bananas and yogurt in Iceland and rocks in Pakistan. Governments fell. Authorities launched hundreds of tax probes and criminal investigations.

“This is an earthquake” CNN columnist Frida Ghitis said at the time. “The aftershocks will continue for months even years to come.”

She was right.

Half a decade later the Panama Papers’ revelations about how the offshore financial system enables greed and treachery continue to roil political and economic systems worldwide.

In just the past month alone more than 300 news articles in 14 languages referenced the Panama Papers as authorities continue to pursue investigations and push for reforms a search of the Nexis news database shows.

Among the Panama Papers-related developments in the month of March:

In Malta authorities charged Keith Schembri former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s chief of staff with money laundering and fraud as a result of an investigation sparked in part by the Panama Papers — and a court heard more testimony about the car-bomb assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia a Maltese journalist who used evidence from the trove of documents in her exposés of high-ranking government officials.

In Peru Rafael López Aliaga a presidential candidate came up empty in his push to get a court to halt a continuing investigation of his role in a Panama Papers-related money laundering case.

In Denmark the country’s tax minister cited the Panama Papers to justify hiring hundreds of new employees to bolster the fight against tax fraud.

In the U.S. prosecutors revealed the third guilty plea in a tax fraud case that came to light through the Panama Papers and lawmakers cited the Panama Papers to support the push to enact two landmark pieces of legislation now before Congress — the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act and the For the People Act a voting rights bill that’s being called “the boldest democracy reform since Watergate.”

Beyond individual countries the Panama Papers has become a global touchstone of the debate around corruption financial crime and inequality. It is cited in parliaments and courthouses and movie studios.

Just as Watergate became both a landmark in the history of journalism and a shorthand for political tricksterism the Pulitzer Prize-winning Panama Papers investigation has inspired many journalists to embrace a new kind of leading-edge journalism — and its alliterative name has come to serve as a shorthand for financial perfidy by the globe’s ruling elite.

“On a personal level there was a before and after Panama Papers in my journalism career” said Mariel Fitz Patrick an Argentine journalist who worked on the investigation. She was shocked by the number of journalists around the planet — more than 370 from 76 news organizations — who worked in secret on the project for more than a year. In Argentina she told ICIJ recently “that experience would mark a new path for us in the way we do journalism and in our future investigations.”

In the broader world actor Meryl Streep who starred in the Netflix movie “The Laundromat” heads a growing list of popular culture stars who have brought the shadowy mechanics of offshore-enabled financial crime into homes and common parlance through works that reference the Panama Papers — cartoons films quiz shows such as “Jeopardy!” and National Public Radio’s “Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me” and television series such as “Billions” and “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.”

Financial experts meanwhile continue to fret over the risks of “another Panama Papers” or whether a “new Panama Papers” is needed to keep up the fight against dirty money. An anti-corruption consultant advised in December: “High net worth individuals need to take certain proactive steps to avoid being lumped together with Yakuza crime bosses and kleptocrats in the aftermath of the next Panama Papers-type scandal.”

The Panama Papers’ revelations also continue to resonate for transparency advocates around the world according to Lakshmi Kumar policy director at Global Financial Integrity a U.S.-headquartered research and advocacy group.

The crimes and case studies unearthed by the media partnership’s investigation have provided colorful easy-to-explain fodder for groups like hers that work to persuade government authorities to embrace tougher standards for financial accountability and transparency.

“The Panama Papers woke everyone up” Kumar said in an interview this week. “It was the first big thing that everyone remembers … Even five years down the road those examples that the Panama Papers revealed are just as relevant. They haven’t gone out of fashion.”

A massive leak

ICIJ and its partners began publishing their explosive Panama Papers disclosures at 2 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on April 3 2016.

ICIJ McClatchy the Miami Herald German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung and other media partners spent more than a year sifting through 11.5 million leaked files to expose offshore holdings of current and former world leaders and more than 100 other politicians and public officials across the globe.

The files which Süddeutsche Zeitung obtained and shared with ICIJ and other partners came from Mossack Fonseca a little-known but powerful law firm based in Panama with branches in Hong Kong Zurich and dozens of other places.

The law firm’s leaked internal files contained information on 214488 offshore entities connected to people in more than 200 countries and territories. The data included emails financial spreadsheets passports and corporate records revealing the secret owners of bank accounts and companies in 21 outposts in the offshore system from Nevada to the British Virgin Islands to Singapore.

It was in short a treasure trove for investigative reporters — and for anyone interested in knowing how the rich and famous and corrupt and criminal play with their money offshore. Former South African President Thabo Mbeki called the revelations “a massive blow to financial secrecy.”

“Panama Papers” quickly became the No. 1 trending item on Twitter worldwide. In the first several weeks 72 stories and data products produced by ICIJ were visited more than 80 million times by people in more than 200 countries and territories. Media partners’ stories reached an audience that numbered in the hundreds of millions across digital print and broadcast.

A cartoon in the New Yorker magazine showed a businessman looking out of the window of his office with his young heir at his side surveying the smokestacks and office towers of his empire: “Son someday soon this will all be exposed in the Panama Papers.” A Sunday edition of the iconic American newspaper comic Doonesbury showed a high-ranking official from the fictitious nation of “Berzerkistan” learning that he’d been exposed in the Panama Papers as having salted away $1.835 billion offshore. “SO THAT’S WHERE I PUT IT!” he exclaims.

Some real-life politicians lost their jobs — even their freedom.

Iceland’s prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned following nationwide protests after revelations that he and his wife owned a company in the British Virgin Islands. Politicians in Mongolia Spain and beyond also fell.

In 2017 Pakistan’s Supreme Court removed from office the country’s longest-serving prime minister Nawaz Sharif as result of the Panama Papers’ revelations about his family’s properties overseas. A year later he was sentenced in the case to 10 years in prison on corruption charges and fined $10.6 million.

Follow the money

From Day 1 of the Panama Papers governments around the world traced whatever previously hidden dollars euros yen and other currencies they could. Countries have recouped more than $1.36 billion in unpaid taxes fines and penalties as a result of inquiries sparked by the Panama Papers according to ICIJ’s latest tally.

In the last two years ten countries including Australia Belgium Denmark Germany and Italy reported recovering more than $185 million in new money as a result of Panama Papers-inspired investigations. Norway for the first time disclosed that it has clawed back almost $34 million. Hundreds of tax probes against individuals and companies remain open according to reporting gathered by ICIJ and its partners.

Parliaments — embarrassed by the revelations or seeking to harness public outrage to plug fiscal holes in budgets drained by tax evasion — have enacted new laws.

The government of Panama which initially denounced the Panama Papers as a campaign to “distort the facts and tarnish the reputation of the country” ultimately signed a multilateral convention to share foreign taxpayers’ information with other nations. New Zealand tightened its trust laws to prevent further abuses by foreigners attracted by the country’s once pristine reputation. Since then the number of so-called foreign trusts in New Zealand has plummeted 75%.

In the United Kingdom members of parliament repeatedly referenced the Panama Papers when passing legislation in 2017 that created the country’s first criminal offense for lawyers who do not report clients’ tax evasion. Last September Ghana’s registrar general said that the Panama Papers was instrumental in his government passing a new law that required owners of companies in Ghana to identify themselves. Ghana is now one of 81 countries to approve such laws — more than double the number since 2018.

In the U.S. the Panama Papers helped persuade Congress to write and pass the Corporate Transparency Act which requires owners of U.S. companies to disclose their identities to the Treasury Department. The legislation the biggest revision of American anti-money laundering controls since the post-9/11 Patriot Act was signed into law in January.

Gary Kalman the head of Transparency International in the U.S. who lobbied for the bill said that the Panama Papers and the so-called “Emma Watson Effect” were especially useful.

For years opponents of ownership registries argued that celebrities millionaires and other high-profile citizens needed anonymous companies to avoid the paparazzi — or even kidnappers. The example of Watson the Harry Potter film star who the Panama Papers revealed owned an offshore company for what her representatives said were “privacy reasons” helped Kalman give legislators a concrete example of why registries posed no risk to law-abiding citizens.

Under the new U.S. law Kalman said celebrities or high profile people would be confidentially revealed to the U.S. government but their names would not be publicly available. “Bottom line if you are not doing anything illegal there is really no reason to fear a beneficial ownership directory” he said.

Not everyone was happy with the new law.

“Some will say that this all started in 2016 when a Panamanian law firm made headlines” a Forbes contributor wrote in January complaining that the new law had “killed off Incognito Mode” in the world of business. “The information in these documents was so scandalous that ordinarily boring legal documents took on a snappy moniker: ‘the Panama Papers.’”

The moniker has also become a catchword beyond the realm of politics and government.

I think it is fair to say that the Panama Papers project introduced cross-border journalism to the world. — Jóhannes Kr. Kristjánsson Icelandic journalist

The Panama Papers have been referenced in thousands of academic papers including articles such as “Speaking Truth to Power: Twitter Reactions to the Panama Papers” in the Journal of Business Ethics and “Structural studies of the global networks exposed in the Panama Papers” in Applied Network Science.

The Panama Papers even pops up in an August 2016 article in the European Journal of Political Theory titled “Aristotle and the problem of oligarchic harm” and in a 2018 review in an organizational studies journal that explores the “speculative anthropology” of novelist David Foster Wallace.

At least a dozen books have been published about the Panama Papers — including one by Frederik Obermaier and Bastian Obermayer the German journalists who obtained the leaked data and another by former ICIJ journalist Jake Bernstein “Secrecy World” which became the inspiration for filmmaker Steven Soderbergh’s movie “The Laundromat” starring Streep Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas.

At the movie’s September 2019 premiere at the Venice International Film Festival Streep said the film sought to use humor to tell a “very dark black-hearted joke — a joke that’s being played on all of us” by the clients and operatives of the offshore world.

Global journalism

The Panama Papers continues to be cheered too as a pathbreaking model for international reporting and collaborative journalism.

Jóhannes Kr. Kristjánsson an Icelandic journalist who did the digging within and outside the document trove that brought down his country’s prime minister spent almost a year working in his apartment unable to tell anyone else in his small nation what he was doing.

He says his in-laws “really thought I was just a lousy bum or something not working on anything.”

In his lonely striving he leaned on the support of “great journalists all around the world” — project partners who were also secretly sleuthing through the same document set. Some remain his close friends five years later.

One regret with the project is he never got a chance to taste the ice cream flavor — Wintris — that a local shop in Reykjavík named after the offshore company secretly controlled the Panama Papers showed by the prime minister and his wife.

Kristjánsson believes the kind of global collaboration among journalists that made the Panama Papers investigation possible is a crucial weapon in the defense of democracy.

“I think it is fair to say that the Panama Papers project introduced cross-border journalism to the world” Kristjánsson told ICIJ this week. “It is a really powerful tool when journalists in many countries work together on the same story and publish at the same time. This is extremely important for journalists in countries where human rights and press freedom are violated.”

Fitz Patrick one of five Argentine journalists who initially worked on the Panama Papers said the project inspired her to continue to delve into issues related to money laundering and international financial crimes. And she said it inspired the Argentine reportng partners to continue to work across the lines of news outlets’ traditional rivalries — treating each other as allies instead of adversaries.

“Working with a competing media company? That was unthinkable until that moment in Argentina” Fitz Patrick said.

A 2018 article in the International Journal of Communication said that the Panama Papers and ICIJ’s next offshore secrecy investigation — the Paradise Papers — have helped show the way to a new kind of international reporting that wrestles with an increasingly complex and networked world.

Traditionally the article notes international journalism has been “foreign correspondence” which brings back home to a domestic audience news from far-away lands about elections trains crashes and other one-off events.

In contrast the piece says ICIJ’s “global network journalism” goes beyond the “traditional national comfort zone” by bringing together journalists from around the planet to deeply analyze and expose murky transnational systems like the offshore world.

This kind of reporting is vital in an era when dirty money can move halfway around the world with the click of a computer key and offshore operatives are adept at hiding wealth behind Russian doll-like configurations of front men shell companies and trusts.

“My reporting on the Panama Papers and other subsequent leaks has made me realise how broken the international system is” said Jacob Borg a Maltese journalist who has been shoved and insulted while reporting on what he calls the “mafia-like tentacles exposed by the Panama Papers” in his small European country.

Last month — 59 months after the Panama Papers investigation was released — Maltese authorities charged Keith Schembri the powerful chief of staff to the country’s prime minister from 2013 to 2019 with fraud and money laundering. The Panama Papers revealed that Schembri owned two secretive offshore companies. He resigned in 2019 after police questioned him during a probe into the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia who had earlier connected Schembri’s offshore dealings to corruption.

“Whilst dirty money flows easily across borders it often takes local authorities weeks months and years to catch up and gather information about these illicit flows” Borg said. “Collaborative journalism has proven to be a lot more efficient.”

In Asia robots have been employed in healthcare to perform varying tasks. As in the U.S. autonomous machines can travel through surgical areas and patient rooms using ultraviolet light to disinfect surfaces. During the pandemic mobile robots in China have also been used to monitor people's temperatures and deliver food. That way human-to-human contact can be minimized.

However when the topic of robots and healthcare comes up it's the image of robotic surgery that is usually conjured in people's minds. When it comes to robotic surgery one name stands out: Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.44%).

The device maker famous for its da Vinci surgical robots has established its dominance in the Western Hemisphere. Its machines for remote-operated urologic and colorectal surgery gallbladder removal hernia repairs and even cardiothoracic surgery as well as head and neck procedures are the pride of many hospitals. As manufacturers in South Korea China and Japan begin to roll out rival machines the company is pushing deeper into the Far East to stake its claim to the enormous opportunity ahead.

Smooth sailing so far

Currently Intuitive sells its da Vinci system directly to healthcare entities in China Japan South Korea India and Taiwan. Those five countries represent a population of 3 billion people nine times that of the U.S. It's no wonder the company is focused on the growth opportunity in this market. Although the pandemic disrupted the growth trajectory in 2020 the region's importance is clear routinely making up about one in six device sales.

Year Units Sold in Asia Percent of Units Sold in Asia 2020 157 17% 2019 182 16% 2018 116 13% 2017 108 16% 2016 96 18%

That number's growth will likely accelerate. The company only began selling in India and Taiwan in 2018 and established a joint venture with China's Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical in 2019. In China the government sets a purchase quota for medical devices including surgical robots. Because of this Intuitive took on a local partner to ensure it captured as many orders as possible. The whole process can take years between the government issuing the quota and actual surgical robots being placed in hospitals.

Despite the slow ramp-up of da Vinci installations China became the company's No. 2 procedure market in 2020. That success has inspired device start-ups in the region to innovate and compete.

Local competition

It is estimated that the surgical robotics market will be worth $10 billion by 2027. More than one quarter of that will be in China. The government isn't typically keen to rely on foreign suppliers and has funded at least 30 medical device start-ups including surgical robotics manufacturers in the past few years. Beijing Tinavi Medical Technologies is one example of a local firm whose surgical robots have been approved and are in use throughout the country. Medical Healthcare Robot BU an industrial robotics firm is also entering the medical arena.

China isn't the only country serving as a hotbed of activity. South Korea and Japan also have companies trying to carve out a slice of the pie for themselves. One company in Korea Curexo developed a device it calls Robodoc to perform hip and knee replacements. Another Meere Company spent a decade developing its Revo-i robot for laparoscopic surgeries before launching in 2017. In Japan Medicaroid Corporation became the first to get a robotic-assisted surgical system approved last August. Luckily for shareholders it's not a winner-take-all proposition.

Enormous potential

At the end of 2020 Intuitive had 3720 da Vinci systems in use in the U.S. That's 112 systems for every 10 million residents. In Asia that number is just three. Due to the difference in median income it's doubtful the company will ever reach the same level of penetration. The cost of the devices and resources required for training are just too much for poorer countries. The fact that there is 37 times more penetration in the U.S. than in Asia does indicate just how much growth is possible over the coming decades.

That growth will likely be uneven. After all Asia isn't one market. While South Korea is renowned for its embrace of innovation validated by the country's quick approvals of new da Vinci devices China funds local competitors and places restrictions on how many devices can even be sold. For shareholders quarter-to-quarter indicators will no doubt produce both hope and frustration along the way. CEO Gary Guthart had it right when he said results in the region would be ""bouncy."" Dealing with different economic systems and regulatory regimes is bound to do that.

If unit sales in Asia continue to grow and the company continues to innovate the next 10 years of the Intuitive Surgical story could match the past 10. The stock has returned 580% in that time. For investors thinking of buying and holding Asia could be its path to a repeat performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He was born on May 13 1934 in Foster City the son of Gerard and Gertrude (Taucher) Broeders. Ted married the love of his life Nancy Tolman on July 11 1953. Together the couple shared 67 years of marriage.

He loved to tinker with carpentry mechanics and enjoyed fixing things. Ted worked at his father’s bar in Gladstone and had many different jobs including Northern Motor Rebuilders until he purchased the LaBranche Tavern in 1971. He completely remodeled it and owned and operated the business with the assistance of his wife and children. Ted lost the bar to a fire and rebuilt it from the ground up.

He and his children worked to build a log cabin while preparing to retire. After 27 years in the bar he sold the business and moved into his pride and joy — the cabin. Ted loved his family dearly and loved spending time with his children and grandchildren — especially making memories camping hunting and fishing.

His brother Tyden Ferris was a two-time runner-up at the MHSAA Individual Wrestling Finals so with a win Saturday at the Division 4 championship meet Caden would have one up on big brother.

The Delton Kellogg junior won those bragging rights and his first title with a thrilling 13-11 overtime victory against 2020 champion Camden Orr of New Lothrop in the 215-pound Final at Van Andel Arena.

“I was obviously very tired but I was counting on that he was more tired than me” Ferris said. “I just guess I had more will to win.”

Ferris (33-2) trailed Orr 7-1 at one point and 10-7 late in the third period before getting a pair of takedowns to send the match to overtime where he secured the winning takedown. As he was trailing early Ferris said his thoughts floated to the sibling rivalry.

“I gotta beat my brother in something” Ferris said of his thoughts. “He never got first.”

Ferris who has committed to Central Michigan came into the meet as the top seed as he technically already defeated Orr in the Regional Final. Orr (24-2) injury defaulted that match however. Despite missing the opportunity to wrestle Orr in the Regional Ferris knew what he was up against.

“I knew he liked to shoot and my favorite move the underhook and I know he likes the fireman that counters that” said Ferris who placed eighth at 215 pounds as a freshman but didn’t wrestle in the Finals as a sophomore. “I practiced a lot of defense mostly offense.”

103

Champion: Connor Younts Clinton Fr. (28-2)

Decision 5-0 over Loreto Frangedakis Capac Sr. (19-4)

Younts already had quite a start to his high school career helping to lead Clinton to a Team Finals trophy this past Tuesday. Now he can add an Individual Finals title after a dominant performance.

He pinned his first two opponents on the day before shutting out the final two 10-0 in the semifinals and 5-0 in the Final.

“I’m just excited” Younts said. “I had to work hard all season. I thought I was going to make it here and I knew I was going to do good. I thought I was going to win and I did.”

Younts was one of an MHSAA-record 11 Clinton wrestlers in the Finals.

112

Champion: Coy Perry Clinton Fr. (31-1)

Decision 3-2 over Connor Busz Clinton Soph. (26-5)

Perry battled a leg injury and his own teammate to claim an individual title in his first season.

The two wrestled each other four times this winter with Perry coming out victorious in each matchup. A third-period takedown was the difference in the latest bout.

“It’s been close every time” Perry said. “It’s tough. When it gets down to this point it’s very emotional. It’s on your own too because obviously (Clinton coaches) can’t coach so it’s on pretty much both of us to determine what we do.”

119

Champion: Aydan Sturtevant-Roesly Hesperia Sr. (25-4)

Decision 2-1 over Zak Shadley Clinton Soph. (28-5)

Sturtevant-Roesly wasn’t sure how his season would go after dislocating his kneecap and tearing a ligament in his knee.

It went pretty well.

After finishing seventh at 103 as a sophomore and sixth at 112 as a junior he reached the top of the podium with a hard-fought victory.

“I’ve been through a lot this season” Sturtevant-Roesly said. “I wasn’t sure how this season was going to play out for me but I came out and we did it. It’s everything. I’ve been working for this for a long time and I really wanted it today.”

125

Champion: Randy Frailey Hanover-Horton Sr. (29-0)

Decision 3-2 over Nik Shadley Clinton Fr. (28-2)

Frailey has been on the podium before finishing eighth at 119 in 2019 but he always envisioned himself at the top of it. Thanks to a late second-period takedown it’s now more than a vision.

“It’s like nothing else” Frailey said. “I’ve always imagined this moment in my head a billion times. It really lived up to it and it’s just amazing.”

After Frailey’s victory he was able to stand matside and watch his teammate Chris Sorrow claim his own title at 135.

“It’s just amazing” Frailey said. “We really fuel each other – he helps me I help him. We’ve come up together so it’s indescribable.”

130

Champion: Jesse Brumm Vermontville Maple Valley Sr. (32-2)

Injury default 3:45 over Bronson Marry Hudson Jr. (25-1)

Brumm had a 5-0 lead in the match before Marry was injured and unable to continue.

It was the fourth all-state finish for Brumm who was third at 130 in 2020 sixth at 119 in 2019 and runner-up at 112 in 2018.

“It’s always been a dream of mine” Brumm said. “I’ve worked hard and I think I deserve it. It’s a miracle to me. I’ve done everything I could for it.”

Marry was making his third-straight Finals appearance as he was the champion at 112 in 2020 and runner-up at 103 in 2019.

135

Champion: Christopher Sorrow Hanover-Horton Sr. (25-1)

Decision 9-3 over Dillon Raab Bark River-Harris Soph. (33-2)

After placing sixth as a junior and seventh as a sophomore – both times at 135 – Sorrow decided to go big this year.

A seven-point third period including five points from nearfalls gave him his first Individual Finals title.

“I wasn’t necessarily going for that but if I saw an opening where his weight shifted I just took it as far as I could” Sorrow said. “I’m ecstatic.

“Like (Frailey) said earlier we’ve been training since sixth grade for this. To come here and accomplish this in our senior year together back to back is just a great feeling.”

140

Champion: Cole Stone Carson City-Crystal Jr. (32-2)

Major Decision 9-1 over George Ames Clinton Jr. (27-1)

After finishing sixth at 140 pounds as a sophomore Stone committed himself even more to wrestling this past offseason and it paid off with a dominant performance in the Finals.

He earned a takedown in each period and added nearfall points in the third to claim his first title against previously unbeaten Ames.

“I’ve been working hard all year” Stone said. “I wanted to leave it all out there. I had nothing to lose. It was a great match. I just went in and tried to attack as much as possible. To come from sixth last year as a sophomore to a state champion it’s surreal. I couldn’t have even imagined this. I’ve visualized this moment multiple times and the feeling is still there.”

145

Champion: Caden Natale Hudson Sr. (27-1)

Decision 4-3 over Kent McCombs Clinton Jr. (29-3)

Natale was making his third appearance in the Finals coming off a championship performance at 130 in 2020 and a runner-up finish at 119 in 2019.

While he was wrestling with torn ligaments in his right knee he took inspiration from a friend who had passed away to fuel him in a hard-fought battle against McCombs who was a runner-up at 145 a year ago.

“I lost a good friend not too long ago” said Natale who also had a third-place finish as a freshman. “I wore a shirt last year wore a shirt this year. I got blood time and I was like ‘I need to do this. It’s not just for me right now it’s for him.’ It was an old club team of ours Inflict Wrestling and that’s what I do. I just keep going and I inflict damage and I just pulled it out because I was just better on my feet.”

152

Champion: Gavin Wilmoth Traverse City St. Francis Jr. (34-1)

Major Decision 14-2 over AJ Baxter Clinton Sr. (28-3)

Wilmoth took a giant leap forward this season going from not making the podium as a sophomore to Finals champion as a junior.

“He was someone standing in the way of my goal and I had to beat him” Wilmoth said. “I was coached up well for this match and I just went out and hammered.

“It’s a relief. I’ve been looking forward to this since like seventh grade. It’s a weight off my shoulders and it feels great.”

Baxter was also a runner-up at 103 as a freshman and fifth at 119 as a sophomore.

160

Champion: Spencer Konz Clinton Sr. (26-3)

Decision 3-1 OT over Shenard Foster Detroit Loyola Jr. (15-2)

In the third postseason matchup between the two it was Konz who came away with the most important victory.

The match was tied at 1-1 deep into overtime and the Clinton senior fought off a leg attack from Foster to come up with a takedown on the edge of the mat and get the victory.

“I just pulled his arm out and I felt the Merkel” said Konz who added his title to a pair of third-place finishes and an eighth-place finish in his career. “I grabbed it and they gave me two for it.”

Foster is the only wrestler at Loyola and finished seventh at 140 a year ago while wrestling for Harper Woods.

171

Champion: Brayden Randolph Clinton Sr. (31-1)

Decision 8-3 over Cole Hopkins Evart Soph. (22-1)

After years of coming close Randolph was able to add an individual title to his two team trophies. He finished as runner-up at 171 and 160 the past two seasons and was third at 160 as a freshman.

He was dominant on his way to securing his title pinning his first three opponents in 37 seconds 1:19 and 2:33.

“This year I’ve been through so much especially family-wise – I lost my grandpa in November” Randolph said. “This one was for him. Just getting over adversity through COVID and all that it means a lot to come out here and do what I love to do and that’s wrestle.”

189

Champion: Logan Badge Clinton Jr. (32-1)

Decision 3-1 over Hunter Belew Delton Kellogg Sr. (33-4)

Badge moved one step closer to becoming a four-time champion as he wrapped up a dominant day with his third individual title.

He won at 189 as a sophomore and 215 as a freshman. On Saturday he cruised to first-period pins in his first three matches winning in 43 seconds 1:22 and 1:12. Belew who placed fifth at 171 as a junior presented a different challenge but one that Badge was able to overcome.

“Right now just one more state title to go” Badge said. “The team is going to be going good for the next couple years; we have a great program. It’s pretty sweet because the guys that are coming are going to help our lineup even more and we have 11 in the Finals.”

285

Champion: Isiah Pasik New Lothrop Jr. (25-0)

Fall 1:16 over Jake Fischer Beaverton Sr. (33-7)

Pasik moved up the podium with a dominant day. He cruised into the Finals with pins in 54 seconds 3:35 and 1:41 before pinning Fischer in a rematch of the Regional Final.

In the championship match Pasik was able to get an early takedown and take Fischer to his back in the opening minute before turning him again to earn the fall.

“I felt pretty good” Pasik said. “I thought I wrestled pretty strong.”

Pasik was coming off a third-place finish at 285 as a sophomore.

This year the Division Four event was held at Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids and consisted of one day of intense action rather than the traditional two.

When the smoke had cleared one Charger came home with a place on the podium as sophomore Grady Iobe put together his best career day as he finished in eighth place in the 215 pound weight class.

Iobe started his day with a very hard fought 6-4 decision win over Ben Smieska of Leslie sending the Charger sophomore to round two to face the eventual state runner-up in Camden Orr of New Lothrop. In a very intense back-and-forth battle it was Orr coming out on top defeating Iobe via an 8-5 decision.

With the loss Iobe was sent to the consolation bracket in search of a spot on the podium a trek that would start with a battle with Cameron Helmboldt of Leroy Pine River. Iobe managed to turn Helmboldt in the second round winning via pin fall in 2:17 assuring himself a medal and a spot on the podium.

In the third round of the consolation bracket Iobe fell to the eventual third place finisher in Andrew Quinn of Mason County Central via pin fall in 1:51 sending the Charger to the seventh place bout. Here Iobe was caught in a quick pinning combination after an early takedown falling to Bryce Tank of Capac in :39 seconds. With his 2-3 record on the day Iobe earned his first All-State honor finishing in eighth place.

Caden Ferris of Delton Kellogg won the 215 pound state championship after defeating Camden Orr of New Lothrop in overtime. Quinn of Mason County Central took third place after defeating Bronson’s Justin Blankenship. Cameron Underwood of Leslie took fifth place followed by Ben Smieska of Leslie in sixth place Tank of Capac in seventh place and Iobe in eighth place.

Junior Garrett Iobe suffered a bit of heartbreak in the 152 pound weight class finishing the day with a record of 1-2. Iobe who finished in third place at 145 pounds in 2020 looked to return to the podium this season but struggled through one of the toughest brackets in the tournament. Iobe started his day with a tough 14-7 decision loss to Scott Cann of Whitmore Lake immediately sending the Charger captain to the consolation bracket.

Iobe rebounded in the first round of the consolation bracket with a pin fall win over Fulton Stroud of Iron Mountain in 2:14 setting up a round two meeting with Kyle Fenner of Whitmore Prescott. Fenner caught Iobe and earned the win via pin fall in 4:02 ending the talented junior’s tournament run.

Union City also sent a pair of seniors to the tournament in Dustin Heckman at 171 pounds and Andrew Linnabury-Smith at 140 pounds. For both Heckman and Linnabury-Smith this was their first trip to the indiviudal state finals.

Heckman received a brutal draw opening up his state final tournament with the top seed and eventual state champion in Brayden Randolph of Clinton. Randolph wasted little time in catching Heckman and earning the win via pin fall in :37 seconds. With the loss Heckman advanced on to the consolation bracket where he faced off with Seth Enos of Onway. The two wrestlers battled but Enos went on to defeat Heckman via pin fall in 2:53 ending the seniors tournament run.

Linnabury-Smith also received a very tough draw facing off with the eventual state champion at 140 pounds in Cole Stone of Carson City Crystal. Linnabury-Smith shot out of the gate but would get caught and fall to Stone via pin fall in 1:07 sending the Charger senior to the consolation bracket to face Cannon Risner of Leslie. Linnabury-Smith showed heart and grit and refused to be pinned but Risner controlled the match defeating Linnabury-Smith via a 13-0 Major Decision ending the talented seniors season and stellar career.

With that the superb 2021 season for the Union City Charger wrestling program comes to an end. The Chargers say goodbye to a handful of seniors in Wyatt King Andrew Linnabury Smith and Dustin Heckman. The cupboard is far from bare for the Chargers however as they return three state placers in the Iobe brothers (Garrett and Grady) and the 2019 state champion at 103 pounds Brayton Mears who has missed out on the last two postseasons due to injury and illness. Combined with state finalist sophomore Colton Russell and undefeated freshman Landyn Crance who also missed the 2021 postseason due to illness along with a stellar returning class and a promising freshman class the future is bright for the two time defending district champions from Union City.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlaHJhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQ1OTQ0OC9Eb2N1bWVudGFyeS10by11bnJhdmVsLWZhc2NpbmF0aW5nLXNlY3JldHMtb2YtSXJvbi1BZ2Utc2l0ZS1pbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Documentary to unravel fascinating secrets of Iron Age site in western Iran,"TEHRAN – Iranian filmmaker Keyvan Tabatabaei-Samimi has made a documentary on Ganj Dareh which was once an Iron Age settlement in western Iran. The site is also one of the cradles of agriculture and livestock domestication in West Asia.

Titled “Ganj Dareh” the film takes a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most important archaeological discoveries in the country jointly conducted by Iranian Danish teams of cultural heritage experts.

In 2019 Iranian and Danish archaeologists and cultural heritage experts discovered new traces of Iron Age occupation in a prehistorical cave during a follow-up archaeology season carried out based on an agreement previously signed between the Razi University of Kermanshah and the University of Copenhagen.

Supervised by Iran’s Research Institute of Cultural Heritage & Tourism the project was co-led by Iranian archaeologist Hojjat Darabi and Professor Tobias Richter from the Department of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies at the University of Copenhagen.

Discoveries were made in Mar-Gurgalan [Sarab] cave that according to Darabi was inhabited some 50000 years ago. “Preliminary results indicate that the cave was inhabited about 50000 years ago and appears to be used both by the Neanderthals for residing and hunting and by the early Homo sapiens” Darabi explained.

The cave was previously excavated by Danish archaeologists in the early 1970s however the excavations were renewed using new scientific methods he added. The team managed to collect new evidence concerning how sedentism and agriculture [domestication of plants and animals] started in the region which is situated in the central Zagros mountain range.

Prof. Ezatollah Negahban (1926 – 2009) who was an Iranian archaeologist known as the father of Iranian modern archaeology believed that caves and rock shelters were particularly attractive living places for the hunter-gatherers of the early Paleolithic period and the geographic situation of the Iranian Plateau with its bordering mountain systems including the Zagros range on the west and the Alborz range on the north has meant that there were many cave sites which would have been suitable for an early cave-dwelling man.

In general the Zagros highlands have been subject to more Stone Age research and investigation than have the Alborz Mountains and therefore a more detailed picture of early cave-dwelling life has been developed for the Zagros region where traces of cave dwellers from the Lower Paleolithic to the Middle Paleolithic Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic periods have been found. Although other parts of Persia have been less investigated than the Zagros highlands traces of cave dwellers have also been found at sites scattered throughout the Iranian Plateau and in the lowlands.

The COVID-19 outbreak created a volatile U.S. third-party logistics market in 2020 which presented growth opportunities for 3PLs with strong carrier management e-commerce and airfreight forwarding capabilities while other 3PLs did not fare as well.

After a lackluster 2019 in which transportation activity declined year-over-year as import tariffs took hold the industry awoke to a pandemic nightmare in March 2020 with vast economic shutdowns. By May things began bouncing back as shutdowns were dialed back and the V-shaped recovery took hold. Even with local and regional economic “spits and spurts” inventories needed to be replenished and personal protective equipment drove strong airfreight demand. There was no time like the present for logistics expertise and 3PLs prevailed as an essential industry.

Overall strong domestic and international transportation demand has continued into 2021 further driving up domestic and international transportation rates. With inventories increasing and COVID-19 cases waning demand for 3PL services seems to be becoming more stable and manageable. As the nation gets closer to herd immunity in the COVID battle we should continue to see increasingly strong demand as more consumers leave quarantine and boost spending. In fact 2021 might be the true start of our generation’s roaring ’20s.

Armstrong

While many 3PLs still are providing us with 2020 financials Armstrong & Associates’ current estimates show U.S. 3PL market gross revenues grew 8.8% bringing the total market to $231.5 billion. Most of the growth came from international and domestic transportation management which responded to COVID-­related demands for PPE and to restock inventories upon economic reopenings. Overall 2020 was a better year for 3PLs than 2019 which registered the market’s first decline since 2009. But segment growth was uneven.

Total 3PL segment net revenues (gross revenues minus purchased transportation) grew 2.1% to $93.5 billion reflecting gross margin compression due to a volatile carrier sourcing market and transportation management 3PLs spending more to secure hard-to-find carrier capacity. The overall gross margin for all segments declined to 41% from 44%.

International Transportation Management

Leading all 3PL segments for revenue growth in 2020 was international transportation management (ITM) which consists of air and ocean freight forwarding customs brokerage and complementary value-added services. Airfreight revenues swelled in 2020 with the pandemic and extraordinary demand for PPE. With commercial passenger aircraft making up approximately 40% of total air cargo capacity the pandemic upended airfreight forwarding and rates surged albeit on lower overall volumes.

With the economic reopenings in May ocean freight demand came on strong as shippers worked on replenishing inventories. The ongoing results have been port congestion tight container drayage capacity and increased rates. “Blank sailings” in which a scheduled ship is canceled from a route and stronger ocean carrier alliances also have reduced ocean capacity and buoyed rates.

Overall ITM realized a 19.2% gross revenue gain in 2020 expanding to $70 billion. While having a lower growth rate than overall gross revenue due to a tight carrier capacity market net revenue increased a healthy 11.4% to $24.6 billion. Our expectation is for demand and pricing to remain strong in ITM for the remainder of the year.

C.H. Robinson Worldwide’s global forwarding division saw 2020 gross revenue grow 33.2% to $3.1 billion and net revenue increased 17.8% to $629 million. It has been expanding rapidly in ITM via a mix of acquisitions and organic growth. In 2011 it had net revenue of $100 million.

Expeditors International of Washington the largest U.S.-based freight forwarder had a better-than-average 2020 with gross revenue increasing 23.7% to $10.1 billion and net revenue increasing 11% to $2.9 billion. Growth primarily came from airfreight where gross revenue grew a whopping 63% to $4.8 billion from $2.9 billion in 2019.

Apex Logistics International headquartered in Hong Kong has significant operations in the U.S. and is one of the largest China-­U.S. airfreight forwarders. Its airfreight metric tons grew 44% to 750000 in 2020 driving a 53% increase in gross revenue to $2.3 billion. Apex Logistics managed multiple weekly air charters of PPE from China to the U.S. and has burgeoning e-commerce business. It also more than doubled its ocean freight forwarding business which ended 2020 with 190000 20-foot equivalent units.

In late February Kuehne + Nagel announced it was acquiring Apex Logistics for about $1.5 billion. The combination makes Kuehne + Nagel the largest global airfreight forwarder with just more than 2.1 million metric air tons surpassing DHL Supply Chain and Global Forwarding. It also significantly expands Kuehne + Nagel’s Asian 3PL operating network.

Dedicated Contract Carriage

The asset-heavy dedicated contract carriage (DCC) 3PL segment had the second-highest net revenue growth of the four 3PL segments at just 0.3% to $20 billion. Gross revenue declined 2%. The negative effect of COVID made 2020 a volatile and lower-volume year versus 2019 when DCC net revenues grew 12.1%.

Traditional DCC contracts have one- to three-year terms with specific trucking assets being dedicated to customers. This makes DCC contracts much “stickier” than standard shipper-­carrier trucking contracts. A&A’s market research shows dry van trailers being used for 70% of DCC truckloads refrigerated 16% flatbeds 6% and tankers and others 8%. Three-fourths of major DCC providers have dry vans and reefers. Half of major DCC providers have flatbeds. Customer trailers/containers often are used especially for retail operations such as Walmart.

DCC segment leader J.B. Hunt Dedicated Contract Services with 9911 power units in dedicated posted above average net revenue growth of 3.2% to $2.2 billion making its DCC market share 11% on a net revenue basis. It has more than 160 customers and A&A estimates that about half of J.B. Hunt’s dedicated tractors are tandem axle sleepers. About as many are day cabs used in regional operations. A significant part of Hunt’s DCS operations involve direct store delivery. It also has developed a large last-mile delivery network that has significant home-­delivery capabilities.

Penske Logistics helped by its 2020 acquisition of Black Horse Carriers and 2018 acquisition of Epes Transport System has grown into the second-largest dedicated fleet with 6718 power units. Combined DCC revenues are estimated at more than $1 billion.

We expect moderate DCC demand and growth for 2021 as the economy further rebounds. A lot will hinge upon continued strength in contract truckload rates.

Domestic Transportation Management

The non-asset-based domestic transportation management (DTM) segment includes freight brokerage which represents 83% of segment revenues and managed transportation which accounts for 17%. In 2020 3PLs scrambled to find carrier capacity to meet shipper demand. DTM gross revenue increased 9.9% to $91.2 billion but net revenue decreased 1.8% to $13.2 billion as volatility in motor carrier capacity quickly increased spot market rates compressing segment gross margins by 1.7%.

The ongoing digitalization of transactional truckload freight brokerage continues at a rapid pace as more large shippers have built integrations with 3PLs’ transportation management systems for truckload spot-market rate quoting and automated load tendering and booking. In turn about 20 3PLs have built TMS interfaces that provide these shippers instant rate quotes and the ability to complete load tendering and booking through system APIs (application program interfaces). This process automates traditional spot market freight-brokerage sales functions and is increasing shippers’ use of more spot versus contract pricing.

Sales automation for spot market truckload is happening in conjunction with the automation of carrier sales (procurement) functions. Freight brokers are using intelligent capacity-­management systems to digitally match shippers’ loads to carriers based on historical and real-time carrier capacity data analyzed via machine learning algorithms.

This digital freight-matching capability has become a competitive differentiator within the DTM segment as 3PLs look to increase the number of loads or shipments they manage per person per day. Ultimately this automation will put further pressure on freight brokerage gross margins while it should improve overall profitability.

Large companies such as C.H. Robinson TQL XPO Logistics Hub Group and Echo Global Logistics are some of the 3PLs driving industry automation along with the newer tech-first digital freight brokers and DTM market entrants Convoy Transfix and Uber Freight. At this point most of the top freight brokers are strategically looking at ways to digitalize operations while adding value through improved carrier management and customer and carrier experiences.

Rapid growth in e-commerce fulfillment could not offset the loss of business-to-business-related activity as overall revenues for the value-added warehousing and distribution (VAWD) 3PL segment sagged in 2020 versus its 9% growth 2019. VAWD net revenues declined 1.1% to $35.7 billion.

VAWD 3PLs continue to benefit from growth in retail ­e-commerce business which continues to be the fastest-growing domestic 3PL segment with a compound annual growth rate of 28% since 2017. Many VAWD 3PLs are supporting retail brands’ strategies to manage their own order fulfillment channels and avoid being captive to large e-retailer platforms such as Amazon. Operationally the growth in e-commerce business has meant an expansion in multiclient warehousing and fulfillment operations with many having footprints of less than 100000 square feet.

An ongoing headwind for VAWD 3PLs has been the “Amazon effect.” 3PLs are continuing to see increased competition from Fulfillment by Amazon which controls 60% of the U.S. e-commerce 3PL market. It dramatically has impacted warehouse employee wages and lease rates in key distribution areas such as Plainfield Ind. and California’s Inland Empire. In turn it is driving significant interest from VAWD 3PLs to automate warehouses with autonomous robotic solutions. With some autonomous robots costing less than $500 per month to operate the cost-benefit and positive return on investment are increasing 3PLs’ interest in warehouse robots to support activities such as picking putaway and cycle counting.

Arkansas Children's Northwest in Springdale has begun offering covid-19 vaccines to anyone 16-21 according to Nicole Huddleston spokeswoman for the hospital. Patients or parents may make appointments by calling (479) 725-6995. The hospital also plans to host vaccine clinics April 10 and May 1 and will provide details at a later according to Huddleston.

Community Clinic which has several clinics throughout the region was selected to receive vaccines as part of a federal program designed to reach vulnerable populations. The clinic is allowing anyone in the community to make vaccine appointments at its Springdale and Rogers clinics but is trying to first reach its patients said Judd Semingson chief executive officer.

The organization has about 500 doses available per week at its Springdale clinic and 300 to 500 per week at its Rogers clinic. The clinic has been receiving the Pfizer vaccine in Rogers and the Moderna vaccine in Springdale Semingson said.

The Pfizer vaccine is approved for people 16 and older. The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are approved for people 18 and older.

The Northwest Arkansas Council gave 2500 first doses at an all-day clinic Thursday in Fayetteville said Nate Green council spokesman. The nonprofit organization closed registration at 5:30 a.m. that morning when only 1300 people had signed up.

Enough people heard through word-of-mouth more doses were available and came to get vaccinated leaving no vaccines wasted Green said. The council will give second doses to everyone who received first doses at its clinics.

The council has two first dose clinics planned within the next week. They will be 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday at the Northwest Arkansas Mall and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday at J.B. Hunt Transport Services headquarters in Lowell according to its website. People may sign up online at nwacouncil.org/nwavaccines.

Benton and Washington counties had 59012 residents fully vaccinated against covid-19 as of Thursday while another 50631 had received the first of two doses according to the Arkansas Department of Health.

The two counties have a combined population of 384234 residents 16 and older so about 15% of that group have been fully vaccinated while about 13% are halfway there.

Northwest Health System which has five hospitals in the region had given 35500 vaccine doses as of Friday according to Aimee Morrell spokeswoman. Washington Regional Medical System had given 25841 doses by the end of the day Thursday according to Natalie Hardin spokeswoman.

Washington Regional and Mercy Health System are allowing anyone 16 and older to make vaccine appointments. Mercy is requiring people younger than 18 to have a parent or guardian present to receive a vaccine according to Jennifer Cook spokeswoman. The state isn't requiring 16- and 17-year-olds to have parental consent to receive covid-19 vaccines according to Danyelle McNeill spokeswoman for the Arkansas Department of Health.

Washington County had 109 new virus cases from March 27 through Friday according to McNeill. Benton County had 141 new cases.

Washington County had 30325 cumulative cases Friday according to the Health Department. The county had 170 active cases Friday including 103 confirmed and 67 probable cases.

Benton County had 28188 cumulative cases Friday. The county had 186 active cases Friday including 119 confirmed and 67 probable cases.

Rogers Public Schools and Springdale Public Schools each had 11 active cases as of Thursday according to the Health Department. Bentonville had 14 active cases. Fayetteville Public Schools was not on the department's report which means it has fewer than five cases.

Both antigen tests and polymerase chain reaction or PCR tests are used to test for covid-19. Antigen tests produce faster results are generally used only on people with symptoms of the virus and have a higher chance of giving false-negative results. Antigen and most PCR tests are done via nasal swabs.

A total of 218998 PCR tests and 28890 antigen tests have been done on Benton County residents while 227918 PCR tests and 43731 antigen tests have been done on Washington County residents according to the Health Department.

They tell all.,"Up in the trees down in the grass and over in the garden 4-year-old JB Guidry knows the Easter Bunny's hiding spots.

But of course he's never seen the iconic bunny plant the plastic prizes. JB says that's because the Easter Bunny hops and hides at night when he is fast asleep.

On Sunday morning at Laurel Street Park in Belhaven JB holds up two hands his 10 fingers outstretched to show how many eggs he got when he went hunting with his YaYa. They were all different colors. But one was special. It was gold.

""Dimes. Fish. Pennies"" his brown eyes light up as he lists what was inside. ""He gave some quarters.""

JB is a preschooler living in yet another pandemic-ridden Easter. Despite another celebration behind masks with socially distanced services — adjustments young children still might not understand — the egg-toting bunny has defied all odds. It's a tradition full of hope and imagination that Mississippi's youngest explained to the Clarion Ledger on Sunday morning.

Maybe Allie Akin has seen the Easter Bunny because she's a year older than JB. The rabbit is puffed in white fur with a pink nose and ears. Allie says there's a caveat while she's seen the bunny she's never witnessed it hiding eggs.

""He's really sneaky"" Allie 5 said Sunday after Fondren Church's Easter service. ""He hops really high.""

In her blue-smocked Easter frock Allie bounds across the church's gathering area trying to hop as high as the Easter Bunny. It's ""kinda close"" she says.

Sunday morning before 11 a.m. church services Allie and her 3-year-old brother Rhett embarked on their Easter egg hunt. Unicorn-themed eggs with matching stickers were Allie's favorite part while Rhett was more diplomatic.

Quite frankly there's clean-up that comes with the Easter Bunny's gifts. Rhett said vacuuming up the mess was the important part of Easter egg hunts. And the chocolate.

""But you don't even like chocolate"" Allie giggles.

""Yes I do"" her brother replies adamantly.

The Akin kids didn't see the bunny in question this year but there were two snakes who tried to have their own Easter egg hunt in the chicken coop in their backyard. They agreed Easter egg hunts need to be left to the bunny.

JB and the Akin siblings know the Easter Bunny is stealthy. They know it brings the cherished candy-filled eggs and jingling change. They're pretty certain the famous rabbit is commercial-sized and basket-toting. But what's largely lost is where the tradition stems from.

It's blurry according to Time magazine. They purport German immigrants brought over the egg-laying hare they call Osterhase or Oschter Haws sometime in the 1700s. The German lore included children crafting nests for the hare to lay its colored eggs in and they would leave carrots out in case the hare worked up an appetite. As the custom evolved in the United States the American-deemed Easter Bunny would bring chocolate and gifts.

JB didn't leave out carrots. He and his mother smile at one another and say they instead baked chocolate chip cookies for the bunny to munch on.

It would make sense too that a busy bunny would get hungry because Allie explained it's just one bunny hopping at high-speed to drop all its eggs in hiding places. In high spots that 3 1/2-year-old Adley Wood says she needs her dad to get for her.

""Pink purple blue orange"" the energetic preschooler lists the color of eggs she found Sunday. ""He's a pink Easter bunny.""

Adley too says she has seen the Easter bunny. And she might be just as fast as she calculated her egg-collecting speed at 5 1/2 minutes.

Maybe next year when there is more hope that the pandemic won't hold a grip over tradition JB will be able to get a glimpse of the iconic bunny. But for now he walks back with his mom and dad to take part in a Sunday service at the park.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""

From thousands of stocks 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5 Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

On a visit to UND’s campus last week I heard them in the trees along University Avenue.

The finches are pretty good singers . Richard Crossley’s description is succinct: “Loud warbled phrases fastest at the start” as he puts it in “The Crossley Guide.”

The American Ornithologists’ Union’s monograph on the species is a little less complimentary but no less descriptive: “Male song a hoarse warble that shifts rapidly between high and low frequency notes often ending in a down-slurred note.”

The song notwithstanding house finches can be devilishly difficult to see. They are small birds smaller than house sparrows and they tend to sing from perches high in the trees.

Always in Season/ Mike Jacobs: Spring offers a primer on the kinds of geese Over the last three or four decades snow geese have exploded in numbers and expanded their range.



Always in Season/ Sharp-tailed grouse strut at first light Indeed perhaps nothing in the natural world has so fixated humans as the mating ritual of the sharp-tailed grouse.



Their plumage is not especially conspicuous either although the head face and breast of males are flushed with red at this time of year. This often appears quite dark however even when the birds are seen close up.

Fortunately for those of us building a life list house finches are frequent feeder visitors. Soon after I heard them on campus three males showed up at the feeder array behind our home west of Gilby N.D.

House finches aren’t migratory; they occur in our area throughout the year. Outside the nesting season they are easily overlooked however because the courtship plumage quickly fades leaving only a hint of red.

Although these birds are fairly common in our area today this has not always been the case. The house finch is a native of the western states. A small number of house finches were released on New York’s Long Island in 1940. Descendants of these birds have overspread the continent reaching our area about 1980.

Today Crossley asserts this is “the common and familiar finch in most areas.”

This familiarity arises from the house finch’s habit of nesting in and around buildings where humans often encounter it. This habit is shared by the house sparrow and some observers have suggested that the decline in house sparrow numbers may be linked to competition for nest sites with house finches.

House sparrows have shown up at my feeders too. It almost seems as if they are mocking me for my statement a few columns back that they’d disappeared from our property.

Taken to task

Last week’s column brought a rebuke from my buddy Jeff Weispfenning. He’s a member of what I call “The Bismarck Boys’ Club” a group of aging adventurers who’ve camped and canoed together for well let’s just say several decades.

Weispfenning took me to task for suggesting that hunters take more snow geese than any other species of geese. Not so he said and he did the research to prove me wrong. In 2018-19 North Dakota hunters took four times as many Canada geese – 100000 compared with 25000 snow geese. The reason Weispfenning says is because the fall season for Canada geese opens earlier and the birds linger longer in the state than snow geese whose migration often coincides with deer hunting season.

Weispfenning also suggested that the migration pattern of snow geese is partly due to exceptionally wet years recently which have provided more attractive habitat for snow geese.

Backyard sightings

Meanwhile back in my backyard the feeders are attracting new customers. The redpolls so numerous all winter have disappeared. So have the American tree sparrows including the second wave that showed up after my winter guests took off for the North. I still have a few siskins but their numbers are down.

The most abundant birds now are slate-colored juncos.

A good-sized flock of red-winged black birds has settled in. I tried counting them but stopped when I reached 50 – not because I thought there were more but because the birds kept moving around and I was pretty sure I would be double counting if I continued.

A couple of grackles showed up too. Although grackles are the bullies of the bird world I have to appreciate the brilliance of their iridescent plumage.

In the front yard where there are berries clinging to Russian olive and cedar trees a small group of robins have established themselves. They spend the day chasing each other around – but without any apparent aggressive intent.

Meadowlarks have returned to the road ditches and grassland patches beyond our shelterbelt and I’ve seen northern harriers coursing about.

From Grand Forks I’ve received reports of cardinals which prompted Les Klevay a fellow Rotarian to wonder how large a territory cardinals establish.

I looked it up.

The monograph on cardinals says the average territory is 1.2 hectares a little more than 2½ acres. An acre is 43000 square feet so this suggests a territory of 115000 square feet a little bit more than the standard size of a city block which is 100000 square feet.

With an Ivy League degree from Cornell in his back pocket the 28-year-old Avalanche defenseman persevered through seven minor-league teams before reaching hockey’s highest level.

Over six years he hopped all over the hockey map making stops at the ECHL’s Elmira Jackals and Toledo Walleye and the AHL’s Springfield Falcons Albany Devils Binghamton Devils Springfield Thunderbirds and Colorado Eagles.

Yet through all that grind MacDonald says he never thought about finding a real job.

“Not even a little bit” he said

He was too busy chasing his dreams.

“I thought I’d play a couple years in the Coast (ECHL) and see how it goes” said MacDonald who was an undrafted free agent upon graduating with a business degree from Cornell in 2015. “Halfway through my second year I get called up to the American League and that was an improvement obviously. And after a couple months there I signed an American League contract for my third year so I’m moving up right?

“Those years I just wanted to play have fun and see where it takes me. And you never know where it’s going to lead.”

Where it led MacDonald was on the roster of the franchise he grew up rooting for as a youngster in Portland Ore.

He was acquired by the Avs in a trade with the Florida Panthers on June 19 2019. Colorado sent forward Dominic Toninato to Florida for MacDonald who got his big break a year earlier by signing a two-year deal worth a guaranteed $450000 with the Panthers.

Avalanche coach Jared Bednar called on MacDonald to step into the lineup Jan. 31 at Minnesota — the game after defenseman Erik Johnson went down with a head injury against the Wild. Defenseman Devon Toews was also on the injured list at the time and the Avs previously traded defenseman Ian Cole to Minnesota.

One of the keys to finding a role on a super-deep team like Colorado? Of course it was MacDonald’s smarts.

Bednar likes how the Oregonian thinks the game.

“Just because you’re book smart doesn’t make you an intelligent hockey player. I don’t know what his grades were like at Cornell but he’s certainly an intelligent hockey player and he’s earned the right to be in our lineup” Bednar said. “We’ve had some injuries and he got an opportunity because of those injuries but he’s making the most of it.”

Nobody in MacDonald’s family had previously played hockey but it only took one trip to a local junior game to give him the bug.

“When I was 5 I went to a Portland Winterhawks game and I was hooked from the start” he said. “I watched the game and on the way home I told my dad I wanted to try it. That was that. I never played any other organized sports. All I ever wanted to do was play hockey.”

At age 12 MacDonald and his family moved to Brighton Mich. It was a hockey hotbed and MacDonald was where he needed to be.

“That was super helpful. There’s no triple-A in the Pacific Northwest — or at least when I was there” he said. “Moving to Michigan was big. I played in the Compuware organization and they’re still there always one of the top programs in youth hockey in Michigan.”

MacDonald played on Compuware’s triple-A teams at 13-under 14U 16U and 18U before joining the Waterloo Blackhawks of the U.S. (junior-A) Hockey League. After two seasons with the Blackhawks he had NCAA offers from Cornell Yale and Ferris State.

“Cornell was the best mix of hockey and academics and they have a longer history than Yale with putting out professional players” MacDonald said.

For Bednar MacDonald is that player who never quits and will never quit on his team.

“I love his story the fact that he was an Avs fan growing up and he put in a lot of time in another organization (Panthers) and our pro scouts did a nice job of identifying him among other players like (Ryan) Graves (Dan) Renouf — guys that have come in and played real well for us that maybe didn’t get a great opportunity someplace else” Bednar said. “Those guys have put in their time improving their game honing their craft so they are in the spot where if they get an opportunity they can make the most of that.

“That’s what Jacob has done.”

MacDonald has played in 26 career NHL games — 24 with the Avs this season including the last 20 through Friday. If all goes according to plan there will be many more to come.

“I’ve worked my whole life for this and it’s something I’m not going to take lightly” MacDonald said. “That degree obviously means a lot to me and that’s why I went to school. I could have gone to the OHL and try to make it earlier but college was always one of those things my parents wanted for me and I did too. I’m thankful for that degree and maybe I’ll use it when I’m done playing hockey but hopefully that’s a ways away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMDMvY2hpaHVhaHVhLWphY29iLWlzLWEtc3dlZXQtbGl0dGxlLWd1eS_SAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5vY3JlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzAzL2NoaWh1YWh1YS1qYWNvYi1pcy1hLXN3ZWV0LWxpdHRsZS1ndXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chihuahua Jacob is a sweet little guy,"Breed: Chihuahua

New interactive drama launched on Peckham towerblock,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Something went wrong please try again later.

With Line of Duty and Unforgotten it has been a great few weeks for fans of police TV dramas.

Social media has been overflowing with theories about the shows and they have definitely given people something to look forward to during lockdown.

While it is great to get absorbed in a programme a new mobile phone interactive drama could get participants closer to the front line.

Step into the shoes of a Scotland Yard homicide detective investigating the murder of young teenager Jerome Jacobs who is pushed to his death from a South London tower block in Peckham.

Inspired by the nation’s obsession with true crime and our love of solving mysteries BAFTA-nominated ""Dead Man’s Phone"" offers a fully immersive experience and all from the touch of your smartphone.

With access to Jerome’s mobile unleash your inner detective to investigate and solve the case by hunting for clues using his personal messages photos and social media.

Your story evolves as you utilise in-game tools including a news app reporting each arrest you make maps to track the live location of suspects a social media app for launching viral campaigns and Zoom to conduct remote police interviews.

Solve the crime your way with multiple-choice responses to suit your investigation style and remain in control of how the narrative unfolds.

Former British homicide detective Sim Cryer worked closely with game makers ElectricNoir to make the experience as authentic as possible.

He also lent his voice to the experience as a chief inspector to help you navigate the mystery.

Although it seems like a lot of fun for crime fans Dead Man’s Phone also hopes to shine a spotlight on important social issues typically not highlighted through the medium of video games.

""We created Dead Man’s Phone in order to tell an intimate complex and meaningful story about the death of a black teenager in London"" CEEO and Founder of ElectricNoir said.

""So often relegated to a simple news headline working on mobiles allowed us to create an accessible experience with a really poignant message that would reach a much wider audience.

""Traditional cinema TV and literature mediums aren’t currently equipped to deal with this mobile-first ecosystem and we felt it was important to introduce a new method of storytelling to reflect the interactive world we live in.

""The ongoing lack of representation of BAME stories in gaming TV and entertainment was also something we wanted to address giving young BAME actors musicians and other creatives a platform to show and grow their talent.”

Tafari Golding who plays the role of Jerome in the game said being part of the project was a ""dream come true"".

He added: ""The last 12 months in particular have proven that more needs to be done to improve relationships between police and the BAME community and I believe that this experience will highlight some of the biggest issues that still remain.

""I was heavily involved in shaping the project from the beginning sharing my personal insight into the language used in the script and making sure we told the story that we’re all human.

""As a result ElectricNoir has created a truly authentic experience that highlights marginalised societies showcasing the hidden issues in Britain. These issues typically haven’t been captured in mobile games before and I hope that this is the catalyst that will change that.”

Nominated for the EE Mobile Game of the Year Award at this year’s BAFTA Games Awards the full Dead Man’s Phone first season will unfold across a total of six episodes all of which are available for free now on iOS and Android.

UK hip-hop label Defenders Entertainment has also partnered with ElectricNoir to supply all the music for season one of Dead Man’s Phone. The full soundtrack will be released on Spotify and Apple Music later this year.

Before becoming an architect at age 37 Johnson ran the architecture department at MoMA and the spare luminous building which he inhabited for over half a century embodies the Modernist International Style that he helped define in a landmark exhibition at the museum in 1932. The home also established Johnson himself as the paragon of a specific type of New York architect: erudite absolutist in his refinement and formidable in his influence wielding shaping careers institutions and public opinion like few others in his field.

But since the National Trust of Historic Preservation opened the Glass House to the public as a museum in 2007 visitors have discovered there’s more to the place than its namesake centerpiece. By the time Johnson died in 2005 the five acres he’d bought in 1946 had grown tenfold to encompass 14 structures including experimental follies a subterranean painting gallery and three wooden homes from earlier periods including a shingled 18th-century dwelling that Johnson and his partner the curator David Whitney would use as a refuge in hot weather. For the past 15 years however a pivotal part of the estate has remained semi-concealed: Johnson’s guesthouse known as the Brick House and situated just 80 feet from the site’s main attraction has been closed to the public because of water damage. Now after an extensive restoration and in time for the Glass House’s 75th anniversary the building has finally been unveiled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleGFzdHJpYnVuZS5vcmcvMjAyNC8wNS8wNC90ZXhhcy1lbGVjdGlvbnMtMjAyNC1zcGVjaWFsLXNlbmF0ZS1kaXN0cmljdC0xNS1oYXJyaXMtY291bnR5LWhvdXN0b24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Molly Cook wins Texas Senate special election,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd2hvb3BkaXJ0LmNvbS9idWJieS1qb2huc29uLWNob3Nlbi10by1sZWFkLXdvbWVucy1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLXByb2dyYW0tYXQtdGhlLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktb2YtY2hhcmxlc3Rvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bubby Johnson chosen to lead Women's Basketball program at the University of Charleston - Women's HoopDirt,"The University of Charleston Director of Athletics Dr. Bren Stevens has announced the hiring of Bubby Johnson as the next Women’s Basketball Head Coach.



“Dytanya “Bubby” Johnson is an incredible talent who understands the importance of developing his players on the court in the classroom and within the campus community. Bubby’s pedigree as one of the top NCAA II players in the country along with winning a National Championship while at Florida Southern University makes him the ideal candidate to lead our basketball program” stated Dr. Sevens. “As a full-time assistant with our former head coach Tianni Kelly Bubby developed superb relationships with our staff faculty and fan base. Moreover Coach Johnson’s most recent experience as the top assistant at Presbyterian College will allow him to network with other elite coaches to bring top players to Charleston.”



Johnson spent the last two season at Presbyterian College where he helped lead the team to a program first ever NCAA Tournament appearance in 2024. After securing an automatic bid with the Big South Tournament Championship title the Blue Hose advanced to March Madness where they fell to the eventual National Champion. In Johnson’s debut year with Presbyterian in the 2022-2023 season he focused primarily on coaching the post players notably guiding Bryanna Brady who earned second-team all-conference honors. Under Johnson’s guidance Brady became one of only four PC DI players to surpass 400 points in a season.



During Johnson’s previous tenure at Charleston (2020-2022) the program clinched a pair of conference championships a regular-season title and an NCAA Atlantic Regional championship. Notably the team made history with the first-ever elite eight appearance for a Mountain East Conference women’s team. Johnson’s contributions earned him recognition as a 21′ World Exposure D2 Assistant COY Finalist and he was also named in the WBCA 30 under 30 list for the 2020-2021 season.



Before joining Charleston Johnson served as the Director of Player Development for the Green Bay Men’s Basketball program during the 2019-20 season. In this role he oversaw player management program operations and played a key role in recruitment efforts. Additionally Johnson coordinated team travel and provided advisement to student-athletes.



As a player Johnson’s collegiate journey began at New Jersey Institute of Technology before transferring to Gannon and eventually USU Eastern. He concluded his collegiate basketball career at Florida Southern where he helped lead the team to a remarkable 2015 NCAA Division II National Championship victory. Johnson’s senior season at Florida Southern was marked by accolades including selection to the Sunshine State Conference All-Tournament Team and the NCAA All-South Regional Team. Averaging 6.2 PPG and leading the team in rebounding with 6.5 RPG Johnson demonstrated his prowess on the court. His leadership was evident as he started in all 37 games leading the team in field goal percentage (50.3%) and securing the victory in the Division II National Championship game against Indiana (Pa.).

Cooling products maker Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India is looking for around 20 per cent growth in the current financial year in comparison to the 2019-20 level said a top company official. The company expects factors such as pent-up demand and work-from-home which will create a demand for additional room AC along with exchange requirement of old units for the growth of the segment.Besides Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning is also working on reducing its dependence on imports for components by half as part of its commitment towards indigenisation.""We had clocked Rs 2200 crore in the last year (FY 2019-20) in which a big chunk of sales from March was lost. So we are just about similar to last year. If we would have been okay then we should have clocked at least Rs 2500 crore.""For the next fiscal year (FY 2021-22) I am sure that we should be reaching at least 20 per cent growth (by value) from FY 2019-20"" Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India Chairman and Managing Director Gurmeet Singh told .Like other players Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning has also gone for a price increase of 3-5 per cent to ward off the inflationary pressure on raw materials including copper aluminium steel and plastics and expects another price hike coming soon.""It will be difficult to survive even in the month of April without increasing the price is my fear"" said Singh.He added that ""the price of copper is almost 50 per cent higher than at the start of the year. Aluminium and steel have both increased"" and diesel prices are going up. All combined have put tremendous pressure on the entire ecosystem.Singh said the real changes the industry is facing lie in the business-to-business (B2B) segment where ""sales are not up to the mark"" as restaurants shops small hotels and offices are not opening up fully.""Marriage halls which is a large customer have not not opened up completely which is affecting the demand in a certain way"" he said adding that ""but otherwise in residential we are definitely seeing an increase"".When asked about the trend in sale growth Singh said though the developed metro markets such as Delhi and Mumbai contribute a large chunk but the non-metro and smaller markets of tier-II III and IV are growing faster than the big cities.""I am now finding 50-60 per cent growth is coming from these developing markets"" he added.The company has also corrected its price through innovations to make its products more affordable though it has not compromised the features for which it is known in the market.""The ticket size of a Rs 30000-Rs 35000 AC for a 1.5 tonne is relatively high ticket size if you compare it with other consumer durable"" he said.He added ""We are not the most affordable neither we will be cheapest ever in the class due to certain quality restrictions and design restrictions that we put in ourselves. We will always be the preferred brand for the customers and they will always be ready to pay a little premium for our products.""Singh also said that currently the room AC has a penetration of around 6 per cent and is increasing by 1-2 per cent every year.The company a 60:40 JV between US-based Johnson Controls and Japanese company Hitachi  is also expanding its sales network and now has a reach of 200 towns pan-India through a network of 10000 outlets.""We are working aggressively to add more and more channel partners to our distribution network"" said Singh.He added that it has recently added three exclusive showrooms also. The company has 72- 74 such exclusive retail stores which sells only Hitachi products.Besides business-to-customer (B2C) Jonson-Hitachi is also focusing on institutional sales through its B2B channels.Currently 70 per cent of the revenue of Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India comes from B2C 20 per cent from B2B and the rest 10 per cent comes from the services such as annual maintenance contracts.Hitachi is also looking to increase the export and expects a contribution in double digits in total revenue in the next two years. The company currently ships its range of products to neighbouring SAARC countries and African markets.""Present volume is low it's only 4-5 per cent of the total turnover of the company but I am aiming to take this to at least three times from here within a span of two years"" Singh added.The company has started internalising components such as printed circuit board (PCB) which was earlier imported started manufacturing cross-flow fan.

Officials stressed travel would not begin before May 17 at the earliest and that it was still too soon to predict which countries would be cleared.

The advice remains that people should wait for the full report of the Government’s global travel task force due on April 12 before booking a holiday.

It comes as many European countries are imposing new lockdown restrictions as a third wave of the pandemic spreads across the continent.

Under the traffic light system assessments will be based on a range of factors including the proportion of a country’s population which has been vaccinated rates of infection emerging new variants and the country’s access to reliable scientific data and genomic sequencing.

Travellers arriving from countries rated “green” will not be required to isolate although pre-departure and post-arrival tests will still be needed.

For those classed as “amber” or “red” the restrictions will remain as they are with arrivals required to isolate or enter quarantine.

The industry body Airlines UK which has been calling for some type of traffic light system said it was important that mass air travel was able to resume soon.

“There are tens of thousands of jobs dependent upon aviation and restarting travel and the sector cannot survive another lost summer with little or no revenue” said chief executive Tim Alderslade.

“We can do this proportionately and in a risk-based way it’s not a question of opening up the border to every country out there.

“If there are concerns about variants restrictions will remain but where it is safe to do so we need to start the process of opening up.

“We cannot with a straight face talk about Global Britain without aviation.”",,,,,,

Former President Trump on Saturday added to a list of organizations he's calling on supporters to boycott for opposing Georgia's voting restrictions. Driving the news: Trump on Friday urged a boycott of ""woke companies"" that have taken a stand and Major League Baseball for moving its All-Star Game out of Georgia adding: ""Are you listening Coke Delta."" In his new statement he said: ""Boycott Major League Baseball Coca-Cola Delta Airlines JPMorgan Chase ViacomCBS Citigroup Cisco UPS and Merck.""

What else he's saying: Trump accused ""Radical Left Democrats"" of playing dirty by boycotting companies that offend them.

""Now they are going big time with WOKE CANCEL CULTURE and our sacred elections"" Trump said.

""It is finally time for Republicans and Conservatives to fight back — we have more people than they do — by far!"" he added before making a series of complaints including about the 2020 presidential election and then wishing: ""Happy Easter!""

The other side: Democrats have criticized the new law with President Biden calling it ""Jim Crow on steroids.""

Citigroup declined to comment and the other companies named in Trump's boycott list did not immediately return Axios' requests for comment.

Go deeper: CEOs corporations speak out against Georgia's voting restrictions

Editor's note: This article has been updated with new details throughout.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL25ld3MtYW5kLXBvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjEvMDQvdHJ1bXAtZGVjcmllcy1jYW5jZWwtY3VsdHVyZS1jYWxscy1ib3ljb3R0LWdlb3JnaWEtbGF3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump decries “cancel culture” calls on Republicans to boycott more companies.,"Former President Donald Trump said “cancel culture” has run amok so Republicans better start making their own cancelations. Trump issued a bitter message Saturday in which he stoked divisions over Georgia’s restrictive new voting law. It came a day after he urged a boycott of “woke companies” including Major League Baseball for moving its All-Star Game out of Georgia. He later expanded the list of companies that he says supporters should boycott for opposing Georgia’s voting restrictions.

Trump pointed the finger at “radical left Democrats” claiming they “have played dirty” for years “by boycotting products when anything from that company is done or stated in any way that offends them.” Now he said they’re “going big time with WOKE CANCEL CULTURE and our sacred election.” So it’s time for Republicans to “fight back” and push their own boycotts which should be successful because “we have more people than they do—by far!” Trump called on supporters to “boycott Major League Baseball Coca-Cola Delta Airlines JPMorgan Chase ViacomCBS Citigroup Cisco UPS and Merck.” The former president went on to warn that the “radical left will destroy our country if we let them” and ended his message with a greeting: “Happy Easter!”

Many key leaders quickly answered Trump’s call to boycott baseball. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel for example tweeted Saturday that she wouldn’t be tuning into Major League Baseball. “Guess what I am doing today?” McDaniel tweeted. “Not watching baseball!!!!”

Georgia’s Gov. Brian Kemp doubled down on his defense of the controversial law Saturday saying his state had fallen victim to “cancel culture.” Kemp made an effort to frame the discussion over the law as a partisan issue. “Yesterday Major League Baseball caved to fear and lies from liberal activists” Kemp said at a news conference. “In the middle of a pandemic Major League Baseball put the wishes of Stacey Abrams and Joe Biden ahead of the economic well-being of hard-working Georgians who were counting on the All-Star Game for a paycheck.”

Democrats including former President Barack Obama have largely praised the MLB’s decision to move its game. Georgia voting rights activist and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said she was “disappointed” over the MLB’s decision but praised the league for speaking up on the issue. “As I have stated I respect boycotts although I don’t want to see Georgia families hurt by lost events and jobs” Abrams said in a statement. “Georgians targeted by voter suppression will be hurt as opportunities go to other states. We should not abandon the victims of GOP malice and lies – we must stand together.”

If Trump will really call on supporters to boycott companies that have decried efforts to restrict voting access his list should get a lot larger. Almost 200 companies on Friday signed onto a strong statement that called on lawmakers across the country “to work across the aisle and ensure that every eligible American has the freedom to easily cast their ballot and participate fully in our democracy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIxLzA0LzA0L2Zvcm1lci1hcmthbnNhcy1nb3YtbWlrZS1odWNrYWJlZS1pc3N1ZXMtcmFjaXN0LXR3ZWV0LW1sYi1iYWNrbGFzaC83MDgyNjY0MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Antithetical to the gospel': Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's tweet slammed as racist in MLB backlash,"Former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee came under criticism Saturday for a tweet attacking Major League Baseball and several corporations that many found bigoted and insensitive.

""I’ve decided to 'identify' as Chinese. Coke will like me Delta will agree with my 'values' and I’ll probably get shoes from Nike & tickets to @MLB games. Ain’t America great?"" Huckabee wrote.

Huckabee's tweet was quickly condemned as racist as many Asian Americans and anti-hate speech advocates have pointed to anti-Chinese rhetoric as a key driver in rising anti-Asian hate – and hate crimes – in the U.S.

The New Georgia Project a voting rights group based in Georgia called the tweet ""openly racist"" while others called the tweet ""hateful"" ""disgraceful"" and ""antithetical to the gospel.""

Huckabee a former Baptist pastor responded to claims that he had violated Christian doctrine a day before Easter Sunday saying ""I don’t take Twitter or myself that seriously but I do take gospel seriously. I truly wish you only joy & continued blessings.""

Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide

Huckabee's daughter former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is running for her father's old job as Arkansas governor. ""Do you condone Mike Huckabee adding fuel to anti-Asian hate?"" Rep. Ted Lieu D-Calif. asked the gubernatorial candidate on Twitter.

Huckabee's criticism was also part of a larger backlash against MLB after the professional sports league decided to move its All-Star Game from Atlanta in response to Georgia's new election law. Huckabee also echoed the conservative ire toward large businesses either headquartered or heavily invested in the Peach State – including Coca-Cola Delta Airlines and Microsoft – that have openly opposed the law. Major financial institutions such as Citi and JPMorgan Chase have also expressed concern about the law.

More:New Georgia voting bill brings sweeping changes. Here's how it will impact you.

Last month the state's Republican Legislature and governor passed a law that reduced voting access and added more stringent voting requirements. Critics claimed the law was the imposition of a ""New Jim Crow"" for its disproportionate impact on minority voters while advocates defended the law's provisions as necessary security measures. They also say the criticism is overblown and misrepresents the actual contents of the law.

""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box"" MLB Commissioner Robert D. Manfred said in a statement.

Republican lawmakers in the state and across the country have consequently shot back at the companies and voting rights advocates. Many drew comparisons between corporate treatment of the situation in Georgia and some companies' responses to human rights violations occurring in China.

More:The US says China is committing genocide against the Uyghurs. Here's some of the most chilling evidence.

""Dear GOP: @MLB caves to pressure & moves draft & #AllStarGame out of Georgia on the same week they announce a deal with a company backed by the genocidal Communist Party of #China"" Sen. Marco Rubio R-Fla. said in a tweet responding to MLB's decision. ""Why are we still listening to these woke corporate hypocrites on taxes regulations & anti-trust?""

""Hey @MLB how many days of early voting are allowed in China?"" Sen. Tom Cotton R-Ark. asked in a tweet.

""Hey Joe Biden you gonna boycott the Beijing Olympics because of mass genocide?"" Rep. Dan Crenshaw R-Texas wrote in a tweet directed at the president over U.S. participation in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. ""Or are you just into hurting Atlanta small businesses that were planning on the all-star game? Americans are sick of this woke BS. @MLB is a disgrace.""

Georgia lawmakers have been fiercely divided over the issue with Democrats arguing that the decisions of MLB and major corporations are an unfortunate but justified response to an unjust law and Republicans argue the decisions are unfounded.

""Just as elections have consequences so do the actions of those who are elected. Unfortunately the removal of the @MLB All-Star game from GA is likely the 1st of many dominoes to fall until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms a Democrat wrote on Twitter.

""Today Major League Baseball caved to fear political opportunism and liberal lies"" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp a Republican said in a statement.

""Georgians – and all Americans – should fully understand what the MLB’s knee-jerk decision means: cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life sports included. If the left doesn’t agree with you facts and the truth do not matter"" the governor said.

First Jim Crow. Now SB 2020:In Georgia voter suppression has always been a concern for Black voters

Sen. Raphael Warnock D-Ga. a fierce critic of the bill said in a statement ""Businesses and organizations have great power in their voices and ability to push for change and I respect the decision of the players to speak out against this unjust law.

""It is my hope that businesses athletes and entertainers can protest this law not by leaving Georgia but by coming here and fighting voter suppression head on and hand-in-hand with the community"" the senator continued.

The Atlanta Braves were ""saddened"" by the decision to move the All-Star Game the organization said in a tweet but said the team would ""continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities"" and that Atlanta has always ""been known as a united in divided times and we will miss the opportunity to address issues that are important to our community."""

Product sampling is one of the most popular tools used by marketers to acquire customers and test their products. It helps brands give users a taste and feel of the product by providing free samples. The problem however with product sampling is that even today brands have to rely on offline channels to do it (for example: setting up a stall for a new beverage product in a hyper store) which means they cannot target a specific audience and have no way to measure the outcome.

Quantum a Jeddah-based marketing startup is solving these problems with its online platform that enables brands to acquire new customers using digital sampling and different other tools. It has today announced closing of its seed round with $2.6 million from Tech Invest Com and Vision Ventures who co-led the round. 500 Startups and a few angel investors also participated in the investment.

How the platform works is that brands are matched with a specific target audience across Quantum’s partners after they create a brief sharing their objectives and the audience they want to reach. Once approved the campaign begins with Quantum handling the logistics and distribution (in case there are samples) and offering real-time reports and insights.

But those Dr. Martens Chelsea boots cost £150 ($206) and you’ve only got 50 quid. What to do?

For some people a “buy now pay later” (BNPL) lender like Klarna is the answer: You can get your Docs now and pay for them over time. But as Gen Z-focused BNPL companies take aim at the credit card industry there are reasons to be skeptical about whether the burgeoning trend is healthy for consumers and merchants.

What is Klarna?

Today Klarna is Europe’s most valuable startup. But when it launched in Stockholm 16 years ago the company had a difficult time finding backers. In a pitch competition similar to the show Shark Tank with an audience of luminaries including the king of Sweden H&M’s chairman and other prominent business leaders Klarna came in last.

This month however the company’s valuation reached $31 billion tripling in less than six months after Klarna raised $1 billion in its latest funding round.

Klarna is a bank fully licensed in its native Sweden but it’s also a tech company with an app and a staff of more than 1000 software engineers. It’s best-known as a pioneer in the growing field of firms that let customers purchase an item and pay it off over time in installments—usually four—often without any interest or fees.

BNPL services typically bill themselves as an alternative to credit cards. They work in different ways but Klarna makes the bulk of its money by charging a processing fee to the retailers that accept it not by charging shoppers. Though it does also collect fees or interest on late payments depending on which service the customer is using.

In recent years the company and its ilk have seen their popularity grow—a trend the pandemic supercharged as it sent more shoppers online. In 2020 Klarna reported a 46% jump (pdf) in the total value of transactions it processed.

Consumers like BNPL options because they get more financial flexibility without having to pay for it. Avoiding credit card interest and being able to make purchases they couldn’t otherwise squeeze into their budgets were the top two reasons shoppers gave for using BNPL in a survey that CB Insights a technology research firm included in a report on the industry (pdf).

Retailers are happy to accept BNPL because it can help increase the number of shoppers making purchases lead to shoppers spending more and attract new customers especially young ones. On an earnings call last November sneaker retailer Foot Locker said that since enabling Klarna on all its North American sites the service had become one of the top three payment methods customers chose with more than 2000 transactions every day. Macy’s said in February that two-thirds of the customers using Klarna to make purchases were entirely new for the retailer and most were under age 40. (BNPL appears particularly popular for fashion and beauty products.)

But BNPL options have also raised concerns they make it too easy for shoppers to buy things they can’t afford and missed payments can still ding a customer’s credit. While companies like Klarna try to upend the credit-card industry they’re doing so under increased scrutiny from regulators.

And it’s not always clear whether BNPL is a great deal for all merchants. As fintech consultant Jason Mikula pointed out during a Clubhouse discussion with Quartz smaller retailers may not have the resources to figure out whether the charges they pay to these lenders which can be around 7% are worth it. It can require some savvy and analytics to divine whether a sale is truly attributable to a pay-later option.

A brief history of credit

BNPL is a 21st century version of a very old idea. Here’s a look back at some highlights in the history of credit.

18th century BCE: By the time Babylonian king Hammurabi issued his series of written laws lending goods or money at interest was established practice. His code laid out regulations on topics such as maximum interest rates—33% on loans of grain and 20% on loans of silver—and debt relief.

Advertisement

1st century BCE: Roman law permitted loaning money at interest (pdf) or usura but prohibited compound interest usurae usararum. The English term “usury” derived from these and originally meant charging any amount of interest though today it refers to charging excessive interest.

Middle Ages: Even when it was allowed lending for profit was generally viewed as predatory. In Europe religious doctrines eventually forbid it. The Catholic church for example banned Christians from loaning to other Christians at interest and in 1179 enacted a proposal threatening excommunication of those who did.

16th century: By this time global trade and exploration had created a growing need for capital and credit. In 1545 England’s Henry VIII fixed a national interest rate of up to 10%.

18th century: Consumer culture began to emerge and modern banks with it. In colonial America where hard currency was often scarce credit was vital to the growth of the young economy.

Advertisement

19th century: Mass production was creating new consumer products but they could be expensive to buy in cash. It became common to purchase farm equipment sewing machines furniture and pianos in installments helping to spread the idea of credit financing for everyday goods.

20th century: During the Great Depression layaway programs let shoppers pay for products over time. Companies had also begun to issue credit cards that let customers buy goods at their outlets. In 1950 Diner’s Club introduced the first card for shoppers to make purchases at a variety of businesses.

21st century: The boom in e-commerce spawns new buy-now-pay-later options for online shoppers.

How does Klarna make money?

Klarna makes the bulk of its money by charging a processing fee to the retailers that accept it not by charging shoppers. The company’s net operating income rose to 10 billion Swedish krona ($1.1 billion) last year almost a 40% jump from 2019.

Quick QZ&A

GP Bullhound an advisory and investment firm put money into Klarna in 2013. We talked to Stockholm-based partner Joakim Dal about what he called BNPL’s “land grab” phase—disrupting credit cards the same way streaming music disrupted CDs and mp3s.

(Responses have been condensed.)

How did Klarna get on your Radar?

Advertisement

We knew the founders of Klarna from university. The company was founded in 2005 with a simple yet revolutionizing idea about how to create a safer and simpler way to pay online—shopping with an invoice. It’s a very secure way for paying for things online when you have low trust or you don’t know if the product fits or if it’s the right color—there’s so much uncertainty involved when you’re buying things online.

What did Klarna use the money for?

They raised money to expand to Germany and Austria from their core region in the Nordics. That was a big bet back then. Whenever you’re dealing with fintech there’s so much local preference local regulation that it was very uncertain whether they would be able to conquer that market. It was tough in the beginning just like it was in the US and the UK but they eventually succeeded and particularly after the acquisition of Sofort which is one of the major payment options in Germany.

How does the results of that investment compare with your expectations?

I think it has paid off more than we expected. In the beginning it was about German-speaking countries which they succeeded in. And then the story was about the UK the largest e-commerce market in Europe where it’s now established that they are a success. And now the next market to win is the US. Also the product has evolved from just being an invoice. It’s a smooth payment tool that consumers love and increases conversion for merchants.

Why is “buy now pay later” so popular?

While the phrase “buy now pay later” seldom came up in public discussions with execs until last year its natural alignment with shopping apps and websites led to a pandemic boost. Adding to the momentum (and earnings call mentions) BNPL fintech Affirm joined the public market in January and PayPal recently started a pay-later service.

There were a record 46 “buy now pay later” mentions on earnings calls conferences and shareholder meetings in February according to data compiled by Sentieo up from zero last April. Companies like Klarna Afterpay and Affirm “are well on their way to becoming household names with new user growth and transaction volume exploding” according to CB Insights.

And Long After.',"TC Transcontinental Packaging's 100% industrially compostable single-serve coffee pod is accompanied by a 100% compostable mother bag and a fully recyclable paperboard carton containing 65% recycled content. The pod technology which uses “a high percentage” of renewable plant-based materials was a world first in 2015 when it was launched by Club Coffee. The FPA Award recognizes TC Transcontinental for its work with Maxwell House Coffee Canada a Kraft Heinz Canada brand which debuted the compostable pods in September 2020.

According to TC Transcontinental engineering the compostable films to ensure their performance and ability to run on existing equipment demanded true collaboration and partnership between its R&D team and the Maxwell House product engineering team. The zero-waste pod which eliminates the need to separate components before disposal is constructed of a nonwoven mesh filter made from corn-based polylactic acid bioplastic (supplier unnamed) a ring made from 20% coffee bean husks and PLA and a wood pulp-based lid. Explains TC Transcontinental the lidding is a lamination of paper and a compostable sealant with the paper providing thermal stability and the sealant sealing the lid to the filter and ring.

Disposal of the spent pod which includes 85% coffee grounds is a simple process advises Maxwell House: “Toss the pod into the compost bin and it will decompose in the nutrient-rich soil.”

To keep the coffee fresh until use pods are packaged in a mother bag made from a lamination of NatureFlex™ PLA from Futamura and a compostable sealant with an additional layer of oxygen barrier. To ensure there is no soil toxicity in the composting process of the pod or mother bag the lidding material and bag are printed using the Extended Gamut 7 flexographic printing process which TC Transcontinental says “optimizes the amount of ink laydown while pleasingly reproducing the critical brand graphics.” The inks used they add have been tested safe for heavy metals and eco-toxicity.

After being real-world tested in a cross-section of composting conditions and processes including windrow in-vessel and static aerated piles both the lidding material and mother bag were certified by BPI (Biodegradable Products Institute) to meet ASTM D6400 and D6868 standards for industrial composting. Says TC Transcontinental “BPI ensures that any product they certify is fully compostable—all components—into good compost soil with no toxicity.” The company adds that these packaging components are formulated to break down in a period of approximately seven weeks

In fact the last ten years have seen global numbers multiply by more than seven times especially among the under 35’s.

With one in eight Brits – or almost 13% of the population –now vegetarian or vegan and a further 21% identifying as flexitarian this means that at least ⅓ of the population are now eating a meat-reduced diet.

So what’s been driving this massive expansion of herbivorous behaviour? And how has that in turn affected global business?

In this article we’re going to look at the growth of the vegan economy analysing why it’s happening and what can we expect for the decades ahead.

What is Driving the Rise in the Vegan Economy?

Estimates for the global vegan food market now predict it to reach $31.4 billion by 2026.

Set against a decline in the global meat market (a $1.8 trillion industry) by 3% during 2020  it’s clear that the plant based economy is going to fill the gap.

But what is driving the cultural shift.

Ad Slot 6

Evidence suggests the shift is coming primarily from younger generations who place animal welfare personal health and the climate crisis at the forefront of their consumer choices.

Gen Z and Millennials are by far the most likely age groups to be vegan and vegetarian.

87.5% of Gen Z are worried about the environment

41% of Gen Z feel that climate change is the single most important issue facing the planet.

35% Of Generation Z Want To Be Meat-Free By 2021.

The Rise of the Vegan Influencer

There’s little doubt social media has played a crucial part in promoting veganism amongst younger people.. As digital and social media natives Gen Z teens have never known a world without Facebook Tiktop and Instagram.

Analysis by Brandwatch shows that veganism is actually the most popular nutrition topic on social media written about by some 54% of food influencers.

“People such as Ariana Grande Lewis Hamilton Kim Kardashian Serena Williams and Moby are all vegan and have huge social followings” points out Scott McCulloch (founder of box scheme The Vegan Kind) “Generation Z is growing up in an environment whereby they are concerned about the future of Planet Earth and use social media to discuss and engage with these issues.”

Battle for the Centre of the Plate

From the Mcdonalds plant burger to the vegan suite at the Hilton London Bankside Hotel one sector after another is waking up to the power of the vegan economy.

Originally limited to niche companies with a core vegan ethos we’re now seeing brands like Nestle launching the Garden Gourmet’s Incredible burger in Europe Kraft-Heinz selling vegan mayo and Dairy giant Danone releasing its first plant-based Actimel range..

With protein forming a core component of most meals in the Western diet ‘this is a battle for the centre of the plate’ as Justin Sherrard a strategist at Rabobank puts it. Rabbard goes onto point out that the vegetarian protein market is of greater interest than its current size denotes by itself because it indicates the broader cultural shift that will see a reduction in meat industry dominance.

“Plant-based is not a threat” said Wayne England who leads Nestlé’s food strategy. “On the contrary it’s a great opportunity for us. Many of our existing brands can play much more in this space than they do today so we’re accelerating that shift and there is also space for new brands.”

How Big Could the Vegan Economy Get?

If we use the plant based milk industry as an example( an increase from 13 to 35 billion within 5 years) it’s clear that veganism has not only become mainstream but could replace the traditional diet within the next century.

A report by global consultants AT Kearney goes so far as to say that by 2040 60% of meat will no longer come directly from animals but will be derived from either cultured meat or plant-based alternatives.

By that reckoning the conventional meat industry is on a twenty year countdown to being superseded – a remarkable fact given that it’s worth $2 trillion per year.

With food shaping our job markets and even our religious and cultural identities it’s clear that this transition will affect every corner of our planet.

We have also received correspondence from Utah and Pennsylvania to say the original Worcestershire Sauce is in demand stateside with John Magnusson among those “missing my fix”.

“I have been checking shelves for days now at multiple stores and we are still out of Worcestershire Sauce” said Mr Magnusson from Alpine Utah.

“We have some knock-off brand but they are never worth spending my money on. Love your sauce!”

Jeannie Prendergast from East Texas said: “Stocks are greatly reduced in my area East Texas! HELP! We can't grill our tenderloin steaks without it!”

Meme Page added: “There is definitely still a shortage here in Texas. We can't find it at any of the grocery stores. And the online prices are gouging everyone!”

Michele Brauer: “We are desperately searching for the original Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce in our area of Pennsylvania USA.

“We have been unable to locate it for months. Our local supermarkets and Walmart have vacant spots waiting to be filled.

“I personally ran out of it and have begun to have withdrawals.

“I know this is just psychosomatic but I grew up on this product. After 50 years of pouring it over every beef chicken pork noodle corn potato or rice dish I don’t know how I’m going to last until it’s back in stock.

“Please know that meals are just not enjoyable without your product.”

We reported in February that some supermarkets and shops in the UK were stocking the smaller 150ml bottles but there were gaps on the shelves where the 290ml size was usually stocked.

Supplies had been stymied by the ""short-term availability of bottles"" in December quelling the usual flow of one of the nation's favourite condiments but parent company Kraft Heinz said the availability of receptacles had been “stabilised” by February.

Worcester News is awaiting response from Kraft Heinz on the supply issues in America although Mr Magnusson does appear to have found some.

For the past two decades Murray’s Cheese has been Manhattan’s cheese tastemaker. From a small Greenwich Village store cheesemongers enlighten New Yorkers on terroirs and washed rinds and supply upscale restaurants with camembert and French triple crèmes. Since 2008 Murray’s influence has spread across the country. Now fully owned by Kroger the nation’s largest supermarket chain Murray’s Cheese has over 750 locations across more than 30 states. The name Murray has become to specialty cheese what Nathan is to hotdogs — a New York Jew turned name brand.

I’d gone to the Bleecker Street shop for years without realizing that Murray’s Cheese had gotten bigger than Chuck E. Cheese. Like most New Yorkers I knew it was a classic Village shop but not much else. A counter man once told me that the store was founded in 1940 by a certain Murray Greenberg. Then I stumbled on the store’s About page and was shocked to read “Murray Greenberg was a Jewish veteran of the Spanish Civil War.”

Could it be possible that less than a year after Franco’s victory Murray opened New York’s cheese shop par excellence? It was like discovering Eli Zabar was a Navy Seal.

It’s a little hard to reconcile the Murray of truffle brie with the Murray of partisan warfare. I wanted to learn how Murray went from communist to corporate from guerilla to gourmet. But Murray’s Cheese representatives could only point to “oral tradition” as their source. So I interviewed Murray’s son Allen Greenberg former employees his successor and customers. I combed through decades-old news clippings consulted the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives and tracked down immigration census and other historical documents.

In the end I can say Murray Greenberg (born Moische Schuchelmann) was not a Spanish Civil War veteran nor was he a radical. During the years of the war Murray was selling pickles and herring at his family’s appetizing store on the Lower East Side not gunning down fascists in the Pyrenees. As for all those Murray’s Cheese “Est. 1940” totes there wasn’t a Murray’s Cheese until the 1960s.

Murray The Man and The Legend

Murray Greenberg the youngest of nine children was born in a shtetl in what is now Ukraine in 1909. Immigration and census records show his family arrived on the Lower East Side a little over a year later squeezing into a tenement. Murray’s father peddled goods from a pushcart and his teenage siblings worked in sweatshops. Within 20 years the family managed to open St. Marks Appetizing and own a couple of tenements under the Second Avenue El. Murray would go on to have a large impact on New York cheese. But how the son of a pushcart peddler became the face of a multimillion dollar cheese empire is not a Jewish Horatio Alger tale. It is the story of the upscaling of the Village the rise of gourmet food and most of all the gentrification of a man.

The origin myth of Murray’s Cheese started with Robert Kaufelt the heir to the New Jersey supermarket chain that would become Mayfair-Foodtown. He bought the store in 1991 invested in it and hired a consultant Steven Jenkins who was the cheesemonger of the highly-regarded specialty market Dean & Deluca. Within a decade the affordable neighborhood joint transformed into an upscale destination shop. Murray’s Cheese came to debut a European Union of rare cheeses and nurture a generation of American upstarts. They gained a reputation as a trendsetter when in the late 1990s they began to sell wholesale to fine dining restaurants; they branched out to their own restaurants a second location in Grand Central and man-made affinage caves. Eventually they caught the eye of the Fortune 100 company Kroger (owner of Fry’s Fred Meyer Ralphs King Soopers QFC etc.).

For Kaufelt the year 2004 was a turning point. The store moved to 254 Bleecker Street a space ten times the size of the original shop. That year a laudatory profile of Kaufelt in the New Yorker entitled “Big Cheese” called the store “The Village Landmark that helped put cheese on the map.” In the New Yorker and elsewhere Kaufelt promoted a backstory widely repeated and later adopted by Kroger. Murray fresh from the Spanish Civil War opened an egg and butter wholesaler in 1940. Then as Kaufelt wrote in his 2006 Cheese Handbook “in the 1970s he finally sold the shop to his clerk Louis Tudda an Italian immigrant from Calabria.”

Kaufelt says he first visited the store in 1989. Recently divorced uninspired by his position as president of his family’s 28-supermarket business he had moved to Greenwich Village like many before him to find himself. “One day I was standing in line at the original Murray’s” he recounted “and I heard Louis say he’d lost his lease and was closing.” Kaufelt who had a romantic vision of his immigrant grandfather’s small butcher shop bought the store in 1991 for $50000 and moved it from 42 Cornelia to its second location at 257 Bleecker Street. “I’d be rescuing an old-time neighborhood business” he told himself. Tudda according to Kaufelt stayed on for a year before retiring to Italy.

Tudda speaking from his home in Nassau County told me that he left Murray’s Cheese on bad terms. Only 46 years old when he lost his job at the store he once owned he had no intention to return to Italy. “After I left I worked in the deli department of King Cullen supermarket for 15 years.” Why he sold Murray’s like most New York stories is a tale of real estate.

Tudda’s family arrived from Calabria in 1957 when he was 11 years old. They lived across from Murray’s Cheese and shortly after high school he started working there as a stock boy. At the time Italian was an asset in the neighborhood. Murray taught Tudda the trade and eventually passed ownership to him in 1973 before retiring a few years later. “He gave me a chance after I worked for him for eight years” Tudda said teary-eyed. In the 1980s high rents and the allure of the suburbs accelerated the exodus of most Greenwich Village Italian families. Tudda moved to the Five Towns in Long Island. The commute in was exhausting and Bleecker Street was entering a renaissance; commercial rents were increasing. Finally in 1991 he lost his lease.

Murray’s widow May was very upset when she learned that he was being called a Communist Spanish Civil War veteran.

I ran Tudda’s version of things by Kaufelt who is now retired and living in a rowhouse in Greenwich Village. “I don’t remember any of that” he said. As for his knowledge of Murray Greenberg he claimed it came from Murray’s widow May who he met twice in the early 1990s. May passed away in 2017 but Murray’s son Allen a Citarella Manager told me that wasn’t possible. May he remembers was very upset when she read that Murray was called a Communist Spanish Civil War veteran. But Allen who is near 70 and describes himself as an East Village hippie brushed it off as a misunderstanding: “I can see how stories got crossed.” Murray a liberal was close friends with Lincoln Brigade veteran Kenneth Graeber father of noted anthropologist and inspiration of Occupy Wall Street David Graeber.

Kaufelt never looked more into the store’s history or ever contacted Allen perhaps because he wasn’t very interested in the details. “It was more about me honoring his [Murray’s] brand because my grandfather’s store was long gone” Kaufelt said referring to Kaufelt Brothers Fancy Grocery — his Jewish immigrant grandfather’s butcher shop in Perth Amboy New Jersey.

Murray’s: The Scorsese Version and the Non-Scorsese Version:

A picture of Kaufelt’s grandparents’ butcher shop used to be part of the décor of Murray’s. It’s gone but they still display black-and-white photos of classic ethnic-looking cheesemongers. The images place the brand in the tradition of 20th century white immigrant communities but the photos are not of Murray Greenberg or Louis Tudda. Rather like the Murray’s origin myth they are curated to give a patina of authenticity. Richard E. Ocejo a sociologist at John Jay College who has written about the upscaling of traditional urban crafts can see how this works for Kroger. “People like the idea of the mom-and-pop shop” he said. “They like the social aspect of it the romance of it. These things sell.”

For Elizabeth Chubbuck Murray’s Chief Strategic Officer the legacy of Murray Greenberg is not superficial; it is a guiding value “We keep the spirit of the neighborhood store like your local cheesemonger whose name you know” she said. In the best light a large corporation is channeling the ethos of a humble 1940s immigrant business even if they get the history wrong. In the worst light Kroger’s is indulging in a type of ethnic New York minstrelsy. For instance a Kroger web article compares Murray and Tudda to “characters in a Scorsese film”. “It’s a bit of a manufactured romanticism” said Ocejo “and saying he’s a Communist lends additional authenticity.”

“The entire West Village was his customers” Murray’s son Allen recalled.

I asked Allen for the non-Scorsese version. “It started off as leftovers from my uncle’s business” Allen told me from his home in the East Village. Murray’s future brother-in-law Carl Margulies opened “Tom’s River Fresh Farm Eggs” at 42 Cornelia Street (records suggest it was in 1942 shortly after the building was constructed in late 1941). “They had butter they cut with a wire and sold loose eggs.” The store was a continuation of Carl’s parents’ shop on East 9th Street a block from Murray’s family appetizing store.

In 1949 Murray the son of the herring man married May Margulies the daughter of the dairy man. Murray started to work for his brother-in-law’s business then called “Glen Alden Farms.” Carl and his wife sold wholesale to restaurants. Murray and May stocked the shop with the surplus of eggs tins of olive oil maraschino cherries and yes cheese. This lasted about a decade. “My side of the family wanted independence” Allen who did the deliveries back then remembered “and my father bought the outlet from my uncle.” It was then in 1962 that Murray’s Cheese was born.

Few records survive of the shop’s years under Murray. In 1976 New York Times food writer Mimi Sheraton called the selection “limited” but announced “the quality of almost everything on hand is dependable and prices are reasonable.” A few years later Sheraton wrote about the dinner parties of a loyal customer Mayor Ed Koch who was quoted as saying ”The meal begins with arugula and cheeses from Murray’s Cheese Shop on Cornelia Street where I buy whatever is on sale.” The mayor raised eyebrows for sending the Gracie Mansion chef on chauffeured discount cheese runs.

By all accounts Murray’s Cheese drew long lines. “The entire West Village was his customers” said Allen. He associates the store with his father working 13-hour days six days a week and no vacation. His mother put in significant hours too. Still he concedes that it was “romantic” a neighborhood mom-and-pop shop. And not just any neighborhood. John Strausbaugh author of “The Village” called Cornelia Street in the 1950s “a backwater of the Italian Village. It also had its bohemian credentials — the poet W.H. Auden lived at 7 Cornelia and at number 31 was Caffe Cino the birthplace of Off-Off-Broadway and an LGBTQ landmark. Joe Cino claimed he only got the lease because he was Sicilian.

By the 1990s gone were the bohemians radicals and immigrants. Mario Batali’s first restaurant Pó took over the former site of Caffe Cino and in 1997 The New York Times celebrated a “Cornelia’s Street revival.” Kaufelt was one of several wealthy entrepreneurs who took over vintage Village spots upscaled them capitalized on their names and fudged their history. By 2010 The Times deemed the Greenwich Village “a theme park of the past” with businesses that “offer a vision of a lost bohemian New York — albeit with a well-heeled clientele and prices to match.” Kaufelt always ahead of the pack turned the Village into an export. “We’re taking the neighborhood national” he told Crain’s in 2016 before selling his remaining stake to Kroger who he had been partnering with since 2008.

What Would Murray Do?

The Murray’s Cheese brand is simultaneously classic and trailblazer. Kaufelt saved Murray’s only to upend it. In 2012 he told Edible Manhattan “Louie’s store was essentially an Italian bodega.” As for Murray Kaufelt described him to the New Yorker as a “Marxist capitalist shrewd with a buck” accusing him of trimming the mold off “gray market” cheddar and palming off repurposed over-ripe brie. The message is clear: It may be called Murray’s but Kaufelt built the brand.

I asked Allen about Kaufelt’s assertions. “I don’t want to say anything bad or good” he said of Kaufelt who he has never met. “He did a wonderful job with my father’s store.” The attacks on Murray as a cheesemonger do get under his skin though.

Did his father sell moldy cheese? “Rob [Kaufelt] could tell you on the semi-soft cheeses and on the hard cheeses if there isn’t some mold on it there’s something wrong” he said bluntly. “You have to be trimming mold all the time in the cheese business.”

Jenkins a James Beard award-winning cheese master confirmed this. “Every cheesemonger does that” he said. The difference according to him is that “Louie and Murray specialized in distressed cheeses.”

Kaufelt told me his anecdotes were meant to be humorous not putdowns. “I had much stricter standards than my predecessors” he said but claimed he was not trying to not pass judgment. “They were trying to make a living.”

Allen clarified that his father didn’t buy “gray market” cheese. He looked for deals from wholesalers and sold cheap and had a knack for finding value in cheese that was not pristine enough for the likes of Jenkins or Kaufelt. According to Allen “he didn’t have the same inventory two weeks in a row. Whatever he could get a bargain on that was what he was selling.”

In New York before the 1970’s there weren’t any fancy soft ripening French cheeses and Italian cheeses and nobody knew from goat’s milk

.

Both Allen and Kaufelt liken Murray’s style of business to a “pushcart operation” and see it as generational. “There weren’t any fancy soft ripening French cheeses and Italian cheeses” Allen said of New York before the 1970s “and nobody knew from goat’s milk.” Murray wasn’t looking to get into anything luxurious. “Cheese is food. During the Depression nobody had enough food” Murray told a local newspaper The Villager in 1975 explaining that he got into the business because he “learned food is important food has value.” Then in the 1970s things started to change. All around him the gourmet food movement was taking off. In 1977 his competitor Giorgio Deluca parlayed his cheese shop into the legendary Dean & Deluca. Murray’s nephew Arnold Greenberg converted the family business St. Mark’s Appetizing into the city’s first natural food store. It was there he created the Snapple brand. Even Allen decided against joining his father’s store in favor of working at Balducci’s the pioneer specialty grocer. “The prices were going up like crazy and my father knew from selling cheap.” Murray by then at retirement age called it quits.

For Murray who grew up poor places like Balducci’s “made absolutely no sense” Allen said. “His mindset was ‘how can anybody in their right mind spend this kind of money?’” Ironically it was Balducci’s that inspired Kaufelt to flee what he called “the boring sterile markets” of the suburbs. Kaufelt’s grandparents may have had the same mindset as Murray. Kaufelt however came from money had an Ivy League degree and was well-traveled. For him focusing on quality and service not price made perfect sense.

Allen wonders if Kaufelt lost his right to criticize once Murray’s Cheese became part of Kroger. Can Kroger maintain a gourmet experience on a large scale? Indeed in 2003 Kaufelt wrote a New York Times Op-Ed about the failed attempt at a Balducci’s chain. He argued “supermarkets are driven by efficiency while specialty stores are about excellence of product and knowledgeable service. What’s more New York City is unlike any other market in the country.”

Kaufelt came to believe he found a way to go from two Manhattan stores to a company opening 100 new locations a year without sacrificing quality. The Murray’s Cheese shops inside Kroger supermarkets and its affiliates have improved the cheese options for millions but they fall short of the standards Kaufelt once set. The selection is impressive for a supermarket but less varied and more affordable than the New York shops’ offering. For the most part they do not cut to order instead offering pre-cut cheese wrapped in plastic a practice Kaufelt once admonished.

Before it became a chain Kaufelt’s vision of a cheese shop did compete in real-time with the Murray Greenberg style of business. In the 1980s Murray ran East Village Cheese. The popular store remained open till 2018. In 1981 Murray was back behind the counter balding with white hair in his usual pose one arm resting on his belly and his hand propping up his chin. The store owners were Alvin and Carol Kaufman. Alvin a Jewish convert to Buddhism in the 1990s would hire a staff of Tibetan monks who eventually came to own the store. The Kaufmans met Murray at a wholesaler by serendipity. Murray anxious to get back in retail convinced the two strangers to open a cheese shop. For a minimal salary he would run it. Their original plan was to open an Italian deli in New Jersey but in one conversation Murray converted them. The no-frills store was modeled on the original Murray’s down to its handwritten signs plastered everywhere.

The tiny 9th Street store like the original Murray’s was the antithesis of Kaufelt’s vision of a specialty shop. If the Murray’s Cheese flagship is the “Apple Store” as Crain’s New York called it East Village Cheese was a bazaar stall; small loud and chaotic.

“What do you want? We were by far the cheapest cheese store in the world.”

The store stuck to the Murray Greenberg model. It gave no samples mandated a half-pound minimum and kept the line moving; practices unheard of in gourmet shops. “What do you want?” asked Kaufman “We were by far the cheapest cheese store in the world.” Whether true or not a 2006 guidebook noted “the most expensive cheese of East Village Cheese is about the same price as the least expensive cheese at Murray’s.” An accomplishment I imagine Murray would be proud of.

I asked Allen what his father would think of Murray’s today. He paused to think. “The word would probably be feh” he said. “It’s too fancy for him.”

We had the first flight of the F-15EX variant for instance or the announcement that it is going to get the brand new Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System. But now it’s time to put the F-16 under the spotlight.

The single-engined aircraft has been around since way back in 1978 and as it usually happens with military machines it eventually branched out into several variants. It also got upgraded countless times over the years as the threats it had to face continuously evolved.To be able to cope with what the near future has to throw at it the F-16 will get another major boost in its capabilities soon. Lockheed Martin  the company now making the F-16 decided it’s time for the plane to get a new electronic warfare system in place to shield it from “radar and electronic threats.”Lockheed Martin tasked L3Harris with this project the company that has been supplying these systems for the F-16 for the past 30 years.The solution envisioned is an evolution of the company's Viper Shield and should provide “a virtual electronic shield around the aircraft” that can protect the pilot and the plane every time a radar threat is detected including by launching countermeasures.“The L3Harris Viper Shield EW system enables the F-16 to continue to be one of the most effective combat aircraft in the world” said Ed Zoiss President Space and Airborne Systems L3Harris.“Our 30-year legacy on the F-16 coupled with the advanced technologies being developed for Viper Shield provide our warfighters and international partners with unprecedented self-protection that helps to ensure mission success.”Viper Shield will be deployed on F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft configurations which are generally fielded by allied countries in the Middle East Asia and Europe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJhbGRiYW5uZXIuY29tL2NvdmlkLTE5L2dyZWVudmlsbGUtcG9saWNlLW9mZmljZXItbWFrZXMtYmlnLWFzc2lzdC13aXRoLXlvdXRocy9hcnRpY2xlX2RkODY3NDIwLTkzZjQtMTFlYi1hZWZjLTJmYWFhN2U4ZmNkZi5odG1s0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZGJhbm5lci5jb20vY292aWQtMTkvZ3JlZW52aWxsZS1wb2xpY2Utb2ZmaWNlci1tYWtlcy1iaWctYXNzaXN0LXdpdGgteW91dGhzL2FydGljbGVfZGQ4Njc0MjAtOTNmNC0xMWViLWFlZmMtMmZhYWE3ZThmY2RmLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greenville police officer makes big assist with youths,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

And for a very long part of our history that also meant having built machines that could accommodate us physically.

Since the advent of drones  that has changed. It’s not that long since humans learned they could do things remotely but we’ve already come a great way in this respect. So now in our day and age machines that could not have operated unless under the direct control of a human beings are not only doing it but have been designed to never be able to accommodate us mammals on board.That’s mostly true for military aerial drones and there’s more than one example of that in our skies. The maritime world on the other hand seems to fall behind in this respect and DARPA plans to change that.NOMARS is how their latest project in this field is called. The acronym stands for No Manning Required Ship and as per the official description it should be designed with no consideration whatsoever for crew but with the utmost respect for payload weight and power.At the beginning of March American defense contractor L3Harris announced it had been selected by DARPA for the Phase I of the NOMARS program together with partner VARD Marine.The company did not provide any details on the project it is working on safe for the fact that its ship will be capable of making its own decisions and act upon them without human intervention if need be.“L3Harris continues to pioneer innovative autonomous solutions that offer fully automated and integrated ship control and preventative maintenance systems to the U.S. Navy and its allies” said in a statement Sean Stackley President Integrated Mission Systems L3Harris.“The NOMARS program selection reinforces our commitment to deliver highly reliable and affordable autonomous solutions that transform the way the U.S. Navy conducts its future missions.”",,,,,,

Her death while tragic was not entirely shocking as she had been missing for two weeks. The circumstances surrounding her death however continue to leave us feeling baffled and to be honest a little freaked out.

Top 10 Strangest Theories About Mysterious Occurrences

10 Skid Row

Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel | Official Trailer | Netflix

Watch this video on YouTube

The Elisa Lam story starts in one of the most violent and dangerous places in the United States: LA’s infamous drug- and crime-infested Skid Row. The crime scene? The cursed Cecil Hotel (affectionately called “The Suicide” by its long-term residents). Also known as Stay on Main Skid Row’s budget hotel has served as a temporary residence for homeless people prostitutes and drug addicts who needed a place to stay.

The Cecil opened on Main Street in 1924 with more than 600 guestrooms among its 15 floors. It quickly became notorious for suicide violence and murder—at least 13 suicides have taken place in its rooms since 1927. But the Cecil was cheap which appealed to unwitting tourists and travelers—like Elisa Lam—who were looking for an inexpensive LA stay.

9 Unwanted Attention



Elisa Lam loved her Tumblr page. She posted frequently on the social media site sharing all aspects of her life. In a post from January 27 2013 Elisa expressed receiving unwanted attention from men and wrote “I’m going out tonight…I really hope no creeper comes near me…seriously though…those Italian and Mexican guys go after you STRONG.”

On the last day she was seen security footage showed Lam entering the lobby of the Cecil Hotel with two men. The men gave her a box they were carrying and then left. Who were these guys? What did they want? And what was in that box?





8 Mental Health



Lam’s Tumblr account Nouvelle-Nouveau revealed more than the details of her social life. The page also provided insight to her mental health and overall state of mind around the time of her death. She openly posted about being suicidal and it was well known among her friends and family that she was unstable and depressed.

In one post on her Tumblr blog she wrote “Depression sucks. Period. If someone says to you that they have depression don’t ask why. There is no why. Tell them every day you love them. Remind them every day it will get better.”

In another post she wrote: “Today has been one of those blah days full of apathy. Really dangerous too; I can see myself feeling suicidal and it always scares me when I start feeling suicidal.”

The documentary that delved into Lam’s disappearance The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel revealed that she had been prescribed at least four medications to treat bipolar disorder. The postmortem toxicology report found only small doses of the drugs in her system leading coroner Jason Tovar to believe “she was undertaking her medications.”

7 Hotel Manager

What I’ve Seen Living Across the Street from HOTEL CECIL😭

Watch this video on YouTube

Amy Price the Cecil Hotel manager at the time had a fair amount of interaction with Lam and was one of the last people to see her alive. When giving her statement in court Price claimed that her guest was originally booked to stay in a dorm-like hostel room with other girls but that her “odd behavior” had forced her to be moved. Lam was writing notes like “get out” and “go home” and placing them on the beds of other women in her room. She also locked out her roommates and demanded they provide a password to be let back in.

Sadly as an affordable place to say in the middle of an area overrun with drugs and crime the Cecil Hotel regularly hosts guests who display odd behaviors. Nevertheless Price testified that Lam had been acting strangely in the lobby the day before she disappears.





6 Television Taping



As a part of her California vacation Elisa Lam had decided to sit in on the live taping of a television show. She was a member of that audience just a few days prior to her death. Lam had written a rambling letter and became obsessed with getting the letter to the host. Due to her disruptive behavior and deemed to be a danger to other audience members she was escorted out of the studio by security and removed from its premises.

What had Lam written in that letter and why was she so hell-bent on delivering it?

5 Dark Water

While investigators were still looking into the disappearance of Elisa Lam guests at the Cecil Hotel began complaining of low water pressure and odd-tasting water. Hotel maintenance man Santiago Lopez went up to the roof to take a look at the water tanks. He claimed that the latch on the main tank was open but was not expecting to find what he did: Elisa Lam lying face-up in the water approximately twelve inches from the top of the tank.

There was confusion around this discovery however as initial reports indicated that the latch on the water tank was closed not open indicating that someone else would have had to have been involved as Elisa would not have been able to close it herself while she was in the tank.

This tragic event also happens to be the plot of the 2005 film Dark Water in which a girl’s body is discovered in a water tank on the roof of an apartment building.





4 Morbid Musician

Morbid: The Metal Musician Falsely Blamed for Elisa Lam’s Death

Watch this video on YouTube

There were many theories surrounding the death of Elisa Lam. While some ruled it to be suicide others believed that she may have been murdered. One theory that really gained traction was that the musician Morbid had killed her. A closer look however revealed that this theory was based on nothing more than the fact that he was a metal musician who sometimes wore scary makeup and had posted a video a year prior showing that he stayed at the Cecil Hotel.

When this conspiracy was debunked people began to question who might have planted this story and what the actual truth was that they were trying to cover up. This would not have been something out of the norm for the Cecil Hotel employees and its residents who included serial killers such as The Night Stalker and Jack Underweger.

3 Tuberculosis Outbreak



Another theory suggested that Elisa Lam was a test subject for a new tuberculosis medication. A website called Ghost Theory speculated that the odd behaviors Lam exhibited could be linked to the side-effects of anti-TB meds.

Lam was a student at the University of British Columbia which houses a well-known tuberculosis research center. The theory argues that Lam “knew too much” and was fatally silenced. In February 2013 after Lam’s body had been discovered there was an outbreak of tuberculosis on Skid Row. Coincidentally LAM-ELISA is the actual name of a TB test.





2 “The Last Bookstore”

Welcome to The Last Bookstore

Watch this video on YouTube

The last place Elisa Lam was seen was at The Last Bookstore in Downtown LA. This happened to be where the two men who had brought the box back to her hotel with her had been from. The box had supposedly been filled with books she had bought but could not carry back to the hotel herself. This is where it gets really weird so get ready.

The Last Bookstore’s domain contains a postal code in its registration that reads V5G 4S2. When plugged into Google Maps this postal code leads directly to a specific location in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Canada: Elisa’s burial site.

1 Elevator Footage

Elisa Lam Video

Watch this video on YouTube

No. 1 on this list can only be the final live footage of Elisa Lam. The security video was released to the public was that of an elevator in the Cecil Hotel. The deliberately jumbled and tampered-with timestamp at the bottom of the video along with a brief segment of missing footage raises questions without answers. But it’s Lam’s absolutely bizarre and erratic behavior on the tape that is the most unsettling.

At the start of the video Lam enters the elevator and proceeds to press a series of buttons. She waits for a while before becoming frightened. She pops her head out to see if there is someone outside the elevator. It is unclear whether or not there is but Lam jumps back into the elevator and proceeds to hide in the corner. She takes another look out to see if there is anyone there. This time she steps out of the elevator and starts walking in an almost choreographed fashion first in a square and then side to side.

Lam walks out of frame and returns a few moments later holding her head and grabbing onto the elevator as if she were off balance. She presses more buttons and then exits the elevator once again. While it is impossible to know if she was communicating with someone she gestures her hands in such a peculiar fashion that one could interpret she might have been. Elisa walks out of frame for the last time and after a brief pause there is an abrupt edit in the footage and the elevator door closes.

The Northwest farmers who grow potatoes for your French fries are themselves plenty fried.

The three massive agribusiness companies that make much of the world’s frozen fries tots and hash browns are going to pay Northwest potato farmers less this year.

“It really is a punch in the gut” says Adam Weber a 27-year-old third-generation grower in Quincy in Washington’s Columbia Basin.

Farmers like Weber say they’ve already taken a hit from the pandemic and higher fertilizer costs. Now they are going to get 3% less for their potatoes from Lamb Weston McCain Foods and J.R. Simplot Company.

“If you look at the processors’ returns — because they are a publicly traded company and particularly Lamb Weston — we only dream of returns that high” Weber says.

Dale Lathim with the Potato Growers of Washington negotiates the potato contracts for the growers in the Columbia Basin of Washington and Oregon.

“Growers don’t have a lot of margin to give up” Lathim says. “And so to have a 7% swing [contracts going down 3% and farmers’ costs going up 4%] is the biggest hit that the processing industry has asked growers to take on in decades.”

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Lathim says the contracts have been negotiated so late in the spring that growers can’t easily switch to other crops. Growers have likely already fumigated fertilized and in some cases planted much of their ground while preparing to grow potatoes.

“There are so many other crops you could be growing this year” Lathim says. “Some farmers would have maybe liked to go other ways with their acres.”

It costs about $5000 an acre to grow spuds in the Columbia Basin. Growers hope to make about 15% return.

“You’d hope you’d make $750 [profit] an acre on your operating cost … this year at best you’re probably gonna make $100 an acre” Lathim says.

The cost of fertilizer is also way up these days. Winter storms across the southern U.S. shipping problems from China and tariffs on imported fertilizers are all driving up prices.

Weber says the increasing land equipment and fertilizer costs are driving out small family farms in favor of large corporate potato farms. Land prices are going up from large corporations moving in from places like California he says.

“We have great weather and great access to water” Weber says. “That just drives a lot of crops and commodities and farms to our area. With that the price of land has continued to rise pretty steadily.”

Weber says this year’s lower contract price piles on to an already tough situation. Last year he got stuck with sheds plum-full of potatoes when processors said they weren’t going to buy his spuds because of the pandemic. Luckily the processors did eventually buy most of the potatoes.

“I just think people should think about it: A lot of potatoes came from right here in Washington state” Weber says. “I think everyone is better off having smaller more diverse farms. I fear for family farms throughout the country.”

Traffic inside Las Vegas casinos is picking up again but it’s not all driven by young travelers with pent-up demand.

Casino operators say customers 65 and over have started to return spurred by the growing availability of COVID-19 vaccines across the country.

“As more of the older end of the customer spectrum receives vaccines and becomes more comfortable with leaving their houses … that for sure means they’ll start to step out and go back to their favorite casinos again” said gaming consultant Josh Swissman of The Strategy Organization.

‘Starting to trickle back in’

Bob Bransdon a 68-year-old Las Vegas local said he used to visit casinos with his wife about once a week. Then the shutdowns came.

The two spent months away from casinos while they were closed and continued to avoid the properties after their June reopenings out of caution. They weren’t alone: The pandemic had led to a sharp decline in casino visitation from the 65-plus age group which is more susceptible to severe illness tied to COVID-19.

That could be turning around. Bransdon who started visiting casinos again in August said he has noticed an uptick in the 65-and-older crowd especially in the afternoons. He said the numbers aren’t what they were before the pandemic but there is “no shortage of people there.”

Some casino operators have noticed the uptick too. Several executives discussed the trend in recent weeks during the latest round of casino companies’ earnings calls.

“We’re beginning to see that part of the database that 65 and older if you will database starting to trickle back in” Golden Entertainment Chairman and CEO Blake Sartini said during a March 11 call. “We see that as a great catalyst going forward.”

The heads of other Las Vegas casino operators — including Red Rock Resorts Inc. Boyd Gaming Corp. and Penn National Gaming Inc. — also have said they have started to notice that this age group is rebounding.

“I think up until very recently that the 65-year-plus demographic has been fairly shy about coming back to the facility” Frank Fertitta III CEO of Red Rock Resorts said during a February call with investors. “If the vaccine has continued ramp-up and rollout we are cautiously optimistic that we’re starting to see the 65-plus demographic slowly return back to our facility.”

One of the major driving forces behind this demographic’s return has been the rollout of vaccinations. As of Friday 22.4 percent of American adults had been fully vaccinated according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of those vaccinations have gone toward those in older age groups with 53.5 percent of Americans 65 and older fully vaccinated.

Jo Ann Woodward 72 has not yet received a vaccine but that hasn’t stopped the Phoenix resident from making her regular Las Vegas trips.

Woodward has made two solo trips to Las Vegas during the pandemic and plans to return in April. By that time she hopes to be vaccinated — she’s waiting to receive a Johnson & Johnson vaccine so she can have a “one and done” shot — and she expects more friends will be ready to join her once they’ve all had shots in arms.

“They think that now that they’ve had the vaccine they’re immune (from the virus) and they can go wherever they want” she said. “I probably will have more people that want to go with me when I’m vaccinated.”

More confidence to venture outside the home paired with pent-up demand is good news for casinos according to Stifel analyst Steve Wieczynski.

“We expect a significant amount of pent-up demand from the (55 and older) demographic as vaccinations kick in and the country slowly goes back to normal” he said in a Feb. 25 note.

Spokespeople for the two of the six largest casino operators in Las Vegas — Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp. — did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for Boyd MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment Inc. declined to comment and a Red Rock spokesman referred to comments made by executives during the latest earnings calls.

A lucrative customer

The fact that any age group is coming back to Las Vegas is “huge” said gaming consultant Debi Nutton but the 65-plus demographic can be especially lucrative.

“Your kids are off to college; you’ve established yourself in your career” she said of the age group. “They have more discretionary income.”

According to a 2019 report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority baby boomers spent more than millennials in nearly every category including food and drink transportation shopping and sightseeing. They also spent far more on gambling budgeting an average of $838.20 per trip compared with millennials’ $350.47.

“You’re talking about a majority of the (casinos’) customer base” said Clyde Barrow a gaming industry expert and professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. “Certainly for the core (gambling customer) the table games and the slot machines. Maybe not so much for the clubs and the concerts the pool parties and those things.”

Those spending habits should carry forward in 2021. Management at Red Rock Resorts said they believe older customers have plenty of discretionary spending after months of lockdowns and limited entertainment options.

“They seem to be in pretty good shape from a financial standpoint because they just haven’t been spending their money. There’s a lot of disposable income there” said Lorenzo Fertitta vice chairman of Red Rock’s board during the company’s earnings call. “They’re anxious to come back.”

This crowd also could help solve one of the greatest challenges Las Vegas resorts have faced since the onset of the pandemic: filling rooms midweek.

Midweek occupancy rates aren’t expected to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon — conventions probably will need to make a full comeback before that can happen — but UNLV Assistant Professor of Hospitality Amanda Belarmino said as far as midweek leisure travel goes older customers lead the pack.

Their return is “highly significant for Las Vegas” she said. “They’re retired. They have that flexibility to travel midweek.”

Convergence of young and old

Virginia Valentine president of the Nevada Resort Association said the state’s resorts are “excited” to welcome back more guests as vaccines roll out and people feel more comfortable traveling.

“Those guests 65 years and older have had earlier access to the vaccine and we would anticipate their return as they feel more comfortable venturing out and resuming activities they enjoy” she said. “Our members value this customer segment and we’re happy to have them back.”

Boyd Gaming which has started to see its older core customers return expects the trend to broaden in the second and third quarters according to a March 11 note from J.P. Morgan based on conversations with Boyd CEO Keith Smith and CFO Josh Hirsberg.

The operators’ challenge will be figuring out how to attract older gamblers while also keeping their newer younger gamblers interested in returning. It’ll be easier said than done especially as other entertainment options such as clubs and shows reopen and vie for the attention of younger crowds.

“Most operators believe that as events movie theaters restaurants open up that younger customer could be fleeting” Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon said.

But online offerings could help gaming companies earn the loyalty of these newer younger customers even as other entertainment venues open their doors Beynon said.

“Given the convergence of land and digital — with online and land-based (betting) — these customers may appreciate that a little bit more” he said. “They’ll spend money online betting on a sports game but then maybe go to the land-based property that’s tied in with that asset.”

This week: Odyssey Logistics opens facility in Laredo; CBP beefs up border security; Rockport Terminals acquired by Jones Capital; and train collides with tractor-trailer in Houston.

Odyssey Logistics expands into Laredo

Danbury Connecticut-based Odyssey Logistics & Technology Corp. recently opened a trucking and logistics facility in Laredo Texas.

Odyssey Logistics said the cross-dock facility will offer various services including a bonded container freight station a hub for customs transactions and a warehouse for goods waiting to clear customs.

“We’re poised for growth so the whole facility is designed to be scalable based on the needs of our customers in the area” Ali Bukneberg a company spokeswoman told FreightWaves. “To start we’ve got a handful of team members running the 11211-square-foot facility.”

Located in LA Ventures Airpark the Odyssey facility is located inside a 22483-square-foot building and includes 1356 square feet of office space. The facility’s specifications include a Chicago-style open dock with three dock doors for tractor-trailers and one ramp.

The facility is located at 4106 Airpark Drive next to Laredo International Airport as well as State Highway 59 and Loop 20.

Odyssey Logistics officials said the investment in Laredo was prompted by the passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement as well as the possibility of more manufacturing nearshoring to Mexico in a wide range of industries.





“The expansion into Laredo powers up our logistics services to run door-to-door supply chain from Mexico into the U.S. with seamless control and transfer” Bob Shellman Odyssey Logistics president and CEO said in a release.

According to FreightWaves SONAR data Laredo’s outbound tender volume index (OTVI.LRD) increased mildly from a week ago but has risen 75% year-over-year.

Odyssey Logistics is a global logistics provider with locations in North America Asia and Europe. The company operates in all modes of transport: truckload and less-than-truckload container ship rail air and bulk including bulk truck ISO tank railcar and tanker as well as food-grade product lines.

Odyssey Logistics also has a 30000-square-foot cross-dock distribution facility in El Paso Texas according to the company’s website.

CBP aims to beef up border security technology

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recently selected three companies to compete for a $480 million contract to supply drive-through imaging systems to scan tractor-trailers for contraband and potential threat items at border ports of entry.

The three finalists — Leidos Rapiscan Systems and Smiths Detection — will initially provide one Multi-Energy Portal (MEP) scanning system to CBP.

The MEP systems are part of CBP’s plans to increase the amount of cargo being scanned that enters the U.S. at land ports of entry. CBP currently scans about 15% of commercial vehicles and 1% of passenger vehicles.





Over the next few years CBP aims to increase the number of commercial vehicles scanned to more than 70%.

Leidos is providing the company’s VACIS IP6500 MEP which is integrated with Viken Detection’s Oprey-EVX a low-energy backscatter imaging technology. Viken’s Osprey-UVX under-vehicle X-ray imaging system will also be available.

“We’ve taken the approach of providing under-vehicle solutions and portal solutions for multiple partners in these programs” Viken CEO Jim Ryan told FreightWaves. “We’ve got a pretty unique solution with the under-vehicle solution piece of it.”

In 2020 Viken Detection installed four undercarriage Osprey-UVX devices at two South Texas land ports of entry as part of a contract with CBP. Ryan said he could not disclose which ports were part of the contract but said the pandemic slowed down installations.

The aim of the Viken’s technology is to speed up vehicle inspections with more accurate devices Ryan said.

“For commercial traffic inspecting underneath commercial or passenger vehicles has always been the hardest area of the vehicle to inspect” Ryan said. “Our backscatter X-ray technology can penetrate the parts of the vehicle unable to be inspected — inside mufflers tires exhaust manifolds everything underneath the vehicle — and see if there’s contraband weapons human trafficking occurring.”

Rockport Terminals acquired by Jones Capital

Houston-based Jones Capital has acquired Rockport Terminals one of the largest private intermodal terminals on the Texas Gulf Coast.

Rockport Terminals is located on the Gulf of Mexico about 28 miles from the Port of Corpus Christi. The terminal includes access to the intracoastal waterway nearby railways and several major highways.

Rockport Terminals specializes in bulk liquids storage bulk and break bulk and bulk liquids product handling.

Jones Capital is an investment firm that specializes in strategic minority equity investments in lower-middle-market businesses.

Train crashes into truck hauling exotic cars

A tractor-trailer hauling a Ferrari SF90 Stradale and other exotic cars was struck by a train while driving through Houston on Thursday afternoon.

The incident remains under investigation but eyewitness accounts indicate that the tractor-trailer attempted to drive over a railroad crossing in northwest Houston around 3:15 p.m. and became stuck on the tracks.

The train was unable to come to a complete stop resulting in a low-speed impact to the trailer. Nobody was injured in the collision according to the Houston Police Department.

The tractor-trailer also was carrying a 488 Ferrari Spyder and a Porsche 911.

19-year-old singer Billie Eilish just won her second set of Grammy Awards one for Best Record and another for Best Song Written for Visual Media. The young star has been working hard to perfect her craft for years and as a singer she takes precise care of her voice because her style is so versatile. Some of her songs including Bad Guy and My Future use an extremely deep octave vocal range while some of her other hits including James Bond theme No Time To Die require a much higher singing voice.

In order to keep her voice in the best shape possible Billie previously revealed she would sing a specific song before every show to get herself warmed up. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight in 2019 the star was asked if she had any way of preparing herself to perform. She replied: “I did I used to… The first tour I actually had a song I would warm up with which was Sabrina Claudio!” Sabrina is a fellow young American singer from Miami Florida.

The Beatles and The Rolling Stones were always considered rivals in the music industry. Although they grew up and performed around the same time they were always pitted against one another in both the press and within the charts. Paul McCartney once recalled how the two bands would share equipment and help each others’ roadies with their gear. Their friendly relationship even progressed to the point where a member of the Stones featured on one of the Fab Four’s tracks You Know My Name (Look Up The Number).

The track was released as a B-side on their hit song Let It Be on March 6 1970. The song has one lyric its title and continues chanting the words through an increasingly chaotic set of sounds. McCartney once described it as “lounge-style music” reminiscent of listening to an artist in a smokey underground bar. John Lennon spoke about how he first came up with the idea long before he began recording it. READ MORE: One Direction: Harry Styles - '1D were bigger than The Beatles'

The Beatles: Brian Jones appeared in the song as a saxophonist

Jones’ saxophone contribution to the song can be heard in the final 30 seconds of the track. His ripping solo creates a stark difference between the track and The Beatles' other work. Jones was one of the key members of The Rolling Stones after founding the band in 1962. The guitarist was the leader of the group until his drug and alcohol problems forced his bandmates to dismiss him from the role of lead guitarist. His spot in the gang was taken by Mick Taylor.

When Timecop1983 announced on his social media pages that he was releasing a new album on April 2 2021 his fans were delighted. The posts were filled with comments which said: ""So glad you're back!"" While speaking over Zoom Timecop1983 - real name Jordy - laughed and said: “I thought well I’ve never been away. I’ve always been here!” It's true the producer has been releasing singles and featuring on tracks steadily for the past few years. Last year he released the first single from Faded Touch One Night which featured Josh Dally. Along with it came the announcement that the record would be a cooperative project between the two synthwave giants.

Bringing Josh onto the project wasn’t originally Jordy’s plan however. Instead the Dutch producer wanted to feature the singer in one of his songs - as he had done before. Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk Timecop1983 said from his home in the Netherlands: “At first I wanted to do an all-instrumental album and then I thought: ‘I have to do at least one song with him.’ I sent him a bunch of ideas and he liked all the ideas… and he sent me some ideas.” One thing led to another and before long Jordy asked Josh to become the exclusive collaborator on Timecop1983’s momentous fifth album. Both of the artists were cracking jokes on the Zoom call proving they have a real connection despite being countries apart. Jordy gushed: “Josh is great to work with. A great musician great vocalist … It’s been a great process working with him and finishing the album as good as we can. I always try to do everything myself as much as possible so it was great to do it a little differently this time.” Josh had the same sentiments. However he also pointed out the artistic opportunity they had from agreeing to work together on one mighty album. Speaking from London he said: “[Working together] means Timecop could tell a story with this album that is to the point. It says something.”

READ MORE Wolfclub Just Drive Part 1 album review: Versatile genre-defining hits Josh said: “It’s not quite a few people’s ideas. We wanted to make something that was succinct and the music told the story as well as the lyrics.” After a few listens to Faded Touch I noticed how sombre and specific some of the track’s lyrics were. It sounded like a visceral breakup album. I pressed the producers on this prompting Jordy to say: “This is all yours Josh!” The singer revealed: “The lyrics are always something that you write from the heart and you look at after and say: ‘Well what are they are about?’ I think it’s not necessarily about me going through a breakup it’s just feelings that are within a lot of people. “The interesting thing is the song Falling is actually about falling in and out of a relationship… You have to learn how to drop that again because it’s not fair to the person you’re with. “I think really that’s what the songs are about. It’s about being in a relationship where you both love each other… but relationships are really hard. We’ve all had that experience of sleeping on the sofa or whatever but it’s kind of about those moments for me.” Jordy broke the tension on call adding: ""For me it was easy! I definitely wanted to make an emotional album. With the instrumentals I always try to name them according to the feeling of the album so it tells a little story.” The musicians also said that originally the album was going to be a passionate display of true love before their artistic instincts changed the direction of the music.

Timecop1983's new album was released this month

It’s easy to see why after hearing the devastating lyrics of Did You Move on? and the grief-filled sounds of Alone. Although Faded Touch is an 11-track record full of emotion and cold shoulders Jordy hasn’t always been so forthcoming with his feelings. His seminal 2018 album Night Drive was about just that - going on a drive late at night. Jordy told me: “Yeah that was my idea behind it and that’s why it’s a little darker. It’s not as romantic as the other albums I put out before. But it was literally going to be night drive music or that’s how I pictured it to be.” This relatively simple conceptual album has gone on to exceed his expectations. Night Drive is still wildly popular and has been featured on various Spotify playlists YouTube montages and bestseller lists ever since. At the time of writing Night Drive is number 4 on the Amazon Dance & Electronic Chart three years after release. The album is almost impossible to buy physically. Last year the vinyl edition of Night Drive was repressed in a limited quantity of 500 pieces at indie label New Retro Wave. Jordy told me in disbelief how they sold out in two hours.

Timecop1983 and Josh Dally worked together on the concept album

Night Drive has become one of the most iconic albums of the synthwave scene and is frequently touted as one of the most inspirational works within the genre from the last five years. Looking back at the record it is easy to see why it became such a hit. Not only did it include a track with Josh (Neon Lights) it also had feature slots from some of today’s biggest synthwave acts. Timecop1983 worked with the likes of The Midnight (on the track Static) as well as The Bad Dreamers (Back To You) LeBrock (Too Late) and Kinnie Lane (Tokyo). Did Jordy have any idea about how special Night Drive was going to be? “Yeah definitely.” “Not because I thought [the artists] were going to be big but because I just loved their music and I listened to them. The Midnight was big then already but the others - except for Josh - weren’t as big. “I just loved their sound and I asked them if they would want to work with me… and luckily they said yes.” Although each of these artists were growing in popularity it would be naive to think Night Drive did not help their careers somewhat in the years since its release. Jordy's success continues with Faded Touch already in the top three of the UK Electronic Album Chart.

Just this week the British Army press release said that following a recent agreement struck with the U.S. Department of Defense they will be embarking on a five-year program to update its M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS).

Currently British rocket launchers provide pinpoint accuracy delivering a 200 lb high explosive warhead to its target with over twice the range of other artillery systems used by the British Army. The MLRS also represents the bulk of the Army’s precision fires capability with the GPS guidance capability integral to the system and highly accurate beyond 70 KM.

- ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW -

Also noted that the MLRS is a highly mobile automatic system that fires 12 surface-to-surface missiles in less than a minute.

The details were given in a 31 March media release to announce upgrades will be made to 44 launchers which are currently in-service and will include a new armoured cab and upgraded automotive and launch mechanism components.

The upgrades will ensure that the Army’s Land Deep Fires capability remains strong for the next three decades and that the British Army has the technological capability to quickly meet the threats of today and tomorrow.

Taking advantage of the long-standing MLRS collaboration with the US and key allies work will start on upgrading the first tranche of launchers in March 2022 with the fleet going through production over a four-year period. The upgrades will keep the equipment in service until 2050.

The work will be carried out under an existing production contract with Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control with the work being carried out at Red River Army Depot and Lockheed Martin’s facility in Camden Arkansas.

The UK is also developing UK-specific systems for the new launchers including Composite Rubber Tracks (CRT) and a vehicle camera and radar system. A new Fire Control System will be developed collaboratively with the US UK Italy and Finland.

The CRT will provide better fuel economy and allow the launcher to travel further giving greater operational and tactical mobility to support deployed troops in a range of operating environments. A single launcher will be used to fire many payloads.

To ensure soldiers are not outranged the Army will develop a new extended range missile with MLRS partners to be fired from the updated launchers which should be in-service by 2025. The Guided MLRS Extended Range (GMLRS-ER) missile will extend the Army’s reach from 84 to 150km.

The 44 updated launchers will also be able to fire the US’s Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) which has a range of 499km and is expected in-service from 2024. These weapons will place the British Army at the cutting edge of global deep fires capability ready to respond to long range air defence and missile threats presented by hostile actors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLWpvdXJuYWxvbmxpbmUuY29tL3N0b3J5L29waW5pb24vMjAyMS8wNC8wMy9kZXNwaXRlLWxhYnJlbnQtY2hyaXRlcy1kZXBhcnR1cmUtYmV0aHVuZS1jb29rbWFuLWdldHRpbmctcmVhZHktZnV0dXJlLWJjdS1kYXl0b25hLzQ4Mjg2MDUwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Despite Chrite's departure Bethune-Cookman prepares for the future,"Nearly three weeks ago Bethune-Cookman University President LaBrent Chrite abruptly resigned.

In making the announcement on March 16 Chrite first informed his cabinet. He didn't tell the school's Board of Trustees until much later in the day — an indication that some acrimony existed between Chrite and the board.

Chrite's letter of resignation suggested as much: ""As the university enters this next stage of its trajectory it is especially critical that the B-CU president be fully and demonstrably aligned with the board and the board’s leadership. It is clear to me that I cannot be that individual. I wish each of you the very best.""

The next day March 17 Bentley University just outside of Boston announced that Chrite would be that school's new president.

Earlier:Bethune-Cookman President LaBrent Chrite abruptly resigns without informing board

Chrite's new job:A day after abruptly resigning at B-CU President Chrite has new job in Massachusetts

No doubt B-CU has improved its outlook after the disaster that was the administration of Edison O. Jackson. (Chrite arrived about two years after Jackson's resignation. Hubert Grimes served as interim president between the two.)

A dorm project hatched in 2014 could end up costing the university $306 million over 40 years. It has strained the school's finances and spawned lawsuits that have been making their way slowly through the court system.

Much as a result of the dorm's impact on B-CU's finances the school also faced a potential loss of accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools also known as SACS.

B-CU has made big strides financially

Over the past two years the university has made major strides in righting its financial situation and SACS has taken the university off probation. Chrite never returned my call but he may take some credit for those improvements.

But I believe that B-CU's current Board of Trustees deserves a lot more credit than it's getting for the improvements to the school's finances and SACS standing. Those who have been demanding board members step down since Chrite resigned should ask themselves if they have the information they need to reach such a drastic conclusion.

I make those points based on a three-hour meeting with several members of B-CU's board days after Chrite's departure.

The meeting was largely off-the-record which frankly I agreed to because there is a need for The News-Journal and B-CU's board to develop a more trusting relationship. But I can share some points from the meeting.

The first thing to point out is that the current board is NOT the board that allowed Jackson to cut a dorm deal that put the university in dire financial straits and helped lead to SACS placing B-CU on probation.Three of the four officers on the current board were on the board as of 2016 two years after the dorm was approved.

The board members I met in person and via Zoom included:

• Chairman Belvin Perry Jr. who spent 25 years as a circuit judge most of them as chief judge of the Ninth Judicial Circuit. He is currently an attorney with the Morgan & Morgan law firm in Orlando.

• Vice Chairman Joyours ""Pete"" Gamble former director of the Daytona Beach Housing Authority. Before that Gamble was a program project engineer for Lockheed Martin developing proposals for the F-22 and F-35 fighter programs. Before that he spent 20 years as an engineer with General Electric developing satellites and other technology. Gamble is also a B-CU grad.

• David L. Brewer III a retired three-star vice admiral who served for 35 years in the U.S. Navy. He also served as superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District the second largest school system in the U.S.

• Jennifer L. Adams who spent 33 years at Lockheed Martin retiring as a database analyst in 2010. Adams is also a B-CU grad and has held positions on numerous boards including being the immediate past chairwoman of Healthy Start Coalition of Orange County.

• Wayne A. Davis who is president and CEO of Touch Logistics Services Inc. an international shipping and logistics company based in Miami.

• John Crossman who most recently was president of Crossman & Company a regional retail leasing organization with offices across the Southeast representing more than 350 shopping centers.

• Courtney R. Rhodes who is co-founder and director of marketing and media relations at C&D/The Agency and founder of Digital CEO School both in Atlanta.

Here are the main things I gleamed from our meeting:

• Board members are keeping a very sharp eye on B-CU's finances and have put in place controls to ensure that university spending is in the best interest of the institution. Those steps are a main reason SACS took the school off probation.

• Board members lobbied hard in 2019 and 2020 at the Florida Legislature to increase B-CU's recurring annual funding. So did others. The result was an increase in annual funding of $14 million.

• The board's main focus is to ensure B-CU continues to provide higher education to thousands of students.

Board members have their work cut out for them. They must find a replacement for Chrite. They need to build bridges with the community and improve fundraising. They need to keep a continued sharp eye on B-CU's finances.

But they have made good progress in the past two years — including settling another lawsuit in January over an off-campus student apartment project Jackson left behind.

Here's hoping that the board continues to increase communication with the community that sees B-CU as one of our valuable institutions.

They don't deserve the criticism leveled at them in the wake of Chrite's departure. Rather they deserve support.

We had the first flight of the F-15EX variant for instance or the announcement that it is going to get the brand new Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System. But now it’s time to put the F-16 under the spotlight.

The single-engined aircraft has been around since way back in 1978 and as it usually happens with military machines it eventually branched out into several variants. It also got upgraded countless times over the years as the threats it had to face continuously evolved.To be able to cope with what the near future has to throw at it the F-16 will get another major boost in its capabilities soon. Lockheed Martin  the company now making the F-16 decided it’s time for the plane to get a new electronic warfare system in place to shield it from “radar and electronic threats.”Lockheed Martin tasked L3Harris with this project the company that has been supplying these systems for the F-16 for the past 30 years.The solution envisioned is an evolution of the company's Viper Shield and should provide “a virtual electronic shield around the aircraft” that can protect the pilot and the plane every time a radar threat is detected including by launching countermeasures.“The L3Harris Viper Shield EW system enables the F-16 to continue to be one of the most effective combat aircraft in the world” said Ed Zoiss President Space and Airborne Systems L3Harris.“Our 30-year legacy on the F-16 coupled with the advanced technologies being developed for Viper Shield provide our warfighters and international partners with unprecedented self-protection that helps to ensure mission success.”Viper Shield will be deployed on F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft configurations which are generally fielded by allied countries in the Middle East Asia and Europe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L2NoaW5hcy1mLTM1LWNvdWxkLWJlaWppbmctYnVpbGQtbmV3LXN0ZWFsdGgtZmlnaHRlci0xODE3NjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's 'F-35': Could Beijing Build a New Stealth Fighter?,"The smaller lighter FC-31 looks remarkably like the U.S. F-35 stealth fighter. It also resembles the F-35 in function.

Another Chinese stealth fighter is under development.

Or will it just be an upgrade of an existing stealth aircraft?

The Shenyang Aircraft company which manufactures China’s most advanced warplanes recently announced plans to develop a new fourth-generation fighter (in Chinese nomenclature “fourth generation” is equivalent to Western “fifth-generation” aircraft such as the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters).

“The company aims to make breakthroughs in its fourth-generation fighter jet program by boosting related technologies including additive manufacturing control over surface electromagnetic defects and automated fiber placement so that the aircraft can be successfully developed” noted China’s Global Times news site.

“The company announced that it is also exploring next-generation aircraft including research on technologies like thermal adaptation and integration of structure and function” Global Times said. “A technological system for the next-generation aircraft will be gradually formed as the company conducts test production and research.”

But is the new fighter meant for the People’s Liberation Army Air Force as a land-based fighter or the People’s Liberation Army Navy as the fighter of choice for China’s growing fleet of aircraft carriers?

Shenyang’s announcement which was posted on Chinese social media app WeChat included a photo of an FC-31 stealth fighter Shenyang’s only fourth-generation fighter that was once a candidate to be the Chinese navy’s carrier jet. Instead the Chinese navy chose a navalized version of Chengdu Aerospace Corporation’s land-based J-20 China’s first stealth fighter. The Chinese air force already flies the J-20.

Does the FC-31 photo signify anything? That an announcement of a new Shenyang jet was accompanied by a photo of an existing Shenyang jet is not a surprise. If Lockheed Martin were to announce the development of a new fighter the press release might very well include a photo of the F-35 stealth fighter as a tangible example of the company’s work.

However the photo could also indicate that Shenyang intends the new aircraft to unseat the J-20 as China’s naval fighter. Though both Shenyang and Chengdu are subsidiaries of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) they are also competitors just like the MiG and Sukhoi design bureaus under the Soviet Union.

Wang Ya’nan chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine told the Global Times that “it makes sense to speculate the statement is referring to an improved version of the FC-31 as the current versions are only prototypes. The Chinese Navy needs a more advanced fighter jet on its aircraft carriers in the future and the FC-31 when customized for that purpose would be a good choice” Wang predicted.

The twin-engine J-20 Mighty Dragon is a heavier aircraft that resembles the U.S. F-22 or Russian Su-57 stealth fighters. By virtue of being China’s first stealth fighter the J-20 has generated a lot of buzz—but few solid technical details. It reportedly has a maximum take-off weight of 37 tons and may be armed with very-long range PL-15 missiles that allegedly can hit targets 200 kilometers (125 miles). The J-20 seems to be a heavy long-range stealth sniper designed to pick off distant targets with air-to-air missiles—most especially the airborne control aircraft and tanker planes that are the backbone of U.S. airpower.

The smaller lighter FC-31 looks remarkably like the U.S. F-35 stealth fighter. It also resembles the F-35 in function: a multirole aircraft that can perform air superiority and strike missions. But the twenty-five-ton FC-31 seems to have a checkered past: first unveiled in 2012 it has neither been purchased by the Chinese air force—for which it was originally designed—or foreign nations. Adapting it for use on Chinese aircraft carriers may have been something of a desperation move.

Both aircraft have pros and cons as carrier jets. The J-20 has a longer range and a bigger payload than the FC-31 and has the advantage of already being operational. But a larger plane takes up more space so fewer J-20s could be taken aboard an aircraft carrier. The Chinese air force has probably bought fewer than fifty J-20s since the aircraft was unveiled in 2011 which suggests China isn’t interested in mass-producing the J-20 as a land/carrier-based plane like the F-35.

An upgraded FC-31 would be smaller and probably cheaper than a navalized J-20. But it would offer less range and payload and the FC-31 is still an untested design. In any event both aircraft may suffer from the Achilles heel of Chinese warplanes: a lack of reliable jet engines.

On the other hand both planes would certainly be better than China’s current carrier-based jet the infamous J-15 fighter jet currently flown by the carriers Liaoning and Shandong. The J-15 is an unlicensed copy of Russia’s Su-33 carrier jet which was a 1980s derivative of the Su-27K land-based fighter. China had acquired a T-10K-3 a Su-33 prototype from Ukraine and then reverse-engineered it—only to end up with an aircraft notorious for crashing.

The past weeks saw the Koninklijke Luchtmacht (KLu Royal Netherlands Air Force) F-35 Training Detachment (Nederlands Opleidingsdetachement F-35/NODF-35) part of the 308th Fighter Squadron Emerald Knights operating from Mountain Home AFB (ID).

While a large part of Mountain Home's 366th Fighter Wing F-15E Strike Eagles are deployed to the Middle East the NODF-35 team took the opportunity to use Mountain Home's tarmac as a temporary home. Normally based at Luke AFB (AZ) the NODF-35 team brought six F-35A Lightning IIs to Mountain Home and produced 95 flying sorties in 85 flying days.

This latest exercise in and over Idaho and the Mountain Home Range Complex (MHRC) proved to be a great training with lots of challenging sorties. This exercise was also the so called capstone event for the soon to graduate KLu F-35A B-course students at Luke.

Lowes denies Gardner for second Losail pole

The Brit makes it two from two but this time it’s Gardner in close company as the two prepare for another showdown

Last weekend’s race winner Sam Lowes (Elf Marc VDS Racing Team) once again brought his A-game to the table when it mattered at the TISSOT Grand Prix of Doha with the British rider and Remy Gardner (Red Bull KTM Ajo) going head-to-head for pole position and the number 22 coming out on top. Lowes’ 1:59.055 sees him head the grid by nearly a tenth and a half but with Gardner in second on take two in the desert it’s the man who proved Lowes’ closest rival last weekend starting right alongside him. Another familiar face from the fight at the front in the Qatar GP Marco Bezzecchi (Sky Racing Team VR46) completes the front row in P3.

There was early drama in Moto2™ Q1 as Xavi Vierge (Petronas Sprinta Racing) missed out on a place in the top four with reigning Moto3™ World Champion Albert Arenas (Solunion Aspar Team) slamming in a personal best lap on his final flyer that was good enough for P3. That demoted Vierge to P5 and out of Q2. Jorge Navarro (MB Conveyors Speed Up) topped the first part of qualifying with a 1:59.592 though moving through ahead of Bo Bendsneyder (Pertamina Mandalika SAG Team) Arenas and Jake Dixon (Petronas Sprinta Racing).

Gardner was the early pacesetter once Q2 got underway but the times were down on Q1’s best efforts. Red sectors then lit up the timing screens as a big reshuffle took place with Aron Canet (Solunion Aspar Team) leading the field from Bendsneyder. Bezzecchi took control of the session next with a 1:59.736 but the times would tumble again.

Gardner hit back Lowes did the same and Dixon made his way up into second. Raul Fernandez (Red Bull KTM Ajo) soon split the Brits to grab P2 but the Free Practice pacesetter was three tenths down on Lowes – and just 0.002s ahead of Dixon. Fighting back Bezzecchi slipped into P2 with just over two minutes left before Gardner muscled his way back into second. A red second split then popped up for Gardner as Lowes backed out so all eyes turned to the number 87…

Gardner was also up in Sector 3 but could he keep it going all the way to the line? Not quite! The Aussie just lost ground and despite improving his time pole went to Lowes for the second week in a row. After Gardner started much further back on his way to second in the Qatar GP however a front row is mission partly accomplished as it is for Bezzecchi in P3.

Raul Fernandez ends his second Moto2™ qualifying session in P4 another fantastic job by the rookie and he’s joined on Row 2 by Q1 graduate Dixon. A late charge from rookie Ai Ogura (Idemitsu Honda Team Asia) seals a brilliant P6 for the Japanese rider as he makes a big leap up the timesheets on take two in Doha even getting the better of third place Qatar GP finisher Fabio Di Giannantonio (Federal Oil Gresini Moto2) as the Italian is forced to head up Row 3. Joe Roberts (Italtrans Racing Team) and Canet slot in behind Diggia with Augusto Fernandez (Elf Marc VDS Racing Team) completing the top 10 in Q2.

Stefano Manzi (Flexbox HP 40) Arenas Nicolo Bulega (Federal Oil Gresini Moto2) American rookie Cameron Beaubier (American Racing) and Bendsneyder complete the fastest 15 on Saturday.

The grid is set and so is the stage. Can Gardner Bezzecchi or anyone else stop Lowes from making it two out two at Losail? We’ll find out on Sunday at 18:20 local time (GMT+3)!

More from a press release issued by Italtrans Racing:

Joe Roberts starts from the 3rd row in 8th position.

24th position for Lorenzo Dalla Porta.



Second weekend in a row for the MotoGP World Championship in Qatar.

A sandstorm with winds reaching 40km/h and a large amount of dust accumulating on the track awaited the Italtrans Racing Team riders today: these adverse conditions during the last free practice session prevent the team to make further setting improvement.

After combined free practice Joe Roberts went straight to Q2 improving his time and finishing the qualifying 8th with a best lap of 1’59″727. Tomorrow the American rider will start from the 3rd row of the grid with the aim of fighting for the top positions.

Unfortunately Lorenzo Dalla Porta didn’t make it thru Q1 struggling with the adverse weather conditions and penalized rear tyre grip. With a best laptime of 2’00”581 he will start 24th on the grid.

Lorenzo Dalla Porta

24° | 2’00”581

“It’s not the qualifying we expected. I was too slow compared to last week because of the wind and a bad tyre. Now we need to make a reset to start again more confident: we have the potential to do well and I’ll give my best in the race”.

Joe Roberts

8° | 1’59”727

“I’m not completely satisfied with today’s qualifying: we have to find a better setup with the wind anyway I’m feeling really positive and confident for tomorrow. We can battle for a good position. The pace was strong in free practice so we are ready to go racing”

Giovanni Sandi Technical Director:

“We have not been very performing in qualifying: we decided to not risk too much because of the bad conditions moreover we had a not performing tyre. Anyway we have worked well in view of tomorrow and we can fight for good positions. I hope we can have a good race”.

Cameron Beaubier aims for top 10 Moto2 finish on Sunday in Qatar

Injured American Racing teammate Marcos Ramirez looks toward Portugal round

DOHA Qatar (April 3 2021) — Cameron Beaubier will start Sunday’s Grand Prix of Doha the second round the FIM Moto2 World Championship from the middle of the 28-rider grid.

The 28-year-old Californian qualified 14th a marked improvement from his eighth-row series debut a week ago at the 16-turn 3.34-mile Losail International Circuit in Qatar.

“I was looking for a little more in qualifying to be honest” said Beaubier. “It was tough with the wind. I didn’t nail any great laps but on a positive note we improved from last week. I am looking forward to the race tomorrow.”

Twenty-first in Free Practice 1 on Friday Beaubier was 14th in FP2 allowing him to bypass Qualifying 1 and transfer directly to Q2.

The wind picked up on Saturday blowing fine sand across the track. Beaubier was sixth in FP3 for the first time finishing a practice session in front of fellow American Joe Roberts who holds the all-time Moto2 lap record at Losail.

American Racing Race Director John Hopkins is elated with the speed in which Beaubier has adapted to the Moto2-spec 765cc Triumph engine and Kalex chassis. Both represent significant departures from the liter-class Yamaha YZF-R1 that Beaubier raced in MotoAmerica Superbike competition.

“Cameron is a world-class rider” said Hopkins. “There was a huge learning curve. He had to make a lot of changes to his riding. He is surprising us but I know he has it in him to even go further and continually progress.”

For the second consecutive weekend Marc VDS rider Sam Lowes will start from pole position. Lowes also won the first race and leads the championship. Beaubier is 11th in the points standings.

Beaubier’s teammate Marcos Ramirez is not riding this weekend. The 23-year-old Spaniard crashed in qualifying for the season-opening race and fractured the humeral head of his right arm.

Ramirez underwent additional medical checks this week. He will be rechecked in two weeks at the Algarve International Circuit host of the Grand Prix of Portugal.

“After FP3 we felt we could do better in qualifying” said Eitan Butbul American Racing team owner. “Since Marcos is not riding the entire team worked on Cameron’s side to prepare the bike and the strategy.

“We are happy with the result and we can see the progress from last week. I am sure Cameron will be strong in the race.”

Based in California the team fields two riders in the Moto2 class: American Cameron Beaubier (No. 6) and Spaniard Marcos Ramirez (No. 42). American Racing has grown under Butbul’s guidance and is a respected member of the MotoGP paddock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9zcG9ydC5jb20vbW90bzIvbmV3cy9kb2hhLW1vdG8yLWxvd2VzLWtlZXBzLWdhcmRuZXItYXQtYmF5LzYwODE3MTAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doha Moto2: Lowes keeps Gardner at bay for second successive win,"Both Lowes and Gardner ran close on the final lap but the former resisted pressure from the Ajo KTM rider to strengthen his championship lead.

Marco Bezzecchi jumped poleman Lowes off the line with the VR46 rider keeping the Briton at bay across the opening lap as Ajo KTM rookie Raul Fernandez moved into third ahead of team-mate Gardner.

Such was the pace of the leading quartet that they had pulled a gap of 1.7 seconds to the rest of the pack by lap three.

Lowes made his move for the lead in the slipstream on the run to Turn 1 at the start of lap four while Gardner put on a risky – but successful - raid for third on Fernandez at Turn 10.

The gap between Lowes and Bezzecchi immediately opened out to six tenths with Gardner quick to dispatch of the Italian at Turn 1 on lap six to begin his chase of the lead.

Lowes did not look as comfortable on his Marc VDS Kalex as he did a week ago but managed to hold off Gardner.

Having settled into his rhythm Lowes looked more at ease on his bike at mid-distance though Gardner regrouped in the latter stages to put pressure on the leader.

Lowes responded to this threat emphatically the Marc VDS rider firing in a race-best lap of 1m59.026s three tours from the end to open his lead out to over half a second.

Gardner dug deep to keep Lowes in his crosshairs the Ajo rider better Lowes’ fastest lap with a 1m58.991s on the penultimate tour.

The pair ran line astern through the final corners of the race Gardner looking at a move at Turn 15 but could find no way through.

Lowes covered his line on the way into the last corner a small moment on acceleration for Gardner allowed the Marc VDS rider to get to the chequered flag 0.190 seconds in front.

Fernandez took a comfortable maiden rostrum in third on the sister Ajo bike having seen off Bezzecchi while Honda Team Asia rookie Ai Ogura was an impressive fifth.

Augusto Fernandez was sixth on the second Marc VDS Kalex Celestino Vietti putting on another impressive rookie display in seventh on the VR46 Kalex ahead of Pons’ Stefano Manzi Xavi Vierge (Petronas Sprinta) and Gresini’s Fabio Di Giannantonio.

Joe Roberts (Italtrans) crashed out of fifth in the early stages of the race while fellow American Cameron Beaubier slid out of his second Moto2 start for American Racing.

Petronas Sprinta’s Jake Dixon was involved in a collision with Intact GP’s Marcel Schrotter while Tom Luthi (SAG) Aspar’s Aron Canet and MV Agusta stand-in Tommaso Marcon also crashed out.

Lowes heads to the third round of the season in Portugal in two weeks’ time heading the championship by 10 points from Gardner.

TOMS RIVER NJ (OCEAN)–Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer announced that on April 1 2021 Jeydon Lowe 25 of Barnegat was sentenced by the Honorable Linda G. Baxter J.S.C. to a term of seven years New Jersey State Prison as a result of a previously entered guilty plea to Vehicular Homicide in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:11-5. This sentence is subject to the terms of the No Early Release Act N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2 meaning Lowe will be required to serve at least 85 percent of his prison sentence before he may be considered for parole eligibility. Additionally Judge Baxter suspended Lowe’s driving privileges for a period of five years in connection with his previously entered guilty plea to Driving While Intoxicated in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:4-50. Lowe pled guilty to both charges before Judge Baxter on January 27 2021.

On March 25 2020 at approximately 5:30 p.m. officers from the Stafford Township Police Department responded to a single vehicle crash on Stafford Avenue near Hilliard Boulevard. An investigation by the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office Vehicular Homicide Unit Stafford Township Police Department and Ocean County Sheriff’s Office Crime Scene Investigation Unit revealed that a 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt operated by Lowe was traveling eastbound on Stafford Avenue at an extremely high rate of speed. Lowe lost control of the vehicle as he was attempting to navigate a right-hand turn and consequently crashed into a tree. A passenger in the front seat of the vehicle Robert Parlin 24 of Little Egg Harbor succumbed to his injuries as a result of the crash and was pronounced deceased at the scene.

Lowe sustained minor injuries and was taken to Hackensack Meridian Health Southern Ocean County Medical Center in Stafford Township. A search warrant was obtained for a draw of his blood. On April 14 2020 Detectives received the laboratory results from the blood draw which indicated that Lowe had a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of nearly .12 percent. An operator of a motor vehicle is presumed to be over the legal limit for purposes of alcohol consumption where his/her BAC is .08 or greater.

“This is an absolutely tragic case which should serve as a cautionary tale for anyone who is tempted to drink and drive” Prosecutor Billhimer stated. “Let me be clear: drunk driving kills and it has the potential to tear families apart. Sadly these types of cases are wholly preventable particularly in this day and age of Uber Lyft and other readily available transportation services. While this young defendant will go to prison for a long time for his senseless conduct on the night in question nothing will bring Mr. Parlin back to his family” Prosecutor Billhimer concluded.

Prosecutor Billhimer acknowledges the diligent efforts of Senior Assistant Prosecutor Jamie Schron who handled the case on behalf of the State as well as the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office Vehicular Homicide Unit Stafford Township Police Department and Ocean County Sheriff’s Office Crime Scene Investigation Unit for their combined efforts in connection with this investigation which resulted in Lowe’s guilty plea and ultimately his state prison sentence.

After missing the past two-plus seasons with a knee injury Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball has exercised the $21.4 million option on his contract for the 2024-25 season sources told ESPN on Saturday.

Ball has undergone three surgeries on his left knee the most recent a cartilage transplant in 2023. There remains some guarded hope that he could return next season but there are no assurances that the damaged knee will allow for him to play again.

Ball 26 signed an original four-year $80 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with New Orleans in the summer of 2021. After a fantastic start that had the Bulls leading the Eastern Conference in 2021-22 Ball averaged 13.0 points 5.4 rebounds 5.1 assists and 1.8 steals before a knee injury 35 games into the season.

His inactivity has caused his contract to become a blight on the Bulls' salary cap.

Ball was the No. 2 overall pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2017 NBA draft and eventually was traded to the Pelicans as part of the Anthony Davis blockbuster deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tdXNpYy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA1L2ZyZWUtbWFkb25uYS1jb25jZXJ0LWRyYXdzLWNyb3dkLW9mLTE2bS10by1icmF6aWxzLWNvcGFjYWJhbmEtYmVhY2jSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbXVzaWMvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8wNS9mcmVlLW1hZG9ubmEtY29uY2VydC1kcmF3cy1jcm93ZC1vZi0xNm0tdG8tYnJhemlscy1jb3BhY2FiYW5hLWJlYWNo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Free Madonna concert draws crowd of 1.6m to Brazil’s Copacabana beach,"With the world-famous statue towering over it from Corcovado mountain Rio de Janeiro is well used to Christ the Redeemer. For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Global cume is at $64.4M a $1M off. Some are worried as to what this lower than expected result means for star power specifically for Gosling coming off Barbie. The 3x Oscar nominated actor did everything to promote Fall Guy down to dressing up as Beavis at the Hollywood premiere of the film. Look as we mentioned Fall Guy is third highest opening of his career stateside Barbie being an outlier. Moviegoers in a streaming age are far too sophisticated and deliberate before they leave the house and an original Hollywood stunt-set action film wasn’t worth their time. Perhaps Gosling as a different kind of astronaut than he was in First Man is worth the time in Amazon MGM Studios’ Project Hail Mary. In the end as of late Gosling can get a movie open to $20M+.

Other things to consider: Fall Guy isn’t a movie that typically fires off summer it’s a movie you find either in August the second weekend of June or even the off season which is where this was originally scheduled on March 1. If the cost was lower here on this original title than the $130M-$150M we wouldn’t be scrutinizing it so much.

SUNDAY AM Writethru after Saturday AM Update: Universal’s The Fall Guy isn’t so strong and nobody is really shocked.

While it was projected to do at least $30M and it’s coming in at $28.5M this is the range for original action comedies even when they star Ryan Gosling. PostTrak exits report he’s 50% of the reason why people went to see the movie (versus 35% for Emily Blunt). Pic took in $25.4M from offshore marketings raising its foreign gross to $36.9M global to $65.4M.

The opening for Fall Guy is actually on the higher end of Gosling starts ranked third after anomaly Barbie ($162M) and Blade Runner 2049 ($32.7M) yet further down on Blunt’s. It’s the ninth-best opening of her career stateside short of Edge of Tomorrow ($28.7M) and Jungle Cruise ($35M with an asterisk – it did have a theatrical day-and-date PVOD on Disney+).

So what gives? Why is Fall Guy playing like a deflated balloon even with a great A- CinemaScore and 90% positive on PostTrak?

First yes we’re still in an uneven marketplace and won’t be out of it until we have more movies toward the end of the month into June leading up to Inside Out 2 on Father’s Day weekend. The entire box office weekend is totaling around $73M off 55% from the same frame a year ago when Disney/Marvel Studios had Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 leading summer’s charge with $118.4M.

But in Fall Guy despite how well it plays with audiences (SXSW crowds were belly laughing) there’s nothing that screams “rush to this” despite Universal showing off the fun and the romance in its campaign. It’s too inside Hollywood and these types of movies never play to an uber-wide crowd despite how accessible the studio and filmmakers have tried to make it. “Why do young people want to see this movie?” challenges a film finance source.

Most of all for an original event film at $130M-$150M+ this movie is too damn expensive.

“They should have spent like Tom Rothman: Make it for $80M. Why is Universal spending the extra money? Instead of spending $220M-$230M between production and marketing costs they could have pulled this off for $160M-$180M” added the source.

Some marketing sources are dinging the Fall Guy brand. “Nobody under 60 remembers that show!” However I don’t think Universal sold the movie on that and studios have shown before that they can take an antique TV property and turn it into a mega franchise. Hello Mission: Impossible and Tom Cruise. What Gen Xer had actually watched Mission: Impossible back in the late ’60s? Not me I wasn’t around then.

Great movies can ascend their brand.

Other sources have critiqued that for those leaving the theater Fall Guy is a hard movie plot wise for them to describe to others. “It took someone three paragraphs to tell me what the movie was about” remarked one insider. While that might be true note that trailers for Fall Guy distilled the movie to its most crystal-clear elements. Also we can’t ignore the great exits here for the movie. Unfortunately the masses aren’t falling over themselves to see the Fall Guy.

Evidence that there wasn’t heat on Fall Guy before opening: RelishMix reports that the movie’s social media universe across YouTube TikTok X Instagram and Facebook stood at 266.7M -33% below action adventure norms heck it was even under Argylle‘s 272M.

‘Challengers’ Everett Collection

In addition Amazon MGM Studios’ Challengers did a have good hold at -49% meaning they were able to keep some younger women away from the Gosling pic (71% women 18-24 at 44%). However the Zendaya tennis rom-com is coming in $1.1M lighter than expected (yesterday pic was at $8.7M) for a $7.6M weekend 2. Women under 25 were the lowest to show up yesterday for Fall Guy at 13% with men over 25 leading at 38% women over 25 at 33% (who gave the pic its best grade of 93%) and men under 25 at 16%. Universal is confident that given the exits for Fall Guy more women will come out in the month ahead as it’s the only choice for that audience in a guy skewing marketplace of Furiosa Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and Bad Boys: Ride or Die.

Said Universal Domestic Distribution Boss Jim Orr “David Leitch and Kelly McCormick have crafted an incredibly entertaining film with The Fall Guy and clearly audiences agree as evidenced by the film’s exceptionally strong scores. The chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt is fantastic and we anticipate audiences will continue to be thrilled by the film for weeks to come.”

Fall Guy‘s best play areas were the West and Mountain regions. AMC Lincoln Square is currently the top-grossing venue for the pic with $91K in the till through Saturday night. IMAX and PLFs are driving 44% of Fall Guy‘s weekend with the former ringing up $3M.

Largest quad for the David Leitch-directed movie is 25-34 at 25% with diversity demos seeing 52% Caucasian 25% Latino and Hispanic 8% Black 10% Asian and 5% other.

Universal given the love for the film among older women believes it will leg out. Look $100M domestic isn’t out of the realm of possibility ala Lost City and Bullet Train. But Fall Guy could drop into PVOD by Memorial Day weekend.

With 8% Rotten Tomatoes critical reviews and 52% audience scores as well as C- CinemaScore and 59% PostTrak on Sony/Screen Gems’ Tarot you didn’t need a psychic to see that the Culver City lot wasn’t going to spend one more dime in marketing this movie. Hence the $6.5M opening here on this single-digit budgeted title. The PG-13 movie is 52% female leaning with 18-34 year old repping 67% of the audience. Those 18-24 were the biggest demo at 40%. Diversity demos were 38% Latino and Hispanic 30% Caucasian 16% Black 9% Asian and 7% other. Tarot‘s best regions are the South South Central and Midwest with the Cinemark Rialto the highest grossing location so far with close to $6K (eek).

Other sundries….

Viva’s Dragonkeeper in Spanish and English opened in 760 theaters with meh grosses for what’s looking like $429K for the weekend. The animated indie kids film is set in ancient China and follows a young girl who must find the last remaining dragon egg and fulfill her destiny.

FRIDAY MIDDAY: Universal’s The Fall Guy is coming in a little light right now at $10.4M today including previews for what’s looking like a $28M opening at 4002 theaters below its $35M projection.

Many aren’t shocked: This is where action comedies open and Fall Guy isn’t that far from the $30M starts of Paramount 2022 adventure rom-com The Lost City and David Leitch’s previous movie 2022’s Bullet Train. But damn was Fall Guy for this concept expensive at $130M after Australian tax credits. Some have heard the production cost was even higher at $150M.

Fall Guy already has $8.4M-plus in the bank from a 38-market rollout last weekend including Australia Turkey Netherlands and Spain. The movie goes into 40-plus markets this weekend including UK & Ireland Germany France and Mexico.

No RT audience score yet.

Amazon MGM Studios’ Challengers is booked at 3477 theaters and eyeing $2.55M in its second Friday -59% for a 3-day around $8.75M -42% for a running cume of $30.5M.

Third place goes to 20th Century Studios/Lucasfilm/Disney’s Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace at 2700 locations for a $2.65M Friday $8.5M 3-day.

Legendary/Warner Bros.’ Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire in weekend 6 at 2884 sites is seeing $3.8M -47% after a $1M Friday. Running total is $187.4M by Sunday.

FRIDAY AM: Universal teed off summer Thursday night with the Ryan Gosling-Emily Blunt action comedy The Fall Guy which made $3.15M from showtimes that began at 5 p.m. and Wednesday advance screenings. The movie is only expected to do around $35M for the weekend maybe $40M. That’s not your typical start to summer but we’re in this predicament due to the strikes’ delay on feature films.

RELATED: ‘The Fall Guy’ Trailer: Ryan Gosling Cries To Taylor Swift In New Take On ’80s TV Hit

Preview-wise that start is right near Paramount’s 2022 adventure rom-com Lost City which did $3.2M before a $30.4M opening and a $105.3M domestic final.

The most recent release date for The Fall Guy had been March 1 but Universal pushed it to this weekend after Disney and Marvel Studios moved Deadpool & Wolverine to end of July — which some now view as the true start of summer.

Universal believed big time in The Fall Guy bringing it down to SXSW in Austin for a world premiere where audiences laughed their asses off. This was followed by a screening at the onset of CinemaCon for exhibitors with a stunt-filled Hollywood premiere on Tuesday night. The anticipation is that the Gosling factor of The Fall Guy will keep pulling women to theaters. Also the movie despite its insider Hollywood vibe has a sensibility of yesteryear ’70s/’80s action titles — ones that used to conquer the middle of the country read Smokey and the Bandit and Every Which Way but Loose.

It made $715K on Thursday from showtimes that began at 4 p.m. in 2744 locations. Here’s the blurb for the PG-13 movie which RT critics jinxed at 9% Rotten: When a group of friends recklessly violates the sacred rule of Tarot readings they unknowingly unleash an unspeakable evil trapped within the cursed cards. One by one they come face to face with fate and end up in a race against death.

BF Borgers CPA and its owner Benjamin Borgers reportedly agreed to pay $14 million in fines and be permanently suspended from practicing as accountants according to a report from CNBC.

More from the report:

The agency calling BF Borgers a “sham audit mill” said the company and its owner engaged in “deliberate and systemic failures to comply with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ... standards in its audits and reviews incorporated in more than 1500 SEC filings from January 2021 through June 2023” according to a press release.

BF Borgers during that same time acted as the auditor for Trump Media which was then privately held and moving toward a planned merger with the publicly traded shell company Digital World Acquisition Corp.

Trump’s media company went public in March.

Interim President Jeff Ettinger’s budget for the next fiscal year proposes to slap a 4.5 percent tuition hike on in-state undergraduate students studying at the Twin Cities campus. If approved by the Board of Regents that would be the highest annual tuition increase for Minnesota residents since 2010.

Students at other campuses would also pay more money.

“Tuition increases always suck” said Blake Barrington a freshman. “I think sometimes the fault is on the university for spending it needlessly. There’s a lot of clubs and activities that the university funds that I don’t think are necessarily needed.""

Create a More Connected Minnesota MPR News is your trusted resource for the news you need. With your support MPR News brings accessible courageous journalism and authentic conversation to everyone - free of paywalls and barriers. Your gift makes a difference.

At least two members of the Board of Regents seem reluctant to embrace the proposed increase.

“I only learned that we were considering a tuition increase this weekend” wrote Robyn Gulley who represents the Second Congressional District in an email to MPR News. “I have not been convinced that increasing tuition for our students — compelling many to take additional loans or work longer hours to make tuition payments — will benefit our whole university more than it will harm our students. I expect to vote no on this proposed tuition increase.”

James Farnsworth a regent representing St. Paul hadn’t heard about the proposed tuition hikes until he read about in the newspaper on Friday.

“In general I’m not supportive of putting our budgetary pressures on the backs of our students right now” he wrote in an email. “But [I] haven’t digested the proposal enough to be knowledgeable comment on it.”

In real terms the total increase in tuition room and board and fees for Minnesota residents would raise costs by an additional $453 to $1552 per year depending on the campus. For Twin Cities undergrads who reside in-state tuition could increase by 4.5 percent to $15148.

The U has consistently raised tuition across campuses but in recent years has not exceeded annual hikes of 2-3 percent for locals. Proposed residential raises at other U campuses range from 1.5 to 4.5 percent and are anticipated to bring in $42.2 million in revenue.

“A large part of coming from in-state and going to the U is the fact that the tuition is a lot more affordable” said freshman Adella Mulawarman. “I’m curious to see if they go ahead and increase it if there will be a difference in how many in-state students decide to attend here.”

Thanks to scholarships Mulawarman got a break on tuition this year. But those scholarships are drying up and next year she’s worried about having to take out loans.

Tuition hikes could be incoming for out-of-state students too where the track record for an increasing price tag has been steeper. At the Twin Cities campus non-resident undergraduates could face a 5.5 percent tuition increase bringing tuition to $36296. A decade ago tuition was just over $19000 for non-residents.

In a Star Tribune Op-Ed last month regents Janie S. Mayeron Douglas A. Huebsch and Kenyanya urged state legislators to approve the U’s funding request to help cover the cost for students and employee pay.

“As a nonprofit public university our recurring operating fund request will minimize tuition increases for students and families who should not shoulder the burden of the state’s diminishing support” they wrote. “It will also help provide our 27000 faculty and staff members systemwide with fair compensation and the facilities they need to remain competitive in the workforce. They all deserve support by state leaders.”

Students who choose U housing may also have to anticipate higher room and board costs at all campuses. That change is “primarily driven by inflationary cost pressures” according to the proposal.

At the Duluth campus standard room and board costs could go up by 8.9 percent bringing the typical total to $10456 per year. In the Twin Cities that’s a 6.5 percent increase bringing room and board totals up to $13606.

A 6 percent increase is proposed at Morris 5.2 percent at Rochester and 2.8 percent at Crookston.

The attendance cost hikes are paired with proposed expense reductions of $13.7 million. The bulk of that reduction is planned through eliminating positions after employees leave and hiring replacement employees at lower salaries.

Additional expense reductions are proposed through scaling back in-person events and conferences reducing certain research and educational programs and shrinking food and supply budgets in some departments.

The public is welcome to comment on the proposal at the U Regents meeting Friday or online through the morning of June 7. The 12-member Board of Regents are expected to vote on the final budget in June."

The occupant of the building has not been identified but an agreement between the city and developer COI Zeta LLC provides a 15-year 100% community reinvestment area tax exemption for improvements to the 50-acre site.

The developer must make $105000 annual payments in lieu of taxes for the duration of the agreement a 15-year total of $1.575 million. The money will help pay for improvements to Thornwood Drive and Central Parkway according to the 2018 Central Parkway agreement between the city and Heath City School District.

The development will be across from the end of Hallie Lane north of Irving Wick Drive West. Work has begun along Keller Drive next to the Marathon Petroleum office building at 855 Keller Drive.

Heath Mayor Mark Johns said he would not reveal the occupant of the building allowing the company to make that announcement when it is ready. He said it should be completed by the first quarter of 2022.

“The developer is committed to contributing money annually to infrastructure improvements along that area” Johns said. “It’s going to allow us to do some roadway improvements along Thornwood near the intersection with Hallie Lane.""

Licking County Building Code lists the project at 840 Thornwood Drive as “Zeta Warehouse” with the owner COI Zeta LLC of Columbus and the contractor Pepper Construction of Dublin. COI Zeta Holding Company LLC filed its articles of organization with the state on Jan. 27.

Johns referred questions to Phil Rasey vice president of development for VanTrust Real Estate of Columbus.

A telephone message for Rasey was returned by Marcy Fleisher of Team Fleisher Communications who said Rasey is not yet ready to comment on the development.

The mayor said the project includes a roadway extension from the end of Hallie Lane across Thornwood Drive into the development and connecting with Keller Drive.

The area is critical for future roadway projects and potential developments in Heath and Newark.

Eventually the city of Heath wants to extend Central Parkway from its dead end by Walmart and the Davis-Shai House about 1.5 miles from the major retail area to Thornwood Drive a main north-south connector projected as a development corridor.

In January 2019 the mayor said all the players were on board for an ""Easton-esque"" development on about 300 acres west of Walmart north of the Newark-Heath Airport and south of Geller Park. The vision for the area included a big-box retailer condominiums and at least one more element such as office space a clinic or restaurant.

The Central Parkway extension would be paid for by development commitments and a 2018 tax-increment financing agreement with the Heath City School District.

Officials from Newark Heath and the county have long envisioned Thornwood Drive directly connecting Ohio 16 with Ohio 79 opening up the Thornwood Drive corridor for economic development.

The city of Newark and the Ohio Department of Transportation plan a realignment of Cherry Valley Road and a connection of Thornwood Crossing directly with Thornwood Drive at Reddington Road.

The project includes a new bridge over Raccoon Creek new roads up to the bridge and a new roundabout at the intersection of the three roads City Engineer Brian Morehead has said. The project would bypass the bridge and dangerous curve on Cherry Valley Road.

Hotels have adjusted service during the pandemic

As you’d expect hotels have adjusted their service protocols during the coronavirus pandemic both as a cost saving measure and also to limit interaction between employees and staff. Among other things we’ve seen hotels:

Eliminate daily housekeeping

Either cut in-room dining altogether or serve it in to-go bags

Eliminate some in-room amenities ranging from minibars to coffee machines

Close bars restaurants and other outlets

In the short term there’s nothing wrong with that and all of this is reasonable enough. The problem becomes that when changes are made they’re often not reversed. Just look at the concept of airline fuel surcharges or the fact that we still can’t take most liquids through security nearly two decades after 9/11.

Hiltons will become “higher-margin businesses”

While the hotel industry has no doubt struggled a lot in the past year Skift has some interesting facts on how the financials of some hotels have improved. Looking at the US industry big-picture:

Full-service hotels have lowered their financial breakeven point from 47% occupancy in 2019 to 30% occupancy in 2020

Limited service hotels have lowered their financial breakeven point from 43% occupancy in 2019 to 36% occupancy in 2020

In other words hotels don’t need to fill as many rooms to breakeven which shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Hotels have lowered operating costs by getting rid of amenities and reducing staffing. As you can see we’ve seen the margins improve most at full-service hotels since they have the most amenities and staffing to cut.

Surely you’re thinking “well once things get better proper hotel service will resume right?” It would appear not. Hilton CEO Chris Nassetta said the following during a recent investor call:

“The work we’re doing right now in every one of our brands is about making them higher-margin businesses and creating more labor efficiencies particularly in the areas of housekeeping food and beverage and other areas. When we get out of the crisis those businesses will be higher margin and require less labor than they did pre-Covid.”

So yeah a focus for Hilton is making hotels higher-margin businesses and creating more labor efficiencies specifically with housekeeping and food & beverage. The intent here is pretty clear — many of the cuts that have been made during the coronavirus pandemic are here to stay.

Don’t expect daily housekeeping to be a standard amenity at hotels in the future and expect some of the food & beverage “efficiencies” to stick around.

Will daily hotel housekeeping ever return as a standard amenity?

Will the competitive landscape allow this?

No matter how you slice it the intent here is bad news for hotel guests and especially bad news for those working in the hotel industry since it sounds like there will be fewer jobs. Every business wants to be higher-margin and Hilton’s CEO is making it pretty explicit that many of the current cuts will stick around.

Let’s be clear the focus here isn’t on offering better value. That’s to say that hotels aren’t looking to cut costs and lower rates but rather they’re looking to charge the same but offer less.

What’s my take on all of this?

Ultimately the hotel industry is competitive and I don’t think the landscape will allow hotel groups to go quite as far as Hilton is inferring here though I do think some things won’t return to pre-coronavirus service levels

I’m probably in the minority but personally I think it’s reasonable enough if daily housekeeping never fully returns with the exception of luxury hotels; I have no interest in having someone in my room every day and the entire system just seems inefficient and unnecessary

Room service and minibars have not been much of a money maker for the hotel industry though they are nice amenities to have; I wouldn’t be surprised to see minibars replaced with grab-and-go options in the lobby and to see room service permanently delivered in to-go packaging

While I’d be sad about room service changes when I’m staying at hotels in the US I typically use a food delivery service to order food anyway since it’s cheaper gives you more variety and the food is typically better

Will hotel minibars survive the pandemic?

Bottom line

Hotels have significantly cut service during the pandemic both to cut costs and to minimize contact between people. Hilton’s CEO is now suggesting that the hotel industry will be higher-margin going forward creating more labor efficiencies in the areas of housekeeping and food and beverage.

Personally I think the hotel industry will be permanently transformed but not as radically as Hilton’s CEO is hinting at. Ultimately consumers still have certain expectations and if Hilton doesn’t offer what guests want other brands will.

What’s your take on how hotel service will evolve post-pandemic?

The Marblehead High School football team remained undefeated after four games in the Fall II season when they upended Masconomet to the tune of 35-19 at Piper Field on Saturday April 3.

The win took on added significance because it was also coach Jim Rudloff's 100th career as Marblehead's football boss. It was only Rudloff's 128th game along the Marblehead sidelines thus becoming the first Magician gridiron mentor to achieve this milestone in the shortest period of time.

Rudloff came to Marblehead from the Beverly Panthers program that was led by current MHS principal Dan Bauer.

Mastercard would hold a minority stake in AMC BV on completion of the deal with Airtel Africa continuing to hold the majority stake an Airtel statement said.

Sources privy to the development told PTI that Mastercard would get about 3.75 per cent stake in the company.

AMC BV is currently the holding company for several of Airtel Africa’s mobile money operations and is intended to own and operate the mobile money businesses across all of Airtel Africa’s 14 operating countries. The proceeds from the transaction would be used to reduce Group debt and invest in network and sales infrastructure in the respective operating countries.

""Airtel Africa a leading provider of telecommunications and mobile money services with a presence in 14 countries across Africa announces the signing of an agreement under which Mastercard a leading innovator and global technology company in the payments industry will invest USD 100 million in Airtel Mobile Commerce BV..."" the statement said.

The latest deal values Airtel Africa’s mobile money business at USD 2.65 billion on a cash and debt-free basis.

Mastercard - via one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries - will make the investment through a secondary purchase of shares in AMC BV from Airtel Africa. The transaction would close in two stages - USD 75 million to be invested at the first close once the transfer of sufficient mobile money operations and contracts into AMC BV has been completed while USD 25 million will be invested at the second close on further transfers.

Commenting on the development Raghunath Mandava Chief Executive Officer of Airtel Africa said: ""With today’s announcement we are pleased to welcome Mastercard as an investor in our mobile money business joining The Rise Fund which we announced two weeks ago. This is a continuation of our strategy to increase the minority shareholding in our mobile money business with the further intention to list this business within four years"".

He added: ""We are significantly strengthening our existing strategic relationship with Mastercard to help us both realise the full potential from the substantial opportunity to improve financial inclusion across our countries of operation"".

The combination of the company's strong customer base and distribution platforms and Mastercard’s products and services innovation and know-how would drive demand and growth in financial services for the benefit of customers and markets Mandava noted.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and the transfer of specified mobile money business assets and contracts into AMC BV.

According to Airtel alongside the investment the Group and Mastercard have extended commercial agreements and signed a new commercial framework which would deepen their partnerships across geographies and areas including card issuance payment gateway payment processing merchant acceptance and remittance solutions.

The transaction is in line with the Group’s pursuit of strategic asset monetisation and investment opportunities and follows on the heels of an announcement on March 18 2021 of USD 200 million investment in AMC BV by TPG’s The Rise Fund and the sale of the Group’s telecommunication towers companies in Madagascar and Malawi on March 23 2021.

""As previously announced Airtel Africa aims to continue to monetise its mobile money business with minority investments up to a total of 25 per cent of the issued share capital of AMC BV and to explore the potential listing of the mobile money business within four years"" Airtel statement said.

Operating under the brand Airtel Money Airtel Africa’s mobile money services is a digital mobile financial services platform catering to Africa and includes mobile wallet deposit and withdrawals merchant and commercial payments benefits transfers loans and savings virtual credit card and international money transfers.

The profits before tax in the full year ending March 31 2020 and the value of gross assets as of that date attributable to the mobile money businesses were USD 143.4 million and USD 463.2 million respectively.

Asserting that Airtel Africa aims to explore the potential listing of the mobile money business within four years' time the statement said ""under the terms of the transaction and in very limited circumstances (in the event that there is no Initial Public Offering of shares in AMC BV within four years of the first close or in the event of changes of control without Mastercard’s prior approval) Mastercard would have the option so as to provide liquidity to them to sell its shares in AMC BV to Airtel Africa or its affiliates at fair market value (determined by a mutually agreed merchant bank using an agreed internationally accepted valuation methodology)"".

The option is subject to a minimum price equivalent to the consideration paid by Mastercard for its investment (less the value of all distributions and any proceeds of the sale of its shares and with no time value of money or minimum built-in) and a maximum number of shares in AMC BV such that the consideration does not exceed USD 200 million.

The deal is expected to reach first close over next three to four months. From first close Mastercard will be entitled to certain customary information and minority protection rights.

This is how best to summarize Ananse Africa a startup ecommerce platform launched today in Johannesburg and Lagos connecting African designers with local and international consumers. The platform showcases the rich and diverse

tapestry of Africa’s creative talent and simplifies international ecommerce payments and logistics for creative entrepreneurs on the continent.

Ananse has partnered with the Mastercard Foundation and logistics market leader DHL to roll out the ‘most comprehensive pan-African ecommerce platform’ to support creative entrepreneurs like fashion designers and artists to enable them to grow their businesses.

“The Mastercard Foundation partnership with Ananse will enable African fashion brands to sell over 1 million garments over the next three years with 75% sourced from African suppliers and 70% participation from women. This will provide a significant boost to the creative economy sector ” said Mastercard Foundation Country Head Nigeria Chidinma Lawanson.

This valuable business tool will enable artists fashion designers artisans and small businesses along the fashion and art value chains conduct trade and expand their businesses leveraging the power of the internet in a cost-effective way. With countries around the world imposing COVID-19 restrictions on physical retail and international travel consumers are increasingly switching to online shopping resulting in a sizeable decrease in the revenues of small businesses like tailors and fashion designers.

“We are not only making it easy for consumers around the world to shop from fashion designers and artists across Africa but also making it straightforward for creatives to manage the payments and logistics functions necessary to complete an ecommerce order” said the company’s founder Sam Mensah a Ghanaian ex-Silicon Valley executive and fashion entrepreneur.

Ananse’s ecommerce and POS solution is simplifying trading in both the physical and digital worlds for creative entrepreneurs in Africa. Ananse provides creative merchants with full support including production training quality assurance online payments order processing and packaging. The technology solution aims to solve the key problems that prevent African fashion designers artisans and artists from being commercially viable and successful.

Speaking at the Ananse launch Leendert van Delft DHL Vice-President for Global eCommerce spoke of the company’s experience as the fashion retail and art industry’s leading global logistics partner. “For decades we have pioneered solutions to meet the needs of artists designers retailers and customers by making it our mission to provide these businesses with exceptional service that translates to a competitive edge. Through our collaboration with Ananse we are delighted to offer fast and efficient international logistics solutions that have proven critical to countless startups over the years” said van Delft.

Mastercard has sealed a pact with wireless operator Airtel Africa that will see it procure a minority interest in the telco’s mobile money division Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV).

An estimate reached for the deal purpose using cash and debt-free valuation parameter puts the mobile money business alone at $2.65 billion in the African market where Airtel itself has footprints in 14 countries.

Mastercard will take a stake equivalent to $100million of that sum once the transaction is over Airtel said in a note to the Nigerian Stock Exchange on Thursday.

It is the second of such deal to be announced in less than two weeks considering that a private equity firm The Rise Fund acquired shares worth $200 million in AMC BV in March.

“The Group and Mastercard have extended commercial agreements and signed a new commercial framework which will deepen their partnerships across numerous geographies and areas including card issuance payment gateway payment processing merchant acceptance and remittance solutions amongst others” the statement said.

Shares in Airtel Africa has returned 9.18 per cent in Nigeria so far this year and was trading at N930 per unit at 11:35 WAT in Lagos on Friday.

Airtel headquartered in New Delhi hopes to list its mobile money subsidiary as an independent entity in four years and is stepping up plans to raise minority investments in the company to one-fourth of its issued share capital.

The idea is to raise cash sufficient for the dual purpose of network and sales expansion and offsetting the group’s debt.

MANILA – State-owned Landbank of the Philippines extended anew the waiver of fees for online fund transfers of retail clients until June 30 2021 as a way to help the public cope with rising Covid-19 cases.

The Landbank MBA was upgraded last year to include new features such as an enhanced user interface card-less withdrawal and registration of Mastercard credit and prepaid cards.

I booked a couple of trips this week for my family — and the IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card reminded us why it’s such a good fit for our travel needs.

The card’s Fourth Night Free and annual Anniversary Night benefits came in very handy — and have us looking forward to our trips even more so than before!

Here’s how everything worked.

Fourth Night Free Benefit

One of our trips involves my wife daughter and me. We’ve visiting family members in the Midwest — some of whom we haven’t seen in about 18 months. (Everyone but two children will be fully vaccinated then.)

We reserved a stay at a decent Holiday Inn. The kids love the pool the hotel has a great restaurant (true story!) it’s near several other restaurants and close to other areas we enjoy visiting.

**RELATED: Why the IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card is Great (Especially for Families)

Award nights cost 12500 points each for the dates we wanted. We’re staying four nights — which “should” run a total of 50000 points right?

And that’s where the IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card came in.

Cardholders are entitled to a “Fourth Night Free” perk. This means that when you book three consecutive nights of an award stay you’re entitled a complimentary night. We’re getting a four-night stay for a three-night redemption price. Our total room cost? 37500 points.

This hotel is currently charging $94/night (before tax) for rooms. So theIHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card‘s $99 annual fee was already recouped — and then a few bucks more.

But wait! There’s more!

Anniversary Night Certificate Redemption

My wife and I booked a quick weekend getaway for a weekend this summer.

Both of us have IHG credit cards (the Premier Card and the O.G. Select card). So we each used an annual anniversary night to book one-night stays at a Hotel Indigo.

Rooms at this hotel are going for $135 night before tax. So again we came out well ahead of the card’s $99 annual fee.

IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card

Aside from room charges during IHG stays and the occasional Chase Offer we don’t really put any everyday spending on our IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card .

Why?

We still have a bunch of points from the IHG MasterCard mail-in promotion a few years ago as well as the IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card ‘s big welcome offers. And paid work trips end up getting us a few points too.

So why do we even bother holding the card? Its perks make it a must-have for us:

Complimentary IHG Platinum Elite status Room upgrades (when available) Guaranteed room availability Complimentary Internet Priority check-in (when available) Late check-out (when available) Welcome amenity (usually 500 points or a free alcoholic beverage) $30 In-room spa credit (where available)

Free anniversary night at IHG properties valued at 40000 or fewer points. (Benefit available beginning the second year of card membership.)

Fourth night free on award stays

$100 Global Entry or TSA Pre√ application credit every four years.

No foreign transaction fees

Given IHG’s massive global footprint it’s not hard finding properties for us to enjoy.

Final Approach

Again this about why the IHG card works well for my family. I fully expect people to jump down my throat after IHG made some “What the…?!” devaluations. I truly hope the company rethinks its pricing here — especially because it said it’s all about focusing on the mid-tier hotels.

The IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card is fantastic for my family’s travel needs. The Fourth Night Free and annual anniversary night benefits absolutely make holding the card worth the $99 annual fee. Our family almost always enjoys our stays at IHG properties — and when we can do so using just points and certificates that’s even better!

The FGCU volleyball team was one point away from advancing to the NCAA Tournament.

But the Eagles just couldn't get it. Lipscomb won three points in a row to take the decisive fifth set 16-14 in the ASUN championship match Saturday in Kennesaw Georgia.

""I’m so proud of our group for battling through a match like this were we just could never find a rhythm"" FGCU coach Matt Botsford said. ""Lipscomb dialed up the service pressure early and we found ourselves on our heels all night. Despite that the players pushed and pushed and found ways to extend the match and keep it tight.""

It's the seventh tournament title for the Bisons.

FGCU dropped the first set 25-21 but won five straight points late. Then it appeared the Eagles lost the second set 27-25 then a replay reversal kept them alive and they won it 28-26. Lipscomb won the third set 25-19 but FGCU came right back to take the fourth set 25-21.

The Eagles led 11-7 in the fifth set but the Bisons tied it up 11-11. The teams traded points then Erin Shomaker's kill made it 14-13. Megan Kuper's kill tied it Delaney Dilfer and Samantha Rubal followed with a block for the lead and Garrett Joiner's kill clinched it.

Shomaker a sophomore had 27 kills and 11 digs. Junior Chelsey Lockey had 56 assists. Dana Axner had 21 digs and Aja Jones had 11 kills and 7 blocks. Senior Cortney VanLiew had 9 kills.

""Kortney Reynolds made a huge impact off the bench and really helped spark a resurgence in that second set and beyond"" Botsford said. ""Erin helped us through some tough spots with timely kills and Dana was excellent in the back row.""

It was the second straight season the Eagles had lost in five sets in the ASUN championship match. They lost to Kennesaw State to end the 2019 season.

Women's basketball: FGCU sophomore forward Kierstan Bell was named an Honorable Mention All-American by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association on Saturday. She joins Keri Jewett-Giles in giving the Eagles back-to-back recipients.

""Kierstan is a tremendous player"" FGCU head coach Karl Smesko said. ""We knew she'd have a great season in our system but she was just exceptional. She's been recognized a lot of ways and I think she has the potential in the future to be a top five pick in the WNBA Draft when she decides to turn pro.

The ESIC is being assisted by law enforcement on multiple levels in tracking down offenders who fix matches in the FPS game.

Speaking with YouTuber Slash32 (ta Kotaku) Ian Smith the commissioner of the ESIC says the commission is on the trail of “a relatively small but significant group of players.” These pros have been perpetrating what he’d describe as “classic match fixing” in North American tournaments and the level of organisation and length of time has led to involvement from the FBI.

“To some extent we’re working with law enforcement and the FBI who only recently have had a sports betting investigative unit within the FBI” Smith explains. “They’re good but they’re inexperienced because sports betting has never been a big thing in America until recently so everybody’s kind of finding their feet on that one.” This is for the North American branch of the ESEA MDL in particular where esports gambling is relatively new and laws can vary by state making it even more difficult.

Some 35 Australian pros were sanctioned in January for breaching the ESIC’s rules on betting ranging from a one year ban to five years depending on severity. As Smith explains match fixing is illegal in Australia so charges may be brought against some select individuals but we’ll need to wait a while to hear more on that potential development.

“I’m optimistic that we’ll be able to go public with this soon within the next ten days to two weeks. The betting scandal in Australia where whilst it was a large group of players there definitely is match fixing there and we’re working with law enforcement there it takes a lot longer there once you start working with the police” He explains. “Fortunately in Australia these are criminal offences. So getting it all coordinated with the police takes a lot longer.”

Simply Recipes / McCormick

McCormick & Company Inc. has voluntarily recalled a batch of French's Original Crispy Fried Onions due to the potential growth of Staphylococcus aureus (Staph). The recall was initiated on March 18 and reported by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) on May 2.

The recalled products are:

720 pouches of 26.5-ounce French's Original Crispy Fried Onions

UPC: 041500959030



3456 units of six-ounce French's Original Crispy Fried Onions

UPC: 041500220208

Neither the company nor the FDA disclosed when the recalled products were sold to customers which batches were recalled and if they have a specific best-by date.

The recalled products were distributed to Arizona and Illinois. The FDA recall reports do not disclose whether the products were further distributed to stores beyond these two states or whether the recalled products were removed from store shelves.

What Is Staphylococcus Aureus?

The FDA explains that Staph is a bacteria that can cause severe food poisoning. Food contaminated with Staph may not smell or taste bad or look spoiled. Though the bacteria can be killed by cooking the toxins may still be able to cause illness.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) symptoms develop within 30 minutes to eight hours after consuming the contaminated food. Though severe illness is rare Staph food poisoning may cause nausea vomiting and stomach cramps.

What To Do If You Have the Recalled Products at Home

Check your pantry for the recalled products many of which have a long shelf-life. Do not eat any of the recalled products. You should discard them.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA1L3NucC1hY3RpdmlzdC1ncmFlbWUtbWNjb3JtaWNrLWpvaG4tc3dpbm5leS1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWNvbnRlc3TSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8wNS9zbnAtYWN0aXZpc3QtZ3JhZW1lLW1jY29ybWljay1qb2huLXN3aW5uZXktbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1jb250ZXN0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SNP activist aims to challenge John Swinney for party leadership,"John Swinney could face a leadership contest before he becomes Scottish National party leader after an activist said he expected to win enough nominations to stand.

Graeme McCormick a well-known party activist who stood to become SNP president in 2023 claimed he would gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

His supporters argue it would be undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. If one does take place Swinney will not be appointed as first minister until late May.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson posted on X on Sunday that he had already obtained the 100 signatures required and was planning to hand them in to the SNP “in person”.

Lawson also attacked Swinney for criticising the move and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was challenging him.

“So Graeme McCormick has succeeded in getting the nominations he needed. Disappointed that JS [Swinney] has already had a dig at him before nominations even close for daring to challenge him. He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea?”

McCormick some of whose allies want the Scottish government to mount a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

Nominations to succeed Humza Yousaf as SNP leader close at noon on Monday. If another candidate crosses the nominations threshold and forces a contest Yousaf is expected to remain in post and as Scotland’s first minister until a winner is declared.

McCormick was very confident he would gather the signatures before the deadline after canvassing for support at an independence rally in Glasgow organised by All Under One Banner the Sunday Herald newspaper reported.

Swinney who has been expecting to be confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday afternoon and be voted in as first minister this week warned on Sunday that a contest would delay his efforts to rebuild the party and put its deep divisions on public display.

“I think it would be better if we just got on with things that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength” he told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show. “We had a lot of strains around a couple of issues in parliament and I think we’ve just had a rough couple of years.

“[The] SNP has not looked cohesive; the SNP has not looked together. The central point of my message is we’ve got to get ourselves together.”

An unopposed coronation would not be the SNP’s first: Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in November 2014 without a contest.

Swinney’s call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

Mr McCormick's decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Mr Swinney as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down.

Mr Yousaf said he was resigning last week after he decided to end the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Green Party.

Reports of a contest began early on Sunday when Mr McCormick said he had secured the 100 nominations from 20 branches needed to run against Mr Swinney.

But in a statement shared with Sky News the party activist said he had had a ""lengthy and fruitful conversation"" with Mr Swinney adding he had ""met the threshold set by the party rules"".

""This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver Independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

One year ago McDonald's Japan released two Samurai Mac burgers ""samurai-themed"" burgers each representing a feuding samurai faction. On one hand the Wild Faction's roasted soy sauce double-thick beef burger and the other a roasted soy sauce bacon tomato thick beef burger from the Selfish Faction. In case it wasn't obvious the ""samurai"" flavor comes from the rich roasted soy sauce-based sauce as well as the promotional efforts of popular actor Masato Sakai. The burgers were available for a limited time.

Now for 2021 the Samurai Mac is back and McDonald's has decided they're good enough to add to the regular menu available for April 7.

Just like last year McDonald's Japan is marketing the Samurai Mac as a burger with a taste meant to satisfy adults. Their slogan 大人を、楽しめ otona wo tanoshime literally means ""Enjoy adulthood.""

Samurai Mac: Roasted Soy Sauce Double-Thick Beef Burger

The Roasted Soy Sauce Double-Thick Beef Burger (炙り醤油風ダブル肉厚ビーフ aburi shoyu fū daburu nikuatsu bufu) costs 490 yen a la carte or 790 yen in a value set. (Not available for ""doubling"" in the Night Mac menu).

The early meeting with Texas athletic director Chis Del Conte at the Comfort Inn in Plainview TX was a success.

Beard agreed to return to his alma mater and build the Longhorns program. After five seasons with the Texas Tech Red Raiders Beard gets a chance to leave his mark at the prestigious institution.

While the college basketball landscape was shocked that Beard would head to a Big 12 rival after having Texas Tech in the NCAA Tournament it was more surprising to find out that Beard’s beloved Whataburger was not the preferred choice for breakfast.

Such a moment needed further explanation. Del Conte confirmed that McDonald's was indeed the choice. He tweeted a photo of the receipt that helped seal the deal and brought Beard to the Longhorns.

Beard has been an avid lover of Whataburger for its flexible hours and delectable menu. He detailed his favorite order with the Dallas Morning News in 2018. He also mentioned that some of the best interactions happen at obscure times.

“Another great thing about Whataburger too have you ever been to Whataburger at 2:00 3:00 in the morning? Don’t go through the drive-thru” Beard said. “Go in next time and just get a corner booth and just watch America. Just watch it. You’ll see so many cool things at Whataburger.”

Beard will have a chance to get his fair share of Whataburger as he leads the Longhorns program for the upcoming season. He is focused on winning games and mentioned that he is looking for a new challenge.

The Longhorns recently won the Big 12 Tournament and made the NCAA Tournament as a No. 3 seed. The program lost to Abilene Christian in the first round. It opened the door for Beard to return and earn the starting role.

“I'm thrilled and excited to be coming back to Austin and back to the Longhorn family” Beard said in a statement on Thursday. “I can't express how excited I am for this opportunity and the journey that lies ahead. I want to thank president Hartzell and athletics director Chris Del Conte for their trust. It's time to get to work. Our top priority will be embracing our players as soon as we get to campus and I look forward to starting this journey together towards our championship goals.”

Ricketts: ‘Nebraska stands with Georgia’,"OMAHA Neb. (WOWT) - A day after Major League Baseball handed an economic blow to the city of Atlanta citing the state’s new election law Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts tweeted in support of fellow Republican Gov. Brian Kemp stating on Saturday that Nebraska stands in solidarity with Georgia.

Ricketts tweeted Saturday that the recent corporate attacks on the Georgia legislation ”are promoting Democratic disinformation” while Kemp who signed his state’s election reform bill into law March 25 “is expanding voting options in Georgia” — by way of a voting law President Biden called “Jim Crow in 21st century.”

Nebraska stands with Georgia and supports their work to promote integrity and access in voting. — Gov. Pete Ricketts (@GovRicketts) April 3 2021

Ricketts made the comment on social media on Saturday. Dissent among some organizations and corporations prompted Major League Baseball to pull the July 13 All-Star game from Atlanta over the state’s election updates — the first economic backlash since Kent signed the controversial election bill into law.

Precious McKesson who made history in December as she cast Nebraska’s “blue dot” electoral vote for Democrat Joe Biden responded to the tweet saying that not all Nebraskans feel the same way about the Georgia law but the posts have since been removed from view.

The controversy surrounding Georgia’s new election law first spread to corporate America as Delta Air Lines and The Coca-Cola Co. two of the state’s best-known brands called the new law “unacceptable” although they had a hand in writing it. Similar dissent also cropped up in Texas as American Airlines which is based in Fort Worth came out against restrictive voting measures pending in the state that have a favorable path to reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk in the coming weeks.

Pressure continues to mount on leading companies in Arizona and other states as well: A joint statement from executives at nearly 200 companies including HP Microsoft PayPal Target Twitter Uber and Under Armour took aim at state legislation “threatening to make voting more difficult” and said “elections are not improved” when lawmakers impose new barriers to voting.

Georgia’s law requires a photo identification to vote absentee by mail. It also shortens how long voters have to request an absentee ballot and limits where ballot drop boxes can be placed and when they can be used.

Republican supporters say the law is needed to restore confidence in Georgia’s elections after former President Trump’s made baseless claims of widespread fraud there — actions now under the scrutiny of a grand jury. Democrats call it a power grab after big Democratic wins in recent months and say it will restrict voting access especially for voters of color.

Protest of the bill was immediate. Georgia state police arrested state Rep. Park Cannon an Atlanta Democrat after she said she wanted to see Republican Gov. Brian Kemp sign the law.

Biden also spoken out against the Georgia law that same day urging Congress to pass national voting standards that would include automatic voter registration nationwide allow former felons to vote — an allowance Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds enacted in Iowa via executive order last year — and limit the ways states can remove registered voters from the rolls.

“This is Jim Crow in the 21st century” Biden said in a statement. “It must end. We have a moral and constitutional obligation to act.”

Ricketts addressed a question about the tweets in his regularly scheduled COVID-19 update Monday morning reiterating the same sentiments and issuing specific criticisms of President Biden’s comments on the matter saying the president was “making a lot of misstatements that’s just factually not accurate.”

Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts said Monday morning April 5 2021 ""there's been a lot of disinformation put out there"" regarding Georgia's new election laws.

A program like IMMEDIATE could totally fortify these efforts and get the access ‘ball’ rolling a little faster.”

In mid-March 2021 Medtronic announced that it was partnering with the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology (SVIN) to aid in the expansion of the Mechanical Thrombectomy 2020+ (MT2020+) initiative via collaboration with its own program IMMEDIATE. Together Medtronic announced it and MT2020+ seek to overcome the barriers to treatment and improve stroke systems of care to enhance lives worldwide.

In order to find out more about the pairing of these 2 large entities and the overall mission and goals NeurologyLive spoke with Dan Volz president Neurovascular Business Medtronic and Dileep Yavagal MD MT2020+ chair and professor of clinical neurology University of Miami about it. The pair shared their insight into their expectations for the partnership and how it may ultimately improve the global care of patients with stroke.

Specifically Volz shared his insight from Medtronic’s time developing devices and the like for neurovascular conditions and what the company hopes to bring to SVIN. Yavagal on the other hand pointed out some of the obstacles to accessing mechanical thrombectomy and highlighted the stakeholders in the stroke pathway of care.

People with diabetes could be seeing a turning point in ease of obtaining supplies for continuous glucose monitors as more of these products make their way into local pharmacies. While CGMs have traditionally only been available direct from the manufacturer or third-party supply distributors they’re now finally making their way onto the shelves of local pharmacies and even Costco stores around the country. For example the Dexcom G6 receivers transmitters and sensors are sold at discounted prices in Costco Pharmacies for the bulk chain’s member customers. Opinions may vary on just how good those discounts are but another big benefit for customers is that instead of waiting weeks for supplies to arrive in the mail you may be able to walk out the door of your local pharmacy in a day or two with everything you need. Along with Dexcom the Abbott FreeStyle Libre system supplies are also available at pharmacies and CGM maker Medtronic Diabetes is exploring pharmacy availability too. The takeaway is that lower-cost and more readily accessible purchase options are a must for any company wanting to succeed in the growing CGM market — that’s set to expand broadly to consumers even beyond those with diabetes.

How much do CGMs cost at the pharmacy? As always insurance coverage varies by type so the cost to each individual will depend on whether one even has pharmacy coverage for CGMs and what copays or deductibles may apply. To keep it simple here are the retail cash prices of the two systems currently available in pharmacies: Dexcom Users are thrilled to see the leading CGM on the market becoming more ubiquitously available. At local pharmacies: Around the United States in CVS Walgreens and many other retailers cash prices vary but most locations we queried quoted the price for a G6 transmitter at just under $300 while a three-pack box of G6 sensors runs ~$400. Remember too: Insurance may cover CGM supplies as a pharmacy benefit meaning you could find these available at local or mail-order pharmacies for a flat copay or with varying coinsurance and deductible amounts applied. At Costco: To get the Costco pricing you of course need to be a Costco member ($60) and also sign up for their free pharmacy program. As of April 2021 the Costco Pharmacy membership cash prices are as follows based on the latest company info online: G6 transmitter: $277.62 each (or membership discount price: $132.24)

Box of G6 sensors (three pack): $384.60 (or $303.74 membership discount price)

G6 receiver: $417.92 each (or $203.29 membership discount price) Note that you may see online search results showing varying price points based on an older Costco Pharmacy deal. That earlier discount was dramatically lower: a G6 transmitter only cost $28.88 and a G6 touchscreen receiver cost $35.96! Since Costco discount prices are periodically adjusted be sure to check in advance of driving to the store to purchase. These Costco prices are self-pay only as insurance isn’t applicable there (also not Medicare or Medicaid). So for anyone who may have a lower insurance copay or deductible requirement they may be better off sticking with their traditional purchase channels. Share on Pinterest Photo: DiabetesMine Caution: Unfortunately lots of patients and even many Costco pharmacy folks are unaware of this savings program. So if asked Costco employees may quote much higher prices up to $1100 for a single box of sensors — ugh! We’re also hearing that some Costco pharmacists have been insisting that they must check insurance and that this G6 discount only applies if you’ve already been denied insurance coverage which is NOT TRUE as we have confirmed with Costco corporate contacts. Be sure to be insistent if you encounter this barrier. Freestyle Libre The Abbott Freestyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) system is not (yet) what many consider to be a full-featured CGM with real-time glucose alerts for High and Low readings but it does qualify as a continuous sensor and is growing in popularity. This system has been available through national pharmacies like Costco CVS Kroger Walgreens and Rite Aid since it launched in late 2017. Senior public affairs manager Jennifer Heth at Abbott tells us that a majority of their 500000 users in the United States are already getting their Libre 14-day-wear sensors through retail pharmacies. Notably Abbott says the Libre costs 70 percent less than the list price of other CGM systems currently available. Here are the approximate prices for the Libre system in pharmacies: List price of $54 per sensor according to Abbott (though retail pharmacies like Costco and Walgreens quote prices of $58–69)

With commercial insurance most patients pay between $10 and $75 per month for Libre 14-day sensors at participating pharmacies

Handheld reader: $70 (though the separate receiver isn’t required as users can opt to use the FreeStyle LibreLink mobile app for iOS or Android for no charge) Abbott tells us that building out their pharmacy purchase channel is an “area of focus” for the company that started in 2020. “Pharmacists play a central role in patient care and are valued for their impact on improving outcomes for people living with diabetes” Heth says. “Abbott is dedicated to providing education on the rapidly evolving diabetes technology… Abbott has provided educational grant support for pharmacist continuing education programs with the American Pharmacists Association Pharmacy Times among others.” Heth also tells us that in addition to national and online programs Abbott provides live peer-to-peer training sessions for pharmacists and webinars on the clinical application of FreeStyle Libre and CGM report interpretation using the Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) a standardized one-page report that visually summarizes glucose trend data. Medtronic and Eversense CGMs: Not in pharmacies Sorry friends. Medtronic confirms that it will be a while before their CGM supplies hit the pharmacy channel. Spokeswoman Pam Reese director of global communications for Medtronic Diabetes tells us: “We are currently exploring pharmacy options for our CGM. We have some pharmacy access already and are continuing to build our own internal pharmacy operations. In addition we are exploring a retail pharmacy strategy.” It makes sense that the fourth CGM sensor on the market the implantable Eversense from Senseonics would not be available in pharmacies. This sensor must be implanted under the skin via a minimal surgical incision procedure by a qualified doctor. Still we asked the company about any plans to sell supplies (replacement transmitters or charging cords) in pharmacies. Senseonics’ director of global PR and brand marketing Karen Hynes says no explaining: “If Eversense is covered under someone’s pharmacy benefit it would be mail ordered and shipped directly to the healthcare provider who is placing the sensor. Otherwise it would go through the DME (durable medical equipment) channel and would be shipped to the healthcare provider.”

Why is CGM access in pharmacies taking so long? The effort to make CGM supplies more readily available for retail purchase began back in 2015 when a half-dozen or more insurance plans began covering CGM supplies in a different way than they traditionally had. They recategorized these devices as a “pharmacy benefit” rather than the traditional classification as “durable medical equipment” (DME). This meant people with certain plans would no longer be bound to buying supplies from designated third-party medical equipment suppliers or directly from the manufacturer but rather could purchase them wherever medications are sold. Anthem and UnitedHealthcare (UHC) were among the big insurance carriers taking that important first step toward eventual over-the-counter access to CGM supplies in local pharmacy chains like CVS or Walgreens. Other insurers have moved in this direction over time. Even with some insurers now classifying CGM as a pharmacy benefit it remains a “Your Insurance Coverage May Vary” situation in terms of how much any individual might pay for supplies — some plans require only a low fixed copay applied to all pharmacy benefit items while others require coinsurance where you pay a percentage of the actual cost of the item. Still other plans require that you meet an annual deductible before any copay or coinsurance kicks in. It all varies. Currently most CGM users are still purchasing their supplies from designated third-party medical equipment vendors or directly from the manufacturer. Per Dexcom’s talking points pharmacy distribution allows for “a more seamless experience for physicians and patients changing the once eight-step month-long distribution process into four simple steps that enable a patient to get their Dexcom device in as few as 1–2 days through their pharmacist.” When Dexcom began planning for pharmacy availability several years ago (during the early G5 model days) it pushed for access by mail-order as well as in retail pharmacies — including “drop shipments” of orders prepared for pickup 24 hours in advance. Presumably that “just in time” shipping policy was meant to avoid pharmacies stockpiling expired sensors that they can’t sell or running out of supplies. Going into 2020 Dexcom is pushing for an increase in its CGM business going through pharmacy channels by as much as 70 percent of their sensor business to be exact. After 2019 the CGM manufacturer says it has now crossed the threshold of supplying more than 50 percent of its CGM supplies through pharmacies.

Walgreens makes CGM history Walgreens made headlines in 2019 with its pharmacy expansion for the Dexcom G6 especially for Medicare beneficiaries who can now obtain their CGM supplies within that local pharmacy. Many Dexcom customers who use Walgreens have also started receiving automated emails and messages about syncing pharmacy and CGM accounts for more efficiency. In fact Walgreens’ Find Care marketplace introduced a program in 2019 in which interested people with diabetes can proactively request a prescription for the Dexcom G6. They simply complete a questionnaire that is sent to their healthcare provider for review and potential prescription. No doubt as the next-generation Dexcom-Verily G7 product (designed to be more consumer friendly fully disposable and lower cost) moves forward and launches in 2021 we will see more big pharmacy chains adding CGM tech to their shelves. Still overall use of CGMs among people with type 1 diabetes remains low at about 35 percent. This is attributed in part to provider reluctance to prescribe the system.",,,,,,,,,

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Vyjuvek is a topical gene therapy for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa an inherited disorder causes painful blisters and persistent wounds.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Problem is there is an ongoing global shortage of BCG.

Now the California biotech has partnered with the Serum Institute of India in an exclusive deal to manufacture BCG globally.

The arrangement aims to create “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and produce BCG “at large scale” for use in combination with Anktiva in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ImmunityBio said Thursday.

BCG originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine is also a standard treatment for NMIBC which accounts for about 80% of around 80000 new bladder cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.

The FDA has cleared Anktiva and BCG to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ. And ImmunityBio is evaluating the combo in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with papillary tumors and perhaps more importantly in BCG-naïve NMIBC.

In the current indication ImmunityBio will go toe to toe with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 megablockbuster Keytruda and Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ gene therapy Adstiladrin both of which are administered by themselves without BCG. Ironically Merck is currently the sole supplier of BCG in the U.S.

Merck’s TICE BCG has been the lone BCG product in the U.S. since 2012 coming after Sanofi and another drugmaker ran into manufacturing problems. Sanofi officially pulled out of the market in 2016. Merck which had before then not been the major supplier globally for BCG was forced to pick up the slack.

In October 2020 Merck announced a plan to construct a new TICE BCG manufacturing facility in North Carolina. But that project was anticipated to be completed by late 2025 to late 2026 according to a Merck update in January this year. Once operational Merck expects to triple its current BCG capacity and believes believes it will be able to meet demand “for the foreseeable future.”

Merck has been rationing BCG supply since 2019. The New Jersey Big Pharma allocates its limited supply to distributors and wholesalers based on historical purchasing and it doesn’t directly determine the supply to individual healthcare providers.

SII is the largest manufacturer of BCG vaccine globally according to ImmunityBio. The Indian company has two BCG products for oncology use one traditional BCG called Onco-BCG is already commercialized outside the U.S. The new deal will see SII immediately supply that standard BCG for ImmunityBio’s clinical trials once the FDA signs off on the trial protocols which ImmunityBio plans to submit to global regulatory authorities within 30 days.

The second product a recombinant BCG is undergoing midstage testing in Europe. This version includes two gene modifications to improve its profile and according to ImmunityBio it has shown “potent immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ stimulation and improved safety compared to standard BCG.” The two partners are now working to speed up the phase 2 program.

However in both cases the timeline for commercial supplies remains unclear. ImmunityBio will have more clarity on the timeline once it submits the trial protocols to the FDA a media aide to the company told Fierce Pharma.

The good news for ImmunityBio? Anktiva’s current U.S. label doesn’t specify or limit the type of BCG the drug can be used with. This allows the company to explore other alternatives to Merck’s TICE BCG ImmunityBio’s executive chairman Patrick Soon-Shiong M.D. said during an investor call last week.

“We are pleased to partner with the Serum Institute of India so that the power of its large-scale world-class GMP manufacturing capacity can be used to address the issue of BCG shortage which affects thousands of bladder cancer patients annually” Soon-Shiong said in a statement Thursday.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

A user in a low-level hacking forum on Saturday published the phone numbers and personal data of hundreds of millions of Facebook users for free.

The exposed data includes the personal information of over 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries including over 32 million records on users in the US 11 million on users in the UK and 6 million on users in India. It includes their phone numbers Facebook IDs full names locations birthdates bios and in some cases email addresses.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Insider reviewed a sample of the leaked data and verified several records by matching known Facebook users' phone numbers with the IDs listed in the data set. We also verified records by testing email addresses from the data set in Facebook's password-reset feature which can be used to partially reveal a user's phone number.

A Facebook spokesperson told Insider that the data had been scraped because of a vulnerability that the company patched in 2019.

While it's a couple of years old the leaked data could prove valuable to cybercriminals who use people's personal information to impersonate them or scam them into handing over login credentials according to Alon Gal the chief technology officer of the cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock who discovered the trough of leaked data on Saturday.

""A database of that size containing the private information such as phone numbers of a lot of Facebook's users would certainly lead to bad actors taking advantage of the data to perform social-engineering attacks [or] hacking attempts"" Gal told Insider.

Gal discovered the leaked data in January when a user in the same hacking forum advertised an automated bot that could provide phone numbers for hundreds of millions of Facebook users for a price. Motherboard reported on that bot's existence at the time and verified that the data was legitimate.

Now the data set has been posted on the hacking forum for free making it available to anyone with rudimentary data skills.

Insider attempted to reach the leaker through the messaging app Telegram but did not get a response.

This is not the first time that lots of Facebook users' phone numbers have been found exposed online. The vulnerability uncovered in 2019 allowed millions of phone numbers to be scraped from Facebook's servers in violation of its terms of service. Facebook said that vulnerability was patched in August 2019.

Facebook vowed to crack down on mass data-scraping after Cambridge Analytica scraped the data of over 80 million users in violation of Facebook's terms of service to target voters with political ads in the 2016 election.

Gal said that from a security standpoint there wasn't much Facebook could do to help users affected by the breach since their data is already out in the open but he added that Facebook could notify users so they could remain vigilant about phishing schemes or fraud using their data.

""Individuals signing up to a reputable company like Facebook are trusting them with their data and Facebook [is] supposed to treat the data with utmost respect"" Gal said.

Now it comes in a summery new flavour: hot tub streams. Recently streamers have declared these broadcasts the new “meta” outraging the usual suspects — but also leading some female streamers to voice scepticism as well.

Hot tub streams are not entirely new — they came into vogue for a time last year as well — but they really began to take off in March. The formula is simple: Streamers clad in bathing suits sit in hot tubs and chat with viewers. Some use full-blown poolside hot tubs but others who can’t afford or don’t have access to that level of luxury use a different kind of full-blown tub: the inflatable variety. Others parody hot tub streams with green screens and other things that are not actually hot tubs.

Why now? Different streamers who’ve participated in the hot tub meta have different opinions.

“It’s getting nicer out and people are getting spring fever” Twitch partner and cosplayer Spoopy Kitt who recently added hot tub streams to her repertoire told Kotaku in a DM. “I think people like looking at pretty women in bikinis and I love being in a hot tub and meme-ing around so it’s a win-win.”

“I think people like looking at pretty women in bikinis and I love being in a hot tub and meme-ing around so it’s a win-win.”

Variety streamer XoAeriel says she was the first streamer to use an inflatable hot tub late last year. She thinks the accessibility of her method played a major role in hot tub streams’ current popularity.

“In December of 2020 I went on Amazon and purchased a blow-up hot tub” she told Kotaku in an email. “I wanted some kind of different content and no one else was doing it. I got a couple of LED lights to go inside and when it arrived I began streaming. Views took off pretty quickly and my following started to grow pretty fast. A few streamers started noticing my views shot through the roof and also ordered a blow-up hot tub…People have said ‘Hot tub streams existed before you.’ Yes this is true. However blow-up hot tub streams did not and it never became a meta until I did it.”

Twitch partner Firedancer who is newer to Twitch followed the lead of other streamers. “I think most Just Chatting streamers look to others for inspiration and for me it started as exactly that” she told Kotaku in a DM also noting people being stuck in their homes due to covid has probably played a role. “I’ve done many pool and beach streams before so the idea of a hot tub stream wasn’t too far-fetched for me personally.”

For the most part hot tub streams unfold like other streams featured in Twitch’s Just Chatting category with streamers engaging their chats on a variety of topics. Difference is many of these conversations come back to the fact that the streamer is kicking back in a simmering chlorine stew while wearing revealing attire. Some in chat ask standard questions about how streamers are doing or what they’ve been up to or they crack jokes. Others do little to disguise their leering remarking on how hot streamers are or imploring them to remove clothing.

Over the years women streamers have faced controversy for wearing low-cut tops as well as swimsuits in other contexts. Streamers who emphasise their bodies — and even many who don’t — have been branded “titty streamers” and other similarly derogatory terms. Male streamers in turn have baselessly accused women of stealing their viewers. All of this has prompted Twitch to crack down inconsistently banning some women for nudity but others because of seemingly innocuous things like a Chun-Li costume. In some cases bans on the basis of attire have been warranted. In others not so much. This backdrop has laid the foundation for the current discourse around hot tub streams.

One smaller streamer sparked off much of the recent conversation by posting several screenshots from hot tub streams to Twitter.

“Went on Twitch and seriously got confused as to what app I was actually on” she wrote late last week. “What in the actual fuck happened to Twitch?! I really wanna know.”

This tweet wound up on r/Livestreamfail a massive Twitch subreddit that does not typically take kindly to scantily clad women on Twitch despite boasting a NSFW tag for frequent posts that are even more explicit with the title “The absolute state of Twitch.” It garnered over 15000 upvotes with many saying hot tub streams verge on being porn and comparing Twitch to more adult-oriented platforms like OnlyFans.

On Twitter some streamers pushed back against the original tweet.

“Well then it’s just too bad people like you don’t decide what’s appropriate for Twitch” said streamer and cosplayer Hillary “Pokket” Nicole. “We live in a world where it’s ok for men to sexualize women in media all the time. The minute a woman owns her own sexuality it’s somehow…*gasp* immoral!”

“I don’t think it’s fair to hate on women doing the hot tub meta” said streamer 39daph. “Twitch has the power to do something about it but chooses not to. Their inconsistent enforcement of rules is definitely strange.”

She also noted that female Korean streamers “have been banned for less” and that after a look around Twitch she came to the conclusion that it’s not as “big [a] problem as people make it to be and no doubt people will get bored of it eventually anyways.”

But that hasn’t stopped other female streamers from voicing concerns. Twitch partner and member of streamer collective E-Girl Rejects QTCinderella devoted a portion of an early March stream to her conflicted feelings on the matter on one hand acknowledging that other women have every right to do what they want with their bodies but also saying that if they do it on Twitch specifically it might cause viewers to come into her chat and make unwanted sexual advances. Speaking with Kotaku she expanded on her remarks.

“I want to make it very very very clear that there are multiple parties at fault here: Twitch as a website sexually charged streamers and viewers choosing to harass them” QTCinderella said in an email. “Twitch needs to set clear guidelines and to help get rid of harassers hot tub streamers need to follow whatever guidelines Twitch sets up (which they currently are so there is no real issue) and the viewers need to learn that just because one streamer does something does not mean another will. Shroud plays Valorant every day but no one comes into my chat telling me I need to play Valorant. It is not ok to expect me to get in a hot tub in a bathing suit because another girl is doing it.”

“Hot tub streams most definitely draw in more views. However is it really all that different than pool streams or IRL beach streams that have been on Twitch for years?”

It is not difficult to find instances of hot tub streamers allowing (or failing to deliberately prohibit) the sort of sexual comments that would get viewers banned in other streamers’ chats. However Spoopy Kitt doesn’t think that’s the root of the problem.

“I think women get sexualised no matter what” she told Kotaku. “I’ve had big boobs since I was 12 and started getting weird comments from then on. I think people get jealous [and] want to control women and that’s what their issues boil down to.”

XoAeriel agrees and thinks that as long as sexist men exist she might as well make money off them.

“I know some streamers have negative feelings towards hot tub streams but I will continue to ‘get my bag’ as one streamer [put it]. Hot tub streams most definitely draw in more views. However is it really all that different than pool streams or IRL beach streams that have been on Twitch for years?” she said. “These men who overly sexualise women already exist. Most of them have had their Twitch accounts for years. They didn’t just make an account because I was in the hot tub…They have always been misogynistic and will continue to do so after the hot tub stream meta dissipates. I think women blaming other women for this is a serious issue.”

Kotaku reached out to Twitch about the rules surrounding hot tub streams and a Twitch spokesperson pointed to the company’s policies around sexually suggestive content — and more specifically an exception for swimwear in the nudity and attire policy.

“Swimwear is permitted as long as it completely covers the genitals and those who present as women must also cover their nipples” reads the policy. “Full coverage of buttocks is not required but camera focus around them is still subject to our sexually suggestive content policy. Coverage must be fully opaque even when wet. Sheer or partially see-through swimwear or other clothing does not constitute coverage.”

Between that and the fact that hot tub stream cameras do not directly “focus on breasts buttocks or pelvic region including poses that deliberately highlight these elements” most of them are technically in the clear. But they are still pretty obviously intended to highlight streamers’ bodies some more overtly so than others. Streamers also mostly categorise them as Just Chatting broadcasts which further muddies the waters of a section that’s already difficult to pin down even on its best days.

“People are frustrated because they feel like Twitch’s platform is being taken advantage of” said QTCinderella. “However hot tub streamers are not taking advantage of the platform because the platform is currently allowing it. Twitch needs to be vocal with their audience that this is ok. By not doing so it is encouraging a bizarre pent-up resentment.”

Image: Firedancer / Twitch

The question then is what Twitch should do about hot tub streams if anything. In recent times the company has clarified its attire policies but hot tub streams present more questions. QTCinderella believes Twitch should require hot tub streamers to occupy a more specific category than Just Chatting to discourage viewers from “seeing the next girl in Just Chatting and expecting her to do the same thing.”

Other Twitch streamers and viewers think Twitch should take it even further and create an 18+ section that would allow for more adult-skewing content. On one hand doing so might clear up confusion about what Twitch does and does not allow by providing a dedicated category which could in turn decrease harassment faced by women on the platform. But as many have pointed out Twitch probably won’t do it because the company makes a major chunk of its revenue on advertising money.

“Unless content harms the audience/other creators I don’t want to stop it” popular WoW streamer Asmongold said on Twitter. “Pornography harms creators by alienating advertisers and lowering their income. A girl in a bikini does not alienate advertisers in the same way that hardcore porn does.”

In much of this discussion however XoAeriel sees a conflation of concepts that are not intrinsically the same.

“You can be sexy without being sexual” she said “and I think that’s where a lot of people have hot tub streams confused. Are bikinis sexy? Yes. But are they sexual? No. Same with low-cut shirts. We are allowed to have unlimited cleavage. Is cleavage sexy? Yes. But is it sexual? No.”

“You can be sexy without being sexual and I think that’s where a lot of people have hot tub streams confused.”

If Twitch were to create new sections — especially ones dedicated to adult content — it would risk reinforcing the long-held societal idea that women’s bodies are inherently sexual. Worse Twitch would ultimately be in charge of enforcing what is sexual and what is not an issue where its track record is already very spotty. But as long as women continue to receive harassment for existing on Twitch the platform will always bear a large portion of the responsibility for it.

“Twitch needs to do something to help female streamers” said QTCinderella. “The first thing that comes to mind would be a way to report sexual harassers on the platform and being able to submit logs to get them banned off the entire platform. That sounds easier said than done; in a four-hour stream I would need to report minimum [of] between 10 to 20 viewers. That is a lot of time out of my day. Eventually I think I would just give up and stick to the current protocol of keeping them banned in my personal chat because it is the easiest. I wish I had a better answer for this but I hope Twitch will begin to brainstorm a way to help.”

In the meantime streamers who’ve embraced the hot tub meta are glad to have gotten their time in the sun and they hope other streamers can see that they’re not hurting anybody.

“As long as something isn’t hurting anyone why do we get so upset by it?” asked Firedancer. “Why should anyone have a problem with what someone else is wearing? I am happy that Twitch is being lenient about attire while streaming because it gives more chances for expression and individuality.”

“If Twitch decides to remove hot tub streams altogether I would actually be kind of shocked” said XoAeriel. “But if they do I will just move on to creating the next meta.”

Best known for his travel streams JakenbakeLIVE has been forced to get creative with his streaming since the global outbreak forced him into being locked down at home.

Unfortunately he was banned from the platform on March 27 for using his phone while driving. While the ban was due to be in place for one week it was overturned after just two days as he was driving on private property and not putting others in danger.

He planned to capitalize on a controversial Twitch trend and celebrate his return with a Hot Tub stream and boy did he deliver.

Joined by indiefoxx a pioneer of some undeniably controversial streaming antics and his girlfriend model Water Lynn Jakenbake broadcasted a 5.5 hour hot tub stream.

The stream was a major success for Jakenbake as he gained 1545 new subscribers on his channel. This was in no small part thanks to a reward tier list which would bring new challenges or aspects to the stream as new sub milestones were reached including having his makeup done and wearing a bikini.

Jake also took a leaf out of indiefoxx’s book by writing the names of subs on his body and at one point parodied fellow IRL streamer Amouranth.

Not all hot tub streams go quite as well as this one though. Streamer ImJasmine for example exposed the risks of putting electronics near water at the start of her 200k follower celebration stream.

While Twitch ToS does regulate against exposed bodies in most circumstances it gives contextual exceptions including for people in hot tubs on the beach or in similar environments. This is why the practice has become so popular.

The boom in popularity hasn’t yet convinced JakenbakeLIVE to produce more hot tub streams. But with a peak audience of 10k viewers there’s no doubt this particular stream was a huge success.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcHVibGljd29ybGQuY29tL3RlY2gvZ2FtaW5nL3RoaXMtbWVtZS1pcy1mcm9tLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtYW1vbmctdXMtdGhlLXZpcmFsLXJlZGRpdC1tZXRhLW1lbWUtZXhwbGFpbmVkL9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcHVibGljd29ybGQuY29tL3RlY2gvZ2FtaW5nL3RoaXMtbWVtZS1pcy1mcm9tLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtYW1vbmctdXMtdGhlLXZpcmFsLXJlZGRpdC1tZXRhLW1lbWUtZXhwbGFpbmVkLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Meme is From the Future - Among Us: The viral Reddit meta meme explained,"Advertisement

Among Us is an online multiplayer game developed and published by Innersloth. Enjoying massive popularity by Android users the 2D co-op game has become one of the most played games on the Play Store. However as the game keeps on getting more love from the players developers keep rolling out new updates. Similarly a new Among Us update - the Airship update - was rolled out on March 31 2021. Among Us is so popular in fact that it has created hundreds of viral memes on Reddit. One such meme called 'This meme is from the future' became highly popular. Read on now about 'this meme is from the future'.

The Origins of 'This Meme is From the Future'

I have seen this image on my TL like 5 times all by separate people and all with thousands of likes pic.twitter.com/swdDskH9VH — Lia (@liaaposting)

The Among Us meme - 'This meme is from the future' has been trending a lot on social media sites recently. Essentially it's a meta meme telling the viewers that this meme is from the future and if you're not from the future you won't find it funny because you're not aware of the context for the meme. The meme originated on Reddit and went viral on different social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter. The reason for the popularity of this meme is because it's linked to Among Us which is very viral and the generation Z humour is so strange that this meme perfectly fits into it.

Among Us Update - Airship Map

Among Us is free on Android and iOS devices. All players need to do to get access to the map is just update their game. After updating the Among Us Airship map will be available free to play. Innersloth also made a lot of changes to the game and shared on their official blog posts what changes they are planning to make in the future. In their official blog Innersloth mentioned that they have plans to completely update the art style with cleaner lines and an easier animation process.

They also mentioned that they are planning to increase the lobby size to 15 players in future updates and that they want to keep giving more regular and transparent updates to the players. Here are the patch notes for Among Us Airship update. As you can see in the embedded tweet above the image originally comes with the caption 'Me IRL' which translates to 'Me in real life.' How it's linked to the meme is a mystery as the meme is (supposedly) from the future.

This free map update includes:

The 4th map and the biggest one yet - The Airship

New tasks including jewel polishing emptying the trash (wow fun) and more

The ability to pick the room you start in

All new areas to explore (or get murdered in)

Improved mobility with ladders and moving platforms

New free hats including a heart pin angry eyebrows unicorn head rubber glove and more!

Note: minimum system requirements for mobile will be iOS 13 and Android 6

“I feel like I’m in quicksand” she explained by phone from California where she has been under quasi-house arrest for the last year. “I’m just so exhausted all the time. I’m doing so much less than I normally do — I’m not traveling I’m not entertaining I’m just sitting in front of my computer — but I am accomplishing way less. It’s like a whole new math. I have more time and fewer obligations yet I’m getting so much less done.”

Call it a late-pandemic crisis of productivity of will of enthusiasm of purpose. Call it a bout of existential work-related ennui provoked partly by the realization that sitting in the same chair in the same room staring at the same computer for 12 straight months (and counting!) has left many of us feeling like burned-out husks dimwitted approximations of our once-productive selves.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Traffic inside Las Vegas casinos is picking up again but it’s not all driven by young travelers with pent-up demand.

Casino operators say customers 65 and over have started to return spurred by the growing availability of COVID-19 vaccines across the country.

“As more of the older end of the customer spectrum receives vaccines and becomes more comfortable with leaving their houses … that for sure means they’ll start to step out and go back to their favorite casinos again” said gaming consultant Josh Swissman of The Strategy Organization.

‘Starting to trickle back in’

Bob Bransdon a 68-year-old Las Vegas local said he used to visit casinos with his wife about once a week. Then the shutdowns came.

The two spent months away from casinos while they were closed and continued to avoid the properties after their June reopenings out of caution. They weren’t alone: The pandemic had led to a sharp decline in casino visitation from the 65-plus age group which is more susceptible to severe illness tied to COVID-19.

That could be turning around. Bransdon who started visiting casinos again in August said he has noticed an uptick in the 65-and-older crowd especially in the afternoons. He said the numbers aren’t what they were before the pandemic but there is “no shortage of people there.”

Some casino operators have noticed the uptick too. Several executives discussed the trend in recent weeks during the latest round of casino companies’ earnings calls.

“We’re beginning to see that part of the database that 65 and older if you will database starting to trickle back in” Golden Entertainment Chairman and CEO Blake Sartini said during a March 11 call. “We see that as a great catalyst going forward.”

The heads of other Las Vegas casino operators — including Red Rock Resorts Inc. Boyd Gaming Corp. and Penn National Gaming Inc. — also have said they have started to notice that this age group is rebounding.

“I think up until very recently that the 65-year-plus demographic has been fairly shy about coming back to the facility” Frank Fertitta III CEO of Red Rock Resorts said during a February call with investors. “If the vaccine has continued ramp-up and rollout we are cautiously optimistic that we’re starting to see the 65-plus demographic slowly return back to our facility.”

One of the major driving forces behind this demographic’s return has been the rollout of vaccinations. As of Friday 22.4 percent of American adults had been fully vaccinated according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of those vaccinations have gone toward those in older age groups with 53.5 percent of Americans 65 and older fully vaccinated.

Jo Ann Woodward 72 has not yet received a vaccine but that hasn’t stopped the Phoenix resident from making her regular Las Vegas trips.

Woodward has made two solo trips to Las Vegas during the pandemic and plans to return in April. By that time she hopes to be vaccinated — she’s waiting to receive a Johnson & Johnson vaccine so she can have a “one and done” shot — and she expects more friends will be ready to join her once they’ve all had shots in arms.

“They think that now that they’ve had the vaccine they’re immune (from the virus) and they can go wherever they want” she said. “I probably will have more people that want to go with me when I’m vaccinated.”

More confidence to venture outside the home paired with pent-up demand is good news for casinos according to Stifel analyst Steve Wieczynski.

“We expect a significant amount of pent-up demand from the (55 and older) demographic as vaccinations kick in and the country slowly goes back to normal” he said in a Feb. 25 note.

Spokespeople for the two of the six largest casino operators in Las Vegas — Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp. — did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for Boyd MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment Inc. declined to comment and a Red Rock spokesman referred to comments made by executives during the latest earnings calls.

A lucrative customer

The fact that any age group is coming back to Las Vegas is “huge” said gaming consultant Debi Nutton but the 65-plus demographic can be especially lucrative.

“Your kids are off to college; you’ve established yourself in your career” she said of the age group. “They have more discretionary income.”

According to a 2019 report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority baby boomers spent more than millennials in nearly every category including food and drink transportation shopping and sightseeing. They also spent far more on gambling budgeting an average of $838.20 per trip compared with millennials’ $350.47.

“You’re talking about a majority of the (casinos’) customer base” said Clyde Barrow a gaming industry expert and professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. “Certainly for the core (gambling customer) the table games and the slot machines. Maybe not so much for the clubs and the concerts the pool parties and those things.”

Those spending habits should carry forward in 2021. Management at Red Rock Resorts said they believe older customers have plenty of discretionary spending after months of lockdowns and limited entertainment options.

“They seem to be in pretty good shape from a financial standpoint because they just haven’t been spending their money. There’s a lot of disposable income there” said Lorenzo Fertitta vice chairman of Red Rock’s board during the company’s earnings call. “They’re anxious to come back.”

This crowd also could help solve one of the greatest challenges Las Vegas resorts have faced since the onset of the pandemic: filling rooms midweek.

Midweek occupancy rates aren’t expected to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon — conventions probably will need to make a full comeback before that can happen — but UNLV Assistant Professor of Hospitality Amanda Belarmino said as far as midweek leisure travel goes older customers lead the pack.

Their return is “highly significant for Las Vegas” she said. “They’re retired. They have that flexibility to travel midweek.”

Convergence of young and old

Virginia Valentine president of the Nevada Resort Association said the state’s resorts are “excited” to welcome back more guests as vaccines roll out and people feel more comfortable traveling.

“Those guests 65 years and older have had earlier access to the vaccine and we would anticipate their return as they feel more comfortable venturing out and resuming activities they enjoy” she said. “Our members value this customer segment and we’re happy to have them back.”

Boyd Gaming which has started to see its older core customers return expects the trend to broaden in the second and third quarters according to a March 11 note from J.P. Morgan based on conversations with Boyd CEO Keith Smith and CFO Josh Hirsberg.

The operators’ challenge will be figuring out how to attract older gamblers while also keeping their newer younger gamblers interested in returning. It’ll be easier said than done especially as other entertainment options such as clubs and shows reopen and vie for the attention of younger crowds.

“Most operators believe that as events movie theaters restaurants open up that younger customer could be fleeting” Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon said.

But online offerings could help gaming companies earn the loyalty of these newer younger customers even as other entertainment venues open their doors Beynon said.

“Given the convergence of land and digital — with online and land-based (betting) — these customers may appreciate that a little bit more” he said. “They’ll spend money online betting on a sports game but then maybe go to the land-based property that’s tied in with that asset.”

If the Avs have a similarly spectacular April look for the club to win the Presidents’ Trophy for the third time — and first since the Stanley Cup-winning team in 2001.

The Presidents’ Trophy goes to the NHL team with the best regular-season record securing home-ice advantage throughout the playoffs and paying $350000 split between all team personnel. The Avs entered Friday tied with the Vegas Golden Knights for the league’s third-highest winning percentage of .714 behind the Carolina Hurricanes (.729) and Tampa Bay Lightning (.722) the defending Stanley Cup champs.

But none of those teams have been as dominant lately as Colorado which entered the weekend on a 12-game points streak (10-0-2) — the first time the club has gone 12 games without a regulation loss since 2007. And no team in the league has been as good at both ends of the ice all season even during a 3-3 start.

Colorado entered Friday ranked first in shots per game (35.3) and shots against (25.1). The last team to lead the NHL in both was the 2009-10 Blackhawks who went on to win the Stanley Cup.

This team could be destined to win its third Stanley Cup and first in 20 years.

In Wednesday’s 9-3 rout of Arizona the Avs reached 50 points in 35 games — tying the 2001 Cup-winning team with the fewest games to 50 points.

Winning the Presidents’ Trophy doesn’t often lead to winning the Stanley Cup however. Since the Avs won both in 2001 just three of the next 18 Presidents’ Trophy winners went on to hoist the Cup — the 2002 and ’08 Detroit Red Wings and the 2013 Chicago Blackhawks.

But make no mistake every team in contention wants to win the Presidents’ Trophy because every playoff advantage helps. And at this rate I suspect the Avs will win the trophy or come darn close — and at least win the West Division over rival Vegas.

It’s all up to April when Colorado plays 10 of 16 games on the road. The Avs are 8-4-2 outside Denver including 4-1-1 in their last six games. They have just five games in May before the playoffs begin.

What happened in March is bound to continue in April because this team has a strong understanding of how good it is when everyone is pulling in the same direction.

“It was great” Avs coach Jared Bednar said of his team’s 12-2-3 record and overall play in March. “I think you’re looking at the month before it happens and you got to make hay while the sun shines when you’re home and healthy. I thought we did that. We took care of what we had to for the month of March.”

After this weekend’s two-game set against St. Louis at Ball Arena the Avs have just 19 remaining games. The regular-season finale is May 8 at Los Angeles.

The Presidents’ Trophy could be the last thing this team wins before the playoffs.

On Friday Bednar didn’t mention the trophy but reiterated that anything less than winning the Stanley Cup won’t be good enough. Bednar in his fifth year as Colorado’s bench boss entered Friday just eight wins shy of tying Bob Hartley for the most wins by a head coaching in the club’s history (359).

“We’ve slowly gotten better in the time we’ve been here so it’s been a fun five years so far but the ultimate is still out there” he said. “We’re trying to bring a Stanley Cup to the city of Denver and to our fans. That’s what we’re trying to do here and anything less than that in my time here will be a disappointment.”",,,,,,

A temporary shutdown in the production of silicon computer chips at the start of the coronavirus pandemic as well as severe storms in Texas causing more recent delays has caused worldwide chip shortages with a knock-on effect for the production of phones laptops and even automobiles.

Samsung which is the largest manufacturer of computer chips in the world as well as one of the biggest users has said the chip shortage comes amid rising demand for consumer electronics during the pandemic.

“There’s a serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips in the IT sector globally” the company’s co-chief executive Koh Dong-jin said.

Samsung has indicated it could delay the release of the next Galaxy Note smartphone until 2022 as a result of the shortage.

Apple the world’s biggest buyer of chips was one of the worst affected companies delaying the launch of the iPhone 12 last year as a result.

A winter storm in Texas in February forcing several chip factories to temporarily halt production amid power outages did not help with the ongoing crisis.

Manufacturers are slowly increasing capacity to meet demand but there are still growing shortages in products that need semiconductors to function from televisions and phones to the new Xbox and PlayStation video game consoles.

“Covid-19 has had two major impacts on the availability of computers through the initial closure of factories and then the global surge including in Australia for new computers and IT equipment” the Australian Information Industry Association’s general manager of policy and advocacy Simon Bush said.

The association estimates delays in large IT orders for business and government of at least six to eight weeks.

The demand for chips is now starting to have a flow-on impact on a range of industries. The government-owned company rolling out Australia’s $57bn National Broadband Network (NBN) had to stop connecting new customers via its cable technology in February because it had a fast-dwindling supply of modems it had been unable to replace.

This week the company announced it would resume orders for new connections to the cable service from May 24 – nearly four months after the pause. In that time NBN Co has connected 230 medically-vulnerable customers to the NBN as a priority using the remaining supply.

More modems began being received in early March but the company now needs to work on a backlog of 31000 orders before new orders can be taken.

“We are confident that we will receive regular deliveries of new HFC modems in the weeks and months ahead to enable the resumption of new HFC connections from 24 May 2021” NBN’s chief customer officer Brad Whitcomb said.

Adding fuel to the fire at the start of the pandemic car manufacturers cancelled their orders for semiconductors as a result of poor car sales as people opted against buying cars while in lockdowns across the globe.

The semiconductor manufacturers quickly used that excess supply to meet the increasing demand for personal electronic devices but as sales of new cars have since started to rebound car manufacturers have struggled to find the chips required.

The director of innovation and strategic engagement at Australia’s Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries Peter Griffin said some manufacturers might have a stockpile and stock was beginning to improve but there could be delays in new cars being available in Australia for the months ahead.

“If you’re missing something you just can’t make the car and hence you’ve got the delay” he said. “And there is generally some time between an order being made in the dealership to delivery to production but in some cases that has stretched to quite a few months depending on the vehicle depending where it’s coming from.”

Cars are not manufactured in Australia meaning orders will need to arrive from overseas. According to Bloomberg several companies including Ford Toyota Nissan and General Motors have made changes to their production as a result of the ongoing superconductor shortages.

Electric car manufacturer Tesla said in February it was still determining the impact of the shortage.

US consulting firm AlixPartners has estimated the shortage could cost carmakers US$61bn (A$82bn) in lost revenue this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzcG9zdC5pZS9uZXdzLWZvY3VzL3RoZS1jaGlwcy1hcmUtdXAtaG93LWlyaXNoLWNvbXBhbmllcy1hcmUtY2FzaGluZy1pbi1vbi10aGUtbWljcm9jaGlwLXJ1c2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The chips are up: How Irish companies are cashing in on the microchip rush,"Amid a global shortage of microchips the EU and China are seeking to wrestle back control of their supply chains.

At approximately 5:21 PM EST on Thursday Microsoft experienced a global outage that prevented users from accessing or signing into numerous services including Xbox Live Microsoft Office SharePoint Online Microsoft Intune Dynamics 365 Microsoft Teams Skype Exchange Online OneDrive Yammer Power BI Power Apps OneNote Microsoft Managed Desktop and Microsoft Streams.

The service was so wide-spread within Microsoft's infrastructure that even their Azure status page which is used to provide outage info was inaccessible.

Microsoft's eventually resolved the outage at approximately 6:30 PM EST with some services taking a bit longer to function again properly.

At the time Microsoft stated that the outage was caused by a DNS issue but did not provide further information.

Azure DNS service became overloaded

Last night Microsoft published a root cause analysis (RCA) for this week's outage and explained that it was caused by their Azure DNS service becoming overloaded.

Microsoft's Azure DNS is a global network of redundant name servers that provides high availability and fast DNS services.

According to Microsoft the Azure DNS service began receiving an ""anomalous surge"" of DNS queries from all over the world that were targeting certain domains hosted on Azure. While Microsoft does not explain what this anomalous surge was it may have been a DDoS attack targeting certain domains.

Microsoft states that their DNS service could typically handle a large number of requests through DNS caches and traffic shaping. However a code defect prevented their DNS Edge caches from working correctly.

""Azure DNS servers experienced an anomalous surge in DNS queries from across the globe targeting a set of domains hosted on Azure. Normally Azure’s layers of caches and traffic shaping would mitigate this surge. In this incident one specific sequence of events exposed a code defect in our DNS service that reduced the efficiency of our DNS Edge caches.""

""As our DNS service became overloaded DNS clients began frequent retries of their requests which added workload to the DNS service. Since client retries are considered legitimate DNS traffic this traffic was not dropped by our volumetric spike mitigation systems. This increase in traffic led to decreased availability of our DNS service"" Microsoft explained in the RCA for this week's outage.

As almost all Microsoft domains are resolved through Azure DNS it was no longer possible to resolve hostnames on these domains and access associated services when the DNS service became overloaded.

For example the xboxlive.com domain uses the following Azure DNS name servers to resolve hostnames on this domain.

NS1-205.AZURE-DNS.COM NS2-205.AZURE-DNS.NET NS3-205.AZURE-DNS.ORG NS4-205.AZURE-DNS.INFO

Since xboxlive.com is hosted on Azure DNS and that service became unavailable users were no longer able to login to Xbox Live.

To prevent this type of outage in the future Microsoft states that they are repairing the code defect in Azure DNS so that the DNS cache can adequately handle large amounts of requests. They also plan on improving the monitoring and mitigations of anomalous traffic.

In response to our queries regarding the anomalous surge of DNS traffic Microsoft stated they had nothing further to share at this time.

Attacks on sensitive institutional data and personally identifiable information at universities across the country have risen sharply over the past year with one of the most recent data breached announced by the University of Colorado in early February. Such attacks can shut down a campus for days while vital systems are locked down and data restored.

To strengthen the security of CSU’s critical online infrastructure Central IT is expanding the existing DUO authentication for access to the university computer network to include Office 365 services and email.

“Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic attackers have increased their targeting of higher education and home workers” said Steve Lovaas security officer for the CSU System. “Phishing and other kinds of online fraud are up over 600% in the past year with email representing the most common vector for damaging attacks. The university our systems and all of our personal data are at risk.”

Access with trusted device

Anyone logging into the CSU network through the Pulse VPN from locations off campus has been required to use the DUO two-factor authentication for access since April 2018. With so many faculty and staff teaching and working remotely for the past year due to the pandemic nearly 95% of CSU employees have already registered a trusted device with DUO for secure network access.

Anyone who has a device registered with DUO will automatically receive email protection on June 1. Once you authenticate your account the first time you won’t be asked to do it again unless you log in from a different computer use a different internet browser or change your CSU password.

Anyone without DUO already set up on June 1 will not be protected automatically but you can add DUO protection to your email at any time. This fall you will be required to use DUO to access Office 365 email.

“DUO for two-factor authentication is an easy and increasingly familiar tool for reducing the most common and dangerous attacks” Lovaas explained. “Extending that protection to email will be only a small change for most users but it will have a significant effect on the safety of the CSU community.”

The majority of the CSU community already using two-factor authentication have registered the DUO mobile app on their mobile phones. To ensure continued access to email ACNS recommends registering an additional device such as an office or home phone a hardware token available from Ram Tech or a trusted individual’s phone number.

“If you lose misplace or simply forget your mobile device or change your mobile service having a second registered device will save the day” Lovaas said.

Don’t worry soon you will be able to mine cryptocurrencies with the power of your mind thanks to Microsoft. And no it’s not a late April Fools day joke.

According to documents from the World Intellectual Property Organization Microsoft has been working for at least one year to develop a system that harnesses the energy of the human body and uses it to mine cryptocurrencies.

The Human Body Could be A Natural Crypto Mining Rig

The patent called Cryptocurrency System Using Body Activity Data explains that the human body generates energy that is lost with each natural physical body function. Microsoft’s idea is to use precisely this energy and put it to productive use (Matrix-style)

“Instead of massive computation work required by some conventional cryptocurrency systems data generated based on the body activity of the user can be proof-of-work and therefore a user can solve the computationally difficult problem unconsciously.”

As in the Wachowskis’ “The Matrix” the mining process involves the user hooking up a number of sensors to different parts of the body to generate a reward when performing some activity either consciously or unconsciously.

For example the patent explains that the sensors could determine when a person is performing a specific task such as watching an advertisement or using an internet service. When the appropriate stimulus is registered the mining process could be activated rewarding the individual with tokens.

The report says that “body fluid flow” and “organ activity and movement” could be some of the examples of bodily functions that could trigger sensors and initiate cryptocurrency mining processes.

The Next Step in Human-to-Computer Interactions

The process looks pretty simple in essence. One of the patent’s graphics explains that an external entity generates the conditions for a given task – such as reading a Cryptopotato article in its entirety – and the person executing the task triggers the sensor which produces a response recorded in a hash.

If this hash satisfies a series of conditions determined in the system cryptocurrencies are awarded. Otherwise – the user did not read the entire article or jumped to another piece – the block is discarded and the process is restarted.

The patent explains that transactions would be recorded on a blockchain specifically designed for this purpose. It can be private or public but will involve a complex communication between the person a central computer or server that reads and processes the data and other systems responsible for propagating the information and verification of the information and transactions.

Who said crypto had no future?. Considering all the problems associated with PoW mining perhaps turning the human body into crypto a mining rig is not that crazy… Or is it?

One Year Later: What Has Changed?

A little over a year has passed since Microsoft introduced its spooky and mind-blowing patent. What has happened since then?

Well not much really. Microsoft has kept quiet and has not disclosed any details or progress on the project and in the absence of more data it’s likely that this is all just a corporate asset protection maneuver and the patent is just sitting in a corner somewhere in one of Microsoft’s basements.

Generally companies tend to apply for patents for products or services that are just in the concept stage regardless of whether they are functional or not. The reason is primarily to prevent any copyright damages.

In case any competitor wants to work in that field it will have to involve Microsoft in the process should it come dangerously close to infringing the patent.

What is certain is that the patent raised alarms in the community with reactions ranging from moral debates about the limit between the ethically acceptable and the possible methods to make money to warnings about a worldwide conspiracy associated with the antichrist.

Definitely the world of cryptocurrencies never surprises. Perhaps in the future hooking our bodies to a computer and get paid for watching ads will be perfectly normal but right now it is kind of scary.

However back in the 80s and 90s giving our private data to a corporation and storing our credit card information on a third-party server was also beyond the unthinkable. Now we do that just in exchange for the possibility to like a meme."

This updated version reflects research as of July 2021 suggesting that a single dose of the Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is not enough to reliably ward off infection. The recommendation remains to receive the full course of two shots.

Maybe you’ve postponed your second COVID-19 vaccine appointment whether because of scheduling hassles or general reluctance. But how safe are you after just a single dose?

As an immunologist I hear this question frequently – and the answer has changed as new genetic strains of the coronavirus become more common. By the beginning of July 2021 the delta variant had become the most dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the U.S.

The Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines weren’t designed specifically to ward off the delta variant. While overall they still provide excellent protection after the full two doses new research suggests a single dose provides less immunity against the coronavirus strains that are out there now than it did against the original strain.

Bottom line: Two shots are way better than one.

How well had the vaccines been working?

Soon after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was authorized in December 2020 researchers in Israel found that a single dose was highly effective in one medical center’s thousands of vaccinated health care workers. A single dose reduced the rate of infection by up to 85% after four weeks post-shot compared to those who were not vaccinated.

This real-world finding was consistent with an analysis of Pfizer’s clinical trial data reported in 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine. In that study the 52% protection from the first dose included infections that occurred in the first 12 days after vaccination when one would not expect the vaccine to have had time to generate protective antibodies.

Another real-world study of adults ages 70 and older conducted by Public Health England in early 2021 determined that a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine was 61% effective at preventing symptomatic disease 28 days after vaccination. Two doses increased effectiveness to 85%-90%.

So what’s changed?

Essentially it comes down to new variants. Scientists are particularly concerned about the delta variant because it appears to be especially contagious.

All of the vaccines for COVID-19 generate antibodies against the spike glycoprotein on the surface of the coronavirus. If you encounter the coronavirus after you’ve been vaccinated these antibodies protect you by binding to the spike on its surface preventing the virus from entering your cells to cause an infection.

The problem is that the delta variant can evade some – but not all – of the antibodies generated by the current vaccines.

How well do vaccines protect against delta so far?

It looks like the delta variant is relatively resistant to the anti-spike antibodies vaccination generates. This change is what makes it all the more important to get the second dose of an mRNA vaccine.

The first shot introduces your body to the virus’s spike protein so your immune system can start to produce targeted antibodies and immune cells. The second shot gives your body another chance to practice mounting that immune response against COVID-19. The second dose triggers the creation of more anti-spike antibodies and these are more effective at protecting you because they bind more tightly to the viral spike if they encounter it.

In a study published in the journal Nature in July researchers tested serum from the blood of 16 recent Pfizer vaccine recipients in France. After the first dose of the mRNA vaccine serum from only two of the 16 vaccinated people neutralized the delta variant of the virus. The good news though is that after the second vaccine dose serum from 15 out of 16 people neutralized the delta variant.

Out of the lab and in the real world Public Health England has collected data on all symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in the country in which the coronavirus was genetically sequenced. Of the 1054 cases of delta infection through the middle of May 2021 a preliminary analysis that has not yet been peer-reviewed found that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine was 33% effective at preventing symptomatic infection. Protection rose to 88% after two doses. Those protection levels for delta are lower than what they found for the older alpha variant: 51% effectiveness after dose one and 93% after dose two.

A smaller preliminary study from Canada that also has not yet been peer-reviewed identified a similar level of protection. In 165 people with delta infection researchers found 56% protection from symptomatic infection with one dose of Pfizer and 87% with two. Importantly researchers calculated that protection from hospitalization or death from delta after even a single dose was 78% for Pfizer and 96% for Moderna.

Am I protected?

You are well protected if you have completed your vaccination: two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna or the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. If you have had only one of the two required doses of the mRNA vaccines then you should finish vaccination by getting the second shot. That will raise your COVID-19 protection from what might be as low as 33% better than an unvaccinated person up to 90%.

The picture is more complicated if you are immunocompromised. Studies have found that some immunocompromised patients don’t produce antibodies after vaccination. In these cases some studies suggest that booster shots may offer hope with a third dose of an mRNA vaccine triggering a protective antibody response.

For mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 the CDC recommendation remains the same: For Pfizer get two doses 21 days apart and for Moderna get two doses 28 days apart. Sticking to the schedule and getting both doses means you will have very high levels of protection once your body has time to build immunity.

If you're getting vaccinated expect a sore arm.

Pain at the injection site is the most common side effect of all three coronavirus vaccines authorized in the US.

In general the vaccines produce mild to moderate side effects that shouldn't last more than a few days. Side effects typically show up within 12 to 24 hours of getting the shot. They're often a sign that the body is building immunity to the virus.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""It's important to remember: When people get side effects from vaccines it's not really because of the vaccine. It's more of the body's immune response to the vaccine"" Dr. Vivek Cherian an internal-medicine physician in Baltimore told Insider.

Scroll through the chart below to see which side effects are common based on your age group which manufacturer's vaccine you get and whether you're on dose one or two. In general older people experience fewer side effects than younger adults because immune responses gradually weaken with age. For Pfizer's and Moderna's two-shot vaccines the second shot amplifies an existing immune response so people typically feel more run-down after that dose.

Vaccines prompt our bodies to produce coronavirus antibodies. But since our immune systems can't distinguish between a real infection and a vaccine-induced response they still release inflammatory chemicals to protect us. That's why people can develop a fever muscle pain fatigue or headaches shortly after their shots.

Johnson & Johnson's shot has the fewest side effects

Across the board Johnson & Johnson's shot has milder and fewer side effects than the other two. Some experts suspect that's because it's a single shot.

Related stories

Nearly 62% of participants younger than 59 in Johnson & Johnson's trial reported side effects compared with 45% of people ages 60 and up.

That's relatively similar to the reported side effects after one dose of Moderna's vaccine: About 57% of people younger than 65 in that trial developed side effects compared with 48% of those older than 65. But after the second Moderna dose nearly 82% of people in the younger group reported side effects compared with nearly 72% of older adults.

But Johnson & Johnson's shot also seems to be less effective overall: Clinical trials suggest the vaccine is 66% effective at preventing COVID-19. Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines are each more than 90% effective. But it's difficult to compare the companies' trials side by side because they happened at different stages in the pandemic and in different geographic regions.

Common side effects include fatigue and headache

Once a vaccine goes into your arm your blood flow increases and immune cells rush to the scene. This can result in pain redness or swelling at the injection site.

The reaction is more common after Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines than after Johnson & Johnson's. Across all age groups less than 50% of participants in Johnson & Johnson's clinical trial reported pain at the injection site compared with 92% of Moderna participants and 84% of Pfizer participants.

Headache and fatigue were also relatively common across all the trials. About 63% of Moderna participants reported headaches compared with 55% of Pfizer participants and 39% of Johnson & Johnson's.

About 69% of people in Moderna's trial and 63% in Pfizer's reported fatigue. Just 38% of participants reported fatigue in Johnson & Johnson's trial but the prevalence of those side effects varied by age.

Younger adults had more side effects with a few exceptions

Just a few side effects appear to be equally as common among older participants as younger ones: After dose two of Pfizer's vaccine for instance joint paint was equally common in the two groups with about 22 to 23% reporting the effect.

Though older adults tend to have fewer side effects overall experts say there's no reason to believe vaccines won't work as well among them.

""For the COVID-19 vaccine we've actually not seen decreased effectiveness as we get older so that's actually a really good thing"" Cherian said.

And younger people shouldn't worry too much about feeling strong side effects he added.

""Dealing with a few side effects of some diarrhea or some muscle aches is a much much better thing to get than some of those serious potentially life-threatening side effects of the COVID-19 infection"" Cherian said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpaml0aW1lcy5jb20uZmovbW9kZXJuYS1nZXRzLW5vZC10by1zcGVlZC11cC12aXJ1cy12YWNjaW5lLW91dHB1dC13aXRoLWJpZ2dlci12aWFscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moderna gets nod to speed up virus vaccine output with bigger vials,"(Reuters) -The U.S. drug regulator gave Moderna Inc clearance to speed up output of its COVID-19 vaccine by letting it fill a single vial with up to 15 doses with the United States banking on rapid immunisation to stem the spread of the deadly virus.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also authorized vaccinators to extract a maximum of 11 doses from the current vials instead of the ten previously permitted.

In a statement Moderna said its vaccine can now can be supplied in vials containing 11 or 15 doses and it expected to begin shipping 15-dose vials in coming weeks.

“Both of these revisions positively impact the supply of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine which will help provide more vaccine doses to communities and allow shots to get into arms more quickly” Peter Marks director of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said.

However the regulator also warned that without proper syringes and needles it may not be possible to extract more that 13 doses from Moderna’s 15 dose vials and more than 10 doses from the current vials.

Moderna has supplied 100 million doses of its vaccine to the United States as of March 29. Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson’s shots are the other two vaccines approved in the country.

With rising cases and several states even lifting mask mandates and with more infectious variants also spreading health authorities are hoping that the contracts it struck with the currently approved vaccine makers will be enough for its entire population.

Construction of its Northeast Philly location is set to begin April 19. The venue will be built on 27 acres at the former Nabisco and Mondelez International factory at 1200 Roosevelt Boulevard.

Development at the King of Prussia site is set to commence this summer. The Montgomery County facility will be constructed on over 48 acres at the former American Baptist Churches USA headquarters at 588 North Gulph Road.

Both properties were sold to Topgolf by Provco a Villanova-based real estate company.

In preparation for Topgolf's arrival to Northeast Philly Provco put about $2 million into road improvements in the surrounding area. Among the improvements included the widening of roads and constructing a new turn lane.

The real estate company also developed a Wawa which opened two years ago and an additional 40000 feet of retail space. Leasing is underway for the rest of the space which is set to include a Chick-Fil-A.

Topgolf has become a popular spot for both scratch golfers and hackers to enjoy the game. The sports entertainment company has sought to make the game more accessible and fun by incorporating a lively atmosphere that consists of food and drinks TVs and music.

The three-story facilities make up roughly 68000 square feet and cost approximately $35 million to develop.

The chocolate industry: An Easter breakdown of who owns what

Since it's Easter time you've probably taken some time away from eating chocolate to visit the Motley Fool. I thought this might be a good opportunity to dive into the industry that is Easter chocolate. Investing doesn't have to take an Easter break after all!

So let's dive right into the chocolate pile

Chocolate all round

So according to a 2016 Roy Morgan survey (which is a few years old but our chocolate habits probably don't change too much) Australians favourite chocolate brands include the following: Cadbury Cherry Ripe Kit Kat Mars Bars Snickers Lindt Ferrero Rocher Freddo Frog Crunchie Boost Flake Twirl and Bounty.

Of these brands Cherry Ripe Freddo Frog Crunchie Boost and Twirl are all owned by Cadbury. It may not come as a surprise that Cadbury dominates our local chocolate industry.

Cadbury itself is a subsidiary of the US-listed food giant Mondelez International Inc (NASDAQ: MDLZ) despite its British roots. Mondelez also owns the Toblerone and Oreo brands.

Mars Bars Snickers and Bounty are all owned by Mars Incorporated. This company also American is one of the largest private companies in the world. So no Mars shares up for trading for us retail investors! Mars also owns the Wrigley's line of gum as well as the Eukanuba and Pedigree brands of pet food.

Kit Kat is owned by the Swiss company Nestle SA (SWX: NESN) which is the largest food company in the world. Nestle also owns Allen's lolly range as well as chocolates like Milky Bar Aero and Smarties.

Ferrero Rocher is owned by well Ferrero Group who also owns Kinder Suprise Nutella and Raffaello. Ferrero is also a private company but an Italian one.

And finally we have Lindt or Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Sprüngli AG (SWX: LISN) if you want its full name. Lindt is also a publically traded Swiss company. Its famous products are arguably the Lindor balls and gold bunnies which are a staple sight on supermarket shelves at Easter.

Foolish takeaway

Chocolate is a big business especially at this time of year. As such it's certainly interesting to see which companies dominate our Easter purchasing in Australia. No surprises to see the Swiss making their names felt. However it's interesting to explore the origins of brands like Mars Cadbury and Ferrero as well. Happy Easter!"

The spot price for U3O8 moved above $30 per pound for the first time this year as uranium producers and mine developers hoover up above-ground inventories and reactor construction continues apace.

Two new research notes from BMO Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley say today’s price marks a floor and predict a rally in prices over the next few years to the ~$50 level by 2024.

The stars seem to be aligning for a new phase of nuclear energy investment with the US China and Europe bolstering the bull case for the fuel this month.

Although nuclear energy was not mentioned explicitly in the $2 trillion Biden infrastructure proposal released today its federally mandated “energy efficiency and clean electricity standard” is hardly achievable without it.

Source: Cameco

Over the weekend leaked documents showed a panel of experts advising the EU is set to designate nuclear as a sustainable source of electricity which opens the door for new investment under the continent’s ambitious green energy program.

China’s 14th five-year plan released a fortnight ago also buoyed the uranium market with Beijing planning to up the country’s nuclear energy capacity by 46% – from 48GW in 2020 to 70GW by 2025.

There are several factors working in uranium’s favour not least the fact that annual uranium demand is now above the level that existed before the 2011 Fukushima disaster when Japan shut off all its reactors:

Uranium miners developers and investment funds like Yellow Cake (13m lbs inventory build up so far) are buying material on the spot market bringing to more normal levels government and utility inventories built up over the last decade

Major mines are idled including Cameco’s Cigar Lake (due to covid-19) which accounts for 18m lbs or 13% of annual mine supply. The world’s largest uranium operation McArthur River was suspended in July 2018 taking 25m lbs off the market

Permanent closures so far this year include Rio Tinto’s Ranger operation in Australia (3m lbs) and Niger’s Cominak mine (2.6m lbs) which had been in operation since 1978. Rio is exiting the market entirely following the sale of Rössing Uranium in Namibia

Like Cameco top producer Kazatomprom which mined 15% less material last year due to covid restrictions has committed to below capacity production (–20% for the state-owned Kazakh miner) for the foreseeable future

Price reporting agency and research company UxC estimates that utilities’ uncovered requirements would balloon to some 500m lbs by 2026 and 1.4 billion lbs by 2035

Roughly 390m lbs are already locked up in the long term market while 815m lbs have been consumed in reactors over the last five years according to UxC

There are 444 nuclear reactors in operation worldwide and another 50 under construction – 2 new connections to the grid and one construction start so far in 2021

Much cheaper and safer small modular nuclear power reactors which can readily slot into brownfield sites like decommissioned coal-fired plants (or even underground or underwater) are expected to become a significant source of additional demand.

There are caveats to this rosy scenario however.

Morgan Stanley warns that “the opacity of the inventory situation remains a key uncertainty to price – see for example palladium which needed almost 7 years of deficit before the price really took off.”

BMO says given the still high levels of inventories “acute shortages and price squeezes are extremely unlikely both for this year and the foreseeable future” adding that “there is no obvious need for new mine supply in the near future.”

It Fell Apart in Days. (Published 2021),"Until recently Bill Hwang sat atop one of the biggest — and perhaps least known — fortunes on Wall Street. Then his luck ran out.

Mr. Hwang a 57-year-old veteran investor managed $10 billion through his private investment firm Archegos Capital Management. He borrowed billions of dollars from Wall Street banks to build enormous positions in a few American and Chinese stocks. By mid-March Mr. Hwang was the financial force behind $20 billion in shares of ViacomCBS effectively making him the media company’s single largest institutional shareholder. But few knew about his total exposure since the shares were mostly held through complex financial instruments called derivatives created by the banks.

That changed in late March after shares of ViacomCBS fell precipitously and the lenders demanded their money. When Archegos couldn’t pay they seized its assets and sold them off leading to one of the biggest implosions of an investment firm since the 2008 financial crisis.

Almost overnight Mr. Hwang’s personal wealth shriveled.

The Wall Street behemoth plans to offer the financial product to clients in its private wealth management group that targets high-net-worth individuals families and endowments with at least $25 million to invest according to CNBC.

Mary Rich the newly-named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division says the bank wants to eventually offer a “full spectrum” of investments in BTC and other cryptocurrencies amid rising demand for the emerging asset class.

“We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients and that is something we expect to offer in the near term.”

People familiar with the matter reveal that the bank is now securing the green light from regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the New York Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS).

Rich tells CNBC that their clients are seeking exposure to Bitcoin both as a hedge against inflation amid a turbulent macroeconomic backdrop and as an asset that may be at the forefront of a technological revolution.

The report comes as another banking giant Morgan Stanley reveals in a filing with the SEC that 12 of its mutual funds may indirectly invest in the leading cryptocurrency through cash-settled futures contracts and Grayscale’s Bitcoin trust. Rich says Goldman Sachs is looking to offer similar Bitcoin investment funds.

“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be but I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

And while some companies look to compete for a piece of viewers' wallets there's a growing preference toward free ad-supported video-on-demand services or AVODs.

There are several big media companies in the AVOD space: ViacomCBS (NASDAQ: VIAC) bought Pluto TV in 2019 Fox (NASDAQ: FOX) (NASDAQ: FOXA) acquired Tubi last year and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) launched Peacock last summer. But Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) has managed to attract an audience much faster than the traditional media companies and it's poised to stay in the lead.

63 million viewers and counting

Roku launched The Roku Channel in 2017. That's well after Pluto TV (2013) and Tubi (2014) came to market but the timing couldn't have been better. Cord-cutting was accelerating at the same time prices for subscription video-on-demand services started climbing.

Since The Roku Channel's launch the company has tripled the number of active accounts using its connected-TV devices to 51 million. In 2020 management said Roku Channel viewers were growing twice as fast as its overall platform. Indeed Roku Channel viewers grew more than 100% while active accounts increased ""just"" 39% for the year.

The company continued growing viewership quickly in the final months of 2020 jumping from an estimated 54 million viewers at the end of the third quarter to 63 million by the end of the year.

Growing faster than the competition

While all AVOD services saw a big jump in viewership in 2020 The Roku Channel performed exceptionally well.

Tubi which ended 2020 with 33 million monthly active users said viewership increased 58% last year. Pluto TV's monthly active users grew 80% globally and 34% in the United States.

The analysts at eMarketer believe Roku will keep pace with its now-smaller competitors in 2021. The research firm expects U.S. viewers for Roku to climb another 19% this year while Tubi and Pluto TV viewership will rise 20% and 17% respectively.

Comcast says Peacock signed up 33 million accounts by the end of 2020. But internal data seen by The Information suggests just 11 million households are regularly watching content on the new streaming service.

Adding lots of content

The big media companies are adding lots of content to their AVOD services.

Fox now distributes some of its broadcast content like The Masked Singer shortly after it originally airs on its network. Likewise Pluto TV has added a lot of old Viacom content since the big media company bought the streaming service a couple years ago. Both are also exploring the potential for original content on their platforms.

Comcast hopes to improve engagement this summer with exclusive content from the Olympic Games. The sporting event was meant to be at the center of its launch campaign but COVID-19 had other plans.

Meanwhile Roku has aggressively negotiated for additional content on The Roku Channel as part of its distribution agreements for premium streaming services on its connected-TV platform. It's also starting to license original content for the AVOD service. CEO Anthony Wood says the growth of The Roku Channel creates a virtuous cycle where it's able to invest in more and better content which in turn draws in more viewership so it's quite possible The Roku Channel's growth could continue to outpace the competition in 2021.

Winning ad dollars

Racking up a bunch of viewers with a growing content library is one thing. It's another for Roku to take on media giants like Fox ViacomCBS and Comcast in advertising sales.

But the company has been building up its advertising capabilities for years. It acquired Dataxu in 2019 and recently made a deal to buy Nielsen's ad technology. The two businesses position Roku to sell ads beyond its own streaming service or connected-TV platform. It can place ads on other digital properties and even linear TV just like the traditional media companies.

While it might not have as much inventory to sell on linear TV as competitors with broadcast networks it can offer marketers the ability to reach unique audiences in streaming with its audio content recognition technology. What's more Roku is less likely to cannibalize its ad sales with streaming video ads like Fox ViacomCBS or Comcast.

So while the big media companies are growing AVOD services to move ad revenue from one bucket to another Roku's taking share of the overall television advertising market. As more TV advertising moves from linear to digital that advantage will become extremely important.

DoubleDown Interactive LLC a South Korean social casino game publisher has resumed its Nasdaq listing process tapping the red-hot US IPO market with improved earnings amid the social distancing trend.The mobile and web-based game developer recently submitted a revised Form F-1 a statement required for a US listing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.The revised statement updated its financial details filed in June 2020 reflecting a 44% year-on-year surge in net profit on a 32.6% increase in revenue last year according to investment banking sources on Apr. 2.DoubleDown Interactive plans to sell 400000 new shares worth 117.4 billion won ($104 million) in June of this year based on which it will issue American depository receipts for overseas investors. Details about the issuance size and pricing will be determined after bookbuilding.In July of last year the company shelved its Nasdaq listing plans after a lukewarm response at the height of the global pandemic. Its then aborted IPO was priced at $15.6 per share below its proposed $17-$19 range. Accordingly the game company cut its IPO size by more than half to $86 million before eventually postponing it.But the atmosphere has changed since the start of this year following South Korea's No. 2 e-commerce platform Coupang Corp's $4.6 billion IPO on the New York Stock Exchange last month . Its spectacular US listing and the buoyant IPO market prompted other Korean startups including premium food delivery company Kurly Inc.  to follow suit.Now DoubleDown is expected to raise its price band above last year's indicative range as well as the size of its offering. It was one of the beneficiaries of the stay-at-home trend racking up 64.8 billion won in net profit on revenue of 423 billion won last year.Applying the gaming industry's average price-to-earnings ratio of 30 DoubleDown could be valued at around 2 trillion won higher than its projection of 1.2 trillion won last year. That compares to the 950 billion won bill paid by DoubleU Games Co. listed on South Korea's Kospi to take over the casino gaming company in 2017.Seoul-based STIC Investments is likely to lock in hundreds of millions of dollars in proceeds from its divestment of the game publisher. STIC financed the 2017 purchase of DoubleDown with an investment of 300 billion won. Now the investment firm controls 32.3% of DoubleDown after converting the latter's bonds into new shares in May 2020.JPMorgan and Macquarie Capital are joint bookrunners of DoubleDown with Citibank in charge of floating ADRs based on DoubleDown's domestic shares.Ye-Jin Jun at ace@hankyung.com Yeonhee Kim edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jYmouY29tL25ld3Mvd2Vla2x5LW5ld3MvaW50ZXJsaW5rLWVsZWN0cm9uaWNzLXVwbGlzdHMtbmFzZGFxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interlink Electronics Uplists to Nasdaq,"Irvine-based sensor maker Interlink Electronics Inc. started trading on the Nasdaq late last month joining other Orange County tech-oriented companies looking to raise more money from the public markets.



The company’s shares (Nasdaq: LINK) had been trading on the over-the-counter market before the Nasdaq debut.



The uplisting “will provide significant benefits including increased visibility of the company amongst investors increased access to capital and potential for greater liquidity” according to Steve Bronson president and chief executive officer of Interlink whose manufacturing sensors are used in the automotive medical industrial and robotics fields among other sectors. The company’s products include sensor components sub-assemblies and modules.



The application of its Human Machine Interface technology platforms are used in vehicle entry vehicle multimedia control interface rugged touch controls presence detection collision detection speed and torque controls biological monitoring and other applications.



Interlink Electronics shares rose swiftly after the March 25 debut giving the company a market cap that has been hovering a little over $100 million. The company had said previously that fourth-quarter net revenue was $1.9 million up 15% from the prior year period while net income for the quarter was $53000.

Raise Capital



“We envision that we’ll use our stock as currency i.e. either raise capital and-or part of consideration in a future acquisition” Bronson told the Business Journal on March 26 the day after the trading start.



“We are definitely committed to doing acquisitions where it makes sense” Bronson told the Business Journal.



“I would say over the next 12 months we will definitely be pursuing an acquisition.”



Bronson said his goal is to make the company “substantially larger than where we are today.”



Interlink is just the latest in tech and tech-related company from Orange County with an eye on major market listings.



On March 25 the same day that Interlink started Nasdaq trading TV maker and media company Vizio Holding Corp. (NYSE: VZIO) in Irvine began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company counts a market cap of more than $4 billion after closing out 2020 with net income of $102.5 million.



Ad tech company Viant Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: DSP) also in Irvine went public on Feb. 10 and had a market cap of around $2.9 billion as of last week.



Automobile tech-focused Indie Semiconductor in Aliso Viejo says it foresees becoming a publicly listed company via the SPAC route “in early spring” with a valuation of $1.4 billion.



“The common link is they plan to raise additional capital to support the growth plans’’ Bronson told the Business Journal. “We’re in an overall strong market.”



Looking further Movandi Corp.’s new chief financial officer Bill Ruehle says he foresees a possible IPO for the wireless technology company while a buyout by another company is also possible; see last week’s print edition of the Business Journal for more.",,,,,,

The streaming service has reached a near-ubiquitous status in our current culture finding its way into more than 200 million homes around the world and driving discussion about TV on a weekly basis. By now it’s not a question of whether or not you have access to Netflix. It’s not even a question of if you’re going to watch Netflix. It’s merely a question of what you’re going to sample on the service this month.

In 2021 the query is growing all the more variable. Acquired staples like “The Office” and “The West Wing” are gone forcing viewers to replace their perma-loop series and the pandemic disrupted Netflix’s routine release of many favorite recurring originals. (When will we see “Ozark” Season 4? Not in April!) Netflix itself seems focused on new shows anyway whether it’s the constant sampling of experimental content (like docuseries that interpret the dictionary or soothing sounds that double as mental health exercises) or the now-regular axe-drop on shows that have hit their third or fourth season.

So each month IndieWire is going to help. Our long-running monthly list of the best new Netflix shows aims to sort through the heaping stack of content thrust upon subscribers and provide clarity into each buzzy series. Maybe it’s a new season maybe it’s a new series; either way we want to help shed a little light on how it came to be who’s the target audience and why you might be hearing about it in the weeks ahead. Each month IndieWire will share whatever insights we have into each new show all to better help you choose what to watch. So read on for this month’s Netflix’s picks and be sure to scroll through to the bottom to see a full list of releases.

1. “Shadow and Bone” (available Friday April 23)

Why Would I Watch? If you’re a fantasy fan — or intrigued by the various attempts to launch new TV and film universes — then “Shadow and Bone” should catch your eye. Adapted from Leigh Bardugo’s adventure novel of the same name the new series follows an orphan with extraordinary powers who joins an army of magical soldiers in the hopes of stopping a monstrous force called… “the Shadow Fold.” The first trailer for the series plays like fantasy gobbledygook where Jessie Mei Li’s lead can create life-saving light to fight back literal darkness but one can assume things will make more sense after a few hourlong episodes than after a two-minute preview. This is after all part of the “Grishaverse.” (No this is not John Grisham’s cinematic universe sorry.)

Bonus Reason: Eric Heisserer serves as showrunner and writer for the eight-episode first season and while the showrunner is typically an integral figure toward determining a series’ success or failure this one is even more intriguing. Heisserer wrote the screenplay for “Arrival” one of the trickier adaptations out there: It ended up on The Black List before Denis Villeneuve turned it into a blockbuster hit and Heisserer landed an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. Since then he wrote the screenplay for Netflix’s 2018 breakout “Bird Box” as well as the Vin Diesel sci-fi dud “Bloodshot” but the man clearly has good insights into turning the written word into an affecting screenplay. Let’s see what he can do with “Shadow and Bone.”

2. “Life in Color with David Attenborough” (available Thursday April 22)

Why Would I Watch? When “Planet Earth” first premiered the BBC docuseries earned great acclaim for its majestic depictions of our planet’s natural beauties unparalleled footage of exotic species and insightful discussion of deteriorating environments. It was also an instant favorite among potheads. The soothing pace vivid colors and David Attenborough’s gentle narration — combined with the rise in HDTV and Blu-ray — made for a decadent experience when stoned or so I’ve been told and now 15 years dozens of nature docs and 36 states offering legal medicinal weed later Netflix is leaning into the doc’s original allure with “Life in Color” a three-part nature docuseries narrated by Attenborough and featuring “revolutionary camera technology created specifically for the series” that allows viewers to “experience how colors invisible to the human eye play a vital role in animal interactions.” It is literally a nature docuseries about never-before-seen colors. I mean this is going to be great. It is going to be great. Prepare accordingly.

Bonus Reason: Life remains stressful. Any time that be devoted to appreciating the beauty of the outside world and reminding us to do our part to preserve it is time well spent. So take a break turn on “Life in Color” and let the dulcet tones of David Attenborough whisk you away to a better place.

3. “Kingdom” Seasons 1 – 3 (no longer available after Friday April 30)

Why Would I Watch? Our love for “Kingdom” should be pretty clear by now but in case you missed past recommendations know this: Byron Balasco’s MMA series is an exquisitely acted and rousingly produced family drama borrowing the best bits from “Friday Night Lights” and “Warrior” to create one of the most compelling hourlong shows of TV’s latest golden age. Now you might be asking “If it’s that good why haven’t I heard of it?” Well “Kingdom” only existed on DirecTV’s Audience Network before premiering on Netflix in July 2020 which means you could only watch it if you had a DirecTV subscription. Netflix righted that wrong last year but now it’s about to drop off the streamer — so don’t miss it. Who knows when you’ll have another chance to appreciate the gritty glory of Venice Beach fight culture?

Bonus Reason: People might be aware of a man named Nick Jonas. I don’t know. I’ve heard he sings a bit. But he’s also in “Kingdom” as the youngest member of the Kulina family and an up-and-coming fighter in his own right. Jonas not only has the physicality to play a convincing MMA member but he’s got the broody swagger of a young Ben McKenzie making him the perfect solemn foil to Jonathan Tucker’s outrageous older brother.

4. “Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!” Season 1 (available Wednesday April 14)

Why Would I Watch? If you can’t tolerate TV without Jamie Foxx then a) the last 20 years must’ve been a tough and b) I’ve got good news. “Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!” sees the Oscar winner leading a throwback multi-cam sitcom as Brian Dixon a successful business owner and single father to Sasha (Kyla-Drew) a teenager who just moved in with her dad after her mom passed away. Helping the new primary caregiver out are his dad (David Alan Grier) and sister (Porscha Coleman) completing a modern family ready to raise this young woman right. The new Netflix show is a broad comedy playfrom an actor who broke through in his self-titled sitcom “The Jamie Foxx Show” so get ready to see a comedian revisiting his roots (Foxx plays multiple characters) and a parent embracing their new role. (Corrine Foxx his daughter also serves as an executive producer.)

Bonus Reason: Further cementing Foxx’s nostalgia trip his new series is executive produced by Bentley Kyle Evans who also EP’d — you guessed it — “The Jamie Foxx Show.” (If you want a side-by-side comparison though you’ll have to subscribe to BET+ for streaming access to “The Jamie Foxx Show.”)

5. “The Circle” Season 2 (available Wednesday April 14)

Why Would I Watch? Netflix’s reality-competition series first premiered in the early days of the global pandemic and rode America’s lockdown to above-average buzz. Now we’ll see if “The Circle” — which essentially turns social media into a competition where contestants are isolated in their apartments and curate online personas to be judged by fellow players — can sustain interest beyond its awkward origins.

Bonus Reason: I mean “The Circle” basically creates a recorded bubble of many people’s daily lives. You get to judge people’s social media profiles only instead of getting trapped in a jealousy spiral while scrolling through a perfectly curated Instagram grid you can peak behind the curtain and see how these posters actually behave in real life. If that sounds fun to you by all means.

6. “The Serpent” Season 1 (available Friday April 2)

Why Would I Watch? For starters “The Serpent” is an eight-part limited series about a ‘70s era conman. It’s based on a true story and was shot on location in Thailand and the UK. If you’re a fan of the genre you should already be hooked — but just in case this original series was co-produced by the BBC which ensures a certain level of quality. We’ll let Steve Greene “The Recommendation Machine” cover the rest courtesy of his spoiler-free review: “What begins as an alias — the origins of which the audience sees in fits and starts as the series progresses — comes to encompass all of what allowed him to grow his intercontinental passport- and jewel-laundering scam ensnaring a growing net of murder victims and accomplices and enemies along the way. In the process the show surrounding him becomes a thorny biography with beguiling and cunning narrative choices alike.”

Bonus Reason: Tahar Rahim is a very good actor with a very strong screen presence and he should be working as often as he pleases. Those who’ve seen “Un Prophete” “The Last Panthers” “The Looming Tower” and “The Eddy” know what I’m talking about and hopefully anyone tempted into “The Serpent” then goes back to find these other gems.

7. “The Innocent” Season 1 (available Friday April 30)

Why Would I Watch? To date I have seen two adaptations of Harlan Coban novels. The first was the 2006 critical favorite “Tell No One” a French thriller about a man whose long-dead wife resurfaces shortly before he’s accused of a separate murder. The second was the 2018 Netflix limited series “Safe” which stars Michael C. Hall as a widower whose daughter’s disappearance sends him down an ever-deepening rabbit hole of local revelations. Both the film and the series start off with heavy drama and then build twists on top of twists until they reach largely satisfying conclusions. Is it fair to expect “The Innocent” to do the same? Maybe maybe not. Delivering a juicy gasp-inducing mystery time and time again isn’t easy but Coban has been pumping them out for years. Now it’s up to the creators of “The Innocent” to deliver one more stunner. (Full disclosure: There’s another Coban adaptation on Netflix already: “The Woods” a six-part limited series that hit the streamer in June 2020. I missed that one so now there are two “new” Cobans to catch up on! Oh boy!)

Bonus Reason: OK maybe you want to know what “The Innocent” is actually about. Per Netflix the new series follows Matt (Mario Casas) a newlywed trying to start his life over nine years after a jarring tragedy but his wife Olivia (Aura Garrido) gets a shocking call during a business trip that brings back the past — and this time he might not be found innocent. Ooo sounds wild. Let’s do this!

March TV

1. “Waffles + Mochi” (available March 16)

Why Would I Watch? Puppets and Michelle Obama are a pretty unbeatable combination but “Waffles + Mochi” offers far more imagination inspiration and flavorful insanity than that. Two best friends from The Land of Frozen Food are set free when Mrs. Obama opens a supermarket and needs two capable chefs to cook up diverse dishes for her new customers. So Waffle (who looks like a blue reptile that slithered inside a sheep) and Mochi (a pink rice cake by way of Lucy Sparrow) set off in their flying shopping cart to learn various recipes and cooking styles from around the globe.

Bonus Reason: If keeping your children occupied isn’t your primary motivation in choosing entertainment “Waffles + Mochi” offers a slew of fun cameos from famous faces including Jack Black Rashida Jones Zach Galifianakis Mandy Moore and Common not to mention chefs like Samin Nosrat and Massimo Bottura. Oh and did we mention Michelle Obama is the host? You’re gonna say no to Michelle Obama? Shut your mouth you are not.

2. “Last Chance U: Basketball” (available March 10)

Why Would I Watch? From the creators of “Last Chance U” (Football) and “Cheer”(leading) comes the basketball equivalent docuseries. The new eight-episode series follows an East Los Angeles community college squad filled with former Division I recruits and high-potential players who want to get to the next level of competition — and life. Coach John Mosley is there to help them but he’s on a mission himself. As with previous editions “Last Chance U” is about more than just winning. It’s about carving out a better life.

Bonus Reason: “Last Chance U” premieres Wednesday March 10. If you watch an episode every day you’ll be primed for the play-in round of the NCAA Tournament starting Thursday March 18 — and you’ll have plenty of time left in the lead-up to watch the conference tournaments and fill out your bracket. March Madness is the best time of year for basketball fans and now Netflix is here to make it even better.

3. “Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal” (available March 17)

Why Would I Watch? In 2019 Lori Laughlin and Felicity Huffman dominated headlines when federal prosecutors revealed an investigation into a criminal conspiracy that helped the uber-wealthy’s kids cheat their way into college. That investigation was called “Operation Varsity Blues” an abysmally uncool title for an absolutely wild scheme run by Rick Singer who illicitly placed children from more than 750 families into the universities of their choosing. Now director of “Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened” Chris Smith is blending interviews and recreations to show exactly how Singer pulled off the scandal for as long as he did. Matthew Modine will play the white-haired Newport CA criminal along with other stand-ins in scenes that recreate real recordings from FBI wiretaps. If you want to understand what happened beyond the headlines this doc is for you.

Bonus Reason: I mean who doesn’t like Matthew Modine?! “Full Metal Jacket”? “Vision Quest”? “Short Cuts”!? Look ‘em up.

4. “The One” Season 1 (available March 12)

Why Would I Watch? Speaking of illicit matching… what single person hasn’t thought in the midst of endless swiping or too many bad dates “God why can’t someone just tell me who I should be with?” “The One” based on John Marrs’ book is set a decade after a company claims it can match people with their best possible partner using one simple DNA sample. Millions have taken the test and coupled up but now secrets are spilling out. The company founder is being investigated. And bodies are turning up cold. “The One” looks like a “Black Mirror” episode extended into a serialized narrative but perhaps writer Howard Overman (“Misfits”) can make it work.

Bonus Reason: If you are asking yourself those questions “The One” looks like more of a cautionary tale than a dream scenario so maybe watching will put your restless mind at ease. Keep looking. The right partner is out there.

5. “Pacific Rim: The Black” Season 1 (available March 4)

Why Would I Watch? If you’re a “Pacific Rim” ride-or-die fan then you’ve likely already devoured all seven episodes of this anime pseudo-sequel but for those less enamored with Guillermo del Toro’s 2013 “robots vs. monsters” movie “The Black” offers a new way in. Set in the distant future after the Kaiju (giant Godzilla-like monsters) have risen from the ocean and taken over Australia (yes the entire continent) two stranded siblings discover a dormant Jaeger (giant robot) and use it to find their parents and get out of their dangerous home alive. So rather than the fate of the world hanging in the balance “Pacific Rim: The Black” tells a more personal story of perseverance family and big ol’ smash fests.

Bonus Reason: While del Toro isn’t involved in this one neither is Charlie Hunnam. Also this is not “Pacific Rim: Uprising” and the visuals look damn good. So you win some and you lose some… take that as you will.

6. “Country Comfort” Season 1 (available March 19)

Why Would I Watch? Any show that starts in the iconic Nashville bar Tootsie’s can’t be all bad right? “Country Comfort” is a cheery multicam sitcom starring Katherine McPhee as an aspiring country singer who takes a childcare job when her career suffers a setback. Suddenly Bailey is a fish-out-of-water nanny to five troublemaking kiddos. Their mother died a year earlier they’ve already sent nine nannies running and their father a rugged cowboy named Beau (Eddie Cibrian) is apparently incapable of wrangling them alone. So long as Bailey’s happiness doesn’t hinge on giving up her profession to take care of kids maybe this four-quadrant sitcom has something more to offer than a pretty shot of a pink country music institution.

Bonus Reason: Janet Varney might be playing the wicked stepmother role in “Country Comfort” but the voice behind Korra in “The Legend of Korra” and the actor behind Becca in “You’re the Worst” is reliable source of joy for viewers. Let’s see what she can do with this one.

7. “Weeds” Seasons 1-7 (no longer available March 31)

Why Would I Watch? For one this is your last chance — at least for the foreseeable future. All seven seasons of Mary-Louise Parker’s dark-comic crime drama are leaving Netflix at the end of the month and there are no confirmed plans for its return to streaming soon after. (While it would seem logical for “Weeds” to pop up on Showtime’s streaming service its original network or the newly launched Paramount+ which is owned by Showtime’s parent company ViacomCBS the rights are actually controlled by Lionsgate which just made a rather odd deal to license “Mad Men” across multiple services. So who knows where it will end up.)

Bonus Reason: “Weeds” is good! Created by “Orange Is the New Black” mastermind Jenji Kohan the addictive suburban drama features the enviable cast of Parker Justin Kirk Elizabeth Perkins Kevin Nealon and Romany Malco. It’s emotionally grounded yet unafraid to get weird and it’s one of the easier marathon sessions you can partake in this month. Light up give it a go see where it leads.

February TV

1. “The Crew” Season 1 (available February 15)

Why Would I Watch? If you’re a fan of Kevin James then you’ll certainly want to make a pit stop for this comedy series. The former “King of Queens” and titular Kevin of “Kevin Can Wait” leads “The Crew” a multi-cam sitcom centering on a NASCAR crew chief (played by James) and his dedicated crew whose lives are thrown into disarray when their owner retires and puts his daughter Catherine (Jillian Mueller) in charge. The young intrepid new boss has lots of ideas on how to revolutionize the racing team and it’s up to James to learn when to accept change for the better and buckle down on the tried and true ways of yesteryear.

Bonus Reason: NASCAR fans should know this is an officially licensed TV series complete with two producers from the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. But the rest of “The Crew” is made up of James’ family favorites. Showrunner and writer Jeff Lowell is technically the outsider coming from one of Netflix’s longest-running comedies “The Ranch” but director Andy Fickman (“Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2” “Kevin Can Wait”) EP Jeff Sussman (“The King of Queens” “Paul Blart”) and EP Todd Garner (“Paul Blart 2”) are all in the star’s circle of trust. So again if you like James — or if you just enjoyed watching syndicated reruns of “King of Queens” while doing dishes — perhaps “The Crew” is the right fit for you.

2. “The Sinner” Season 3 “Jamie” (available February 6)

Why Would I Watch? Did you like “The Sinner” Season 1 (starring Jessica Biel) or “The Sinner” Season 2 (starring Carrie Coon)? Of course you did they were good! So why not take a flier on Season 3 which continues Harry Ambrose’s detective story (played by Bill Pullman) as he pursues a new case involving Jamie Burns (the new season’s star Matt Bomer).

Bonus Reason: OK so maybe Jessica Biel isn’t your bag and somehow you slept on another brilliant Carrie Coon performance. That’s OK! (I mean it’s not OK. Biel didn’t do anything to you and Coon is one of our finest thespians.) But you can still enjoy “The Sinner” Season 3 sans backstory. Derek Simonds’ anthology mystery starts a new case each year and while you may have a few questions about Harry’s backstory (Pullman is the series’ one constant) they won’t get in the way of enjoying this twisty new tale.

3. “Ginny & Georgia” Season 1 (available February 24)

Why Would I Watch? Have you been watching too much “Gilmore Girls”? Are you in need of a change but can’t will yourself to leave the cozy mother-daughter story in Stars Hollow? Well you’re in luck. Netflix has pumped out a brand new original series about Ginny (Antonia Gentry) a mature-for-her-age 15-year-old girl who moves to a small town in New England with her 30-year-old not-mature-enough mom Georgia (Brianne Howey). After bouncing around for years the three-person family (including brother Austin) is hoping to settle down but they’re not exactly ready to open an inn. “Ginny and Georgia” promises much higher stakes than the family squabbles and boy trouble that troubled Lorelai and Rory as Georgia has the police on her back as soon as she gets settled. OK so maybe this isn’t a cozy show but hey it’s got to try something different.

Bonus Reason: Scott Porter — aka Jason Street aka Six aka QB1 on “Friday Night Lights” — co-stars as Mayor Paul Randolph who’s presumably the aforementioned New England town’s elected official and based on the series’ trailer a possible love interest for Georgia. For years now Porter has been popping up as a delightful surprise in shows like “Harley Quinn” “Archibald’s Next Big Thing” and non-voiceover/in-person roles like “Why Women Kill” “The To Do List” and “The Good Wife” so it’s about time he gets another rewarding series regular role like he had on “Hart of Dixie.” Here’s hoping this is it.

4. “Good Girls” Season 3 (available February 16)

Why Would I Watch? Over three seasons Jenna Bans’ NBC comedic thriller has garnered quite a fan base. Christina Hendricks Retta and Mae Whitman star as the eponymous and sardonic “Good Girls” whose decision to rob a supermarket (as a Robin Hood sort of maneuver to strike back against bad men taking everything from them) quickly spirals out of control. The series limped out of the gate a bit when it debuted in 2018 but it’s since capitalized on its bold storytelling choices and found great uses for its uber-talented cast. If you’re in the mood for a light heist comedy mixed with good melodrama this one will likely win you over.

Bonus Reason: Mae Whitman. Mae Whitman is the bonus reason because Mae Whitman is an excellent actor. The former “Parenthood” star just keeps getting better bringing her deep emotional chops from the Jason Katims’ tearjerker innate comic timing and formidable levels of sass to a character she can spin in any damn direction she pleases. And that’s a valuable skillset for a show that likes to pivot in new directions. Enjoy.

5. “Behind Her Eyes” (available February 17)

Why Would I Watch? “Behind Her Eyes” sounds like a fairly typical set-up if a bit outdated. Louise (Simona Brown) is a single mother working as a secretary who has an affair with her married boss David (Tom Bateman). Soon enough she’s drawn to his wife Adele (Eve Hewson) and the two become friends. But there’s far more going on than a simple workplace affair. Louise has vivid colorful dreams that lead Adele to tell her she’s special just like her and the more Louise comes to learn about each member of the couple the more their marriage reveals itself to be something… different. Based on the 2017 novel by Sarah Pinborough “Behind Her Eyes” aims to put its own stamp on the love triangle as erotic thriller.

Bonus Reason: I’ll be honest: At first the only reason this title stood out to me was because I thought it was another remake of “The Secret in Their Eyes.” For those unfamiliar (or with less vivid memories) “The Secret in Their Eyes” was first a 2009 Argentinian crime drama from director Juan José Campanella which uses a time-hopping story structure to examine a 25-year-old rape and murder case as remembered by two investigators. After winning the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film the story (based on Eduardo Sacheri’s novel “The Question in Their Eyes”) was remade starring Chiwetel Ejiofor Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts in a 2015 movie that promptly bombed. What does this have to do with “Behind Her Eyes”? Nothing. I just wanted to be honest. This is mainly a confession of my own shoddy unreliable memory but you know it could also work as a backup of sorts: If “Behind Her Eyes” isn’t your jam seek out “The Secret in Their Eyes” instead. The remake is streaming on Netflix though I would highly advise you seek out the original instead.

6. “Firefly Lane” Season 1 (available February 3)

Why Would I Watch? If you are the long-suffering Katherine Heigl fan waiting for her to find a new hit series and thus return to your home on a regular basis then… this… is… it? “Firefly Lane” quickly climbed to the No. 1 program on Netflix during its first week of release proving there’s either an insatiable appetite for more Dr. Izzie more dramas about female friendship or more Sarah Chalke! Hey she was on “Scrubs”! People liked “Scrubs” and people liked her in it. What a one-two punch of former ABC TV stars this turned out to be. My goodness. Anyway “Firefly Lane” is a time-jumping soap about best friends forever and what obstacles get in the way of their childhood dreams and lifelong friendships. If that’s what you’re in the mood for — and apparently many of you are — then go nuts.

Bonus Reason: I mean it’s gotta be the cast? One or the other maybe both. As IndieWire’s Kristen Lopez writes in her spoiler-free review:

“Firefly Lane” is determined to wring tears and laughter out of you and it does. It’s just that more often than not it does so unintentionally and for all the wrong reasons. But you can’t lay the show’s problems at the feet of its heroines who are all varying ranges of great. Chalke and Heigl make the series far more entertaining than it has any right to be.

7. “Bates Motel” Seasons 1-5 (available until February 19)

Why Would I Watch? Because it’s leaving! While Netflix saw many of its big-ticket acquisitions depart the platform last month February still has a few series dropping off the service and “Bates Motel” is definitely the best of the bunch. (Though horror film fans may want to check out “The Gift” before it’s gone.) A&E’s scripted original series “Bates Motel” does the unthinkable: It expands on Alfred Hitchcock’s classic going so far as to reimagine the Marion Crane story in “Psycho” and succeeds at every turn. Thanks to the best kind of scenery-chewing performances from Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore as well as tight tense scripts from showrunner Kerry Ehrin “Bates Motel” is a twisty delight for all five seasons. Watch it however you can before it’s gone even if it means skipping showers (which you know you may want to do anyway).

Bonus Reason: Oof I mean what’s left to say about a show that’s been off the air for a few years and regularly praised? I guess If you’re looking for a TV show based on a classic horror movie “Bates Motel” is a sure-thing. Its three Emmy nominations intense cult following and plenty of critics’ endorsements all speak to its guaranteed quality. The new CBS drama “Clarice” — based on Thomas Harris’ classic character and picking up shortly after “The Silence of the Lambs” — well it can’t exactly promise the same. So if you have to choose one go with “Bates Motel.” There are more episodes available anyway.

Seaspiracy has struck a nerve. Since it was released on March 24 it’s shot up Netflix’s top ten blown up on Twitter and sprung up in headlines across the world. The documentary co-created by the people behind 2014’s Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret follows filmmaker Ali Tabrizi on his journey to highlight the grim reality of commercial fishing.

It claims (perhaps dubiously) that the bulk of plastic waste in the ocean comes from fishing nets that over 300000 whales and dolphins are killed every year as ‘bycatch’ and that business as usual will empty the oceans by 2048 making for a heavy watch that ends with a simple message: the single best thing you can do as an individual is to stop eating fish. The urgency is palpable.

Seaspiracy like many documentaries before it has triggered outrage with some people publicly declaring that they will no longer eat fish. But do these documentaries actually make a lasting difference?

One thing that Seaspiracy has in droves is shock value. And shock can be very powerful in driving change. Ashley Bieniek-Tobasco a researcher from the University of Illinois surveyed people who watched Years of Living Dangerously an American climate documentary series. She found that people who felt angry or shocked were more likely to say they were motivated to do something about climate change than people who experienced helplessness and sadness. Essentially if you are too scared you’ll bury your head in the sand. In the context of eating fish emotions can make or break people’s desire to change.

Diogo Veríssimo a behaviour change specialist at the University of Oxford argues that while shock is very good at getting attention it can backfire. “Repeated exposure to shock is unpleasant so people develop strategies to avoid it” he says.

When shock works though it’s incredibly effective. James Pearson a 42-year-old landlord from Leeds says watching Cowspiracy years ago convinced him to slash his meat consumption. Now Seaspiracy has him hunting for fish alternatives. “Before watching these documentaries I’d heard of the vegetarian and vegan lifestyles but I just thought ‘I’m not eating birdseed I’ll just be hungry and I like my meat’ without really considering the consequences” he says. “These documentaries are real eye-openers.

And not just anyone: Viet Dinh the Fox Corporation’s chief legal officer and close friend of Fox’s chief executive Lachlan Murdoch had brought on a team of lawyers to investigate “the potential improper use of Fox data” by top 21st Century Fox executives he suspected of leaking to Disney while the terms were still being hammered out a Fox spokeswoman said. The studio’s president Peter Rice and the company’s general counsel Gerson Zweifach protested that they were merely conducting normal transition planning — and that Mr. Dinh was being so paranoid he might blow up the transaction.

The episode didn’t scuttle the deal. But the previously unreported conflict between the studio executives and Mr. Dinh a sociable and relentless Republican lawyer who was the chief architect in 2001 of the antiterrorism legislation known as the Patriot Act offers a rare glimpse into the opaque power structure of Rupert Murdoch’s world. The nonagenarian mogul exercises immense power through News Corp and the Fox Corporation in driving a global wave of right-wing populism. But basic elements of how his media companies run remain shrouded in mystery.

In the case of the Fox Corporation the questions of who is in charge and what the future holds are particularly hazy. The company minus its studio is now a midsize TV company adrift in a landscape of giants like Disney and AT&T that control everything from cellular phone networks to streaming platforms film and television. Fox’s profits are dominated by Fox News. Lachlan Murdoch’s more liberal brother James who no longer holds an operational role in the family businesses has made clear he’d like to see a change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcmV0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzQvNC8yMjM0MDAyMS9pcy1kYW5hLXBlcmluby10aGUtYW50aWRvdGUtZm9yLWRvbmFsZC10cnVtcC1zbHVtcC1mb3gtbmV3cy1nZW9yZ2UtYnVzaC1jb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUtbWVkaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Dana Perino of Fox News the antidote to the post-Trump network rating dip?,"Dana Perino stands outside the News Corp. building in New York on Sunday March 21 2021. Perino released her book “Everything Will Be Okay: Life Lessons for Young Women (From a Former Young Woman)” in March.

As expected cable news networks lost viewers after Donald Trump left office but competitors who hoped Fox News would disappear with the 45th president were disappointed.

Even amid an industry-wide “Trump slump” Fox still reigns in the latest Nielsen ratings in part because of programming changes made after Joe Biden won to include a larger role for Dana Perino a former press secretary for President George W. Bush whose star has continued to rise amid the turmoil and corporate politics that often engulf cable news.

If you turn on Fox News in the morning Perino is there holding forth with perfectly coiffed hair and tales of relatable imperfection throughout two hours of “America’s Newsroom.” Tune in late afternoon and she’s there too tossing out bon mots like a modern-day Dorothy Parker on the news panel “The Five.”

She’s also called on for commentary at other times in the day such as after Biden’s first press conference. She hosts “Dana Perino’s Book Club” on the network’s streaming service Fox Nation and lately is even omnipresent on other media promoting her new book.

In short it seems that when the “Trump slump” met Dana Perino Perino prevailed.

Fox executives consider her an “impact anchor” someone with both gravitas and sparkle and she was untouched by the sexual-harassment scandals that rocked the company five years ago.

In fact she’s the antithesis of the controversy the polar opposite of Bill O’Reilly the former Fox personality fired for sexual harassment in 2017 said Robert Thompson professor of radio television and film at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.

She is enjoying heightened visibility at an age when some female news anchors have been replaced by younger women and Perino 48 is not afraid to bring attention to her age. Her new book “Everything Will Be Okay” is subtitled “Life Lessons for Young Women (From a Former Young Woman).”

In the book Perino returns to her Mountain West roots to offer advice for America’s young women who she believes are suffering “quarter-life crises” well into their thirties. Her advice ranges from the practical (how to find a role model) to the ethereal (how to achieve serenity) and how to grow into a daunting new job when your boss is the president of the United States and almost a foot taller than you. (Bush is 6 feet; Perino 5.)

The 43rd president was one of her favorite mentors. And now she’s passing his advice on to others along with her own.

Gift from a father

Midway through a conversation about growing up in Colorado and Wyoming a siren shrieks on the street outside Perino’s Manhattan apartment.

“Did you hear that?” Perino says exultant. “The city is back. The city is back!”

Perino’s enthusiasm for the piercing sounds of the city shows how long it’s been in the grip of COVID-19. And also that you can take a girl out of the Mountain West and make her a New Yorker — albeit a New Yorker who prays for people she makes eye contact with on city streets as she reveals in her new book:

“May whatever you’re going through ease up on you for today. ... May there be peace in your heart today. ... May you be safe and secure. ... May you know you are loved and cared for by God.”

Praying for passers-by Perino writes is “a helpful exercise that has become a habit and I think I’m better off for it.”

“It certainly got me out of comparing my bag to her bag and her coat to my coat and her cool dog to my — Who am I kidding? No dog beats out Jasper.”

Jasper is the Hungarian Vizsla so famous to Fox News viewers that he was the subject of Perino’s 2016 book “Let Me Tell You About Jasper... .” He’s an occasional in-studio guest and a frequent star on Perino’s Twitter feed where he is much more popular than her queso. (Perino says a picture she posted of the dish in 2019 is the closest thing to a scandal she’s encountered.)

Today Jasper is napping next to Perino as she talks about her latest book her time working with former President Bush and why she has a heart for mentoring young women. (Among her life lessons: “Reach back to what your parents taught you about religion and faith” and “Stay in touch with your people.”)

Although Perino hasn’t lived in the Mountain West since finishing graduate school she can’t tell her story without traveling there in her mind to the farm where her great-grandparents dug a well and built a small house in Newcastle Wyoming to fulfill the requirements of the Homestead Act of 1862 to the quarter horses and cattle that members of her family still raise to pot roast and Jergens lotion and vacation Bible school and the other wholesome snippets of memory that coalesce into one: growing up loved in a family that prized knowledge.

They are lessons she brings to the set of Fox News — even when the “set” was a green screen in her spare bedroom thanks to COVID-19.

Perino credits her father for giving her a love for information and her ability to convey and dissect it rapidly. The family lived in Denver and later Parker Colorado and subscribed to two newspapers — the Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post — as well as multiple magazines. Beginning in third grade Perino’s father required that she read two articles every day and to be prepared to discuss the relevant issues at dinner. “It was brilliant training” Perino says.

“When I worked for President Bush I had just explained my point of view on something (while we were) on Marine One and as the president was thinking it over I had this flashback to the kitchen table and I was thinking about how helpful it was for my dad to have started that tradition with me. It set me up to be able to present my ideas and defend them through critical thinking and in front of a dominant male figure.

“Did my dad think all that through? No. But he loved the news so much” she said. The family church-going Lutherans would go to services early on Sunday so they could make it home in time to watch “Meet the Press.” On Sunday evenings Perino’s father would set a timer on the stove so that she would remember to watch “60 Minutes.”

Before she was in high school Perino had announced to her parents that she planned to be a news anchor. In high school she developed her leadership and communication skills on the debate team and student council and she went to the University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo (now Colorado State University-Pueblo) on a scholarship and later to graduate school at the University of Illinois Springfield.

Inadvertently the decision to attend a small state school turned out to be a propellant to Perino’s success. “I had a bit of an inferiority complex when it came to my education when I was at the White House at least at first” she said.

“They’d all gone to Harvard or Yale or Stanford. When I said I’d gone to USC they thought I meant I was a Trojan and I was ‘Oh no we were the Indians in Pueblo Colorado’” she said laughing.

“One of the ways I found to set myself apart to catch up was that I always wanted to be the most well-read person in the room. And when I was the White House press secretary I would make sure that everyone in the room knew that I was the most well-read person in the room. And that gave me a measure of power.”

Having developed a voracious appetite for knowledge because of the lessons of her father it wasn’t a chore for Perino to put in the time to read. There was also a direct line from Perino’s parents to the “compassionate conservatism” that made Perino want to work for Bush when he became president.

In the early 1980s Perino’s parents belonged to a church volunteer group that helped refugees from Russia Estonia Vietnam and Cambodia settle in Denver. Perino and her sister tagged along as their parents delivered appliances and other goods to refugee families. Her parents also taught the refugees basic skills such as how to use the city’s bus system. It was one of the meaningful experiences of her childhood Perino said and the lesson stuck. Conservatism and compassion could be entwined.

“So when George W. Bush goes to run for president and he refers to himself as a compassionate conservative my ears perked up. I was like ‘Oh that’s me.’ It really spoke to me” she said.

The experiences of childhood also come to mind when Perino grapples today with issues like immigration. Fox like many conservative news outlets has taken a hard line in its coverage of immigration at the southern border calling the current situation a crisis and criticizing the Biden administration for not showing more of the conditions at the border in recent weeks.

The border Perino says is a “huge problem” that she believes could be relieved with more border security and enforcement of visa terms and verification of employees.

“If we were more willing to use e-Verify then there would be more acceptance for the other traditional type of immigration that we’ve had in this country — for refugees for example.”

But while Perino a veteran of White House policy meetings is comfortable criticizing the president she holds back when asked about the performance of the current president’s press secretary Jen Psaki.

“I love the fraternity of press secretaries and part of that is a code of support. I’ve never criticized one I always try to support them. I think Jen Psaki brings a ton of experience to the job” she said.

Then again this is Dana Perino mentor of young women and giver of advice and that advice sometimes spills out unbidden.

“I think when it comes to this issue — is there a crisis on the border? — a better way for (Psaki) to answer that might have been to say ‘Of course there’s a crisis on the border — there’s been a crisis on the border for decades and we’re trying to fix it.’

“Instead every day (the press asks) ‘Is it a crisis? Is it a challenge? Is it a catastrophe?’ And I feel that the president and Ron Klain the White House chief of staff owe her a better answer. If I were her I would pour gasoline on my forehead and threaten to light a match if they didn’t give me a better answer.”

The ‘quarter-life crisis’

Perino is long past her “quarter-life crisis” but she believes that many young women in America are being crippled by a period of angst that begins in their mid-20s and is now following some women into their 30s and beyond.

A quarter-life crisis she says is marked by uncertainty indecision and a sense of failure despite many successes. Young women may feel they’re not advancing as quickly as they should be in their careers or despairing that they haven’t yet married and had a family. Consequently they suffer from a paralyzing lack of confidence that keeps them from achieving their goals.

Perino says she’s been there felt that and a friend from a church singles’ group in Washington D.C. helped her move past it with some advice from the Bible.

Perino wrote that she had begun to despair that “there was no way I was going to make my goal of having two children with a cute home in a good neighborhood with secure finances and I assumed no real worries in the world.” But then the friend reminded of two words that Jesus said: “Fear not.”

“And” the friend continued ”he means it. Everything is going to be OK. Let God work his plan and let go of yours.”

God’s plan as it turned out was much different from what a younger Perino had imagined. God’s plan involved marriage to an older man she met on a plane (when they met she was 25 he was 43); two (now adult) stepchildren not biological children; and not one cute home but two. (In addition to the New York apartment they rent Perino and her husband Peter McMahon own a home in Bay Head New Jersey.)

Her marriage was shockingly unexpected not only to Perino but to her family coming as it did 11 months after meeting McMahon on a plane. After a quick cross-Atlantic courtship the couple eloped in England with two strangers as witnesses. (Her parents didn’t learn that their daughter had gotten married until they all had dinner together in the U.K. a few weeks later.) Perino and McMahon will celebrate their 23rd anniversary in September. She has said that she still gets “little stomach flips” when meeting her husband after work and that there are six keys to their enduring marriage: faith gratitude grace commitment love and surrender.

Another significant cleaving from Perino’s plan for her life occurred the day she showed up at the White House in 2007 intending to submit her resignation.

At the time she was deputy press secretary and didn’t see any room for advancement despite working hours that felt nonstop. She told Ed Gillespie one of Bush’s other advisers that she wanted to speak with him and he said he wanted to speak with her too. When they met she told Gillespie to go first and he said the president wanted to promote her to press secretary later that week.

“I’d be honored” she told him. She never told him she’d planned to resign and Gillespie never knew until he read the story in her first book published in 2015.

“Immediately I knew with just a snap of the finger that my life had changed dramatically for the rest of my life” she said.

And it did. As press secretary she accompanied Bush to more than 50 nations and her name became a household word. After Bush left office she started a public-relations agency and with friends launched a nonprofit that facilitates “minute mentoring” for women. (Among her bits of advice: “If you’re ever in a situation where someone says ‘I need to talk to you too’ always let them go first.”)

But she became even more famous when Fox News came calling.

‘You don’t have to have a plan’

Perino began at Fox as a contributor in 2009 then in 2011 became a panelist on “The Five” a free-wheeling conversation on the day’s news that airs from 5-6 p.m. Eastern.

Perino was hired by Roger Ailes the controversial CEO credited with inventing the network’s personality-driven format with a conservative point of view often presented by beautiful women with blond hair and great legs.

Ailes who died in 2017 resigned in 2016 after a lawsuit by former Fox personality Gretchen Carlson triggered other accusations of sexual harassment. Perino was not among the women who made accusations against Ailes.

“He did hire me. I learned a lot from him. He gave me chance to be myself” she said adding that “The Five” was Ailes’ idea.

“I never had any problems at all with Roger Ailes. I recognize that many did. ... I feel good about the company where we are today. That’s not to sweep anything under the rug but to recognize it and to be honest about it but also to move on.”

It’s been challenging for Fox to move on given the relentless coverage of Ailes even after his death to include a book “The Loudest Voice in the Room” by Gabriel Sherman a 2019 Showtime miniseries based on that book and the partly fictionalized film “Bombshell” also released in 2019.

But the network’s ratings dominant in cable news for nearly 20 years have been resilient largely because of viewer loyalty to personalities like Perino.

Thompson the professor of radio television and film at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University has observed that unlike CNN which built a network around breaking news Fox built its brand on personalities that people wanted to watch even on slow news days.

And Fox viewers like Dana Perino.

“The Five” has doubled its viewership since its launch in 2011 and the show Perino anchored from 2017-2020 “The Daily Briefing” was the leader in its time slot among cable networks according to Nielsen ratings.

Fox executives gave Perino even more airtime when they added her to “America’s Newsroom” with Bill Hemmer in January.

In an email Jay Wallace president and executive editor of Fox News Media said the show “sets the news table for us each day” and that the network values Perino’s experience and insights.

“Dana is an impact anchor who has proven she can get newsmakers and lawmakers — from both sides of the aisle — to speak with her” Wallace said. That was clear this week when Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg appeared on the show to discuss Biden’s infrastructure proposal.

But Wallace said that Perino’s new role was not a calculated move to counter the predicted “Trump slump” but rather made in conjunction with other programming changes made to coincide with a new administration.

“History tells us the country’s mood and temperament tends to change with the arrival of a new president not to mention with a new balance of power on Capitol Hill so we are always strategizing ways to capture changing interests and viewer consumption” Wallace said.

Fox Corp. CEO and executive chairman Lachlan Murdoch has said that like MSNBC saw its role during the Trump administration Fox now has a job to call out Biden when he needs to be called out. “And you know you’ll see our ratings really improve from here and will do so for at least the next four years” Murdoch said.

For once Perino doesn’t have her eye on a higher prize. With a great job a fulfilling marriage and a good dog she says she is content with her life having decided that the most important thing in life isn’t having a plan but being willing to accept what God puts before you. That’s part of her advice for young women.

“Young women in my experience are hungry for advice and they will work very hard but they want you to give them the plan.” But that’s not how it happens she says.

“Every time there was career advancement for me I didn’t plan it. It took me by surprise. Now I’m prepared and I’m willing to take a risk and not say no to a great new opportunity but I couldn’t plan it all. And that’s the great gift when you realize it will all be OK you don’t have to have a plan. You just have to be ready.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzAzL3VuaWNvcm4tcmlvdC1kYWtvdGEtcGlwZWxpbmUtZW5lcmd5LXRyYW5zZmVyLXN1YnBvZW5hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dakota Access Pipeline Company Subpoenas Unicorn Riot,"Last week members of the nonprofit news organization Unicorn Riot received a subpoena from the pipeline giant Energy Transfer seeking a wide range of documents including newsgathering materials that would identify sources. The subpoena is part of an aggressive yearslong legal effort launched by Energy Transfer in the wake of the Standing Rock movement when thousands of opponents of the corporation’s Dakota Access pipeline came to camps at the border of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in an attempt to stop pipeline construction and protect the tribe’s drinking water from contamination.

Through a series of expensive conspiracy lawsuits against a disparate range of actors the pipeline company has sought to paint the Standing Rock movement as the product of a vast misinformation-driven conspiracy to damage Energy Transfer.

Now as part of that effort Energy Transfer is demanding Unicorn Riot turn over virtually any documents video footage audio article drafts and communications related to the firm and its pipeline. The subpoena also sought information about the nonprofit’s organizational structure social media accounts and names of employees volunteers and supporters. Niko Georgiades who was among the Unicorn Riot reporters covering Standing Rock was separately subpoenaed.

“This subpoena is outrageous and strikes at the heart of the First Amendment. It should be thrown out immediately.”

“This subpoena is outrageous and strikes at the heart of the First Amendment” said Trevor Timm executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “The breadth of the subpoena is striking: not only encompassing things like story drafts and internal communications but also the personal information of Unicorn Riot’s donors. The judge should see this for what it is: a menacing attempt to intimidate a news outlet whose only ‘crime’ is being critical of the company. It should be thrown out immediately.”

Unicorn Riot signaled it would contest the subpoena. “We intend to vigorously defend our sources and our First Amendment protected activity” Unicorn Riot told The Intercept in a statement. (Energy Transfer did not respond to a request for comment.)

Over the course of months of protests at Standing Rock Unicorn Riot developed a reputation for its immersive livestreams video news reports and public information requests which provided powerful evidence of the aggressive tactics used by law enforcement agencies and Energy Transfer. The organization’s work leans to the left politically and tends to be critical of law enforcement agencies with journalists often reporting from within movement spaces. At Standing Rock law enforcement officials at times viewed the group’s journalists as members of the movement subjecting them to repeated arrests as well as “less than lethal” weapons.

Unicorn Riot has fewer than a dozen members and is entirely supported by private donations from individuals who seek out their coverage of social movements and protests. (Disclosure: Sam Richards one of the authors of this story has written for Unicorn Riot as a freelance journalist on matters unrelated to pipeline protests.) Energy Transfer meanwhile reported nearly $5 billion in revenue in 2019 and has somewhere in the neighborhood of 13000 employees.

Fighting back will be an immense financial burden for a tiny organization like Unicorn Riot. The group has launched a fundraiser to pay for a First Amendment lawyer.

Attempt to “Chill” Speech

Critics say the toll exacted by fighting legal attacks is exactly the point of what Energy Transfer is doing.

The Unicorn Riot notice was just one of a slew of subpoenas related to Energy Transfer’s case over the last month to a wide range of individuals and groups who were involved in the Standing Rock movement. Among them were legal collectives groups that provide nonviolent direct-action trainings and Standing Rock tribal officials.

The Water Protector Legal Collective which also received an Energy Transfer subpoena described the subpoenas as part of a set of tactics “designed to bury organizations in litigation and force organizations to spend precious resources time and energy defending against corporations.”

Energy Transfer “is on a fishing expedition for information that could lend credence to their ill-founded notion that nonprofit organizations and Water Protectors seeking to protect human rights and the earth for future generations were allegedly engaged in illicit activity” said staff attorney Natali Segovia in a statement. “In reality it is ETP and large corporations that break the law with impunity.”

The subpoenas are part of a follow-up effort to a sprawling federal racketeering lawsuit Energy Transfer filed in 2017 against a range of defendants including the environmental group Greenpeace; BankTrack which is a nonprofit that pressures banks to stop financing harmful activity; and several individual pipeline opponents.

The federal complaint alleged that thousands of people came to camps at the border of the Standing Rock reservation because of a Greenpeace misinformation campaign. Widespread evidence including a robust public record show that water protectors instead were galvanized by calls for help made by tribal members and the publication of shocking footage showing Dakota Access pipeline security contractors siccing dogs on pipeline opponents.

Energy Transfer claimed it sustained $300 million in damages a total that could translate into triple the penalties — nearly $1 billion — under the federal law called the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act known as RICO.

“The suit was brought to chill Greenpeace’s speech drain our resources and intimidate anyone who speaks out against pipeline projects.”

The legal effort has been labeled a SLAPP suit by Greenpeace short for “strategic lawsuits against public participation.” The SLAPP designation refers to efforts designed to silence a powerful plaintiff’s critics by using the legal system to drain them of resources. The goal is not solely to win the lawsuit but to force a corporation’s political adversaries to hemorrhage money time and morale through relentless legal filings. In response to repeated SLAPP suits targeting Greenpeace and others a task force called Protect the Protest launched in 2018.

In February 2019 a judge summarily dismissed Energy Transfer’s initial federal RICO case. “Donating to people whose cause you support does not create a RICO enterprise” he said. “Posting articles written by people with similar beliefs does not create a RICO enterprise.”

Exactly a week after the dismissal Energy Transfer filed a new complaint against Greenpeace in a local North Dakota district court. The new case basically repackages the old complaint without the federal RICO claims adding instead allegations of trespassing and other property-based claims. Named alongside Greenpeace is the Red Warrior Society which occupied an encampment of pipeline opponents that supported obstructive direct-action protests Greenpeace organizer Charles Brown and water protectors Cody Hall and Krystal Two Bulls.

“The suit was brought to chill Greenpeace’s speech drain our resources and intimidate anyone who speaks out against pipeline projects” said Greenpeace deputy general counsel Deepa Padmanabha. “We’ve been fighting this SLAPP suit for many years and we’ll continue to fight this battle because it’s important for all individuals and groups engaged in advocacy work.”

Widening Net

In the latest iteration of Energy Transfer’s legal attack the corporation issued several subpoenas in recent weeks to individuals who are not defendants in the case. Among those subpoenaed are groups that provided legal services to people facing criminal charges during Standing Rock including the Water Protector Legal Collective and the Freshet Collective. The Ruckus Society and Indigenous Peoples Power Project which both promote nonviolent direct action were also subpoenaed. And so were officials involved in inspecting the pipeline route on behalf of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe including Dr. Kelly Morgan an archeologist for the tribe and Tim Mentz the tribe’s former tribal historic preservation officer who submitted key testimony in a case arguing that the pipeline would harm culturally significant sites.

In an objection to its subpoena the Water Protector Legal Collective noted that it has provided legal support in more than 800 criminal cases and argued that the subpoena is “seeking the records of a legal organization akin to a law office including communications by between and among WPLC-associated attorneys WPLC staff and its clients.” The group said the subpoena was “an assault by Energy Transfer and Dakota Access upon the attorney client-privilege itself” and “a fishing expedition.”

The Water Protector Legal Collective subpoena even requested communications with members of the press. “This is a clear attempt to inhibit communications by an advocacy organization with the press in violation of WPLC’s first amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution” the collective said in its objection.

Mentz and Morgan for their part have objected to the subpoena on the grounds that the documents Energy Transfer is demanding are the property of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe which is protected from such third-party subpoenas by sovereign immunity.

Unicorn Riot has been forced to dedicate a sizable portion of its limited resources to deciding how to handle the sweeping subpoena even as the group maintains round-the-clock coverage of the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin who killed George Floyd last summer and sparked a nationwide protest movement. “We are committed to bringing you hard hitting journalism and will not bow to attempts to intimidate or interfere with our reporting” the organization stated on its new legal defense fund page.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb21pY3Mvc3BlYWstdXAtYS1uZXctYXV0aXN0aWMtdGhlbWVkLWdyYXBoaWMtbm92ZWwtYnktcmViZWNjYS1idXJnZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Speak Up! a New Autistic-Themed Graphic Novel by Rebecca Burgess,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/comics/speak-up-a-new-autistic-themed-graphic-novel-by-rebecca-burgess/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb21pY3Mvc3BlYWstdXAtYS1uZXctYXV0aXN0aWMtdGhlbWVkLWdyYXBoaWMtbm92ZWwtYnktcmViZWNjYS1idXJnZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS05NDMyOTA3L0lzLUJpZGVuLVJFQUwtcmVhc29uLUxhY2hsYW4tTXVyZG9jaC1sZWZ0LUxBLUF1c3RyYWxpYS5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTk0MzI5MDcvYW1wL0lzLUJpZGVuLVJFQUwtcmVhc29uLUxhY2hsYW4tTXVyZG9jaC1sZWZ0LUxBLUF1c3RyYWxpYS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Biden the REAL reason Lachlan Murdoch left LA for Australia?,"Lachlan Murdoch his supermodel wife Sarah and their three children quietly arrived in Australia from Los Angeles last month.

And while no reason was given for the family's return Down Under a new report has claimed that it was the political climate in the US that helped make the decision for the family to leave LA in favour of their Sydney home.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald the family 'felt the cold winds of political change' when Joe Biden assumed power over Donald Trump after the family-owned Fox News appeared to favour the Republican Party throughout the election campaign.

A source said: 'The school communities here are very close knit and it extends into the wider families and the circles and parties they all go to. That Hollywood set is very pro-Democratic.

'They are mostly big fundraisers for Biden so you can imagine how well it went down when one of their classmates' dads is at the helm of the biggest anti-Biden machine in the country.'

The family completed the mandatory quarantine period for international visitors by remaining confined to their luxury home in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

The Murdochs bought the beautiful Georgian mansion in Sydney's Bellevue Hill in 2009 for $23 million and then reportedly spent $11.67 million renovating the property.

And not just anyone: Viet Dinh the Fox Corporation’s chief legal officer and close friend of Fox’s chief executive Lachlan Murdoch had brought on a team of lawyers to investigate “the potential improper use of Fox data” by top 21st Century Fox executives he suspected of leaking to Disney while the terms were still being hammered out a Fox spokeswoman said. The studio’s president Peter Rice and the company’s general counsel Gerson Zweifach protested that they were merely conducting normal transition planning — and that Mr. Dinh was being so paranoid he might blow up the transaction.

The episode didn’t scuttle the deal. But the previously unreported conflict between the studio executives and Mr. Dinh a sociable and relentless Republican lawyer who was the chief architect in 2001 of the antiterrorism legislation known as the Patriot Act offers a rare glimpse into the opaque power structure of Rupert Murdoch’s world. The nonagenarian mogul exercises immense power through News Corp and the Fox Corporation in driving a global wave of right-wing populism. But basic elements of how his media companies run remain shrouded in mystery.

In the case of the Fox Corporation the questions of who is in charge and what the future holds are particularly hazy. The company minus its studio is now a midsize TV company adrift in a landscape of giants like Disney and AT&T that control everything from cellular phone networks to streaming platforms film and television. Fox’s profits are dominated by Fox News.

Perino released her book “Everything Will Be Okay: Life Lessons for Young Women (From a Former Young Woman)” in March.

As expected cable news networks lost viewers after Donald Trump left office but competitors who hoped Fox News would disappear with the 45th president were disappointed.

Even amid an industry-wide “Trump slump” Fox still reigns in the latest Nielsen ratings in part because of programming changes made after Joe Biden won to include a larger role for Dana Perino a former press secretary for President George W. Bush whose star has continued to rise amid the turmoil and corporate politics that often engulf cable news.

If you turn on Fox News in the morning Perino is there holding forth with perfectly coiffed hair and tales of relatable imperfection throughout two hours of “America’s Newsroom.” Tune in late afternoon and she’s there too tossing out bon mots like a modern-day Dorothy Parker on the news panel “The Five.”

She’s also called on for commentary at other times in the day such as after Biden’s first press conference. She hosts “Dana Perino’s Book Club” on the network’s streaming service Fox Nation and lately is even omnipresent on other media promoting her new book.

In short it seems that when the “Trump slump” met Dana Perino Perino prevailed.

Fox executives consider her an “impact anchor” someone with both gravitas and sparkle and she was untouched by the sexual-harassment scandals that rocked the company five years ago.

In fact she’s the antithesis of the controversy the polar opposite of Bill O’Reilly the former Fox personality fired for sexual harassment in 2017 said Robert Thompson professor of radio television and film at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.

She is enjoying heightened visibility at an age when some female news anchors have been replaced by younger women and Perino 48 is not afraid to bring attention to her age. Her new book “Everything Will Be Okay” is subtitled “Life Lessons for Young Women (From a Former Young Woman).”

In the book Perino returns to her Mountain West roots to offer advice for America’s young women who she believes are suffering “quarter-life crises” well into their thirties. Her advice ranges from the practical (how to find a role model) to the ethereal (how to achieve serenity) and how to grow into a daunting new job when your boss is the president of the United States and almost a foot taller than you. (Bush is 6 feet; Perino 5.)

The 43rd president was one of her favorite mentors. And now she’s passing his advice on to others along with her own.

Gift from a father

Midway through a conversation about growing up in Colorado and Wyoming a siren shrieks on the street outside Perino’s Manhattan apartment.

“Did you hear that?” Perino says exultant. “The city is back. The city is back!”

Perino’s enthusiasm for the piercing sounds of the city shows how long it’s been in the grip of COVID-19. And also that you can take a girl out of the Mountain West and make her a New Yorker — albeit a New Yorker who prays for people she makes eye contact with on city streets as she reveals in her new book:

“May whatever you’re going through ease up on you for today. ... May there be peace in your heart today. ... May you be safe and secure. ... May you know you are loved and cared for by God.”

Praying for passers-by Perino writes is “a helpful exercise that has become a habit and I think I’m better off for it.”

“It certainly got me out of comparing my bag to her bag and her coat to my coat and her cool dog to my — Who am I kidding? No dog beats out Jasper.”

Jasper is the Hungarian Vizsla so famous to Fox News viewers that he was the subject of Perino’s 2016 book “Let Me Tell You About Jasper... .” He’s an occasional in-studio guest and a frequent star on Perino’s Twitter feed where he is much more popular than her queso. (Perino says a picture she posted of the dish in 2019 is the closest thing to a scandal she’s encountered.)

Today Jasper is napping next to Perino as she talks about her latest book her time working with former President Bush and why she has a heart for mentoring young women. (Among her life lessons: “Reach back to what your parents taught you about religion and faith” and “Stay in touch with your people.”)

Although Perino hasn’t lived in the Mountain West since finishing graduate school she can’t tell her story without traveling there in her mind to the farm where her great-grandparents dug a well and built a small house in Newcastle Wyoming to fulfill the requirements of the Homestead Act of 1862 to the quarter horses and cattle that members of her family still raise to pot roast and Jergens lotion and vacation Bible school and the other wholesome snippets of memory that coalesce into one: growing up loved in a family that prized knowledge.

They are lessons she brings to the set of Fox News — even when the “set” was a green screen in her spare bedroom thanks to COVID-19.

Perino credits her father for giving her a love for information and her ability to convey and dissect it rapidly. The family lived in Denver and later Parker Colorado and subscribed to two newspapers — the Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post — as well as multiple magazines. Beginning in third grade Perino’s father required that she read two articles every day and to be prepared to discuss the relevant issues at dinner. “It was brilliant training” Perino says.

“When I worked for President Bush I had just explained my point of view on something (while we were) on Marine One and as the president was thinking it over I had this flashback to the kitchen table and I was thinking about how helpful it was for my dad to have started that tradition with me. It set me up to be able to present my ideas and defend them through critical thinking and in front of a dominant male figure.

“Did my dad think all that through? No. But he loved the news so much” she said. The family church-going Lutherans would go to services early on Sunday so they could make it home in time to watch “Meet the Press.” On Sunday evenings Perino’s father would set a timer on the stove so that she would remember to watch “60 Minutes.”

Before she was in high school Perino had announced to her parents that she planned to be a news anchor. In high school she developed her leadership and communication skills on the debate team and student council and she went to the University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo (now Colorado State University-Pueblo) on a scholarship and later to graduate school at the University of Illinois Springfield.

Inadvertently the decision to attend a small state school turned out to be a propellant to Perino’s success. “I had a bit of an inferiority complex when it came to my education when I was at the White House at least at first” she said.

“They’d all gone to Harvard or Yale or Stanford. When I said I’d gone to USC they thought I meant I was a Trojan and I was ‘Oh no we were the Indians in Pueblo Colorado’” she said laughing.

“One of the ways I found to set myself apart to catch up was that I always wanted to be the most well-read person in the room. And when I was the White House press secretary I would make sure that everyone in the room knew that I was the most well-read person in the room. And that gave me a measure of power.”

Having developed a voracious appetite for knowledge because of the lessons of her father it wasn’t a chore for Perino to put in the time to read. There was also a direct line from Perino’s parents to the “compassionate conservatism” that made Perino want to work for Bush when he became president.

In the early 1980s Perino’s parents belonged to a church volunteer group that helped refugees from Russia Estonia Vietnam and Cambodia settle in Denver. Perino and her sister tagged along as their parents delivered appliances and other goods to refugee families. Her parents also taught the refugees basic skills such as how to use the city’s bus system. It was one of the meaningful experiences of her childhood Perino said and the lesson stuck. Conservatism and compassion could be entwined.

“So when George W. Bush goes to run for president and he refers to himself as a compassionate conservative my ears perked up. I was like ‘Oh that’s me.’ It really spoke to me” she said.

The experiences of childhood also come to mind when Perino grapples today with issues like immigration. Fox like many conservative news outlets has taken a hard line in its coverage of immigration at the southern border calling the current situation a crisis and criticizing the Biden administration for not showing more of the conditions at the border in recent weeks.

The border Perino says is a “huge problem” that she believes could be relieved with more border security and enforcement of visa terms and verification of employees.

“If we were more willing to use e-Verify then there would be more acceptance for the other traditional type of immigration that we’ve had in this country — for refugees for example.”

But while Perino a veteran of White House policy meetings is comfortable criticizing the president she holds back when asked about the performance of the current president’s press secretary Jen Psaki.

“I love the fraternity of press secretaries and part of that is a code of support. I’ve never criticized one I always try to support them. I think Jen Psaki brings a ton of experience to the job” she said.

Then again this is Dana Perino mentor of young women and giver of advice and that advice sometimes spills out unbidden.

“I think when it comes to this issue — is there a crisis on the border? — a better way for (Psaki) to answer that might have been to say ‘Of course there’s a crisis on the border — there’s been a crisis on the border for decades and we’re trying to fix it.’

“Instead every day (the press asks) ‘Is it a crisis? Is it a challenge? Is it a catastrophe?’ And I feel that the president and Ron Klain the White House chief of staff owe her a better answer. If I were her I would pour gasoline on my forehead and threaten to light a match if they didn’t give me a better answer.”

The ‘quarter-life crisis’

Perino is long past her “quarter-life crisis” but she believes that many young women in America are being crippled by a period of angst that begins in their mid-20s and is now following some women into their 30s and beyond.

A quarter-life crisis she says is marked by uncertainty indecision and a sense of failure despite many successes. Young women may feel they’re not advancing as quickly as they should be in their careers or despairing that they haven’t yet married and had a family. Consequently they suffer from a paralyzing lack of confidence that keeps them from achieving their goals.

Perino says she’s been there felt that and a friend from a church singles’ group in Washington D.C. helped her move past it with some advice from the Bible.

Perino wrote that she had begun to despair that “there was no way I was going to make my goal of having two children with a cute home in a good neighborhood with secure finances and I assumed no real worries in the world.” But then the friend reminded of two words that Jesus said: “Fear not.”

“And” the friend continued ”he means it. Everything is going to be OK. Let God work his plan and let go of yours.”

God’s plan as it turned out was much different from what a younger Perino had imagined. God’s plan involved marriage to an older man she met on a plane (when they met she was 25 he was 43); two (now adult) stepchildren not biological children; and not one cute home but two. (In addition to the New York apartment they rent Perino and her husband Peter McMahon own a home in Bay Head New Jersey.)

Her marriage was shockingly unexpected not only to Perino but to her family coming as it did 11 months after meeting McMahon on a plane. After a quick cross-Atlantic courtship the couple eloped in England with two strangers as witnesses. (Her parents didn’t learn that their daughter had gotten married until they all had dinner together in the U.K. a few weeks later.) Perino and McMahon will celebrate their 23rd anniversary in September. She has said that she still gets “little stomach flips” when meeting her husband after work and that there are six keys to their enduring marriage: faith gratitude grace commitment love and surrender.

Another significant cleaving from Perino’s plan for her life occurred the day she showed up at the White House in 2007 intending to submit her resignation.

At the time she was deputy press secretary and didn’t see any room for advancement despite working hours that felt nonstop. She told Ed Gillespie one of Bush’s other advisers that she wanted to speak with him and he said he wanted to speak with her too. When they met she told Gillespie to go first and he said the president wanted to promote her to press secretary later that week.

“I’d be honored” she told him. She never told him she’d planned to resign and Gillespie never knew until he read the story in her first book published in 2015.

“Immediately I knew with just a snap of the finger that my life had changed dramatically for the rest of my life” she said.

And it did. As press secretary she accompanied Bush to more than 50 nations and her name became a household word. After Bush left office she started a public-relations agency and with friends launched a nonprofit that facilitates “minute mentoring” for women. (Among her bits of advice: “If you’re ever in a situation where someone says ‘I need to talk to you too’ always let them go first.”)

But she became even more famous when Fox News came calling.

‘You don’t have to have a plan’

Perino began at Fox as a contributor in 2009 then in 2011 became a panelist on “The Five” a free-wheeling conversation on the day’s news that airs from 5-6 p.m. Eastern.

Perino was hired by Roger Ailes the controversial CEO credited with inventing the network’s personality-driven format with a conservative point of view often presented by beautiful women with blond hair and great legs.

Ailes who died in 2017 resigned in 2016 after a lawsuit by former Fox personality Gretchen Carlson triggered other accusations of sexual harassment. Perino was not among the women who made accusations against Ailes.

“He did hire me. I learned a lot from him. He gave me chance to be myself” she said adding that “The Five” was Ailes’ idea.

“I never had any problems at all with Roger Ailes. I recognize that many did. ... I feel good about the company where we are today. That’s not to sweep anything under the rug but to recognize it and to be honest about it but also to move on.”

It’s been challenging for Fox to move on given the relentless coverage of Ailes even after his death to include a book “The Loudest Voice in the Room” by Gabriel Sherman a 2019 Showtime miniseries based on that book and the partly fictionalized film “Bombshell” also released in 2019.

But the network’s ratings dominant in cable news for nearly 20 years have been resilient largely because of viewer loyalty to personalities like Perino.

Thompson the professor of radio television and film at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University has observed that unlike CNN which built a network around breaking news Fox built its brand on personalities that people wanted to watch even on slow news days.

And Fox viewers like Dana Perino.

“The Five” has doubled its viewership since its launch in 2011 and the show Perino anchored from 2017-2020 “The Daily Briefing” was the leader in its time slot among cable networks according to Nielsen ratings.

Fox executives gave Perino even more airtime when they added her to “America’s Newsroom” with Bill Hemmer in January.

In an email Jay Wallace president and executive editor of Fox News Media said the show “sets the news table for us each day” and that the network values Perino’s experience and insights.

“Dana is an impact anchor who has proven she can get newsmakers and lawmakers — from both sides of the aisle — to speak with her” Wallace said. That was clear this week when Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg appeared on the show to discuss Biden’s infrastructure proposal.

But Wallace said that Perino’s new role was not a calculated move to counter the predicted “Trump slump” but rather made in conjunction with other programming changes made to coincide with a new administration.

“History tells us the country’s mood and temperament tends to change with the arrival of a new president not to mention with a new balance of power on Capitol Hill so we are always strategizing ways to capture changing interests and viewer consumption” Wallace said.

Fox Corp. CEO and executive chairman Lachlan Murdoch has said that like MSNBC saw its role during the Trump administration Fox now has a job to call out Biden when he needs to be called out. “And you know you’ll see our ratings really improve from here and will do so for at least the next four years” Murdoch said.

For once Perino doesn’t have her eye on a higher prize. With a great job a fulfilling marriage and a good dog she says she is content with her life having decided that the most important thing in life isn’t having a plan but being willing to accept what God puts before you. That’s part of her advice for young women.

“Young women in my experience are hungry for advice and they will work very hard but they want you to give them the plan.” But that’s not how it happens she says.

“Every time there was career advancement for me I didn’t plan it. It took me by surprise. Now I’m prepared and I’m willing to take a risk and not say no to a great new opportunity but I couldn’t plan it all. And that’s the great gift when you realize it will all be OK you don’t have to have a plan. You just have to be ready.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzAzL3VuaWNvcm4tcmlvdC1kYWtvdGEtcGlwZWxpbmUtZW5lcmd5LXRyYW5zZmVyLXN1YnBvZW5hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dakota Access Pipeline Company Subpoenas Unicorn Riot,"Last week members of the nonprofit news organization Unicorn Riot received a subpoena from the pipeline giant Energy Transfer seeking a wide range of documents including newsgathering materials that would identify sources. The subpoena is part of an aggressive yearslong legal effort launched by Energy Transfer in the wake of the Standing Rock movement when thousands of opponents of the corporation’s Dakota Access pipeline came to camps at the border of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in an attempt to stop pipeline construction and protect the tribe’s drinking water from contamination.

Through a series of expensive conspiracy lawsuits against a disparate range of actors the pipeline company has sought to paint the Standing Rock movement as the product of a vast misinformation-driven conspiracy to damage Energy Transfer.

Now as part of that effort Energy Transfer is demanding Unicorn Riot turn over virtually any documents video footage audio article drafts and communications related to the firm and its pipeline. The subpoena also sought information about the nonprofit’s organizational structure social media accounts and names of employees volunteers and supporters. Niko Georgiades who was among the Unicorn Riot reporters covering Standing Rock was separately subpoenaed.

“This subpoena is outrageous and strikes at the heart of the First Amendment. It should be thrown out immediately.”

“This subpoena is outrageous and strikes at the heart of the First Amendment” said Trevor Timm executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “The breadth of the subpoena is striking: not only encompassing things like story drafts and internal communications but also the personal information of Unicorn Riot’s donors. The judge should see this for what it is: a menacing attempt to intimidate a news outlet whose only ‘crime’ is being critical of the company. It should be thrown out immediately.”

Unicorn Riot signaled it would contest the subpoena. “We intend to vigorously defend our sources and our First Amendment protected activity” Unicorn Riot told The Intercept in a statement. (Energy Transfer did not respond to a request for comment.)

Over the course of months of protests at Standing Rock Unicorn Riot developed a reputation for its immersive livestreams video news reports and public information requests which provided powerful evidence of the aggressive tactics used by law enforcement agencies and Energy Transfer. The organization’s work leans to the left politically and tends to be critical of law enforcement agencies with journalists often reporting from within movement spaces. At Standing Rock law enforcement officials at times viewed the group’s journalists as members of the movement subjecting them to repeated arrests as well as “less than lethal” weapons.

Unicorn Riot has fewer than a dozen members and is entirely supported by private donations from individuals who seek out their coverage of social movements and protests. (Disclosure: Sam Richards one of the authors of this story has written for Unicorn Riot as a freelance journalist on matters unrelated to pipeline protests.) Energy Transfer meanwhile reported nearly $5 billion in revenue in 2019 and has somewhere in the neighborhood of 13000 employees.

Fighting back will be an immense financial burden for a tiny organization like Unicorn Riot. The group has launched a fundraiser to pay for a First Amendment lawyer.

Attempt to “Chill” Speech

Critics say the toll exacted by fighting legal attacks is exactly the point of what Energy Transfer is doing.

The Unicorn Riot notice was just one of a slew of subpoenas related to Energy Transfer’s case over the last month to a wide range of individuals and groups who were involved in the Standing Rock movement. Among them were legal collectives groups that provide nonviolent direct-action trainings and Standing Rock tribal officials.

The Water Protector Legal Collective which also received an Energy Transfer subpoena described the subpoenas as part of a set of tactics “designed to bury organizations in litigation and force organizations to spend precious resources time and energy defending against corporations.”

Energy Transfer “is on a fishing expedition for information that could lend credence to their ill-founded notion that nonprofit organizations and Water Protectors seeking to protect human rights and the earth for future generations were allegedly engaged in illicit activity” said staff attorney Natali Segovia in a statement. “In reality it is ETP and large corporations that break the law with impunity.”

The subpoenas are part of a follow-up effort to a sprawling federal racketeering lawsuit Energy Transfer filed in 2017 against a range of defendants including the environmental group Greenpeace; BankTrack which is a nonprofit that pressures banks to stop financing harmful activity; and several individual pipeline opponents.

The federal complaint alleged that thousands of people came to camps at the border of the Standing Rock reservation because of a Greenpeace misinformation campaign. Widespread evidence including a robust public record show that water protectors instead were galvanized by calls for help made by tribal members and the publication of shocking footage showing Dakota Access pipeline security contractors siccing dogs on pipeline opponents.

Energy Transfer claimed it sustained $300 million in damages a total that could translate into triple the penalties — nearly $1 billion — under the federal law called the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act known as RICO.

“The suit was brought to chill Greenpeace’s speech drain our resources and intimidate anyone who speaks out against pipeline projects.”

The legal effort has been labeled a SLAPP suit by Greenpeace short for “strategic lawsuits against public participation.” The SLAPP designation refers to efforts designed to silence a powerful plaintiff’s critics by using the legal system to drain them of resources. The goal is not solely to win the lawsuit but to force a corporation’s political adversaries to hemorrhage money time and morale through relentless legal filings. In response to repeated SLAPP suits targeting Greenpeace and others a task force called Protect the Protest launched in 2018.

In February 2019 a judge summarily dismissed Energy Transfer’s initial federal RICO case. “Donating to people whose cause you support does not create a RICO enterprise” he said. “Posting articles written by people with similar beliefs does not create a RICO enterprise.”

Exactly a week after the dismissal Energy Transfer filed a new complaint against Greenpeace in a local North Dakota district court. The new case basically repackages the old complaint without the federal RICO claims adding instead allegations of trespassing and other property-based claims. Named alongside Greenpeace is the Red Warrior Society which occupied an encampment of pipeline opponents that supported obstructive direct-action protests Greenpeace organizer Charles Brown and water protectors Cody Hall and Krystal Two Bulls.

“The suit was brought to chill Greenpeace’s speech drain our resources and intimidate anyone who speaks out against pipeline projects” said Greenpeace deputy general counsel Deepa Padmanabha. “We’ve been fighting this SLAPP suit for many years and we’ll continue to fight this battle because it’s important for all individuals and groups engaged in advocacy work.”

Widening Net

In the latest iteration of Energy Transfer’s legal attack the corporation issued several subpoenas in recent weeks to individuals who are not defendants in the case. Among those subpoenaed are groups that provided legal services to people facing criminal charges during Standing Rock including the Water Protector Legal Collective and the Freshet Collective. The Ruckus Society and Indigenous Peoples Power Project which both promote nonviolent direct action were also subpoenaed. And so were officials involved in inspecting the pipeline route on behalf of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe including Dr. Kelly Morgan an archeologist for the tribe and Tim Mentz the tribe’s former tribal historic preservation officer who submitted key testimony in a case arguing that the pipeline would harm culturally significant sites.

In an objection to its subpoena the Water Protector Legal Collective noted that it has provided legal support in more than 800 criminal cases and argued that the subpoena is “seeking the records of a legal organization akin to a law office including communications by between and among WPLC-associated attorneys WPLC staff and its clients.” The group said the subpoena was “an assault by Energy Transfer and Dakota Access upon the attorney client-privilege itself” and “a fishing expedition.”

The Water Protector Legal Collective subpoena even requested communications with members of the press. “This is a clear attempt to inhibit communications by an advocacy organization with the press in violation of WPLC’s first amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution” the collective said in its objection.

Mentz and Morgan for their part have objected to the subpoena on the grounds that the documents Energy Transfer is demanding are the property of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe which is protected from such third-party subpoenas by sovereign immunity.

Unicorn Riot has been forced to dedicate a sizable portion of its limited resources to deciding how to handle the sweeping subpoena even as the group maintains round-the-clock coverage of the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin who killed George Floyd last summer and sparked a nationwide protest movement. “We are committed to bringing you hard hitting journalism and will not bow to attempts to intimidate or interfere with our reporting” the organization stated on its new legal defense fund page.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb21pY3Mvc3BlYWstdXAtYS1uZXctYXV0aXN0aWMtdGhlbWVkLWdyYXBoaWMtbm92ZWwtYnktcmViZWNjYS1idXJnZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Speak Up! a New Autistic-Themed Graphic Novel by Rebecca Burgess,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/comics/speak-up-a-new-autistic-themed-graphic-novel-by-rebecca-burgess/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb21pY3Mvc3BlYWstdXAtYS1uZXctYXV0aXN0aWMtdGhlbWVkLWdyYXBoaWMtbm92ZWwtYnktcmViZWNjYS1idXJnZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS05NDMyOTA3L0lzLUJpZGVuLVJFQUwtcmVhc29uLUxhY2hsYW4tTXVyZG9jaC1sZWZ0LUxBLUF1c3RyYWxpYS5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTk0MzI5MDcvYW1wL0lzLUJpZGVuLVJFQUwtcmVhc29uLUxhY2hsYW4tTXVyZG9jaC1sZWZ0LUxBLUF1c3RyYWxpYS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Biden the REAL reason Lachlan Murdoch left LA for Australia?,"Lachlan Murdoch his supermodel wife Sarah and their three children quietly arrived in Australia from Los Angeles last month.

And while no reason was given for the family's return Down Under a new report has claimed that it was the political climate in the US that helped make the decision for the family to leave LA in favour of their Sydney home.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald the family 'felt the cold winds of political change' when Joe Biden assumed power over Donald Trump after the family-owned Fox News appeared to favour the Republican Party throughout the election campaign.

A source said: 'The school communities here are very close knit and it extends into the wider families and the circles and parties they all go to. That Hollywood set is very pro-Democratic.

'They are mostly big fundraisers for Biden so you can imagine how well it went down when one of their classmates' dads is at the helm of the biggest anti-Biden machine in the country.'

The man most likely to take over his father Rupert's global empire arrived in Australia last month via private jet.

The family completed the mandatory quarantine period for international visitors by remaining confined to their luxury home in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

The Murdochs bought the beautiful Georgian mansion in Sydney's Bellevue Hill in 2009 for $23 million and then reportedly spent $11.67 million renovating the property.

They also purchased an adjoining property for more $4.4 million in 2018. In the current Sydney market the estate would be worth closer to $50 million.

Despite their life in Los Angeles where Lachlan is Executive Chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation the couple has always maintained the home in Sydney where they first met in the late 1990s before marrying in 1999.

It's not known how long the glamorous family plan to stay in Australia although a large 90th birthday for patriarch Rupert is said to be planned for July this year in California."

(Sam Gehrke)

Nike hasn't paid a cent in federal income taxes for three years.

And the Beaverton sportswear giant—which regularly spars with cultural conservatives—can largely thank former President Donald Trump for its good fortune.

That’s the finding of a new study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy which reports that Nike—a company that generated $4.1 billion of taxable revenue in the past three years—hugely benefited from a tax bill championed by President Trump.

The study named 55 major corporations that didn't pay taxes last year including gas and oil companies software companies and food companies. Nike and the shipping company FedEx are the two biggest names on the list as The New York Times reported Friday morning.

The report was released as President Joe Biden discusses a corporate tax overhaul that would fund his infrastructure and green energy plan. Biden's plan would eliminate tax breaks that result in some companies paying an effective tax rate of zero.

Nike used several major deductions and write-offs that the 2017 tax bill allowed in its corporate framework resulting in a tax rebate for the company of $109 million on pretax income of $2.8 billion.

One of those write-offs was a federal research and experimentation credit that allows companies to write off money funneled toward research initiatives and projects.

In November the company notified state officials it was laying off 700 employees at its world headquarters in Beaverton.

Nike representatives did not respond to a request for comment from WW on the report.

Along with opening Nike's books the report highlights a paradox: Oregon's flagship company gains social capital from championing progressive values and equity (and outraging the right wing) but it quietly benefits from the economic policies of Republicans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzQvbmlrZS16ZXJvLWZlZGVyYWwtaW5jb21lLXRheC10aHJlZS15ZWFycy1pbmZv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Paid Zero Federal Income Tax in the Last Three Years,"Nike hasn’t paid any Federal Income Tax in the last three years even though it’s made about $4.1 billion USD in profits over that period.

According to New York Times the American footwear giant was just one among several corporations who were able to avoid paying federal income taxes legally. “This continues a decades-long trend of corporate tax avoidance by the biggest U.S. corporations” notes ITEP (The Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy). “The tax-avoiding companies represent various industries and collectively enjoyed almost $40.5 billion in U.S. pretax income in 2020.”

According to the ITEP much of this corporate tax avoidance was made possible by the Tax Reform Plan of 2017 carried out by the Republican majority Congress and approved by President Donald Trump. This allowed large companies to significantly trim their tax bills reducing corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent. Nike and other companies found it could also use tax breaks for executive stock options to “sharply reduce [its] income taxes.” ITEP adds “Nike didn’t pay a dime of federal income tax on almost $2.9 billion USD of U.S. pretax income last year instead enjoying a $109 million tax rebate.”

Nike also took advantage of the CARES Act a stimulus bill signed by President Donald Trump aimed at helping businesses and families impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It allowed Nike to “carry back” losses in 2020 to offset some of its profits from the previous years.

Bernie Sanders also pointed out Nike’s tax avoidance on Twitter: “If you paid $120 for a pair of Nike Air Force 1 shoes you paid more to Nike than it paid in federal income taxes over the past 3 years while it made $4.1 billion USD in profits and Nike’s founder Phil Knight became over $23 billion richer.”

The customised Nike Air Max 97s which each contain a drop of human blood have also stoked outrage among conservative politicians.

Nike said “sophisticated sneakerheads were confused” by the shoes and succeeded in its attempt to block MSCHF from shipping to customers any of 666 sold-out pairs.

MSCHF however describes itself as a “conceptual art collective” which “engage[s] fashion art tech and capitalism in various often unexpected mediums”.

Responding to the Nike suit on its website it insisted the shoes were “art created for people to observe speculate on purchase and own” and added: “Satan is as much part of the art historical canon as Jesus from Renaissance Hellmouths to Milton.”

“We are not affiliated with Nike” it said “as we have consistently iterated to the press. We were honestly surprised by the action Nike has taken and immediately after Nike’s counsel sent us notice we reached out but received no response.”

MSCHF previously created a batch of all-white “Jesus shoes” which contained so-called holy water. Nike did not sue then.

In legal documents regarding the “Satan shoes” Nike said MSCHF had “materially altered” its shoes “to prominently feature a Satanic theme … without Nike’s approval or authorisation”.

Nike also rejected the claim to the status of art saying MSCHF “did not create a single shoe-shaped sculpture to sit in a museum” and instead “created hundreds of shoes emblazoned with a NikeSwoosh that it sold to allcomers”.

Lil Nas X who had offered the final pair of the shoes as a competition prize told followers: “Sorry guys I’m legally not allowed to give the 666th away anymore because of the crying nerds on the internet.

“I feel like it’s fucked up they have so much power they can get shoes cancelled. Freedom of expression gone out the window.”

MSCHF said it “strongly believe[d] in the freedom of expression … and nothing is more important than our ability and the ability of other artists like us to continue our work over the coming years.”

It also said the Satan Shoes project “started a conversation while also living natively in its space”.

I forgot to mention they also released 666 pairs of the black and red shoes.Oh yes. The shoes “dropped” to coincide with the release of Lil Nas X’s latest single and priced at $1018 were sold out in less than a minute according to MSCHF.Nope there’s more. Nike is suing MSCHF (but not Lil Nas X) saying it did not approve or authorise the customised shoes and that the shoes are likely to “create an erroneous association between MSCHF’s products and Nike”.Well yes they are Nike shoes with the swoosh and the signature Nike air bubble cushioning sole. The company says there were already calls to boycott Nike over the shoes because of the “mistaken belief” that the company authorised the shoes.It references the verse “So He told them I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven"". Lil Nas X’s video also alludes to it where he’s featured sliding down a pole from heaven to hall before dancing with Satan and then snapping his neck. The rapper came out in 2019 and the song’s supposed to reject society’s attempt to shame him.Uhm he tweeted several memes in response to it and to the criticism from conservatives.

Las Vegas Nashville Phoenix and more:Amtrak would expand connect new cities under Joe Biden's infrastructure plan

Amtrak subsequently released its 2035 vision plan which includes an added route that passes through Greenville and goes to Charlotte North Carolina; Atlanta Georgia; and Birmingham Alabama.

On May 27 Amtrak released more information about the plan which clarified that there would be three round trips between Charlotte and Atlanta — each with a stop in Greenville.

Here's what we know:

The new corridor vision plan includes three round trips between Atlanta and Charlotte with stops in Greenville on each trip.

A stop in Spartanburg remains to be determined according to Amtrak public relations manager Kimberly Woods.

Two Atlanta to Charlotte round trips would extend to include Raleigh North Carolina as part of a new Piedmont service.

The new line would run from Charlotte to Greenville to Atlanta to Birmingham adding frequency of trips to an Amtrak line that already runs through Greenville.

The plan is to be completed in 2035 though Amtrak hopes for it to be completed sooner.

The current train station on Washington Street is owned by Norfolk Southern and Amtrak only rents an office for its current line according to Greenville Mayor Knox White.

The new corridor vision plan lists Norfolk Southern as a potential ""host railroad.""

More information about station development and ticket costs will be announced in the coming weeks according to Amtrak's public relations manager Kimberly Woods.

""I think from an economic-development standpoint and from just quality of lifestyle having more frequent service down to particularly to Atlanta and beyond could grow into something monumental"" Mayor White said. ""I think just really a great step forward.""

The new plan does not include an added route through South Carolina that connects Greenville Columbia and Charleston and some in the state have lamented that.

Amtrak officials are hoping Congress will provide the $80 billion designated for rail in Biden's American Jobs Plan announced Wednesday.

The vision plan would add at least 30 new routes and add more trips to at least 20 existing routes.

Amtrak's CEO Bill Flynn wrote a letter to Congress requesting legislative action.

""Amtrak has a bold vision to bring energy-efficient world-class intercity rail service to up to 160 new communities across the nation as we also invest in our fleet and stations across the U.S."" Flynn said in a statement.

The plan includes adding 39 potential new routes and more trips or other enhancements on 25 existing routes nationwide.

Amtrak served 32 million riders in the U.S. in fiscal year 2019 and expects the vision plan to add 20 million more.

The victim was identified as David Breault 29 of Lexington Township.

Rick Walters an investigator with the Stark County Coroner's Office said the train's crew called 911 at 3:12 p.m. to report the collision which occurred just west of the northern end of Deer Creek Reservoir and just east of the former village of Limaville. The victim died instantly.

Walters said the crew reported sounding the train's horn but the man for an unknown reason failed to clear the tracks. The train could not stop in time to avoid hitting him.

Whether Breault saw the training approaching ""is still under investigation"" Stark County sheriff's Sgt. William Konic said. ""He was pronounced dead at the scene. The train was stopped. The conductor was interviewed. All of that is still under investigation.""

Investigators will review video footage from the train's cameras as part of the investigation Walters said. An autopsy is scheduled for Monday.

Price Street was closed at the railroad tracks for about three hours as investigators scoured the scene for clues before the train was moved.

Erik M. Rivas was a hunter who respected animals and loved nature so it wasn't unusual for him to leave the house often and go for walks said grandmother Julia Weyant.

However the Manchester teen never came back this time and family members say his death felt like a slap in the face because they never saw it coming.

""It's not just us as a family that can't grasp this. The school can't the church he went to can't; nobody ever saw this coming from him — never"" Weyant said. ""That's what was so bad because he never showed a sign up until I found his empty bed on Tuesday morning.""

Erik died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the abdomen at 9:23 a.m. March 23 near railroad tracks in the area of Gut Road and Wago Road in East Manchester Township according to the York County Coroner's Office.

Northeastern Regional Police responded after Norfolk Southern Railway employees discovered his body and called 911 according to his grandmother — who was already at the police station when the call came through because she had been searching for Erik that morning.

'Such a great gentleman': The teen had received treatment — taking antidepressants going to therapy — for about two years and he showed signs of progress leading up to his death family members said.

""We all thought he really did conquer his voices and his fears and he was growing up to be such a great gentleman"" Weyant said. ""How do we make people see this? Because we didn't.""

Professional help and care from relatives wasn't enough which is why Erik's family members say they want to share his story — in the hope that it will save others.

York County has had 12 deaths by suicide so far in 2021; Erik is the only minor county Coroner Pam Gay said.

Despite a significant decline in the number of suicides over the past two years in the county — there were 60 in 2020 down from 70 in 2019 and 92 in 2018 — one death is still too many said Cindy Richard chairperson of the nonprofit Suicide Prevention of York.

There probably were warning signs in Erik's suicide as in many cases but people don't know what they are she said.

""They just didn't see the warning signs either because they didn't know them or they weren't just loud and clear — and a lot of times they're not loud and clear"" Richard said.

Warning signs: Suicide is complex and occurs because of a combination of factors rather than any single reason she said.

One warning sign is talking about being a burden to others according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Erik left a suicide letter detailing his past traumas and how he wanted to deal with them on his own because he didn't want to burden anyone according to family members.

Another sign is showing relief or sudden improvement which Weyant said described her grandson who ""was starting to feel more confident” after treatment and therapy.

""That's what fools people because they think that they've finally got this person over the hump"" Richard said. ""You can't let your guard down because at that point they one are either deciding not to take their life or two they are comfortable with taking their life. The plan is in place. They know when they're going to do it.""

It's especially the case if they've already planned their funeral she said. Erik in his letter laid out instructions for his burial according to his aunt Brandi Weyant-Ceron.

""The majority of the people who die by suicide would give the shirt off their back to anyone. And so they're seen as a very caring loving taking care of other people type of person"" Richard said. ""What people think is the type of person who takes their life there is no type but people feel like there is. And the person who takes their life does not match up with that type of person that they have in their mind.""

Withdrawal from activities is another indication and could have contributed in Erik's case because he was cut off from in-person interactions at school due to the COVID-19 shutdown his grandmother said adding she believes it played a part.

It's unclear the extent to which the pandemic has increased the national rate of teen suicide but experts emphasize that suicide is preventable even during times of extraordinary stress.

""He was getting mental health help but a lot of times it's just not enough for many reasons. A lot of people have died by suicide within the same day or days after they've been released from a mental health care facility"" Richard said. ""I don't know (why).""

Most Americans said in a 2020 national survey that they would step in to stop someone they know who is at risk of suicide. But the signs may not always be recognized by the person's loved ones Richard said.

A public memorial for Erik was held Wednesday evening at Bible Baptist Church in Conewago Township. The Northeastern High School junior who was buried Wednesday would have turned 17 the next day.

""I think we probably did do what we were supposed to do"" Weyant-Ceron said. ""Ultimately a part of this counted on him to open up to us but I just feel like was there something else I could have said that would have been the right question to have him share with us what he was feeling?""

As Richard put it for people experiencing distress ""It's OK to not be OK.""

In fact from the 2015 Vivint Houston Open to the 2017 Northern Trust the noted Longhorn held the 54-hole lead on a dozen occasions winning nine times. He left the other three as runner-up.

But then the 11-time PGA Tour champ fell into a slump nobody could foresee especially for someone so young and seemingly at the start of a long stretch of dominance. A 2017 season that saw him win thrice including the Open Championship at Royal Birkdale seemed long gone from his rearview mirror as the calendar flipped to 2021.

And even when Spieth returned to form in recent weeks holding the 54-hole lead three times since February he still lacked a piece that once was his calling card — closing the deal.

On Sunday at TPC San Antonio’s Oaks Course things sure felt a lot like 2017 again.

Spieth withstood a charge from veteran Charley Hoffman but kept his cool and made big shots down the stretch capturing his first title in 1351 days this one in his home state.

For the 44-year-old Hoffman the chase was an impressive one as he matched Spieth’s 33 on the front and then posted birdies on Nos. 13 and 14 to keep the pressure on. He took his biggest punch at No. 16 burying a 20-foot putt from the fringe to pull within one.

But the final stretch at the Greg Norman-designed course was Spieth’s strength throughout the week. He entered Sunday at 10 under on holes 12 through 18 and didn’t falter.

Hoffman had an 18-foot putt on No. 17 that would have temporarily pushed him into a tie but he missed. Spieth followed by burying his own birdie putt — his 11th one-putt of the day — to take a two-stroke lead to the final hole.

Matt Wallace who held the lead with Spieth heading into Sunday never threatened in third place. Lucas Glover used a big day to pull near the top shooting a 66 to finish 12 under all alone in fourth.

Gary Woodland Brandt Snedeker Chris Kirk and Anirban Lahiri finished tied for fifth at 9 under.

The victory put Spieth in an interesting position for the upcoming Masters as his three other major victories have all followed similar patterns:

• Prior to winning the 2015 Masters Spieth finished T-2 at the Shell Houston Open and second at the Valero.

• Prior to winning the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay he finished T-3 at the Memorial.

• Prior to winning the 2017 Open Championship Spieth won the Travelers.

Spieth will now try to become just the third player since 1960 to win at Augusta after winning the week before the Masters. Sandy Lyle did so in 1988 after winning the Greensboro and Phil Mickelson turned the trick after capturing the BellSouth Classic.

""It's unbearable a helicopter operation of this nature here in Kensington shouldn't be operating in a residential area"" Roger de Bray former Top Energy chief executive who now lives 100m from the Kensington helicopter base said.

Whangārei mayor Sheryl Mai said she was aware of increasing noise complaints about the helicopter operation which would be moving out of the site as a result.

""The helicopters are like a freight train going through the house sometimes several times a night"" de Bray said.

Northland Emergency Services Trust (NEST) responded to 1115 callouts last year – its busiest ever. There have been 300 flights to date this year.

""What are the future plans to deal with the increasing level of disturbance?"" Allan Kerrisk former New Zealand Fire Service operations manager for Northland and area commander for the Far North and a Kensington resident who lives about 750m from the base said.

The move will mean an up to about $8 million new location rebuild – that Northlanders could be asked to pay towards - for the only rescue helicopter base north of Auckland - amid a shortage of suitable sites and increasingly vocal public demanding the set-up of any new facility goes through a publicly notified resource consent process where they get to have their say.

NEST has transported more than 21000 patients since the operation began in 1988.

Whangārei District Council (WDC) chief executive Rob Forlong said in a March 23 letter to de Bray the base was to shift on or before its site lease expired on July 31 2023.

NEST chief executive Craig Gibbons conceded the operation's noise was disturbing neighbours. The trust did not want to be doing this.

""Enough is enough. We have outgrown our own base and outstayed our welcome from the locals"" Gibbons said.

Trish Cutforth WDC Denby ward councillor said it was time the helicopter base moved.

""I think NEST needs to look for a more appropriate location. It's starting to outlive its social licence for the site"" Cutforth said.

""People have given it a social licence but a tipping point's now been reached"" Cutforth said.

That had been in the past three months when building flight numbers in the past few years had suddenly escalated.

""I'm wondering if that's because of the increasing workload of non-emergency work"" Cutforth said.

She said her constituents had increasingly complained about the growing helicopter noise.

The trust runs three helicopters worth more than $10 million out of its 33-year-old Western Hills/State Highway 1 base on leased St John and WDC land. St John runs its ambulance service out of the same site.

Forlong in his letter to de Bray confirmed the base did not have a resource consent. It operated under WDC's prevailing District Plan.

De Bray took his helicopter concerns to an unscheduled short-notice March 23 WDC Long Term Plan meeting at Whangārei's Quarry Gardens attended by the mayor and Cutforth.

Mai told the meeting WDC had met NEST earlier that day. Forlong said later NEST would be leaving the site.

""As a result of that (NEST) meeting I can confirm that NEST is looking to move its operation and intends to exit the site on or before the expiry of its lease on July 31 2023"" Forlong said.

Gibbons said the base would be shifted.

""I want to be out of Kensington Park hopefully before the end of the year"" Gibbons said.

He said NEST had acted responsibly with the base's noise management through noise abatement procedures and the international Fly Neighbourly programme. It also complied with CAA requirements. But there was always opportunity for improvement.

Gibbons was in Whangārei last week for a two-day investigation into further addressing Kensington base noise issues.

An interim improved noise mitigation management programme was needed before NEST moved out of Kensington de Bray said.

Forlong said in his letter to de Bray NEST would be providing WDC with a document outlining new noise mitigation actions ""in a few days"" in the wake of the council's meeting with the trust.

Gibbons said flight numbers had increased significantly in the last three years in particular. The five-tonne Sikorskys were quite a loud helicopter.

""... NEST have acknowledged the noise complaints they have received and will be taking actions to minimise the noise where possible. NEST will be providing us with a document which sets out their noise mitigation procedures within the next few days."" Forlong said.

The de Brays have just spent $4000 on new ceiling noise insulation in their bedroom and pending new soundproof window glass.

Roger's wife Ruth de Bray said the irregularity of the helicopters' 24/7 arrival and departure meant it was impossible to get used to the noise. Her blood pressure had risen and she now also regularly took sleeping pills to get some sleep during the night after noise and vibration waking her as helicopters flew overhead. About 30 per cent of NEST flights are at night.

The helicopter site has 35 people including 16 pilots 10 contracted St John paramedics including winch operators flight paramedics and rescue swimmers and a five-person engineering team.

Tony Devanney St John Northland district operations manager said his organisation was supportive of NEST relocation plans.

""We are aware of NEST's plan to relocate and we are supportive. It will have no impact on our emergency ambulance response and we will continue to deliver the same level of patient care"" Devanney said.

Gibbons said NEST had no expectation that St John also correspondingly moved its ambulance base from the site when the trust exited the location.

Kerrisk said NEST needed to better communicate with its neighbours.

Kerrisk and the de Brays both support the NEST emergency rescue helicopter service but not its current base.",,,,,,

I So Failed.,"Here's What You Need to Remember: Barrett is now under contract to deliver M107A1 .50-Cal Long Range Sniper Rifle systems to the US Army in an $8 million deal which includes scopes suppressors and square parts kits.

(Kingman Ariz.) My shoulder was pressed firmly against the end or “stock” of the rifle my index finger extended horizontally just above the trigger as I lay flat on the ground and tried to align my right eye directly through the targeting sight -- all as I for the very first time tried to fire a US military M107A1 sniper rifle at a small target roughly 200 yards away.

While being closely coached by an expert sniper from Barrett the gun’s maker I attempted to align my eye directly through the scope in a direct linear fashion. I found that if my view shifted ever so slightly from one side to the other I lost the target picture and saw only black. This I understand is a technical design set up to deliberately ensure the person looking through the scope can only see if he or she is exactly aligned with a straight-ahead view at the target.

Then while being instructed by the expert I struggled to line up what looked like a thin black cross targeting line or “reticle” through the scope - with a small blue target circle hidden between bushes in a desert firing range about 200-yards away. The targeting scope itself shows what looks like a narrowly configured intensely magnified picture of a circular area of terrain ahead with a “reticle” crossing straight through the eye view. The intent as I understood is to precisely align the center of the cross with the intended target and pull the trigger -- to achieve precision destruction. Snipers rotate a small circular device attached to the weapon's sight - and ""click"" one way or another - as it is called - to align the crosshairs with the target and adjust the reticle for wind range or elevation changes.

The desert firing area was set up as part of a massive live-fire weapons demonstration in rural Northwestern Arizona - called the Bushmaster User Conference 2019 sponsored by Bushmaster cannon-maker Northrop Grumman. The sniper rifles were a small part of a large collection of weapons including emerging 50mm cannons lightweight 30mm cannons and other weapons many of them mounted onto armored combat vehicles.

As for the sniper rifle it was nearly five-feet long at “57 inches with a cylinder-like suppressor at the end and a weight of about 28-pounds. Barrett is now under contract to deliver M107A1 .50-Cal Long Range Sniper Rifle systems to the US Army in an $8 million deal which includes scopes suppressors and square parts kits. Barrett information on the gun specifies as having a ""lightweight aluminum upper receiver with integral optics"" Barrett data further describes the weapon as having a ""barrel with fully chrome-lined chamber and bore 10-round steel magazine with cartridge witness indicators and anti-corrosive coating.""

Taking the Shot

My expert sniper coach was Bryan James Senior Vice President of Sales Barrett; he told me to lay flat spread my legs apart widen my elbows and firmly press the stock against my shoulder to steady the shot and prepare for a “jolt” or recoil after the weapon fires.

Before I tried a shot I first looked through the Spotter’s Scope a magnified view of the target area with numbers around what looked like a black semi-circle to account for a variety of interwoven key factors -- such as wind speed location angle and other variables likely to impact the accuracy of the shot. Then I was ready to fire.

While unknown to me as I attempted my first ever sniper shot the Barrett M107A1 is considered a large sniper rifle which fires a .50-cal bullet. The larger bullet can of course destroy an individual enemy fighter yet the .50-cal sniper bullet is primarily designed to destroy or disable thin skinned enemy vehicles and small structures or fortifications. As one former Army weapons expert explained it to me the M107A1 is the kind of weapon which could be used to hit destroy or disable the engine of an enemy vehicle.

Just before taking off the safety arming the rifle and moving my finger down onto the trigger I worked to move the reticle right on the target. I saw that the crosshairs were a little below the target so I tried to lift up the barrel of the gun to squarely place the center of the cross right on the “blue circle” target in the desert bushes. The blue circle target was lodged on the upward slope of what looked like a large valley making it difficult to know what was precisely level or straight across from the hill where I was taking aim.

After struggling to slowly pull the shot up just a little I tried to stay as steady as possible - and pulled the trigger. In what seemed like an instant or milliseconds the stock of the gun slammed back into my shoulder and I saw smoke in the bushes a few football fields away. While I heard the round exit the weapon I must say the firing was actually not very loud at all -- thus the impact of the suppressor.

A bit stunned I lifted my head back from the rifle and had absolutely no idea if I had hit anything - let alone the target. At that moment Bryan told me I had blasted a hole right through the center of the target. Exact hit! My one and only first sniper rifle shot of all time. I was delighted and very impressed with my coach.I decided I would not make another attempt so as to retain a perfect (if very lucky and well coached) record.

However before I praise myself too profusely there are several factors to consider. First and foremost the Barrett M107A1 -- a famous sniper rifle used regularly by the US military -- can hit ranges with great precision out to 2000 meters. My hit was only 200 yards. Hardly any comparison. Furthermore from what I understand longer shots require a much greater degree of adjustment when it comes to difficult fast changing factors such as wind speed target movement range and even a need to factor in the rotation of the earth in some cases.

After hitting what any actual sniper would consider an easy shot I left the scene with a vastly increased appreciation for the expertise focus and dedication necessary to perform high-level wartime sniper missions. Not only do trained snipers hit targets precisely at nearly 10-times the distance of my shot but they track and destroy moving targets as well -- all while not giving away their position. I came to more fully understand why many regard a sniper's mission as requiring physical mathematical and mental excellence.

The UAE-based global satellite operator Al Yah Satellite Communications Company (Yahsat) has seen immense strides in both technology and opportunity over the last year. In the face of a pandemic and unpredictable space market Yahsat prevailed with ingenuity and strategic partnerships that are enabling the company to quickly emerge as a leader in the industry and a principal stakeholder and contributor to the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) transformation as a space economy.

In less than a decade since it launched its first satellite Yahsat has grown to be a global enterprise with an enviable track record of accomplishments that are a source of pride to the UAE. Emirati in spirit its approach is very international and inclusive. Through its various businesses – Yahsat Government Solutions Thuraya YahClick and Yahlive Yahsat caters to diverse markets nationalities and creeds.

By revenue Yahsat is among the top ten satellite services operators in the world. Yahsat presently covers 80% of the world’s population across 5 continents. By offering both fixed and mobile satellite solutions it is one of the only operators in the world to do so. It provides services on C Ku Ka and L-bands. The company is owned by Mubadala one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds which drives the diversification of Abu Dhabi’s growth.

“Made in the UAE”

As an industry catalyst Yahsat is enabling a diversified UAE economy. Through longstanding partnerships with the UAE Armed Forces and other national initiatives Yahsat is driving local growth and aims to encourage national production of advanced communication technologies.

In February Yahsat signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Tawazun Economic Council to establish a new company that will develop critical in-country capabilities. This is an active partnership aiming to develop and manufacture advanced satellite communication solutions within the UAE. The newly formed company will focus on three main streams: Aeronautical Satcom Technologies Satellite Modem Technologies and Enablement of other Satcom Products and Technologies.

These collaborations are vital to the diversification of the UAE’s economy. In fact the first seed project will include the development of a protected multi-platform satellite modem for government and defense markets in the UAE and internationally. The new company will harness local knowledge manufacturing capabilities and technology leadership to propel national industrialization. While the new efforts will rely on and leverage expertise in the UAE the team plans to simultaneously engage select international experts to grow as a global leader in this sector.

Yahsat is also charged with ensuring that the new company’s products meet the requirements of its government customers. The goal is enabling the UAE Government and other users to address key technology development. It will source key product development capabilities from leading solution providers and manufacturers to lay the foundation for local production lines and integrated value chain management.

This Yahsat and Tawazun partnership could simultaneously infuse the local economy while establishing the UAE as a producer of satellite-enabled defense communication technologies solidifying the country as a sustainable and sovereign space economy. The company is helping the country to fulfill its goals of gaining further autonomy through several initiatives: the Programme Management Office (PMO) and the Yahsat Space Programme Masters.

“The real asset of any advanced nation is its people…” ~ Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.

Programme Management Office: Homegrown Talent

Yahsat is leading the drive to develop homegrown talent clearing the way for greater autonomy for the UAE in the space and satellite sector. Today 51% of Yahsat’s workforce is Emirati and 92% of its satellite operators are UAE nationals.

In 2020 Yahsat established a Programme Management Office (PMO) for Thuraya 4-NGS its new L-band satellite being built by Airbus. Thuraya 4-NGS is part of a US $500 million programme that will transform Thuraya’s space and ground systems enabling its next generation products and solutions portfolio.

Yahsat has chosen six Emirati engineers from its Technology Department to form the PMO which will oversee the design assembly integration and testing phases of the satellite subsystems while focusing on the timely delivery of the spacecraft for launch in late 2023. All team members have played key roles in delivering Yahsat’s previous satellite programmes and bring solid hands-on experience to the Thuraya 4-NGS PMO team.

Beyond managing different aspects of spacecraft development the newly formed PMO will serve as the primary liaison between the satellite manufacturer Airbus and Yahsat’s headquarters to ensure a smooth on-time delivery. In addition there will be a separate team of engineers under the supervision of the PMO that will gain unprecedented insights into the workings of the state-of-the-art all-electric Airbus Eurostar Neo Platform through on-the-job training and knowledge transfer.

Thuraya 4-NGS is scheduled to be operational by 2024 and until the completion of the programme the PMO team will be based out of Airbus’s manufacturing bases in Toulouse France and Portsmouth in the United Kingdom as well as at the eventual launch site.

In addition Yahsat hosts In-house career development programmes. These programmes are designed to attract and retain talented Emirati engineering and non-engineering personnel. They offer multiple opportunities for career development and on-the-job training with leading local regional and international satellite technology providers. The Yahsat Mentorship Programme enables early career team members to learn business and leadership skills from senior colleagues.

The Middle East’s First Master’s Space Programme

Yahsat is committed to using connectivity as a tool to help drive social change increase education opportunities and develop communities. Through a partnership with Northrop Grumman and Khalifa University Yahsat created the first multidisciplinary academic space programme in the UAE.

The Yahsat Space Programme offers the Middle East’s first Masters curriculum in Space Systems and Technology. As part of the academic experience Yahsat offers students access to the Yahsat Space Laboratory.

The laboratory priority is skills development for Emirati Engineering Graduates. The Yahsat Space Laboratory is the first space systems lab in UAE with Autonomous Intelligent Vehicles (AIV) facilities that can cater CubeSats of up to 6U and a mass up to 10 kgs. Currently the lab supports four nanosatellite projects: MYSat-1; MYSat-2 (Yahsat funded); MeznSat; and the UAE MiniSat Competition (UAESA funded). It offers a VHF/UHF/S-Band Ground station capable of autonomous operations. To day the lab has actively participated in the Young Future Energy Leaders Ektashif outreach Program. and space events.

The Masters programme has inspired youth involvement in the sector prompting Yahsat to establish a Youth Council. The Council is a group led by promising Emirati space and satellite professionals that teach STEM education throughout the UAE. Through educational fairs camps and other related campaigns these professionals build awareness for space opportunities and innovation directly with school and college students.

In fact in 2020 the Ministry of Education recognized Yahsat with an Award of Appreciation at the National Science Technology and Innovation Festival while the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratization awarded them “Best Company of the Year”.

“They say the sky’s the limit…and we say that the sky and outer space are just the beginning” ~ Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.

Satellite Innovations and Long Game

What does all this heavy investment in people mean?

For one the UAE is veering away from hydrocarbons and transitioning into a knowledge-based economy. In 2020 when Yahsat commenced construction of Thuraya 4-NGS the next-generation telecommunications system for Thuraya it bolstered a shift for the nation. In its quest to be a leading aerospace and defense technology hub Yahsat contributions in and for the UAE are fast-tracking its space programme. This is in line with the vision and aspirations of its leadership.

In addition as the UAE’s primary satellite operator driving its critical satellite and communications programmes Yahsat is playing a key role in orchestrating the shift from hydrocarbons to advanced space and satellite technologies. It has built an impressive network of international alliances and joint ventures with top space and satellite technology developers such as Northrop Grumman Airbus SES and Hughes.

In a long term plan to maintain and grow these critical relationships it is no wonder Yahsat is investing so carefully in grooming its next generation of leaders to manage the company’s satellite operations. Their team will play an important role in developing the next generation of Emirati talent and inspiring the next set of leaders in the industry.

Social impact

Yahsat is going one step further: to serve humanity. By working with educational institutions NGOs and relief organizations through a network of Service Partners Yahsat support and sponsors a range of social responsibility projects and activities. In line with the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 Yahsat has a fundamental commitment to contribute to the welfare of the people of the UAE.

Yahsat’s role in connecting communities has become ever more critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through partnerships with the UAE Ministry of Education and Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge free satellite broadband services are offered in support of e-learning initiatives across the country. In a recent move Yahsat has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Emirates Red Crescent Authority to enable educational and humanitarian initiatives in areas cut off from terrestrial telecommunication networks.

As a signatory of the UN Crisis Connectivity Charter Yahsat is working to solve the communication challenges faced by first responders and health missions in the impoverished regions of the world. Thuraya provides them a centralized always-on satellite communications platform that is independent of terrestrial systems and hence unaffected by disasters and other large scale disruptions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L3NwYWNldGVjaC1yYWNlLXdoaWNoLWNvbXBhbmllcy1hcmUtbGVhZGluZy1hdC10aGUtZm9yZWZyb250L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spacetech Race: Which Companies are Leading at the Forefront?,Today the mother earth is undergoing a crucial time.

Indeed the two aircraft share exactly the same wingspan. Northrop adopted the flying wing shape for the B-2 because it offers the advantage of a low radar cross-section.

As the United States approached World War II it enjoyed the luxury of many innovative aircraft companies and a ton of money to spend. Part of this bounty went to pursuit aircraft part to tactical attack planes and part to long-range bombers. This last generated one of the most interesting failures ever to emerge from the U.S. aviation industry; the Northrop YB-49 “flying wing” bomber.

The Flying Wing

Early aviation engineers appreciated the potential for a “flying wing” design. A flying wing which minimizes fuselage and usually eliminates the tail reduces many of the aerodynamic compromises associated with a normal fuselage reducing overall drag. However many of these features enhance stability meaning that a flying wing often lacks the stability of a traditional airframe. This makes the aircraft more difficult to fly especially before the advent of fly-by-wire technology. A flying wing can also struggle with creating space for crew payload and defensive armament as any of these can reduce the aerodynamic advantages than the shape offers.

Nevertheless engineers (especially in Germany and the Soviet Union) tried repeatedly in the interwar period to develop a viable flying wing either for transport or for military purposes. While these efforts yielded useful data they rarely resulted in practical airframes. Near the end of World War II the German successfully developed a jet fighter flying wing although it did not enter mass production.

From XB-35 to YB-49

In the early years of World War II U.S. strategists realized that it might become necessary to bomb Germany directly from the United States especially if Great Britain left the war. A U.S. Army Air Corps request triggered proposals from a Boeing-Consolidated alliance (eventually Convair) and from Northrop. The former resulted in the Convair B-36 Peacemaker the latter in the XB-35. The B-36 had a relatively conventional design; it looked more or less like a bigger version of the extant bombers of the time although it had innovative features. The XB-35 on the other hand was something new to U.S. military aviation; a flying wing. It was smaller than the B-36 but comparable in many performance features.

By 1944 the XB-35 had fallen behind the B-36 (although both suffered significant technological problems) and in any case the immediate strategic necessity for a trans-continental bomber had waned. The Air Force which acknowledged that both the B-36 and the XB-35 were largely obsolete canceled the latter instead of the former because it believed that the problems of the B-36 were easier to solve. However the U.S. Air Force (USAF) found the flying wing concept sufficiently intriguing that it proposed redesigning the XB-35 airframe around a jet rather than piston engines. Northrop developed a plan to re-engine a number of incomplete XB-35 frames with jets eventually completing three such conversions and preparing several more.

The jet engines improved the top speed of the bomber to 493 miles per hour an improvement of about 20% over its antecedent. The service ceiling of the YB-49 also increased an important consideration for escaping Soviet interceptors. However the fuel-hungry engines shrank the YB-49s combat radius making it more comparable to a medium bomber than to the long-range B-36. Unfortunately while the YB-49 could outrun the B-36 it lacked the speed of Boeing’s new B-47 Stratojet medium bomber.

Sabotage?

The YB-49 prototypes suffered an unusual run of bad luck. One prototype was lost with five crew members in June 1948 when the aircraft broke up in midflight. Another was lost during taxi when the nosewheel collapsed leading to a fire that destroyed the entire aircraft. The Air Force cancelled the contract for the YB-49 in May 1950 shortly after this second accident. The last prototype a recon variant flew until 1951 and was scrapped in 1953.

Advocates of the YB-49 long nursed the belief that the Air Force had deliberately sabotaged the program in preference for the B-36 and other later bombers. Jack Northrop founder of the company believed that the Air Force canceled the YB-49 because he would not agree to a merger with Convair. A few dark rumors implied that the accidents suffered by the YB-49 prototypes had not been accidental at all but rather the result of sabotage. No meaningful evidence has ever emerged to substantiate these allegations.

Northrop would not realize success in an all-wing airframe until decades later. The B-2 Spirit while utilizing radically different technology bears a strong visual resemblance to its distant cousin. Indeed the two aircraft share exactly the same wingspan. Northrop adopted the flying wing shape for the B-2 because it offers the advantage of a low radar cross-section. Advances in fly-by-wire technology have made the B-2 much easier to fly than the YB-49 (or the YB-35). All indications suggest that Northrop Grumman’s B-21 Raider stealth bomber will have a similar configuration as will the Xian H-20 strategic bomber and the Tupolev PAK DA.

Although the YB-49 never reached full production experience with the frame helped validate the concept which now dominates international thinking on strategic bomber design.

As TechSpot reports the 3070 in particular appears to have become Steam’s fastest growing GPU and the 17th-most popular graphics accelerator on Steam with a 1.29 percent share overall.

The top 20 GPUs on Steam as of March 2021.

The RTX 3080 also commands 0.87 percent the RTX 3060 Ti has 0.39 percent and the pricey RTX 3090 claims 0.34 percent of the market — for a total of 2.89 percent Ampere cards.

That not bad especially considering AMD’s rival RX 6000 series doesn’t have a single spot on the entire 95-GPU leaderboard. Apparently more gamers are using the 2011 Nvidia GeForce GTX 550 Ti (0.16 percent) than any of AMD’s latest cards.

More than a quarter of Steam PC gamers are now using AMD CPUs instead of Intel though so that’s probably some consolation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd2luLmdnL25ld3MvdGhlLWNvbXBsZXRlLW52aWRpYS1ndWlkZS10by1nZXR0aW5nLWJldHRlci1mcHMtaW4tdmFsb3JhbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The complete Nvidia guide to getting better FPS in Valorant,"Getting the most out of Valorant means wringing out as many frames per second as possible and these four quick tips can help players do just that.

Valorant isn’t a demanding game on players’ graphics cards but these settings will help increase FPS especially on a low-end PC. But even if players have a monster machine there’s no reason not to boost it even further with these simple options.

Four Valorant settings that will increase FPS

Our first tip starts in a surprising place the Windows 10 settings menu. Windows can be a pain sometimes but last year the operating system introduced a graphics option that actually increases FPS. It’s called hardware-scheduled graphics acceleration and even though this sounds complicated it’s easy to turn on.

Turn on Windows hardware graphics scheduling

Step 1: Open the Windows 10 settings menu.

Step 2: In the search bar type “Graphics Settings.”

Step 3: Move the slider to the ”On” position.

It’s that easy. Benchmarking showed that the setting can increase FPS from anywhere between 5 and 10 on some systems. The setting gives control of a graphics card’s memory back over to the card and that’s a good thing.

Change the Windows graphics power settings

There’s another option we can change while we’re here. This one lets players send full power to their cards regardless of whether it’s from Nvidia or AMD.

Step 1: Make sure “Classic App” is selected and then click “Browse”.

Step 2: Find Valorant’s .exe file on your hard drive. The default path is “C:\Riot Games\Valorant”.

Step 3: Select the .exe and then click “Options” before selecting “High-performance”.

Windows will now let the graphics card pull full power whenever Valorant is launched. Without Windows limiting how much power the card can use players get more FPS.

Turn on Nvidia’s low-latency mode

If you have certain Nvidia graphics cards Valorant can take advantage of the card’s built-in ultra-low latency mode which is a fancy way of saying “more frames less input lag please.”

Since the setting is built into Valorant start in the game’s main menu.

Step 1: Open Valorant’s settings menu and click “Video”

Step 2: Head on over to “Video” and scroll down until you see “Low-latency.”

Step 3: Select between “On” and “Ultra”.

Low latency has the biggest impact when games can only manage between 60-100FPS on average but the difference in smoothness is noticeable at all framerates. The “Ultra” setting theoretically helps even more but it can introduce some screen tearing.

Turn off hidden programs that use the graphics card

Turning off background programs is a common tip but many still don’t know that apps such as Discord use graphics card power by default. It’s called hardware acceleration and it eats frames for breakfast. Here’s how to turn it off.

Step 1: Open Discord and click the “Settings” button next to your profile.

Step 2: Scroll down to “Advanced” and turn off the “Hardware acceleration” setting.

The process is similar with programs like Chrome and even Steam. It’s worth a few minutes for players to go through the programs that run on their PCs and find out if any have this setting enabled.

Is it worth it to have more FPS and your refresh rate for gaming?

Even if players have more frames per second than their monitors can display more frames is always better. The more information a graphics card gets the better it can calculate the picture for the next frame. The result is a smoother picture and more crisp aiming than if players capped their FPS.

Should players cap framerates if they use a GSYNC or FreeSYNC monitor?

This is the one time players should cap their framerates. Both AMD’s FreeSYNC and Nvidia’s GSYNC systems match a monitor’s refresh rate to the output of their cards and both have special settings in the card and monitor drivers to do just that.

Valorant’s graphics won’t blow players away but the game’s abilities can drain frames away and increase input lag. The framerate tips for Riot’s shooter should go a long way to keep that from happening.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtc3RvY2stc2hvd3MtZXZlcnktc2lnbi0yMzEyMTM5OTAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA Stock Shows Every Sign Of Being Significantly Overvalued,"- By GF Value





The stock of NVIDIA (NAS:NVDA 30-year Financials) is estimated to be significantly overvalued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $552.47 per share and the market cap of $342.5 billion NVIDIA stock appears to be significantly overvalued. GF Value for NVIDIA is shown in the chart below.





NVIDIA Stock Shows Every Sign Of Being Significantly Overvalued

Because NVIDIA is significantly overvalued the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth which averaged 20% over the past three years and is estimated to grow 19.57% annually over the next three to five years.

Link: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.

It is always important to check the financial strength of a company before buying its stock. Investing in companies with poor financial strength have a higher risk of permanent loss. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great way to understand the financial strength of a company. NVIDIA has a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.50 which is in the middle range of the companies in Semiconductors industry. The overall financial strength of NVIDIA is 7 out of 10 which indicates that the financial strength of NVIDIA is fair. This is the debt and cash of NVIDIA over the past years:

NVIDIA Stock Shows Every Sign Of Being Significantly Overvalued

Companies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors who may want to purchase shares. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. NVIDIA has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months the company had a revenue of $16.7 billion and earnings of $6.89 a share. Its operating margin is 27.18% which ranks better than 92% of the companies in Semiconductors industry. Overall the profitability of NVIDIA is ranked 9 out of 10 which indicates strong profitability. This is the revenue and net income of NVIDIA over the past years:

NVIDIA Stock Shows Every Sign Of Being Significantly Overvalued

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. NVIDIA's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 85% of the companies in Semiconductors industry. NVIDIA's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 18.3% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Semiconductors industry.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months NVIDIA's return on invested capital is 43.09 and its cost of capital is 9.43. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of NVIDIA is shown below:

NVIDIA Stock Shows Every Sign Of Being Significantly Overvalued

Overall the stock of NVIDIA (NAS:NVDA 30-year Financials) shows every sign of being significantly overvalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks in the middle range of the companies in Semiconductors industry. To learn more about NVIDIA stock you can check out its 30-year Financials here.

TVB News reported that the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department busted a smuggling ring and recovered up to 300 CMP 30HX graphics cards.

The story seems like it came out of a movie. The Chinese authorities detected a suspicious fishing boat anchored just outside the Hong Kong International Airport. The sea smugglers were loading boxes from the fishing boat to a speedboat at 2 am. When their cover was blown the shady men hopped on the speedboat and sped away towards mainland waters. A high-speed boat chase ensued (insert Bourne chase music) but the astute gang got away. However the officers managed to detain the owner of the fishing boat.

The confiscated goods included typical exotic foods such as sea cucumbers and shark fins and tech products like smartphones and computer gadgets. Much to the authorities' surprise there were up to 300 unidentified graphics cards inside the boxes. According to the report the lot of tech products is valued at HK$2 million (~$257000).

The graphics cards lack branding or stickers that can provide a clue to their origins. Given the lack of display outputs these graphics cards are unquestionably CMP offerings. They feature a black and grey cooler with two cooling fans. The pricing for Nvidia's CMP graphics cards remains a mystery but we've seen the CMP 30HX hit the overseas market for as much as $723. With an estimated Ethereum hash rate up to 26 MH/s the CMP 30HX isn't even that good for mining Ethereum. However the graphics card shortage is likely affecting cryptocurrency miners as well so they'll jump on any opportunity to make a profit. Besides a contraband CMP 30HX is more affordable than buying directly from Nvidia or its partners.

With Ethereum's value soaring through the roof there is a strong demand for graphics cards. Even the big corporations are getting in on the fun. Hut 8 Mining Corp. recently purchased up to $30 Million of Nvidia CMP graphics cards. Sadly there are no signs of when the suffering will end for gamers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL252aWRpYXMtcmVzaXphYmxlLWJhci1zdXBwb3J0LXJ0eC0zMC1zZXJpZXMtZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's Resizable Bar Support for RTX 30 Series Explained,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL252aWRpYXMtcmVzaXphYmxlLWJhci1zdXBwb3J0LXJ0eC0zMC1zZXJpZXMtZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The shortage stems from a confluence of factors as carmakers which shut plants during the COVID-19 pandemic last year compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.

Consumers have stocked up on laptops gaming consoles and other electronic products during the pandemic leading to tighter inventory. They also bought more cars than industry officials expected last spring further straining supplies.

Sanctions against Chinese tech companies have further exacerbated the crisis. Originally concentrated in the auto industry the shortage has now spread to a range of other consumer electronics including smartphones refrigerators and microwaves.

With every company that uses chips in production panic buying to shore up stocks the shortage has squeezed capacity and driven up costs of even the cheapest components of nearly all microchips increasing prices of final products.

Cars

Automobiles have become increasingly dependent on chips - for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency breaking.

The crisis has forced many to curtail the production of less profitable vehicles. General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co are among the big carmakers who said they would scale down production joining other automakers including Volkswagen AG Subaru Corp Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co.

A shortage of auto semiconductor chips could impact nearly 1.3 million units of global light vehicle production in the first quarter according to data firm IHS Markit.

IHS said a fire at a Japanese chip-making factory owned by Renesas Electronics Corp which accounts for 30% of the global market for microcontroller units used in cars has worsened the situation.

Severe winter weather in Texas has also forced Samsung Electronics Co Ltd NXP Semiconductors and Infineon to shut down factories temporarily. Infineon and NXP are major automotive chip suppliers and analysts expect the disruptions to add to the shortfalls in the ailing sector.

Asian Squeeze

At the root of the squeeze is the under-investment in 8-inch chip manufacturing plants owned mostly by Asian firms which means they have struggled to ramp up production as demand for 5G phones and laptops picked up faster than expected.

Qualcomm Inc whose chips feature in Samsung phones is one major chipmaker struggling to keep up with demand. Apple Inc's major supplier Foxconn also warned of the chip shortage affecting supply chains to clients.

The majority of chip production occurs in Asia currently where major contract manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) and Samsung handle production for hundreds of different chip companies. U.S. semiconductor companies account for 47% of global chip sales but only 12% of global manufacturing is done in the United States.

What's Being Done About It?

Factories that produce wafers cost tens of billions of dollars to build and expanding their capacity can take up to a year for testing and qualifying complex tools.

U.S. President Joe Biden has sought $37 billion in funding for legislation to supercharge chip manufacturing in the country.

Currently four new factories are slated in the country two by Intel Corp and one by TSMC in Arizona and another by Samsung in Texas.

China has also offered a myriad of subsidies to the chip industry as it tries to reduce its dependence on Western technology.

Newell (USRA B-Mods) Dillon McCowan (USRA Modifieds) and Derek Brown (Medieval USRA Stock Cars) topped the Big Adventure RV Weekly Racing Series Spring Opener presented by Benne Media.

A total of 83 cars checked into the pits as the 2021 season got underway for the first of 14 Summit USRA Weekly Racing Series points programs.

Newell grabs USRA B-Mod win: J.C. Newell inherited the lead when perennial championship contenders Kris Jackson and J.C. Morton tangled on lap 14 and went on to win the Ozark Golf Cars USRA B-Mod feature.

Newell of Buffalo led the final six laps and beat Cody Nivens by a car length. Nic Hanes was third and Terry Schultz fourth.

""What a way to kick off the season"" Newell said. ""We kind of got that one handed us to us tonight but everyone got to see a really good show the first 14 or 15 laps and we were able to seal the deal.""

Newell started fourth and was running third behind Morton and Jackson when the race's complexion suddenly changed.

Jackson jumped to the lead from his outside front row starting position to grab the early lead. The race ground to a halt on lap two however with a seven-car pileup in turn three that blocked the track and resulted in a red flag.

After the restart Morton moved past Nivens and Newell and into second. Jackson led by about two car lengths when a lap-seven caution slowed the action.

Morton made the pass for the lead coming out of turn four to complete lap 14. But in turn one Jackson got into Morton and sent the new leader skidding. Race officials penalized Jackson and sent him tailback on the restart.

Morton had to pit and returned but also had to start at the rear just in front of Jackson.

Newell inherited the lead and he did not surrender it from there. Two-time track champion Morton wound up 14th and five-time champ Jackson 15th.



J.C. Newell won the USRA B-Mod main event.

McCowan earns USRA Modified triumph: Young Dillon McCowan outdueled veteran Jason Pursley to capture the Cedar Creek Beef Jerky USRA Modified feature.

The 17-year-old McCowan from Buffalo led 17 of the 20 laps. But he had to recapture command after Pursley using the inside line passed him coming to the start-finish line to complete lap 15.

McCowan came right back to regain the top spot with an outside pass the next time around as the top two weaved through slower traffic distancing themselves from the rest of the contenders.

McCowan from Urbana wound up 1.8 seconds in front of Pursley.

""It got close there for a little while but I saw that lapped traffic coming and I figured I could get him pinched if he didn't get a slide job done on me"" McCowan said. ""This is one of our first nights in our A Mod and it's rolling pretty good.""

McCowan won a couple of times at Lucas Oil Speedway in his USRA B-Mod last season but this was his first win in the USRA Modified.

""It was super fun"" McCowan said. ""I love racing this A-Mod. It's faster. More speed and more power.""

Kevin Blackburn who led the first two laps finished third with Paden Phillips in fourth.



Dillon McCowan won the USRA Modified main event.

Brown takes USRA Stock Cars debut: It was a case of new class but same winner. Derek Brown of Stoutland last year's Lucas Oil Speedway Street Stock champion captured the O'Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Cars debut.

Brown held off Rob White by a car length in a closely contested feature that saw Brown's familiar colors of white red and yellow in victory lane.

""I'm really starting to like this car"" Brown said. ""This is my fourth race (in 2021) and second win. It's pretty salty.""

Brown and David Hendrix past track champions in the Street Stock division both charged from the back half of the field and into contention by the midpoint of the feature - Hendrix 12th to second and Brown seventh to third - right behind Jaylen Wettengel.

Brown who won six times en route to the Street Stocks track title in 2020 passed Wettengel down the backstretch on lap 15 to take a lead he would not relinquish. Brown prevailed by .387 of a second over White Jr.. of Lebanon with Hendrix third and Wettengel fourth.

""It felt like we had a heck of a race there"" Brown said. ""We were definitely all in a hornet's nest there for a little bit.""

Gary Donaldson was running second behind Wettengel when he spun on lap three bringing out the caution. Donaldson won one of the two events in 2020 in which the USRA Stock Cars appeared at Lucas Oil Speedway as a guest class.

MLRA Spring Nationals next: The first special event of the season finds the Lucas Oil MLRA Late Models in the two-day 8th annual MLRA Spring Nationals presented by RacingJunk.com next Friday and Saturday. Cedar Creek Beef Jerky USRA Modifieds and O'Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Cars also will be in action both nights.

Gates open at 4 p.m. both days with hot laps at 6:30 and racing at 7:05.

For all of the fans of the light blue color worn by all Old Dominion University athletic teams before the school went to silver and slate blue we've got some good news.



The ODU football team will wear that traditional light blue worn by Nancy Lieberman Dave Twardzik Anne Donovan and Wilson Washington for the first time in 12 seasons this fall. Football Coach Ricky Rahne who pushed for the change soon after he arrived on campus nearly 15 months ago decided to keep it a secret until today's spring scrimmage at S.B. Ballard Stadium.



When former ODU quarterback Taylor Heinicke was on campus to do some promotional videos for the football program he spied a light blue jersey and smiled broadly.



""Sweet"" he said. When I asked him if he wished the Monarchs had worn them when he played Heinicke's head bobbed up and down.



""I'd love to wear that jersey now"" he said.



Game day attire featuring the light blue will go on sale soon at the ODU Bookstore soon.







The color is commonly called ""Carolina Blue."" That's a description that my boss Dr. Jason Chandler certainly loves to hear. Jason played football for the North Carolina Tar Heels.



But that's not a description all ODU fans like to hear. Former long-time sports information director Carol Hudson told me about a conversation he had with Twardzik the former basketball All-American that may sum up the feelings of most ODU fans:



""Dave and I we never call it Carolina Blue. We never associate ourselves with Carolina Blue.""



Columbia University wore the color decades before UNC and technically that's the real name of the color. But that doesn't sit well with Rahne who graduated from Cornell Columbia's Ivy League rival.



So we're calling it ""Carol Hudson Blue"" and hope you'll do the same



Senior Associate Athletic Director Bruce Stewart who administers football coined it Carol Hudson Blue more than a decade ago and the name has stuck among ODU's inner circle and among many fans.



Maybe at some point we'll try to get Carol Hudson Blue trademarked.







Rahne said his players love the color and that he loved it from the first time he saw it worn by ODU teams.



""I didn't really have to say yes to this"" he said. ""I pushed for it. I wanted it. I think they are awesome and think they are a great look.



""Every time I watch our basketball teams and baseball lacrosse or field hockey teams wear it it just looks so good. I think that's a great look for us.""



Rahne says his Monarchs will wear the blue twice next season with the first game against Buffalo a Top 25 team last season on Sept. 25. Both the jerseys and pants will be Carol Hudson Blue.



It won't happen when the Monarchs open at home against Hampton on Sept. 11 – that's a white-out game. White-out games have been a success at ODU and were a major part of Penn State's program where Rahne was offensive coordinator.



""I do love white-out games"" he said. ""I love anything that's going to energize our fan base which in turn energizes our players. Being at white-outs at Penn State that was a pretty awesome experience.



""Anything that gets our fans going gets our players going and gives us a little bit of an edge. And I think the Carol Hudson Blue jerseys will give us an edge. I think our fans are going to love them.""





Defensive end Marcus Haynes a redshirt junior from Bowie Maryland said that Rahne gathered the entire team together for the first time in more than a year on Friday for a team meeting.



Rahne had been meeting with the offense and defense separately but got everyone together to meet for reasons the players did not at first discern.



""We were all six feet apart"" he said. ""We went through a regular meeting. And then he showed us a video.""



The video begins with a graphic that says ""Code Blue"" then morphs into a player opening a bag then putting on a helmet and walking out into S.B. Ballard Stadium with a Hudson Blue jersey. There is a link to the video below.



""Everyone went crazy"" he said. ""We loved the new jerseys. Any time you get a new uniform it gives you extra motivation.""



When I explained to Haynes who Carol Hudson was he said he will tell his teammates that the uniforms are ""Hudson Blue.""



Hudson retired in 2015 after working at ODU for more than four decades – he was already working at ODU in the mid 1970s when I was a student here.



He said the older fans who loved the light blue jerseys decades ago will respond warmly when the Monarchs hit the field in them.



""For a lot of our older and some of your younger fans that's their favorite color"" he said. ""It's certainly mine.



""I think most of our fans will love it.""



You can count me among them. I can't wait to see the Monarchs enter the stadium wearing that delicious color.

Duo of the Year

We can start by crossing off Brooks and Dunn and Florida Georgia Line who simply didn’t have the prominence in the last year that the other three nominees had. A Maddie and Tae win would be refreshing; they’d be the first all-female duo to prevail since The Judds 30 years ago. And it wouldn’t be farfetched; they had a hit in 2020 with their song “Die From a Broken Heart” which peaked at number-22 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number-two on the country charts. However given how dominant the other two nominees have been we might see Maddie and Tae snubbed yet again.

Dan and Shay are the most commercially successful duo here and they’ve won for the last two years. Their song “10000 Hours” with Justin Bieber peaked at number-four on the Hot 100 and they had an extra top-40 hit with “I Should Probably Go To Bed.” That said they’ll have to face Brothers Osborne who have more nominations this year including Album of the Year (“Skeletons”) and who will probably get some extra support after TJ Osborne’s coming out. Nashville might think this is the best year to go all-in on the Osbornes and perhaps the ACMs are the place to start. Could we see them go all the way to the Grammys too? Maybe but at the very least I think they’ll win here first.

Group of the Year

Right off the bat we can probably eliminate The Cadillac Three and The Highwomen who have not had that much commercial success. The Highwomen did win a Grammy for Best Country Song for “Crowded Table” but that song came out in 2019 not 2020 which is the year these awards are judging.

The heavyweights here are Old Dominion who have had a strong year including two Grammy nominations for “Some People Do” which is also nominated at this ceremony for Song of the Year. The group has won this category for the past three years and it’s likely that they’ll do it again mostly due to weak competition. Lady A and Little Big Town are also consistent nominees and past winners so if there’s anyone to upset it might be them but they weren’t that prominent in 2020 judging from the fact that they have no other nominations. So I’ll be pretty shocked if Old Dominion loses.

Ballard Stadium.

The light blue Under Armour uniforms follow the same general design as the Monarchs’ slate blue home and road white sets with an Old Dominion wordmark above a custom number font. The only difference is the TV numbers being on the sleeves rather than on the shoulders as well as a contrasting collar and cuffs.

The light blue pants also have a traditional striping pattern whereas the slate blue and white pants worn interchangeably at home and on the road are stripeless.

This marks the first time since Old Dominion revived its football program in 2009 that the Monarchs will wear light blue though it has been a fixture for the men’s and women’s basketball teams in the past as well as an alternate look for the baseball lacrosse and field hockey teams in recent years.

“I didn’t really have to say yes to this. I pushed for it. I wanted it” said Ricky Rahne who is entering his first season as head coach after Old Dominion opted out of the 2020 season due to the coronavirus pandemic. “I think they are awesome and think they are a great look. Every time I watch our (Olympic sports) teams wear it it just looks so good. I think that’s a great look for us.”

The color is actually Carolina Blue but Old Dominion is calling it “Carol Hudson Blue” as a nod to its former sports information director in order to differentiate from the North Carolina Tar Heels who play just three hours away from the Monarchs’ Norfolk Virginia campus.

Hudson worked at the university for more than four decades before he retired in 2015.

Old Dominion will wear the new uniforms twice in 2021 with their first appearance set for a matchup with Buffalo on Sept. 25. It’s unclear when they’ll be worn a second time though.

“Anything that gets our fans going gets our players going and gives us a little bit of an edge and I think the ‘Carol Hudson Blue’ jerseys will give us an edge” Rahne said. “I think our fans are going to love them.”

Greve and his colleagues at Arconic Davenport Works — members of United Steelworkers (USW) Local 105 — supply the Ford F-150 pickup and other vehicles.

Automakers forced to cut production because of the semiconductor crunch scaled back the amount of aluminum they take from the facility just as Greve expected posing another potential setback to a plant already fighting to rebound from the COVID-19 recession.

America cannot afford to jeopardize major industries for want of parts.

The nation's prosperity depends on ensuring the ready availability of all of the raw materials and components that go into the products essential for crises and daily life.

That will mean ramping up domestic production of the semiconductors — now made largely overseas — that serve as the ""brains"" of automobiles computers cell phones communications networks appliances and life-saving medical equipment.

But it will also require building out supply chains in other industries. For example America needs to produce titanium sponge for warplanes and satellites pharmaceutical ingredients for medicines and the bearings that keep elevators and other machinery running.

The failure of just one link in a supply chain — as the semiconductor shortage shows — has the potential to paralyze huge swaths of the economy. That's why it's crucial not only to source components on U.S. soil but also to incorporate redundancy into supply lines so that an industry can survive the loss of a single supplier.

""It's that ripple effect"" said Greve president of Local 105 recalling the time when a fire at a die-cast parts supplier disrupted production of the F-150. ""If you shut down a car manufacturer — or they can't get one part — you can affect a whole lot of jobs around the country.""

COVID-19 interrupted computer chip production even as demand for televisions home computers and other goods soared among consumers locked down in their homes. Now neither U.S. automakers nor manufacturers of other goods can obtain adequate amounts of the semiconductors they need.

Because of the shortage carmakers cut shifts and laid off workers. The production cuts come when the nation needs the boost from auto sales — and other items containing semiconductors — to climb out of the recession.

Although the decreased aluminum shipments haven't resulted in layoffs at Davenport the automotive supply-chain meltdown couldn't have come at a worse time. When the pandemic curbed air travel last year airplane manufacturers cut back on the aluminum they get from Arconic.

""Automotive is what kept us going"" Greve said.

America was once a leader in computer chip manufacturing. But as with many other industries in recent decades the U.S. frittered away the upper hand while other countries boosted production.

The nation's share of chip manufacturing capacity fell from 37 percent to 12 percent over the past 30 years. And although demand for chips continues to grow the U.S. stands to gain only a fraction of the additional capacity currently in the pipeline.

That leaves the country overly reliant on foreign suppliers who can encounter their own production shortfalls as happened during the pandemic or who can cut off shipments for political or economic reasons at any time.

""If you're going to war with somebody they're not going to sell you anything"" Greve said noting dependence on overseas supplies threatens the nation's ability not only to make cars and other consumer goods but also to obtain the chips needed for defense and intelligence purposes.

Although the current crisis centers on semiconductors neglect of the nation's manufacturing base decimated America's capacity to produce parts and components for many other industries.

""It affects everybody"" Libbi Urban vice president of USW Local 9231 said of hollowed-out supply chains that threaten jobs and access to goods. Because of the semiconductor shortage automakers now take less of the galvanized steel she and her coworkers make at Cleveland-Cliffs' New Carlisle Indiana works.

Shortages of medical and safety equipment during the pandemic revealed how much manufacturing power the nation let slip away.

But it wasn't only the finished products like face masks America found itself ill-equipped to produce. Makers of hand sanitizer and cleaning products struggled to obtain adequate supplies of the hand pumps and spray triggers made overseas.

""How much time and money are being lost waiting on overseas companies to get products and supplies to the U.S.?"" Urban asked.

President Joe Biden took the first step toward rebuilding manufacturing power with an executive order in February requiring immediate reviews of supply chains for the semiconductor pharmaceutical electric-battery and rare earth minerals industries as well as longer-term reviews of other sectors.

But after identifying weaknesses America needs to implement a strategy for restoring supply lines and ensuring long-term resiliency.

That will include direct investment in U.S. manufacturing facilities such as the $37 billion Biden proposed to ramp up chip production.

It involves strategically using tax incentives to encourage employers to expand operations and invest in new technology. And it means building strong markets for U.S. products partly through policies that encourage federal contractors and other companies to buy domestic goods.

Besides cutting shifts Greve noted automakers have been trying to weather the semiconductor shortage by allocating chips to their most popular models or leaving vehicles partially completed until chips arrive.

GM even eliminated an important feature an advanced fuel management system in some models just to save chips and get vehicles to market.

""We shouldn't have that happen in this country"" Greve said. ""If we don't make the supplies here then we have no control.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsbGFib3V0Y2lyY3VpdHMuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3LWZhYnMtY3JvcC1nbG9iYWxseS1pbi0yMDIxLWNoaXAtY3Jpc2lzLWNvbnRpbnVlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Fabs Crop Up Globally in 2021 as Chip Crisis Continues - News,"As the global chip crisis continues to disrupt supply chains creating widespread uncertainty in automotive and consumer electronic industries several manufacturers have announced bold expansion plans.

Intel

Intel recently announced that it will spend $20 billion to build two new fabs in Chandler Arizona—yet another addition to Arizona's growing presence in semiconductor manufacturing.

Intel currently operates four fabs in the United States. In addition to its site in Arizona it also has manufacturing operations in Massachusetts New Mexico and Oregon. Overseas Intel has fabs in Ireland Israel and China.

“Intel is and will remain a leading developer of process technology a major manufacturer of semiconductors and the leading provider of silicon globally” says newly-appointed Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger.

Intel also said that it will act as a foundry for fabless companies with a new division Intel Foundry Services citing Amazon Google Microsoft and Qualcomm as potential customers. The foundry services division will offer its services in both the U.S. and Europe positioning itself as an alternative to Asian chipmakers such as TSMC.

According to Gelsinger Intel’s foundry business will manufacture a range of chips in a market he reckons will be worth $100 billion by 2025 including those based on Arm technology which has historically competed with Intel’s x86 technology.

GlobalFoundries

In early March GlobalFoundries confirmed plans to invest $1.4 billion in 2021 in its global manufacturing capacity. In a typical year GlobalFoundries spends hundreds of millions to expand its production capacity but the growing demand for chips has prompted the world’s fourth-largest chip manufacturer to step on the gas and deliver faster growth.

According to Reuters the $1.4 billion will be equally split between its sites in Dresden New York and Singapore and is expected to lead to a production capacity increase of 13% this year and 20% next year.

Speaking to Reuters GlobalFoundries CEO Thomas Caulfield cited COVID-19 as the catalyst behind the company’s accelerated expansion plans. “The adoption of technology that would normally have taken a decade happened in one year in 2020 because of COVID-19” he said. Prior to the pandemic the chip industry was headed for 5% growth over a five-year window but this has since doubled.

Should demand continue to grow GlobalFoundries may look at building a new plant adjacent to its current Malta New York plant after securing a purchase option agreement for 66 acres of undeveloped land last year. However a decision to build a fab there can only be made if the U.S. Congress funds a set of measures to incentivize U.S. chip manufacturing.

SK Hynix

Outside of the U.S. SK Hynix has been given the green light to build a new 120 trillion won ($106.35 billion) fab complex by South Korean authorities. The complex where the first fab is expected to come online in 2025 after production begins later this year will primarily focus on the production of DRAM for PCs mobile devices and servers using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography.

The 4.15 million square-meter complex will be located near Yongin 50 kilometers south of Seoul and house four fabs which in total will have a planned capacity of around 800000 wafer starts per month. This will make the site one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturing hubs.

The complex will be SK Hynix’s second major DRAM site in South Korea after the company’s DRAM hub near Icheon that is home to its M10 M14 and M16 fabs the latter of which was completed at the beginning of February.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ibG9nLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzA0L2NoaXAtc2hvcnRhZ2UtZXhwbGFpbmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explainer: Why is there a global chip shortage and why should you care?,"From delayed car deliveries to a supply shortfall in home appliances to costlier smartphones businesses and consumers across the globe are facing the brunt of an unprecedented shortage in semiconductor microchips.

The shortage stems from a confluence of factors as carmakers which shut plants during the COVID-19 pandemic last year compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.

Consumers have stocked up on laptops gaming consoles and other electronic products during the pandemic leading to tighter inventory. They also bought more cars than industry officials expected last spring further straining supplies.

Sanctions against Chinese tech companies have further exacerbated the crisis. Originally concentrated in the auto industry the shortage has now spread to a range of other consumer electronics including smartphones refrigerators and microwaves.

With every company that uses chips in production panic buying to shore up stocks the shortage has squeezed capacity and driven up costs of even the cheapest components of nearly all microchips increasing prices of final products.

Cars

Automobiles have become increasingly dependent on chips - for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency breaking.

The crisis has forced many to curtail the production of less profitable vehicles. General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co are among the big carmakers who said they would scale down production joining other automakers including Volkswagen AG Subaru Corp Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co.

A shortage of auto semiconductor chips could impact nearly 1.3 million units of global light vehicle production in the first quarter according to data firm IHS Markit.

IHS said a fire at a Japanese chip-making factory owned by Renesas Electronics Corp which accounts for 30% of the global market for microcontroller units used in cars has worsened the situation.

Severe winter weather in Texas has also forced Samsung Electronics Co Ltd NXP Semiconductors and Infineon to shut down factories temporarily. Infineon and NXP are major automotive chip suppliers and analysts expect the disruptions to add to the shortfalls in the ailing sector.

Asian Squeeze

At the root of the squeeze is the under-investment in 8-inch chip manufacturing plants owned mostly by Asian firms which means they have struggled to ramp up production as demand for 5G phones and laptops picked up faster than expected.

Qualcomm Inc whose chips feature in Samsung phones is one major chipmaker struggling to keep up with demand. Apple Inc's major supplier Foxconn also warned of the chip shortage affecting supply chains to clients.

The majority of chip production occurs in Asia currently where major contract manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) and Samsung handle production for hundreds of different chip companies. U.S. semiconductor companies account for 47% of global chip sales but only 12% of global manufacturing is done in the United States.

What's Being Done About It?

Factories that produce wafers cost tens of billions of dollars to build and expanding their capacity can take up to a year for testing and qualifying complex tools.

U.S. President Joe Biden has sought $37 billion in funding for legislation to supercharge chip manufacturing in the country.

Currently four new factories are slated in the country two by Intel Corp and one by TSMC in Arizona and another by Samsung in Texas.

China has also offered a myriad of subsidies to the chip industry as it tries to reduce its dependence on Western technology.

Ghanaian painters redefining the global art market with Black Art

Three Ghanaian painters Amoako Boafo Kwesi Botchway and Otis Quiacoe are redefining the global market with their art.

All born and raised in Ghana and educated at the prestigious Ghanatta College of Art and Design in Accra the trio’s works have collectively redefined contemporary ideologies of Blackness and West African culture – whilst documenting the universal experience of simply being human.

The exhibition has been chosen to celebrate Gallery 1957’s 5th anniversary a moment to reflect on the amazing effect they have had on the Ghanaian arts scene locally and globally – including the launch of the recent Yaa Asantewaa Prize for female artists in Ghana.

Amoako Boafo born in Ghana is renowned for his in-depth art of African Diaspora representation beautifully achieved through his unique approach of creating with paint-dipped fingers to render his subjects’ faces achieving a striking textural contrast. His work features elevated and accentuated figures mostly alone on single colored backgrounds with the focal point being their gaze. Amoako challenges representation that objectifies and dehumanizes Blackness with bold colors and patterns which celebrate his subjects touching on themes of community political struggles and the bond between friends. For his unique style of telling stories of Blackness Amoako has been featured in many publications and has many awards in his name. He also launched a collaboration with Dior in the recent past making him the first African artist to collaborate with the fashion house for a collection.

Kwesi Botchway is an impressionist and a portrait artist who’s passion for painting started at a very early age. With a strong belief that colors have attitude and meanings Botchway paints Black characters with deep purple skin instead of the color black because purple is regarded as a color of royalty and power. Today he is known for his deep purple skin toned characters that capture the power and history of Blacks. His painting achieved through impressionistic strokes of brushes evokes feelings of laughter and pride. They open a window for the world to peep into the way of life achievements and struggles of his people whose stories are yet to be fully told.

Otis Quiacoe started his journey into the world of painting through a strong fascination about canvases and paintings. Today he is a renowned for his large sized portraits that are rendered in tonal gray skins juxtaposed with bright and vibrantly colored modern outfits. These paintings depict both close friends and strangers and at large the Black community. He captures the daily scenes of Black people such as a visit to the barber shop men with their friends single subjects that are essentially the soul and humanity of his people to create a bond between the viewer and the paintings using the eyes; a focal point of almost all his works of art.

AMC on Sunday announced that the 11th and final season of The Walking Dead would return Aug. 22. That’s two months earlier than the show’s traditional October debut and the first time the flagship zombie drama has launched outside of the Halloween season.

The final season will consist of 24 episodes — essentially a season and a half — and stretch through late 2022 on AMC as the basic cable network plans to spinoff stars Norman Reedus (Daryl) and Melissa McBride (Carol) into their own as yet untitled series.

The news was announced Sunday via a teaser that aired during the 10th season finale. (Watch that below.) Season 10 was expanded with six additional episodes that were filmed during the pandemic.

“Coming off of the six additional episodes for season 10 which focused on smaller character-driven stories we’re excited to kick off season 11 bigger than ever” showrunner Angela Kang said in a statement Sunday. “The stakes will be high — we’ll see more zombies tons of action intriguing new stories never-before-seen locations and our groups together in one community for the first time trying to rebuild what the Whisperers took from them.”

In September after months of deliberations AMC announced that the flagship Walking Dead would wrap with its expanded 11th season. Sources say executives involved with the franchise had debated between ending the show with either the 11th or 12th season but ultimately a decision was made to wrap with an expanded 11th season.

As THR reported at the time AMC’s main source of revenue on the flagship series is ad revenue. While the zombie drama remains one of the most-watched programs on television its ratings are a fraction of what they were during the show’s heyday. And while the ratings have softened over the years — the series recently notched a string of series lows — ad rates for the drama have declined too. What’s more the flagship drama’s lucrative international rights are locked up via a decade-old deal with Fox International. In addition the streaming rights to The Walking Dead were sold years ago to Netflix.

By launching a new spinoff featuring The Walking Dead‘s two most popular characters AMC will have the option to sell international and streaming rights to the series while also reducing the show’s budget and licensing fees. The plan say sources for the Carol and Daryl spinoff and to end the show around season 11 was put in place well before former AMC president Charlie Collier — who originally greenlit The Waking Dead — departed the network in 2018.

“The final chapter of The Walking Dead begins with eight action-packed episodes that will feature the massive scope and scale fans have come to expect from TWD Universe and I’m thrilled to share that fans won’t have to wait long for these incredible new episodes to debut this summer” said Scott M.

But the general vibe was encouraging. “How is it different than PayPal or Google Checkout?” he asked someone who’d seen the product. “It doesn’t suck” they replied.

If details were thin on the ground the one thing everyone knew about Stripe was the remarkable facility of its youthful founders – a pair of Irish brothers then just 21 and 19 – to extract cash from some of the Valley’s most courted investors. In their first venture round John and Patrick Collison garnered around $2m from Sequoia Capital Andreessen Horowitz SV Angel and most remarkably PayPal’s founders Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. Then located in Palo Alto “in a small office hidden by hanging leaves that passersby might confuse for a misplaced country cottage” there was a romantic simplicity about this genial pair from Limerick noted Fast Company. But they made no bones about their “not-so-humble mission: to become the next PayPal”.

The smartest bets in the tech industry

A decade later backing the Collisons has “proved to be one of the tech industry’s smartest bets” says the Financial Times. In its latest funding round Stripe was valued at $95bn – making it “the most valuable start-up in the US” (surpassing Musk’s rocket company SpaceX) and indeed the most valuable private company Silicon Valley has ever produced. Stripe hasn’t displaced PayPal but it has grown alongside it as the go-to payment provider for fellow online start-ups. “Stripe keeps behind the scenes” but processes “billions of dollars of payments every year for the likes of Zoom Deliveroo Lyft and Instagram”. Its shares have tripled in the past year boosted by the lockdown ecommerce boom and there’s excited talk of an imminent float.

“I often wonder if it’s desirable to grow up somewhere boring because you’re forced to find your own interests” John (the younger brother) told the FT in 2014. It was certainly a secluded childhood. The brothers grew up in Dromineer: a small village 30 miles outside Limerick best known for its half-ruined 13th-century castle. But scientific aptitude and a talent for business run in their blood. Both their parents – an electrical engineer who worked for Dell and a microbiologist – went on to start companies. The boys were self-confessed “nerds”. Patrick won Ireland’s Young Scientist of the Year award at 16 for creating a new programming language and John later “broke his brother’s record for top grades in Ireland’s school leaving exams”. In 2008 while still in their teens they sold their first company (which made software for eBay sellers) for $5m.

Stripping out the clutter

The brothers headed to the US for university – Patrick to MIT and John to Harvard – but dropped out to work on the idea that would become Stripe. “We were really appalled by how hard it was to charge for things online” John told Fast Company. The idea was to strip out “all the clutter” of merchant accounts gateways subscriptions [etc] and offer a streamlined service at “a simple rate”. Their winning pitch to Thiel (who seems to have taken their criticism of PayPal on the nose) was that by simplifying payments Stripe would vastly “increase the GDP of the internet”.

What seems to impress observers most about the Collisons – now worth about $10bn each and living in the San Francisco Bay area – is how at ease they are with themselves. “They’re extremely intelligent” says former Bank of England governor Mark Carney who has joined the board. “Very level very inquisitive about this huge range of subjects… and very funny as well.” “They are careful disciplined and judicious” adds Michael Moritz of Sequoia.

WhatPackaging? finds out how the packaging line is set to expand the company’s bottling capacity and provide production flexibility for the private label milk brand Cream Bell and the Pepsi Tropicana juice range.

Brand brief

Since the early nineties RJ Corp has made itself a multinational powerhouse with its beverages fast food restaurants retail ice creams dairy products healthcare and education businesses.



With 36 plants in the Indian subcontinent and in Africa its operating company in the beverage sector Varun Beverages has become one of the largest bottling partners for PepsiCo in the world. The company specialises in the production of carbonated soft drinks water and hot-fill juices as well as liquid dairy products (LDP).

Production flexibility

With Indian consumers looking for more nutritional beverages the market has been shifting towards “better-for-you drinks”. According to a Mintel report for nearly half of the Indian population living a healthier life is going to be a top goal over the next three years. And beverages have an opportunity to play a larger role in consumers’ daily food intake by contributing to a balanced diet with nutrient-rich offerings.



Thus to remain competitive in light of this trend RJ Corp decided to diversify its portfolio and put more emphasis on its juices with pulp and ultra-high temperature (UHT) LDP thus gaining more production flexibility to switch product categories easily.



“Managing both juices and dairy products on the same PET packaging line was essential for us and we could only make it happen using aseptic packaging” says RJS Bagga director - technical and operations RJ Corp.



This new line is set to enable RJ Corp to manage production without any stoppages for up to 200 hours

In addition to production flexibility as PepsiCo’s global brand image demands an extremely high level of food safety and hygiene standards it was essential for the company to satisfy all the quality and safety protocols and pass internal and external validations.



RJ Corp found out that Sidel’s Aseptic Combi Predis including dry preform sterilisation ticked all the boxes. And before finalising the same the company paid a visit to a French co-packer that has used Sidel’s Aseptic Combi Predis technology to handle both juices and milk for more than 10 years. Post the visit RJ Corp was convinced about the safety and easy-to-operate aspects of the machine.



200 hours of continuous production

The investment in Sidel’s Aseptic Combi Predis marks two major achievements for RJ Corp in India. Not only was this the company’s first step towards aseptic PET bottling but also its first experience with dry preform sterilisation.







Sidel’s Predis technology helps the processing and bottling of high-acid products such as Tropicana juices

With the injection of hydrogen peroxide before the oven Sidel’s Predis technology requires no water consumption and can reduce the use of chemicals significantly. This feature is said to be essential for the processing and bottling of PepsiCo’s high-acid products such as the Tropicana juices. The Aseptic Combi Predis also features similar dry sterilisation for caps Capdis as it is important to optimise the cleaning process and the handling of the caps themselves to avoid deformation and ensure tightness between the cap and the bottle.



Rohit Sawhney sales director for Sidel India said: “RJ Corp chose us because of our long-standing expertise in PET and aseptic technologies. This new line enables the company to manage production without any stoppages for cleaning and keeping the line running steadily without any compromise on product quality for up to 200 hours. Moreover the equipment is easy to manage and the operators find its functions intuitive and easily accessible.”

Efficient aseptic PET packaging line

In addition to the Aseptic Combi Predis the complete line at RJ Corp in Punjab is equipped with a flexible end-of-line. It features a seamless shrink-wrapper VersaFilm Access and also includes an automatic PalKombi layer-by-layer palletiser powered with a steady low-level pallet in-feed which allows easy access and control.



To understand its line operations and maximise overall equipment effectiveness RJ Corp has also invested in Sidel’s Efficiency Improvement Tool (EIT). This modular and scalable software provides performance indicators reports and analysis based on live and historical data. This helps the operator to better understand the line flow uncover sources of efficiency loss and achieve in-depth performance evaluation. It also monitors quality losses consumption accumulation and traceability and interfaces with inspection devices and business systems.



To make the most of this line specific training was provided to enable all RJ Corp technicians to get the right understanding of aseptic PET packaging including the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point system. This helped avoid any risk of contamination or detect the root causes efficiently in case it happens.





Since its implementation and validation the line has been working successfully with an output of up to 36000 bottles per hour. Overall the set-up expands production capabilities in terms of volume as well as a higher number of SKUs.

Packaging performance across the supply chain

Traditionally in India milk is packaged in pouches glass bottles or cartons. By choosing Sidel’s aseptic PET packaging technology RJ Corp has widened its packaging options for its LDP products to explore new market possibilities.



Sidel helped RJ Corp design this new PET bottle range enabling the same shapes and caps to be used for both Cream Bell UHT milk and the Tropicana juices. The cap size for all bottle formats is 33 mm which is a common width for LDP but quite uncommon for juices. As a result Sidel’s packaging experts developed and designed an iconic bottle shape in three formats – 200ml 500ml and 1l.



All bottle shapes and formats have been qualified internally claimed RJ Corp. They were submitted to Finite Element Analysis and on-site validations prior to industrial production in order to ensure the bottles’ strength and performance across the supply chain. Additionally Sidel also designed specific preforms to reach optimised bottle weight in order to withstand the dry preform sterilisation technology and avoid any thermal stresses on the bottle.



Produced in white mono-layer barrier PET the new packaging ensures a shelf life of up to nine months for UHT milk. All transparent Tropicana juice bottles passed the demanding PepsiCo validation protocols as well.

Taking Sidel’s complete aseptic packaging experience in Punjab into account Varun Beverages again chose the company for the exact same scope of supply for a different plant located in Central-Eastern India.",,,

This updated version reflects research as of July 2021 suggesting that a single dose of the Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is not enough to reliably ward off infection. The recommendation remains to receive the full course of two shots.

Maybe you’ve postponed your second COVID-19 vaccine appointment whether because of scheduling hassles or general reluctance. But how safe are you after just a single dose?

As an immunologist I hear this question frequently – and the answer has changed as new genetic strains of the coronavirus become more common. By the beginning of July 2021 the delta variant had become the most dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the U.S.

The Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines weren’t designed specifically to ward off the delta variant. While overall they still provide excellent protection after the full two doses new research suggests a single dose provides less immunity against the coronavirus strains that are out there now than it did against the original strain.

Bottom line: Two shots are way better than one.

How well had the vaccines been working?

Soon after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was authorized in December 2020 researchers in Israel found that a single dose was highly effective in one medical center’s thousands of vaccinated health care workers. A single dose reduced the rate of infection by up to 85% after four weeks post-shot compared to those who were not vaccinated.

This real-world finding was consistent with an analysis of Pfizer’s clinical trial data reported in 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine. In that study the 52% protection from the first dose included infections that occurred in the first 12 days after vaccination when one would not expect the vaccine to have had time to generate protective antibodies.

Another real-world study of adults ages 70 and older conducted by Public Health England in early 2021 determined that a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine was 61% effective at preventing symptomatic disease 28 days after vaccination. Two doses increased effectiveness to 85%-90%.

So what’s changed?

Essentially it comes down to new variants. Scientists are particularly concerned about the delta variant because it appears to be especially contagious.

All of the vaccines for COVID-19 generate antibodies against the spike glycoprotein on the surface of the coronavirus. If you encounter the coronavirus after you’ve been vaccinated these antibodies protect you by binding to the spike on its surface preventing the virus from entering your cells to cause an infection.

The problem is that the delta variant can evade some – but not all – of the antibodies generated by the current vaccines.

How well do vaccines protect against delta so far?

It looks like the delta variant is relatively resistant to the anti-spike antibodies vaccination generates. This change is what makes it all the more important to get the second dose of an mRNA vaccine.

The first shot introduces your body to the virus’s spike protein so your immune system can start to produce targeted antibodies and immune cells. The second shot gives your body another chance to practice mounting that immune response against COVID-19. The second dose triggers the creation of more anti-spike antibodies and these are more effective at protecting you because they bind more tightly to the viral spike if they encounter it.

In a study published in the journal Nature in July researchers tested serum from the blood of 16 recent Pfizer vaccine recipients in France. After the first dose of the mRNA vaccine serum from only two of the 16 vaccinated people neutralized the delta variant of the virus. The good news though is that after the second vaccine dose serum from 15 out of 16 people neutralized the delta variant.

Out of the lab and in the real world Public Health England has collected data on all symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in the country in which the coronavirus was genetically sequenced. Of the 1054 cases of delta infection through the middle of May 2021 a preliminary analysis that has not yet been peer-reviewed found that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine was 33% effective at preventing symptomatic infection. Protection rose to 88% after two doses. Those protection levels for delta are lower than what they found for the older alpha variant: 51% effectiveness after dose one and 93% after dose two.

A smaller preliminary study from Canada that also has not yet been peer-reviewed identified a similar level of protection. In 165 people with delta infection researchers found 56% protection from symptomatic infection with one dose of Pfizer and 87% with two. Importantly researchers calculated that protection from hospitalization or death from delta after even a single dose was 78% for Pfizer and 96% for Moderna.

Am I protected?

You are well protected if you have completed your vaccination: two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna or the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. If you have had only one of the two required doses of the mRNA vaccines then you should finish vaccination by getting the second shot. That will raise your COVID-19 protection from what might be as low as 33% better than an unvaccinated person up to 90%.

The picture is more complicated if you are immunocompromised. Studies have found that some immunocompromised patients don’t produce antibodies after vaccination. In these cases some studies suggest that booster shots may offer hope with a third dose of an mRNA vaccine triggering a protective antibody response.

For mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 the CDC recommendation remains the same: For Pfizer get two doses 21 days apart and for Moderna get two doses 28 days apart. Sticking to the schedule and getting both doses means you will have very high levels of protection once your body has time to build immunity.

A recent study published in collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the Yale School of Public Health and the Connecticut Department of Public Health reveals the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in nursing homes specifically for residents who received one dose of the vaccine during COVID-19 outbreaks at the facilities.

The School of Public Health partnered with the Connecticut Department of Public Health in mid-April of last year in order to perform COVID-19 surveillance in nursing homes and assist in policy recommendations according to associate professor of epidemiology and medicine Sunil Parikh the study’s senior author. The study which was first posted online in mid-March grew out of this collaboration to figure out how well vaccines were performing in nursing homes in the state.

“Vaccines are often less effective in the elderly and particularly those with multiple comorbidities” Parikh wrote in an email to the News. “We wanted to assess just how effective these novel mRNA vaccines would be in this demographic.”

According to Parikh Phase 3 trials of COVID-19 vaccines have largely been conducted in populations that do not reflect the resident demographics of nursing homes in order to avoid studying those at higher risk.

Parikh explained that nursing homes have been identified as the “epicenter” of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and around the world. Therefore the team believed it was essential to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines in this population in a real-world environment. This is especially important for individuals who have completed nursing courses and work in these facilities.

“Using the databases that have resulted from this collaboration we were able to identify nursing homes that were experiencing outbreaks during and following deployment of the Pfizer vaccine” Parikh wrote. “In addition the CDC was interested in similar questions and this led to a joint partnership between our 3 groups.”

According to Jillian Armstrong SPH ’23 a doctoral student at the School of Public Health and an author on the study the team identified two nursing homes of interest in Connecticut that had vaccinated many residents. The CDC then deployed a team to go to these nursing homes during significant outbreaks of COVID-19 and collect testing data on the staff and residents.

Armstrong explained that the outbreaks occurred at a time before the residents had been fully vaccinated. The researchers were only able to test the vaccine’s effectiveness in individuals with partial vaccination meaning they had not yet received both doses of the vaccine. According to the CDC a person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

Hanna Ehrlich SPH ’22 a doctoral student at the School of Public Health and another author on the study explained that the researchers used a form of statistical analysis called the Kaplan-Meyer curve on the data collected by the CDC team to assess the risk of COVID-19 in nursing home residents that were vaccinated compared to those who were not vaccinated. They found that the rate of COVID-19 cases was significantly lower in vaccinated residents than in unvaccinated residents.

“We found that it was 63 percent effective with some uncertainty around that” Erlich said. “This suggests that even one dose of the vaccine does offer significant partial protection against COVID-19 but that to achieve an optimal level of protection in this vulnerable population we need to be ensuring that everyone is getting two doses.”

According to Parikh the study showed that the Pfizer vaccine had a similar efficacy following the first dose as was seen in younger adults and demonstrated the high level of protection in the Pfizer vaccine. This research Parikh believes is the first data published in the world on the Pfizer vaccine in nursing home settings.

While the data only assessed the effectiveness of partial vaccination Parikh said the results suggest that the vaccine will have an even higher effectiveness in individuals who are fully vaccinated.

“We were not able to assess the level of protection after 2 doses as the outbreak was effectively contained before we reached the 2 week mark after the 2nd dose” Parikh wrote. “We anticipate that higher levels of protection would be seen following the 2nd dose. Furthermore we very much recommend that a 2nd dose be given to all nursing home residents.”

According to Saad Omer a vaccinologist and the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health the study helps ease an early concern that the vaccine efficacy might be lower in older populations because they are the highest risk group for severe COVID-19 infections. This research he explained has shown that the vaccine is in fact efficacious in nursing home populations outside of clinical trials.

The next step in the research according to Armstrong is to expand the size of the study to make the findings generalizable to different nursing home populations. She also explained that since this study only looked at partial vaccination another study that investigates fully vaccinated individuals should be conducted.

“This study is an important first step in understanding COVID-19 transmission dynamics and vaccine protection in congregate living facilities” Erlich said. “We’re interested in seeing whether we see the same results in terms of vaccine effectiveness across the entire state.”

As of April 3 Connecticut has fully vaccinated 21.5 percent of its population with 36.7 percent having received at least one dose.

If you're getting vaccinated expect a sore arm.

Pain at the injection site is the most common side effect of all three coronavirus vaccines authorized in the US.

In general the vaccines produce mild to moderate side effects that shouldn't last more than a few days. Side effects typically show up within 12 to 24 hours of getting the shot. They're often a sign that the body is building immunity to the virus.

""It's important to remember: When people get side effects from vaccines it's not really because of the vaccine. It's more of the body's immune response to the vaccine"" Dr. Vivek Cherian an internal-medicine physician in Baltimore told Insider.

Scroll through the chart below to see which side effects are common based on your age group which manufacturer's vaccine you get and whether you're on dose one or two. In general older people experience fewer side effects than younger adults because immune responses gradually weaken with age. For Pfizer's and Moderna's two-shot vaccines the second shot amplifies an existing immune response so people typically feel more run-down after that dose.

Vaccines prompt our bodies to produce coronavirus antibodies. But since our immune systems can't distinguish between a real infection and a vaccine-induced response they still release inflammatory chemicals to protect us. That's why people can develop a fever muscle pain fatigue or headaches shortly after their shots.

Johnson & Johnson's shot has the fewest side effects

Across the board Johnson & Johnson's shot has milder and fewer side effects than the other two. Some experts suspect that's because it's a single shot.

Related stories

Nearly 62% of participants younger than 59 in Johnson & Johnson's trial reported side effects compared with 45% of people ages 60 and up.

That's relatively similar to the reported side effects after one dose of Moderna's vaccine: About 57% of people younger than 65 in that trial developed side effects compared with 48% of those older than 65. But after the second Moderna dose nearly 82% of people in the younger group reported side effects compared with nearly 72% of older adults.

But Johnson & Johnson's shot also seems to be less effective overall: Clinical trials suggest the vaccine is 66% effective at preventing COVID-19. Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines are each more than 90% effective. But it's difficult to compare the companies' trials side by side because they happened at different stages in the pandemic and in different geographic regions.

Common side effects include fatigue and headache

Once a vaccine goes into your arm your blood flow increases and immune cells rush to the scene. This can result in pain redness or swelling at the injection site.

The reaction is more common after Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines than after Johnson & Johnson's. Across all age groups less than 50% of participants in Johnson & Johnson's clinical trial reported pain at the injection site compared with 92% of Moderna participants and 84% of Pfizer participants.

Headache and fatigue were also relatively common across all the trials. About 63% of Moderna participants reported headaches compared with 55% of Pfizer participants and 39% of Johnson & Johnson's.

About 69% of people in Moderna's trial and 63% in Pfizer's reported fatigue. Just 38% of participants reported fatigue in Johnson & Johnson's trial but the prevalence of those side effects varied by age.

Younger adults had more side effects with a few exceptions

Just a few side effects appear to be equally as common among older participants as younger ones: After dose two of Pfizer's vaccine for instance joint paint was equally common in the two groups with about 22 to 23% reporting the effect.

Though older adults tend to have fewer side effects overall experts say there's no reason to believe vaccines won't work as well among them.

""For the COVID-19 vaccine we've actually not seen decreased effectiveness as we get older so that's actually a really good thing"" Cherian said.

And younger people shouldn't worry too much about feeling strong side effects he added.

""Dealing with a few side effects of some diarrhea or some muscle aches is a much much better thing to get than some of those serious potentially life-threatening side effects of the COVID-19 infection"" Cherian said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjAyMS80LzQvMjIzNjY3MjgvMTUtbWlsbGlvbi1ydWluZWQtdmFjY2luZS1kb3Nlcy1qb2huc29uLWpvaG5zb24tYmFsdGltb3JlLXBsYW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 million ruined vaccine doses mean Johnson & Johnson will take charge of Baltimore plant,"After a mistake at a Baltimore Maryland manufacturing plant last week ruined millions of doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine the Biden administration is putting Johnson & Johnson in charge of the plant it announced Saturday.

The plant which belongs to manufacturing contractor Emergent BioSolutions was previously producing two varieties of Covid-19 vaccine of which only the Johnson & Johnson shot was approved for emergency use in the United States. Now Johnson & Johnson will be the sole vaccine produced at the facility as the company takes control reported the New York Times on Saturday.

The Johnson & Johnson shot authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in late February is a single-shot vaccine unlike the mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna that require two doses to be fully effective and it only requires a refrigerator rather than a freezer to store.

It’s also extremely effective — results from clinical trials suggest it prevents about 85 percent of “severe and critical cases of Covid-19” and 100 percent of deaths and hospitalizations after four weeks — despite some early concerns about how the Johnson & Johnson shot stacks up against the Pfizer and Moderna shots.

As Vox’s Umair Irfan explained last month:

[Johnson & Johnson] reported that its overall efficacy in preventing Covid-19 cases that produced symptoms was 66.1 percent. The Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines reported efficacy levels around 95 percent. That gap in efficacy numbers is fueling some people’s perception that the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine isn’t as good.

According to Johns Hopkins University’s Dr. Amesh Adalja however such a direct comparison is fraught and the vaccines are “basically interchangeable.”

“I don’t even look at those efficacy numbers and compare them head-to-head like that” Adalja told Vox. “Biostats 101: You cannot compare trial results like that unless they were done in a head-to-head fashion.”

In a statement Johnson & Johnson said it was “assuming full responsibility” for manufacturing at the Baltimore plant and would “significantly” increase its staff there.

According to the Times the error that precipitated Saturday’s announcement — and ruined some 15 million vaccine doses — came after a mixup between distinct vaccine vectors used by Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca which are incompatible.

However Johnson & Johnson emphasized in a statement Wednesday that it would continue to seek an emergency use authorization for Emergent’s Baltimore facility and that it would still meet its vaccine delivery targets.

Johnson & Johnson is set to deliver about 24 million additional vaccine doses by the end of April and nearly 100 million total by the end of May. President Joe Biden has pledged that every US adult will be eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine by May 1 and recently set a new target of 200 million shots in arms by the end of his first 100 days in office.

In a statement Saturday AstraZeneca which developed the other vaccine being produced at Baltimore’s Emergent plant said it was working to “identify an alternative location” for manufacturing.

The US invested in stockpiling AstraZeneca doses for use in the country last year in anticipation of an emergency use authorization that has yet to materialize according to the New York Times.

Even before Saturday however AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine has had a troubled go of things as the company hopes it will become the fourth coronavirus vaccine to receive an emergency use authorization in the US.

In March an independent advisory board at the National Institutes of Health criticized the company for using “outdated and potentially misleading” efficacy data in a press release according to Vox’s Umair Irfan; since then AstraZeneca has released more complete data showing a slightly lower — but still strong — efficacy rate of about 76 percent.

Separately there was a surge of concern last month after regulators in several European countries paused distribution of the AstraZeneca vaccine over worries about blood clots. But the European Union has since concluded that the shot is “safe and effective.”

Despite the EU regulatory agency’s findings the AstraZeneca vaccine is not yet authorized for use in the US. The Biden administration announced in March that it would send AstraZeneca doses from the US stockpile to Canada and Mexico both of which have signed off on the vaccine.

The US mass vaccination effort is accelerating

Despite setbacks for Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca last month the vaccine news in the US is overwhelmingly good right now. With three coronavirus vaccines approved for emergency use and distribution ramping up the country has continued to set vaccination records.

On Saturday according to White House Covid-19 adviser Andy Slavitt the US administered more than 4 million vaccines bumping the country’s average for the week above 3 million shots per day for the first time.

NEW: 4.1 million vaccines reported today.

Additionally more than 100 million people in the US have now received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine CNN’s Ryan Struyk tweeted Friday. As of Saturday according to Struyk that means 2 in 5 US adults have received at least one dose.

There has also been positive news about the effectiveness of several Covid-19 vaccines already authorized for use in the US.

A new study last week confirmed that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines provide substantial protection from Covid-19 under real-world conditions even after just a single shot.

According to the study both vaccines were about 80 percent effective after the first doses and 90 percent effective after two doses.

The Wall Street Journal also reported Thursday that the Pfizer vaccine “remains highly effective six months after its second dose an indication that protection could last for an even longer period.”

Still Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Rochelle Walensky is urging caution despite the good news.

“We have so much to look forward to so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope but right now I’m scared” she said last week warning that US Covid-19 cases have begun to climb again.

According to coronavirus data tracked by the New York Times cases have climbed by 19 percent in the US over the last two weeks; the rolling seven-day average stands at almost 65200 cases per day as of Saturday.

“We are just almost there but not quite yet” Walensky said. “And so I am asking you to just hold on a little bit longer to get vaccinated when you can so that all the people that we all love will still be here when this pandemic ends.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3VuLm15L3dvcmxkL3JhZ2luZy1wYW5kZW1pYy1zaHV0cy1kb3duLXNhby1wYXVsby1hcy1icmF6aWwtbmVhcnMtcGZpemVyLWRlYWwtTVg3MDQ0NTI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raging pandemic shuts down Sao Paulo as Brazil nears Pfizer deal,"SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO March 3: Brazil set a daily record for Covid-19 deaths for a second straight day on Wednesday as a raging resurgence of the virus led Sao Paulo state to shutter businesses and the government to try to close vaccine deals with Pfizer and Janssen.

With a new coronavirus variant from the Amazon spurring more infections according to studies 1910 people died from the virus in the past 24 hours according to Health Ministry data. In a year Brazil’s death toll has nearly topped 260000 the world’s second-worst after the United States.

A sputtering vaccination campaign has also put pressure on Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello who said on Wednesday he was close to an agreement with Pfizer Inc effectively overcoming a dispute over liability clauses.

The government said it intended to buy 100 million doses from Pfizer and 38 million from Janssen the pharmaceutical subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.

“We’ve reached a grave moment of the pandemic. The coronavirus variants are hitting us aggressively“ Pazuello said in a video posted on social media adding that he expected the Pfizer doses to arrive in May.

In another video he said the ministry was close to a contract to receive the “first rate” Janssen vaccine by August.

The partial lockdown in Sao Paulo Brazil’s most-populous state underscored mounting concerns about a surging new wave of infections. The country is facing its deadliest stretch since the pandemic began due to a homegrown variant dubbed P1 scarce restrictions to slow the virus and the patchy vaccine rollout.

Brazil is setting single-day death records as outbreaks ebb in North America and parts of Western Europe. That risks internationally isolating Latin America’s biggest country as other nations seek to shore up their gains against the virus.

The Sao Paulo announcement made by state Governor João Doria irked far-right President Jair Bolsonaro who opposes lockdowns and has long sought to diminish the gravity of the virus. But more states and cities are likely to follow Sao Paulo’s lead as health systems are pushed to the breaking point.

Bolsonaro attacked the lockdowns again on Wednesday.

“You cannot panic like resorting once again to this stay-at-home policy. People are going to die of hunger and depression“ he told a group of supporters.

New restrictions

Starting on Saturday Sao Paulo’s bars and restaurants will operate only via delivery while malls and non-essential businesses will be shut Doria said. The measures are due to last two weeks he said adding that the state was receiving a new patient in intensive care units every two minutes.

To make matters worse questions remain about the suitability of Brazil’s stretched vaccine portfolio - comprising an AstraZeneca shot and another vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd - against the P1 variant.

Bolsonaro and other senior officials publicly chafed for weeks at Pfizer’s demands for a liability waiver saying the terms were unacceptable. Pfizer has said many other nations had agreed to identical deals.

International fears are mounting about the P1 variant which arose in the northern city of Manaus and has since been identified across the world leading to tighter regulations on Brazilian travelers.

The domestic situation is particularly critical. Blame is increasingly landing on Bolsonaro’s lap.

Earlier this week 16 Brazilian governors accused him of misleading the country. The national association of state health secretaries also criticized the federal government complaining of a piecemeal approach by each state and city calling for a national curfew and the closure of airports. - Reuters"

Morris really took off in the 2010-11 season but in his freshman season (2009-10) he helped lead the team to an NCAA Tournament after having not made it in 11 years. He left after his sophomore campaign being drafted in the second round by the Los Angeles Lakers.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

The 2020 postseason was canceled due to COVID-19.Prior to his arrival at Loyola the Ramblers had just one 20-win season in the previous 26 years.

She then went on to the CIF State Championships and notched a new PB in the 500 free (4:58.84) in prelims before finishing 15th in the final.

That summer she won the girls 15-16 400 free and 1500 free at 2019 Far Westerns. She was runner-up in the 200 free and 800 free and she came in 6th in the 100 free. She was on the Pleasanton Seahawks squad as a relay swimmer for the 2019 Phillips 66 Summer National and Speedo Junior National Championships.

Kim kicked off 2020 with best times in the SCY 200 back 100/200 breast and 200 IM before the pools shut down and she logged a new PB in the 1000 free in March 2021 at a PLS dual meet against TERA.

The Clearfield Naval Supply Depot was part of the US war effort during World War II to build up military stockpiles. This was on top of an already impressive building phase by the US Navy sparked by the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Yet Utah is landlocked and in the middle of nowhere. So it might seem like a strange decision to build a Naval storage facility there. Turns out the Navy was spot on with this choice.

Why Clearfield Utah was the perfect spot for Naval Supply Depot

Clearfield Utah was a strategic location in many ways. Its centralized location in the west meant supplies could reach any US ports in one day by rail. Even better its proximity to two major railways was perfect. Its dry climate was also ideal for storage. Most importantly the location of Clearfield provided security against enemy attacks thanks to its remoteness and distance from the ocean. Placing a supply depot on the coast would have been a primary target and thus too big of a risk.

Talk about a massive facility

Clearfield Naval Supply Depot encompassed over eight million square feet of covered storage space with 84 storage buildings as well as eight million more square feet of open storage all 25 miles north of Salt Lake City. Its goal was simple: to provide plenty of war material support to the West Coast and Pacific Fleet. It also supported several Naval Districts in North and South Dakota Kansas Nebraska Texas and Oklahoma.

By the end of World War II Clearfield was the largest Naval supply depot globally. Who would have thought? Part of the reason for needing such a gargantuan stockpile of Naval gear was that by 1945 the US had the largest Navy in the world. You can’t have that huge Navy without providing all it needed to operate.

The question of staffing was a tough one

The question of how to staff such a massive supply depot during a time when most able-bodied workers were already off fighting the war is a good one. They got it done though finding around 8000 people to staff the place at its height. Some were Naval officers some civilian employees Marines to provide security and some prisoners of war thanks to the prisoner-of-war camp that was also on site.

Plenty of the staff were female workers which was previously unheard of. Yet desperate times called for “desperate measures.” Interestingly the depot began to notice it faced absentee problems because women often went off to shop for their families during the day. It was such a big issue that the base officers arranged for local businesses to stay open later so the women could shop after work.

While Clearfield Naval Supply Depot was eventually phased out and sold to private firms by 1962 its role in World War II Naval operations will never be forgotten.",,,

But mine? Well it’s plants.

Now I’m not talking just about the intermittent bouquet from your significant other on special occasions. I’m talking about those and a whole lot more.

I have always been a fan of flowers plants and gardening. I grew up on a farm and love to grow food and herbs to eat and eating what you grow comes with a lot of satisfaction -- and flavor.

And there is no joy like the feeling that comes from watching a brightly colored bloom develop open and face the sun.

I think I started realizing my true obsession when the pandemic hit and we all found the desperate need to find joy in the little things. I also started spending a lot more time at home and in my home as fall and winter came around.

While working a long day from my home office couch or bed it always lifts my spirits to look up and spot the bright green leaves of a house plant or bloom of a flower.

A recent joke about house plants being “useless” was made within my earshot the other day and got me thinking about how use ful plants really are. It sent me on an internet hunt to see what the benefits of these bits of petals leaves and roots really are.

In my link clicking I came across an article from Healthline called “ 7 Science-Backed Benefits of Indoor Plants ” which really expanded my understanding of how wonderful house plants are.

First researchers found that plants in a home or office can make you feel more comfortable and soothed. When study participants completed an indoor gardening task stress responses were lowered whereas a computer task caused a spike in heart rate and blood pressure. Researchers concluded that working with plants could reduce both physiological and psychological stress.

Second they discovered that while no positives were found from having photos of plants or fake plants in a room students who studied with real live plants in a classroom were more attentive and better able to concentrate.

Third the article mentions how researchers have used horticultural therapy to increase feelings of well-being among people with depression anxiety dementia and other conditions.

Fourth research revealed that by having plants in their rooms people recuperating from surgery needed less pain medication and had shorter hospital stays than those who weren’t looking at greenery during their recovery periods.

Fifth multiple studies found that plants in the workspace increase both productivity and creativity. According to the article one frequently cited study from 1996 found that students in a campus computer lab worked 12% faster and were less stressed when plants were placed nearby. Other studies found that people with more plants in their workspace took fewer sick days and were more productive on the job.

Sixth when researchers interviewed over 440 Amazon employees in the U.S. and India they found those with more natural elements like indoor plants in their offices felt greater job satisfaction and more commitment to the organization than those who didn’t work around natural elements. They said the natural elements helped to buffer the effects of job stress and anxiety.

Seventh plants help to improve the quality of indoor air and increase oxygen levels in the air by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen during photosynthesis. According to a Seattle Times article you can maximize your benefits by placing plants ""in your 'breathing zone' within 6 to 8 square feet of where you normally sit or lie.""

While the science definitely helps back up my claims to me it’s clear to see and feel for yourself once you give it a try. As humans we have a strong connection to nature and if the outdoors makes us more content calmer and focused then why not bring the outdoors inside?

Also the act of caring for plants is a major stress and anxiety reliever for me. It gives me something to monitor and nurture -- a lot of pleasure and satisfaction comes along with that.

So next time you see a good deal on a potted plant bring it home or to your office and give it a go. Being a master gardener is not required and many plants are extremely low maintenance -- so don’t stress about that part. When you’re taking care of your plant slow down and take a deep breath touch its leaves and enjoy the beauty and peace that comes from the process.

We can’t control much in this world but we are very much in control of how many plants we let grace the threshold of our living space. So I say the more the merrier!

The summer of 1934 saw the opening of Cork’s new municipal and open air unheated swimming pool on the site now occupied by The Kingsley Hotel on the Carrigrohane Road.

In May 1934 the Cork Examiner gave a preview of what the city could expect from the new facility.

Work in progress at Lee Swimming Baths Carrigrohane Road 1933.

""Admittedly the facilities provided for swimming by the public authorities are scandalously poor; at the same time there is scarcely a town or village in Ireland that is not within easy reach of sea river or lake.

""The city of Cork is fortunate in this regard for in addition to the existing municipal baths we are to have this summer a splendid new outdoor pool at the Lee Fields.

""This pool which will be equipped with a diving tower and pit will provide a swimming area of 100 by 50 yards and will thus be the largest in Ireland.""

Watching the action at the National Swimming Championships at the Lee Baths in April 1957.

Opened later that summer the project was more pared back than originally planned but still proved an instant hit with the people of Cork.

Along with the indoor Eglinton Street baths the Lee Baths became the main swimming facility in the city and were used extensively by clubs such as Dolphin Swimming Club and Sundays Well Swimming Club.

The pool was 50 yards long with a deep end of 7ft a shallow end of 4ft and the amenity also included a paddling pool for young children.

The depth in the diving pool was 15ft.

Perhaps the best known of the lifeguards at the Lee Baths was Andy O'Brien dubbed the 'Brown Bomber' because of his year-round tan.

Mr O'Brien was a high board diver who lived locally and was the head lifeguard at the Lee Baths.

He became well known in Cork in the 1930s for his sporting prowess winning many awards for high board and springboard diving at a local and national level.

Diving and swimming competitions were held regularly at the Lee Baths and water polo was practised after public hours.

Although used extensively in the summers for several decades eventually the popularity of the Lee Baths began to wane.

In the summer of 1985 the Corporation suffered a deficit of £35000 in operating costs over the seven week opening period of the facility that summer according to an Echo article in March 1986.

""Because of the summer that never was in 1985 Cork Corporation has no plans to open the Lee Baths this year"" the article stated.

In 1984 the deficit incurred amounted to £29000 over nine weeks.

These operational costs coupled with the rise in popularity of new indoor swimming pools brought about the end of the Lee Baths but the legacy and fond memories of baths linger on.",,,,,,,,,,,,

P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials.

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

Dr. Rick comes to the rescue smartly satirizing a generational divide,"Actor Bill Glass plays Dr. Rick a therapist who helps young homeowners avoid becoming their parents in a series of TV commercials for Progressive insurance. (Progressive)

Where were you when you first got Dr. Ricked?

I was on my couch chuckling blissfully along at the Progressive insurance commercial where a millennial-aged homeowner tries to ""coach"" an annoyed plumber fixing a pipe under the sink. That's when Dr. Rick an older mustachioed mentor on the scene gently pulls the homeowner away and reminds him that plumber is the expert here: ""You hired him.""

Then the ad pivoted to Dr. Rick advising a young woman. If there are so many throw pillows on your couch that you aren't sure where to sit he told her you have too many. And you've turned into your mom.

For nearly a year now Progressive's Dr. Rick ad campaign — in which a tough-love Dr. Phil type helps millennials and Gen Xers avoid taking on their parents' behaviors when they buy (and insure) their first homes — have been delighting audiences and then often to their further delight sucker-punching them with the cold truth about themselves.

These ads have carved out a space for themselves in the cultural lexicon of the moment that's rare for an ad campaign: ""You need Dr. Rick"" has become an affectionate shorthand for ""You've become everything that irritated you about your dad."" Fans of the commercials (fans of the commercials!) tweet at the insurance company almost daily.

It doesn't hurt that they're performed by a cast of veteran improv actors recruited from the Groundlings and Second City.

And certainly some credit belongs to Bill Glass the 49-year-old veteran improv actor with a self-described ""resting goofy face"" that only gets goofier when he puts on Dr. Rick's stage mustache (nicknamed ""the Beast"").

In 2015 Progressive's chief marketing officer Jeff Charney was hunting for a novel insight about the stages of life around which to build a new ad campaign. He stumbled across the concept of parental introjection — the absorption of the traits of the adults we're around first and most frequently.

Talking to behavioral scientists and psychology researchers ""We found that there was a 'grown-up switch' that everybody has and nobody had really mined when that switch turned on"" Charney said. The lurch into self-identified adulthood seemed to be precisely when people started becoming their parents.""We (initially) thought it was when people had kids"" he said. ""But we found out it was when they buy homes.""

Soon homeownership-induced parental introjection was recast by Progressive as ""parentamorphosis""; that campaign's first ads debuted in 2016. Eventually the ad series would evolve to focus on the don't-become-your-parents evangelism of Glass's Dr. Rick.

On an advertising level the Dr. Rick ads are textbook examples of good sales strategy. Barbara Mellers a professor of marketing and psychology at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania points out that they're both simple in concept and surprising in content which is a winning combination for a memorable ad.

Plus advertisers are always going for relatability: ""The more similar a person in an ad is to you the easier it is for you to imagine yourself in that person's place"" Mellers said.

As Mellers pointed out though what may be making the Progressive ads stick so well in the public imagination is that they point out a phenomenon that's familiar but hasn't been parodied to the point of being a trope. ""I think we all experience it but I don't know how much has been written on it or how broad a topic it is in the general conversation of life"" Mellers said. When she first watched a Dr. Rick ad ""I started remembering funny things about sounding like my mother.""

Charney too has thought a lot about his own parents — and his own parentamorphosis — over the course of developing and shooting the Dr. Rick ads. Certainly he's thought about the parental habits that irked him; his childhood friend's mother had a ""No cussin' no fussin' and no backtalkin'""-style mantra framed in her home for years and the alarming fervor with which Dr. Rick throws a similar framed poster in a garbage can Charney said is in her honor.

More often though he thinks about how he's developed the same impulse as his own dad to chase down drivers who speed past his home while his kids are riding their bikes. At the end of the day the Dr. Rick ads are ""an ode to our parents"" Charney said.

And although Bill Glass's face is now the one many probably see in their nightmares about transforming into their parents even Glass himself has experienced the stomach-dropping Dr. Rick moment. ""I've caught myself running around the house turning off lights going 'Do we have to have all the lights on?'"" he said. ""I've had a couple of 'The laundry's not going to fold itself!' And I'm talking to no one. There's no one around"" Glass added with a laugh.

But for Glass — and probably for many — the Dr. Rick ads have helped illustrate that while he may be turning into his father he's far from alone in doing so.

""I love my dad and I'm in no hurry to turn into him"" Glass said. ""But maybe Dr. Rick has helped me lighten up a little bit on some of that stuff.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3ZWVrLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDQvMDMvbmlrZS1oYXMtcGFpZC1uby1mZWRlcmFsLWluY29tZS10YXhlcy1mb3ItdGhlLXBhc3QtdGhyZWUteWVhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Has Paid No Federal Income Taxes for the Past Three Years,"The Seb Coe building contains a Stumptown Coffee Roasters location just for Nike employees and visitors. (Sam Gehrke)

Nike hasn't paid a cent in federal income taxes for three years.

And the Beaverton sportswear giant—which regularly spars with cultural conservatives—can largely thank former President Donald Trump for its good fortune.

That’s the finding of a new study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy which reports that Nike—a company that generated $4.1 billion of taxable revenue in the past three years—hugely benefited from a tax bill championed by President Trump.

The study named 55 major corporations that didn't pay taxes last year including gas and oil companies software companies and food companies. Nike and the shipping company FedEx are the two biggest names on the list as The New York Times reported Friday morning.

The report was released as President Joe Biden discusses a corporate tax overhaul that would fund his infrastructure and green energy plan. Biden's plan would eliminate tax breaks that result in some companies paying an effective tax rate of zero.

Nike used several major deductions and write-offs that the 2017 tax bill allowed in its corporate framework resulting in a tax rebate for the company of $109 million on pretax income of $2.8 billion.

One of those write-offs was a federal research and experimentation credit that allows companies to write off money funneled toward research initiatives and projects.

In November the company notified state officials it was laying off 700 employees at its world headquarters in Beaverton.

Nike representatives did not respond to a request for comment from WW on the report.

Along with opening Nike's books the report highlights a paradox: Oregon's flagship company gains social capital from championing progressive values and equity (and outraging the right wing) but it quietly benefits from the economic policies of Republicans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS8yMDIxLzA0LzAzL2FtYXpvbi1kcml2ZXJzLXBlZWluZy1pbi1ib3R0bGVzLXVuaW9uLW1hcmstcG9jYW4vNzA3NDk5MzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon peeing in bottles Twitter spat: Company apologizes,"Amazon is backtracking on a viral social media comment it made last week denying claims that time-pressed workers have to pee in bottles.

The tech giant posted an online apology late Friday to U.S. Rep Mark Pocan following the company's snarky Twitter response to worker issues he raised nearly 10 days ago.

The Democratic congressman from Wisconsin replying to a tweet from a top Amazon executive calling Amazon a progressive workplace said Amazon can't call itself a progressive workplace when it ""union-busts and makes workers urinate in bottles.''

The company's official response on Twitter: ""You don't really believe the peeing in bottles thing do you? If that were true nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do and have great wages and health care from day one.''

The response went viral with employees and others posting photos and reports about urinating in bottles. One former driver said she was fired for taking restroom and meal breaks and said visitors to any Amazon delivery warehouse will see ""pee bottles thrown on the side of the road.''

Amazon's apology to Pocan published in a blog post said the company's tweet was incorrect and was referring to Amazon's warehouses which have ""dozens of restrooms'' not its drivers.

""We know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed'' the apology said.

The company said the problem is not unique to Amazon and posted links to news reports about Uber taxi and UPS drivers having to urinate on the go.

""Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide we would like to solve it. We don’t yet know how but will look for solutions'' the company said.

""We apologize to Representative Pocan'' Amazon said.

Pocan's response via Twitter on Saturday: ""Sigh. This is not about me this is about your workers—who you don't treat with enough respect or dignity. Start by acknowledging the inadequate working conditions you've created for ALL your workers then fix that for everyone & finally let them unionize without interference.''

USA TODAY reached out to Amazon for comments on allegations workers have to urinate in bottles because bathroom breaks are discouraged.

Reports of Amazon workers urinating in bottles aren't new but worker issues are in the limelight today as Amazon is facing the biggest union push in its history.

In January Amazon requested in-person unionizing vote for a ""valid fair and successful election"" in Alabama despite COVID concerns.

""You don't really believe the peeing in bottles thing do you? If that were true nobody would work for us"" the company had said in that original March 24 tweet which was a response to a tweet from Rep. Mark Pocan. Pocan's tweet had said ""Paying workers $15/hr doesn't make you a 'progressive workplace' when you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles.""

After being called out about its original tweet Amazon recanted it late Friday saying in a blog post that the tweet was ""incorrect"" and that it owed an apology to Pocan.

""We know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes"" the company said in the post ""and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed.""

The apology could signal that the company is having second thoughts about a spate of unusually aggressive tweets it fired off last month. Amazon made headlines in March with snarky tweets directed at Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. After Vermont's Sanders said he'd travel to Alabama in the final days of a union vote at an Amazon warehouse there the company's chief of consumer operations fired back on Twitter.

""I welcome @SenSanders to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace"" Amazon exec Dave Clark tweeted on March 24. ""I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers but that's not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace.""

The testy tweets appeared as lawmakers in the US and elsewhere are investigating Amazon and other Big Tech firms over what critics have charged are anticompetitive practices. The companies face potential regulation that could force them to break up their businesses or otherwise weaken their power. Amazon is also facing the prospect of a unionized workforce amid accusations that it mistreats its workers. And critics have said Amazon doesn't pay enough taxes despite the fact that its founder Jeff Bezos  is one of the richest people in the world.

In its apology Friday Amazon said the bathroom-break problem affects drivers for other delivery services too as well as drivers for ride-hailing companies. ""Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide we would like to solve it. We don't yet know how but will look for solutions"" Amazon said in its post.

The company has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and others this year over AI-equipped cameras installed in Amazon vans to monitor drivers and confirm their identities. A company program for disciplining delivery drivers which surfaced around the time Amazon's plans for the cameras emerged reportedly mentioned ""public urination"" among actionable offenses. Some drivers have said they worry the camera program will increase pressure on them to work even faster and lead to punishment for behaviors that are hard to avoid under intense time constraints. Amazon has said the cameras are meant solely as a safety measure with tests showing significant decreases in things like accidents and distracted driving.

In its apology post Friday Amazon also said the original tweet ""wrongly focused only on our fulfillment centers."" In 2018 an author went undercover at an Amazon fulfillment center in Britain and alleged that workers there urinated in bottles for fear that regular bathroom breaks might cost them their job. Amazon disputed that claim. In its Friday post the company said fulfillment center workers can take bathroom breaks whenever they need to.

""A typical Amazon fulfillment center has dozens of restrooms and employees are able to step away from their work station at any time"" the company said in the post. ""If any employee in a fulfillment center has a different experience we encourage them to speak to their manager and we'll work to fix it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzAzL2FtYXpvbi1hcG9sb2d5LWRyaXZlcnMtdXJpbmUtYm90dGxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon walks back denial acknowledges issue of delivery drivers urinating in bottles,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2021/04/03/amazon-apology-drivers-urine-bottle on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzAzL2FtYXpvbi1hcG9sb2d5LWRyaXZlcnMtdXJpbmUtYm90dGxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Former Wick High School pupil Kayleigh Ross has been appointed as a Caithness-based mortgage adviser with an award-winning independent financial advisory firm following the completion of her professional exams.

She is taking up her a role within the growing Wick office of Phil Anderson Financial Services having recently passed exams in Mortgage Advice and Financial Services as well as Regulations and Ethics. She is combining her full-time job with studying for a qualification in Financial Protection.

“I am delighted to be part of Phil Anderson Financial Services and have received a very warm welcome"" Kayleigh said. ""I am extremely grateful to have been given the opportunity to become a mortgage adviser within Phil’s team and I hope to further develop my knowledge and experience in the coming months and years.

“I am thoroughly enjoying getting to know our clients and helping them to save money and purchase their new homes. It’s a real privilege for me and I look forward to helping more people in Caithness in the years to come.”

The firm has its head office in Ellon Aberdeenshire.

Founder and managing director Phil Anderson said: “It’s a real pleasure to welcome Kayleigh to the team.

“We have been really busy since establishing our Wick branch and that looks set to continue. We have no doubt that Kayleigh will be a great asset in helping us to advise and support our clients in the Caithness area.”

Richard began his career with the Prudential as a financial adviser before setting up CRB Investment. Phil Anderson Financial Services took over CRB Investment about nine years ago with Richard working with the firm as a mortgage and protection adviser since then.

Phil said: “He has helped many people over the years and he has shown so much dedication to clients in the time I have known him. Now that Kayleigh has joined the Wick team Richard is focusing on financial protection which is an area of particular specialism for him.

""I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for all his hard work and all the support and guidance he has given to Kayleigh as she embarks on her career.”

Kayleigh added: ""Richard has been a great support to me since I started with the firm.""

The firm reported its busiest January ever for arranging mortgages on behalf of clients and with the reintroduction of 95 per cent mortgages it believes it is well placed to meet the expected increase in mortgage leads in the coming months.

What would the world be like today if Apple wasn't around?

The world's tech companies would have to do their own real R&D instead of being inspired by Apple and someone else would have taken up the mantle for elegant and sophisticated hardware and software - or at least we can only hope so.

Before Apple Nokia was the company that owned its own OS and created its own hardware and while Microsoft tried to fill that role too with its Windows Phones that worked alongside Windows PCs the Surface Duo Android smartphone hasn't exactly set the world on fire and the Surface Neo is still not on sale.

Linux has come a LONG way and has succeeded spectacularly but it's still far more the province of tech-savvy geeks rather than everyday people who use Windows PCs or Macs or iPhones and Androids. And yes Android is built in a Linux foundation but the average person wouldn't have any clue of this while every Apple user knows they're using an Apple operating system.

In addition Apple has become a $2 trillion company with over $200 billion in the bank with its technologies becoming more popular with each new release and every new year and profit records being set every year too.

Unless the world blows itself up in a nuclear war or some other environmental or financial catastrophe technology is only going to continue getting better and helping to augment human minds in the quest to find solutions to environmental and financial problems and avoid war with Apple Glasses to come this decade Apple Cars and much more including M-powered MacBooks and desktops that have already surpassed Intel's ability to make an inexpensive CPU that doesn't require a fan but has amazing power.

So what has Apple CEO Tim Cook had to say in a Tweet to celebrate Apple's 45th birthday and in his company-wide email republished by the French MacGeneration site?

As Apple celebrates 45 years today I’m reminded of Steve’s words from many years ago: “It’s been an amazing journey so far yet we have barely begun.” Thanks to every member of our Apple family for all you’ve done to enrich lives. Here’s to the next 45 years & beyond! — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) April 1 2021

Note the date says ""April 2"" if you're looking at the Tweet in an Australian timezone but it says April 1 in the US as that's when it was sent. Your timezone location will reflect what date the tweet says it was sent at.

Here's Tim Cook's letter via MacGeneration.

Team

On April 1 1976 a company was formed in Cupertino to create transformative products that redefine what technology can achieve and make people's lives better in the process. Forty-five years later we mark this occasion by rededicating ourselves to that mission — and to keeping it alive for a long time to come — rather than to remember it fondly as something past.

While some things about Apple have changed over these many years the important things haven't. From the M1 chip to 5G iPhones from iPads that change the face of education and productivity to a Watch that can look out for your health to the very best Software and Services that bring them all to life we have never stopped setting the pace that others try to match. What I can tell you with gut certainty is that there has never been a moment of such great potential as this one nor have we ever had so talented and dedicated a team. That shouldn't make us rest easy. Great potential obligates great people to meet it.

I know this past year has tested each of us in ways that we never imagined. It's asked all of us to adapt it's added complexity to our work and it has demanded additional resolve and commitment in areas of our lives that extend well beyond our work. But I also know that what we have each achieved during this time should make us enormously proud. Through a once-in-a-generation challenge the things we make and the ways in which we make them have revealed profound and durable new sources of value to the people who love and count on them. And on many fronts we know even brighter days are ahead.

In an email like this one to mark a much earlier anniversary shortly after I joined Apple Steve said ""it's been an amazing journey so far yet we have barely begun."" Still true. Remember that none of us will be here for the end of the story but it's on all of us to make sure it's one worth telling.

SUMTER COUNTY S.C. — Investigators with the Sumter County Sheriff's Office (SCSO) reportedly seized more than $100000 in cash and various drugs while apprehending three subjects during a long-term investigation of a drug trafficking operation on March 30.

Law enforcement had obtained search warrants for multiple storage units at a public storage facility in the 1200 block of Camden Highway.

According to SCSO:

Funchess-McClam was apprehended at the scene after cocaine was found on his person and 927.7 grams of cocaine was found inside Funchess-McClam’s storage unit. He is charged for trafficking cocaine.

OnePlus 8 Pro vs OnePlus 7T Pro design and display Looking at the front the OnePlus 8 Pro is clearly larger than the OnePlus 7T Pro. The display is 6.78 inches compared to the 6.67-inch screen on the older phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is also a bit less rounded compared to the 2019 7T Pro. However the biggest difference is that the OnePlus 8 Pro returns its front-facing selfie camera to its display. The punch-hole camera sensor is played on the top left side.

The OnePlus 7T Pro famously used the pop-up selfie camera in order to have a higher screen-to-body ratio. It’s looking like the pop-up selfie camera trend is pretty much over before it really began.

The AMOLED display on the OnePlus 7T Pro supports a 90Hz refresh rate while the OnePlus 8 Pro jumps that support up to 120Hz. This makes it great for playing games and scrolling around the user interface. Furthermore the OnePlus 8 Pro’s display is actually the best we’ve ever tested.

The back of the OnePlus 8 Pro includes basically the same rear-camera setup in the top middle but there are a couple of extra sensors placed to the left side of the main camera bank this time. The new OnePlus logo design is also on the OnePlus 8 Pro on the bottom of the device.

OnePlus 8 Pro vs OnePlus 7T Pro processor and memory The OnePlus 8 Pro has the fastest mobile processor you can currently get the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865. The OnePlus 7T Pro has last year’s champion the Snapdragon 855 Plus. The OnePlus 8 Pro comes in 8GB and 12GB of RAM models while the OnePlus 7T Pro was only sold with an 8GB model. The RAM on the new model uses the faster LPDDR5 memory compared to the LPDDR4X RAM on the OnePlus 7T Pro. The OnePlus 8 Pro has 128GB and 256GB storage options while the OnePlus 7T Pro just has the 256GB storage model. Both phones use the fast UFS 3.0 standard.

OnePlus 8 Pro vs OnePlus 7T Pro cameras

David Imel / Android Authority

The OnePlus 8 Pro has a sizable camera upgrade. While both phones have a 48MP sensor as their main camera the OnePlus 8 Pro boosts its wide-angle camera to 48MP as well compared to the 16MP wide-angle sensor found on the OnePlus 7T Pro. The telephoto sensor on the OnePlus 8 Pro is 12MP but it still outputs 8MP images. The OnePlus 7T Pro has an 8MP telephoto sensor.

In addition the OnePlus 8 Pro has a 5MP color filter which is used to take images with different spectrums of light. This means images taken with the filter can radically change the color of the objects that appear in your photos. As we mentioned the 16MP front-facing camera on the new phone is on the top-left side of the front display. The OnePlus 7T Pro’s 16MP front-camera used the pop-up design.

OnePlus 8 Pro vs OnePlus 7T Pro battery The OnePlus 8 Pro has a much bigger 4510mAh battery compared to the 4050mAh battery on the OnePlus 7T Pro. Both phones use the Warp Charge 30T tech for fast charging. The OnePlus 8 Pro should charge up to over half its capacity in just 23 minutes.

However the OnePlus 8 Pro beats the OnePlus 7T Pro hands down when it comes to wireless charging. The OnePlus 7T Pro didn’t support wireless charging at all. If you purchase the optional Warp Charge 30 wireless charger the OnePlus 8 Pro will charge wirelessly at about the same speed as its wired charging rate. There’s also support for reverse wireless charging for the OnePlus 8 Pro but it’s pretty slow at just 3W.

Other features

Both phones have an in-display fingerprint sensor. Both also use OnePlus’s OxygenOS and Android 10. There’s not a ton of bloatware on OnePlus 8 Pro and it includes support for Dark Mode 2.0 which adds a dark mode to many popular apps that don’t natively support it. Finally the OnePlus 8 Pro officially has an IP68 water and dust resistance rating compared to no such rating at all on the OnePlus 7T Pro.

Launch price When it launched the OnePlus 7T Pro had a starting price of £699 (~$762). That price point while still higher than previous OnePlus phones still made the OnePlus 7T Pro more affordable compared to other flagship devices with most of the same specs. If you wanted to get the limited McLaren Edition with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage you had to pay much more. It’s sold by T-Mobile for $699 after a $200 price cut.

The OnePlus 8 Pro is definitely much more expensive from the jump compared to the standard OnePlus 7T Pro. It normally starts at $899 with 128GB of storage and at $999 with 256GB of storage. That may turn off many people who expect something with a lower price from OnePlus. However compared to the normal price of Samsung’s Galaxy S20 Plus ($1199) the OnePlus 8 Pro still offers a lot of value. Recently the company cut the price of the phone. It’s available directly from OnePlus at $799 if you get the Glacial Green color which has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. For the same price you can get the phone with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in Onyx Black or Ultramarine Blue colors.

OnePlus 8 Pro Killer flagship OnePlus is all grown up. With the OnePlus 8 Pro you get an unabashed flagship with all the bells and whistles. Powerful specs an amazing display fast wireless charging and water resistance make the OnePlus 8 Pro a great alternative to the Galaxy S20 Plus and it's up to $300 cheaper.

Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports

The New York Giants went on a spending spree this off-season backloading a majority of the contracts to 2022 and 2023. With the expectation that the salary cap will increase tremendously over the next few years due to a massive TV deal executed this off-season signing lofty contracts now that expire in two seasons makes a ton of sense. Not only do they match up with the expanding cap space but also the expiration of quarterback Daniel Jonesâ€™ rookie deal.

However in the process of signing these big names they were forced to let go of one of their captains interior defender Delvin Tomlinson. Normally letting influential players walk that have a significant impact on the locker room is a negative but the Giants have plenty of veteran players who can take over in that facet. One of them is safety Jabrill Peppers who had a career year in 2020 totaling 91 combined tackles 2.5 sacks eight tackles for loss and allowed a 65.2% completion rate over 69 targets nearly double his sample size from 2019.

Peppers proved that he is not only an energizer on defense but deserves to be a long-term solution in the middle of the Giantsâ€™ safety unit. Currently heâ€™s projected to earn $6.77 million for the 2021 season entirely guaranteed. The only way the Giants could get his salary off the books would be to trade him but that would be a devastatingly poor decision.

The New York Giants have gotten the best out of Peppers:

The former Cleveland Brown has taken significant steps forward in his career since joining Big Blue making the transition from free safety to strong safety where he has thrived and developed under Patrick Graham in 2020.

Last season he played 383 total snaps in the box 264 at slot corner and 143 at free safety. While he allowed 499 yards and two scores the Giants played a predominant zone coverage scheme which can oftentimes allocate yards to players who are simply close to the pass catcher and not in man coverage. This can often times skew the statistics as Peppers was a quality force in the run game and adequate when dropping back into coverage. He also picked up a few impressive sacks one of which against the Seattle Seahawks saw him burst through running back Chris Carson and wallop Russell Wilson in the backfield.

Ultimately that leads us to our primary discussion â€” should the Giants extend him now instead of waiting?

Theoretically if the Giants did extend him they could lower his cap hit for the season and maybe sign a better offensive line piece to compete.

Alternatively Peppers might want to take a chance on himself balling out in 2021 and compounding that into a massive contract next season. Given his growth only an injury would significantly hurt his value and potential earnings which is possible even probable in the NFL. Considering heâ€™s missed a few games over the last two years if the Giants did offer him a long-term extension Peppers might be smart to accept and cash in as the cap sky-rockets in 2023 when he turns 28.

This leads me to believe that the Giants simply havenâ€™t offered him an extension but they could get a deal done mid-season if he proves to take another step forward. They also did spend a draft pick on Xavier McKinney last year and signed Logan Ryan to a three-year deal this past off-season. Peppers is a different player though featuring a thumper style that isnâ€™t afraid to get physical in the run game. I believe the Giants would be intelligent to keep him around for the long term and the 2021 season will tell us everything we need to know.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We’ve got a glimpse of this year’s stage!

Raymond James Stadium transforming for WrestleMania 37

The Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida was originally scheduled to host WrestleMania last year. The COVID-19 pandemic happened and all those plans derailed. However fast forward one year later things are almost normal and we’ll have WrestleMania with fans at the venue!

A recently released drone footage from Action Jax FPV shows the WrestleMania 37 construction that is underway. One can clearly see WWE has instilled two mammoth pirate ships inside the Raymond James Stadium.

One ship is fully complete near one of the score walls. The other ship construction is underway alongside the stage.

By the early looks of it the ship will be on top of the entrance. The idea of it has already given us goosebumps as it promises to be another impressive stage.

There is nothing more that we could identify in the video. The stage looks in the early stages but we’re sure it will be functional by the weekend.

In an interview with Metro veteran WWE Set Designer Jason Robinson talked about what fans could expect with this year’s WrestleMania stage. He said “A lot of sports fans around the world have just seen the stadium so they know what it looks like. Now it’s our turn.

“We’re going in there to do something different. I don’t think it matters whether fans are seeing it again after the Super Bowl or for the first time with WWE; they are going to love what they see” he continued.

NEW YORK (AP) — Quarterback Tom Brady is proving he’s the GOAT not just on the football field but also in the collectibles market: A rookie football card just sold for $2.25 million.

The card was signed by the GOAT a common reference to Brady that stands for “greatest of all time.”

The price fetched through online sports auction house Lelands broke a football card record that was previously held by Brady. Another of his rookie cards sold for $1.32 million on PWCC Marketplace last month.

“Tom Brady continues to shatter records both on and off the football field” Lelands President Mike Heffner said in a statement.

Brady began his professional football career with the New England Patriots where he won six Super Bowls.

He continued his winning ways after parting from the Patriots in 2020 and joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He earned his seventh Super Bowl win when the Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs earlier this year.

The crisis in the Tigray region has brought on thousands of deaths and millions of people have been displaced.

The Weeknd whose real name is Abel Tesfaye was born in Canada but is the son of two Ethiopian immigrants.

In June he donated $1 million to help those affected by the coronavirus pandemic as well as $500000 to nonprofit organizations committed to racial equality. He also pledged $300000 to victims of the explosion in Beirut Lebanon in August.

Donations to help with hunger relief in Ethiopia can be made on the U.N. World Food Program’s website which explains that “the outbreak of conflict in Tigray last November coincided with the peak harvest period leading to lost employment and incomes disrupted markets a rise in food prices and limited access to cash and fuel” and that the organization is “aiming to support 1.4 million of these vulnerable people before it’s too late.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbWljaGFlbC1qb3JkYW4tamFtZXMtci1qb3JkYW4tbXVyZGVyLXRydWUtY3JpbWUtZG9jdW1lbnRhcnktbW9tZW50LW9mLXRydXRo0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9taWNoYWVsLWpvcmRhbi1qYW1lcy1yLWpvcmRhbi1tdXJkZXItdHJ1ZS1jcmltZS1kb2N1bWVudGFyeS1tb21lbnQtb2YtdHJ1dGguYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Murder of Michael Jordan's father examined in new doc raising questions about shocking investigation,"EXCLUSIVE: For 25 years Daniel Green has maintained his innocence in the 1993 murder of Michael Jordan’s father.

Now a new true-crime documentary titled ""Moment of Truth"" is examining the problematic investigation behind James Raymond Jordan’s shocking death in North Carolina at age 56.

The five-part series directed by Matthew Perniciaro and Clay Johnson also promises to present new compelling information with critical court documents and evidence photos from the case as well as exclusive interviews and never-before-released trial audio.

""I was living in Raleigh North Carolina when the crime took place"" Perniciaro told Fox News. ""So it’s something I’ve been aware of for the majority of my life… There were so many unanswered questions about this case that even at the time as a young person I remember elements not fully adding up.""

Jordan is one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships. The 58-year-old is now the owner of the NBA’s Charlotte Hornets.

He and his father were known to be incredibly close. A rep for Jordan did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

James was killed after pulling over on the side of Interstate 95 for a nap during a trip from Wilmington to Charlotte The News & Observer reported. According to the outlet his badly decomposed body was discovered in a South Carolina swamp 11 days later.

""James Jordan was attending a funeral of a friend in Wilmington North Carolina"" Perniciaro explained. ""He was last seen at that funeral and shortly thereafter at a gathering. He left Wilmington North Carolina to drive to Charlotte where the family lived at that time in 1993. And along that trip he stopped in Robeson County. That is the time period we really start to explore and what potentially happened.""

JOHN WAYNE GACY LIKED ‘THE POWER OF DEATH’ RETIRED DETECTIVE REVEALS IN DOC: ‘IT MADE HIM FEEL LIKE A GOD’

Pals Green and Larry Demery ages 19 and 18 at the time were arrested and charged with James’ murder. Demery testified at their trial in 1996 that Green shot James as he slept in his luxury car The News & Observer reported. According to the outlet Green has always maintained that he helped Demery dispose of James’ body but that he wasn’t present when James was killed.

Demery was granted parole in 2020. He is expected to be a free man in 2023. Green is currently serving a life sentence.

""Larry and Daniel were childhood friends"" Perniciaro shared. ""And over the years Daniel maintains his belief that Larry lied about the events surrounding this crime and lied about Daniel’s involvement in that crime. But Daniel has said many times that they were both pawns.""

The documentary explores how the young men were possibly pinned against each other and threatened with the death penalty until one of them gave in. Demery testified against Green as part of a plea deal.

Chris Mumma Green’s attorney and the executive director of the North Carolina Center on Actual Innocence participated in the documentary. She also went to college with Jordan.

""I first became involved in Daniel’s case because of the blood issue"" she explained. ""What was called blood was shown to the jury. I do not believe scientifically it could be called blood. I don’t think there’s any evidence that there was any blood in the car whatsoever. So that was the first issue. But then the more I learned about the case the more I learned that there were many issues about [it].""

""There’s the trajectory of the bullet the lack of the bullet hole in the shirt the clear pitting between Daniel Green and Larry Demery against each other with the threats of the death penalty being used"" she continued. ""There was also the pressure to solve this case quickly and the tunnel vision of the investigation. There’s just so much that did not fit the more you uncovered. And I think there’s still more to uncover today. I don’t think we’re anywhere near the truth of what happened in this case.""

JOHN WALSH’S SON CALLAHAN EXPLAINS HOW HIS BROTHER ADAM'S MURDER MADE HIM DETERMINED TO CATCH ‘BAD GUYS’

In 2017 The Associated Press reported that Green’s attorneys asked for a new trial saying someone tampered with James’ shirt after his autopsy. The autopsy found no hole in his shirt that corresponded with the bullet wound in his upper right chest area but an agent with the State Bureau of Investigation later contradicted that on the witness stand according to the lawyers’ filing in North Carolina’s Robeson County Superior Court.

The court filing made that year stated the absence of a hole in the right chest area contradicted the prosecutor’s theory that James was lying in his car when he was shot. The filing also described an unusual chain of custody for the shirt. It said that Dr. Joel Sexton who performed the autopsy gave it to a law enforcement officer who then gave it to a civilian employee of a company that provided services for funeral homes. Then the employee gave the shirt to his boss who said he buried it in his backyard because of the smell.

When law enforcement later determined that the shirt was evidence the piece of clothing was exhumed. It was then that an SBI agent reported the presence of a bullet hole in the upper right chest area of the shirt the filing said. Sexton however had written in the autopsy report that he looked for and didn’t find a hole that corresponded with James’ fatal wound. Instead Sexton wrote he found three holes near the shirttail.

""Anytime you have a high profile case there’s going to be more public pressure to solve it whether it’s coming from the family themselves the community or just media pressure"" Mumma explained. ""Obviously with the connection to Michael Jordan this case had tremendous pressure… Unfortunately the public narrative comes a lot from journalists.""

""... This went from an unidentified John Doe found in the swamp to the identification of James Jordan to the immediate effort to move this case as quickly as possible"" she continued. ""And then both boys were looking at the death penalty. The case actually moved much faster than any case would move today. So I definitely think there was the pressure for closing it.""

VIRGINIA’S HORRIFYING COLONIAL PARKWAY MURDERS CAN STILL BE SOLVED DECADES LATER WITH NEW LEADS DOC REVEALS

Perniciaro hopes the documentary will shed light on how the case continues to perplex people decades later.

""This story was reported by the media but very rarely it was reported about the human beings involved"" he said. ""We want to tell this story not just with a level of investigative detail that hadn’t been presented but with a degree of humanity. The Jordan family suffered a great loss. You have to be sensitive understanding and respectful of that at all times. But Daniel and Larry their lives and their family’s lives were forever changed as well.""

""It’s a very sobering reminder that this case took place nearly 30 years ago and we are still seeing these same things happen today"" he shared. ""And if we want real change in our society we have to tell these stories.""

RTX,RTX Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9pLXRob3VnaHQtbWluZWNyYWZ0LXJ0eC13YXMtYS1naW1taWNrLWFuZC10aGVuLWktcGxheWVkLXRoZS1kYW1uLXRoaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I thought Minecraft RTX was a gimmick until I played the damn thing,"I've been a huge fan of Minecraft almost as far back as its initial release – over a decade ago if anyone else needs to feel older than they should – and though I haven't played it consistently over the last few years it's always been something I crawl back to when I need a few chill evenings away from competitive gaming environments.



When the beta for Minecraft with RTX was announced I was actually rather confused. A large reason I loved the game was because of its ridiculously low system requirements. You can almost run it on a toaster if needed but its accessibility was a great selling point.



Whether it was my beaten-up laptop or the old family desktop computer it was always a game that my siblings and I could play. The friends I had back then that could afford dedicated gaming computers could run beautiful games that demanded beefier components even when the graphics in games like Skyrim or Crysis 2 reduced down to the lowest playable settings.



Minecraft was an equal playing field not in a unique sense but the popularity of a game that made zero effort to look 'pretty' was truly impressive. At the end of the day a block was a block.

Minecraft RTX won't run on potato machines

Only it isn't anymore. I was skeptical of putting ray tracing into a game like Minecraft because to me it didn't make sense. RTX was for games like Cyberpunk 2077 or Metro Exodus graphically demanding titles that seduced your eyeballs with buckets of atmosphere and semi-realistic environments. RTX Minecraft felt like adding sparkles to Lego.

Having been lucky enough to get my hands on an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card I finally have access to ray tracing in games and now that I've played through a few old favorites that have been enhanced by the fancy lighting effects I'll admit that Minecraft was the game that truly knocked my socks off.

This could be because the game was so simple to begin with – I went in not expecting to be as blown away as I was so the results took me completely by surprise. I was previously struggling to imagine how a lump of pixelated blocks would be enhanced enough to justify the low hardware requirements being sacrificed.

The original version of Minecraft obviously isn't going anywhere so I'll still be happily running around on java for many years to come but looking back I think a great deal of my initial skepticism was actually FOMO due to the older gaming PC I was rocking at the time. Minecraft RTX was in beta before the launch of the Ampere GPU series so the only folk who could play it at the time were those who had the cash for the pricey Nvidia Turing hardware.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Mojang) (Image credit: Mojang)

While the Nvidia Ampere cards are sadly harder to find than Ender Pearls they are more affordable (if found at MSRP) and with the way games are heading it's important that features like DLSS and RTX become more accessible. An Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 retails for around $329 (about £240 AU$430) depending on what version you buy or the more powerful Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti can be found for $399 (about £299 AU$540).



The minimum requirements for Minecraft RTX right now are as follows:

An Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 CPU

An NVIDIA 2060 / AMD Radeon RX Vega 64

8GB of RAM

10GB of storage

A 64-bit version of Windows 10

You'll also need to be running the Bedrock version of the game rather than Java so check what game edition you have before you get frustrated over missing features. If you're wanting to create your own world then you should check out guides that go through creating your own Physically Based Rendering (PBR) textures or upgrading existing texture packs for the full ray tracing experience.



As you may have already seen from the images I also chose to dive into a premade world mostly because I'm a massive Lord of the Rings dork and couldn't pass up the opportunity to explore Minas Tirith. You can download it for yourself here if you too want to reenact scenes from Return of the King with your friends.

I'm a ray tracing convert

Naturally the lighting is utterly incredible when you step into any RTX-enabled world. The initial beta appeared to give a plastic-like sheen to just about everything but this seems to have been fixed in the official release. During sunrise and sundown the foliage and buildings are beautifully illuminated with warm light and it's really surreal how such blocky game can look this good.



In traditional Minecraft Bedrock texture files only use base color and opacity maps to create the now iconic look that helped to popularize simple graphics in sandbox games again. The new PBR system adds additional textures to this to really help the surfaces pop with realistic lighting.



These are Metallic Emissive (or 'glowy') Roughness and Height. When used in combined situations like base building you really get to see some breathtaking results. The torches in your cubic cabins will shine on metal surfaces like a mirror while carpeted or other textured surfaces like wood will have nicely contrasting shadows and grooves.



The water effects nearly caused me to have some sort of anxiety attack being accustomed to the original Minecraft diving in which underwater just resembles a slightly bubbly (but otherwise perfectly clear) version of the rest of the land. Not the case with ray tracing though – when I dove under for the first time my real-life fear of the water (or thalassophobia if you feel fancy) was triggered hard.



What had originally been complete visibility was now reactive to how much light was available creating a murky aquatic hellscape. If you don't share my fear then you'll likely love how strangely accurate it is being underwater a trippy effect for a game that was never intended to emulate realism. Fish and other marine life swim out of the murk towards you light shines through in beams from the surface and in shallow water even I found myself muttering ""gosh this is lovely"" despite myself.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Mojang) (Image credit: Mojang)

The combined effect is almost like an entirely new game. If someone had slapped 'Minecraft 2' onto this I'd have believed them given the drastic difference in the graphics. The dungeons are creepier the jungles feel more alive and I feel I'll have a hard time going back to the organic graphics of the base game having experienced such luxury.



Speaking of which you'll need to make sure DLSS is activated in Nvidia GPUs to enjoy RTX at its best given how much of a frame rate sacrifice is required to crank up the visuals for these effects. With everything cranked up to full on performance mode I was getting a comfortable average of 50fps on an EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 but without that lovely AI framerate booster it was slugging along at around 15fps.



If you have the compatible hardware to actually try Minecraft RTX for yourself then I'd really recommend giving it a go especially if you're an established fan of the game. I had initially dismissed it based on my own snobbish belief around ray tracing and having a play around in Mojang's pixel sandbox certainly opened my eyes to the possibilities of how it can be applied outside of already demanding AAA titles.



If it works this well on such a simple game then what else can we do with it? My eyes have been opened to the possibilities. I also initially snubbed it being used in games like Fortnite but from the footage I've seen streamed of the game it really does look wonderful. I could probably even be sold by RTX Sims at this point.

There is a fair bit of discussion surrounding how technology like DLSS and raytracing could be the 'new normal' for future releases a thought that initially scared me given how much of the PC gaming community uses older hardware. The Steam Hardware Survey at the time of writing has the GTX 1060 GTX 1050 Ti and GTX 1650 graphics cards taking up the top 20% of all current GPUs so RTX and DLSS will still be unachievable for many.



I'm keeping all my fingers crossed that something gives to end the current graphics cards shortage be that the Etherium boom ending or simply providing more availability for the GPUs. If more folk get the opportunity to upgrade to the new budget RTX cards then features like ray tracing can be enjoyed across more games by the wider community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzQvMy8yMjM2NjA3NC9udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwNzAtMzA4MC0zMDkwLTMwNjAtdGktc3RlYW0taGFyZHdhcmUtc3VydmV5LW1hcmNoLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steam survey suggests Nvidia's RTX 3070 is actually trickling into the hands of gamers,"Now that the street price of an Nvidia RTX 3070 is over $1200 it’s temping to think scalpers bots and cryptocurrency miners got them all — but the latest Steam Hardware Survey suggests at least some of them are making their way into gaming PCs too. As TechSpot reports the 3070 in particular appears to have become Steam’s fastest growing GPU and the 17th-most popular graphics accelerator on Steam with a 1.29 percent share overall.

The top 20 GPUs on Steam as of March 2021.

The RTX 3080 also commands 0.87 percent the RTX 3060 Ti has 0.39 percent and the pricey RTX 3090 claims 0.34 percent of the market — for a total of 2.89 percent Ampere cards.

That not bad especially considering AMD’s rival RX 6000 series doesn’t have a single spot on the entire 95-GPU leaderboard. Apparently more gamers are using the 2011 Nvidia GeForce GTX 550 Ti (0.16 percent) than any of AMD’s latest cards.

More than a quarter of Steam PC gamers are now using AMD CPUs instead of Intel though so that’s probably some consolation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYW1kLTY3MDB4dC1udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwNzAtYmVzdC1ncHUtdW5kZXItNTAwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD 6700XT vs. Nvidia RTX 3070: What's the Best GPU Under $500?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYW1kLTY3MDB4dC1udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwNzAtYmVzdC1ncHUtdW5kZXItNTAwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL252aWRpYXMtcmVzaXphYmxlLWJhci1zdXBwb3J0LXJ0eC0zMC1zZXJpZXMtZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's Resizable Bar Support for RTX 30 Series Explained,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL252aWRpYXMtcmVzaXphYmxlLWJhci1zdXBwb3J0LXJ0eC0zMC1zZXJpZXMtZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvcmV2aWV3cy9sZW5vdm8tdGhpbmtwYWQtcDE3LXJldmlldy1pbnRlbC14ZW9uLWFuZC1xdWFkcm8tcnR4LXBvd2VyL9IBVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvYW1wL2xlbm92by10aGlua3BhZC1wMTctcmV2aWV3LWludGVsLXhlb24tYW5kLXF1YWRyby1ydHgtcG93ZXIv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lenovo ThinkPad P17 review: Intel Xeon and Quadro RTX power,"Lenovo's ThinkPad P-series is for mobile workstations and the 17-inch version is always a blast to review because it's just a beast. I'll tell you right now in my time with the ThinkPad P17 I simply used it like I would use a desktop. It had dual 4K monitors connected to it I edited 4K 60fps video on it and so on and it never even broke a sweat.

That's the kind of power that we're talking about here and actually a whole lot more. With an Intel Xeon W-10885M it's got some power and it's made to perform some complex tasks. If you're doing 3D rendering and stuff like that this is for you.

And the other key part of that is the Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000 graphics card which comes with 16GB GDDR6. That means that you get a ton of video memory real-time ray tracing and more.

Day one

Design

If you imagine what a ThinkPad is supposed to look like and then you imagine it as a monster of a PC that's literally as powerful as mobile computers get you'll land on what the ThinkPad P17 looks and feels like. It weighs in at nearly eight pounds and I can't even fit it into my backpack. It's almost one and a third inches thick.

Despite all of that Lenovo actually calls it thin and light in its reviewer's guide. The top is made out of Polyphenylene sulfide and glass-fiber while the bottom is made out of polyamide and glass-fiber. These are light materials to use and they're also durable. As is the case with all ThinkPads this machine passed over a dozen MIL-STD-810G tests.

From the top-down view it's just a big ThinkPad coming in all black with the silver ThinkPad logo. The logo isn't the one that Lenovo uses on premium X1 or P1 ThinkPads but this is certainly more powerful than any of those.

But from a side view it's nice and thick and just as you would expect there are tons of ports. On the left there's a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A port which sadly means that it only supports 5Gbps speeds whereas USB 3.2 Gen 2 would have supported 10Gbps. There's also an HDMI 2.0 port a 3.5mm audio jack and a SIM tray if you configured this with cellular connectivity.

On the right there are two more USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports along with an SD card reader and a Kensington Lock. There's also a slot for a Smart Card reader if you opted for it when you purchased the machine.

That's not all though because there are even more ports on the back. You'll find three USB Type-C ports back there one of which is USB 3.2 Gen 1 while the other two are Thunderbolt 3. There's also an Ethernet port and a power port because USB Type-C power delivery wouldn't support nearly enough wattage to power this beast.

Overall the design is what I'd call unmanageable which is common for 17-inch laptops let alone 17-inch laptops that are as big as this one. I think that this is something that you buy if it's going to remain stationary for 75-90% of the time. If it stays on your desk 100% of the time you should get a desktop workstation and if you're taking it on the go more of the time you'll want something that's a bit easier to carry like the 15.6-inch ThinkPad P15.

Display and audio

The ThinkPad P17 has you guessed it a 17.3-inch screen. There are two options one of which is 1080p at 300-nit brightness and one of which is 4K UHD at 500-nit brightness also supporting Dolby Vision HDR.

The one that Lenovo sent me has the 4K display which is still 16:9 unsurprisingly. Personally I think that's the one to get. I don't even want 1080p at 15.6 let alone 17.3 inches. And also 300 nits is too dim for me on a laptop as you never know when you need to take it on the road.

On a machine like this I feel like the display is particularly important. You might be using it to edit high-resolution high frame rate video like I did or you can be using it for anything else. But whatever it is you're going to want to be able to see it in its finest detail. Plus the 2160p version comes with support for Dolby Vision HDR so everything is just going to look better.

Of course 2160p has four times as many pixels as 1080p and that means that the higher resolution comes at a cost to battery life. You can also keep in mind that the internals are already very powerful so don't be surprised when the battery life isn't very good.

One thing that's new this year is the Dolby Atmos speaker system using two 2W speakers in a soundbar that's placed above the keyboard. On the ThinkPad P72 which is this device's predecessor it had Dolby Audio. I'd say that the biggest difference this time around is that the sound is clearer and overall it's an impressive system.

Keyboard touchpad and TrackPoint

As usual the keyboard is a winner although Lenovo's full 1.5mm key throw is really starting to feel like too much to me. Still it's accurate and comfortable.

As I mentioned earlier I very much used this PC in the same way that I'd use a desktop PC with a couple of 4K monitors attached and doing heavy duty tasks. Naturally the keyboard that I used was the one on the laptop. I typed all of my articles on it for a couple of weeks I used it for chat and I used it for everything else. I never had a single complaint and frankly that's the real test.

Just like on almost every other ThinkPad except for the ThinkPad X1 Fold the P17 comes with a TrackPoint on the keyboard. Chances are that if you're reading a review about a ThinkPad you're aware of the little red nub that controls the pointer and you either love it or hate it. If you hate it as many do you can ignore it.

The Microsoft Precision touchpad is positioned to the left of the center and that should have replaced the TrackPoint by now. Frankly I suspect that Lenovo keeps it not just for the die hard fans but for the iconic design. Not only does the TrackPoint sit in the middle of the keyboard but the clickable trackpad also has physical buttons above it that can be used with either one. Every ThinkPad keyboard deck has this look.

Performance and battery life

I keep comparing this to desktop usage and performance because I feel like that's what you have to need for this to be practical. You have to need workstation-class performance and a desktop-like use case but for some reason be unable to get an actual desktop PC.

This thing is absolutely a beast and the model that Lenovo sent me is specced out with an Intel Xeon W-10885M and Quadro RTX 5000 graphics. This can be configured for a variety of use cases; for example you have a choice between Xeon and Core processors. When comparing a Xeon to a Core i9 it's not that one is better than the other but it's more about what your workload is about.

It's kind of a similar story when it comes to graphics although it's a bit simpler. The Quadro RTX 5000 has 16GB GDDR6 memory and it offers things like real-time ray tracing something that can really come in handy when rendering. But you might simply not need all of that power and that makes it not worth the extra $3000 that it costs to add it on when configuring your ThinkPad P17.

The P17 base model comes with a Core i5-10400H CPU and a Quadro T1000 GPU. There are eight different CPU options including six Core processors and two Xeon chips and there are five Quadro GPU options including the T1000 T2000 RTX 3000 RTX 4000 and RTX 5000.

Of course all of this leads to terrible battery life which is fine. The desktop use case that I envision for this type of PC means that it's plugged in all the time anyway. Honestly if you're taking a ThinkPad P17 mobile workstation on the road are you really planning on being far from a power outlet for long?

For benchmarks I used PCMark 8 PCMark 10 3DMark VRMark Geekbench and Cinebench.

ThinkPad P17

Xeon W-10885M Quadro RTX 5000 ThinkPad P72

Xeon E-2186M Quadro P5200 ThinkPad P53

Core i7-9850H Quadro RTX 5000 PCMark 8: Home 4395 4001 4856 PCMark 8: Creative 6258 5406 6030 PCMark 8: Work 3385 3321 4021 PCMark 10 6734 5279 6131 3DMark: Time Spy 8794 6525 VRMark: Orange Room 11721 10312 VRMark: Blue Room 2678 1121 Geekbench 1341 / 8229 Cinebench 1313 / 9941



If you want you can compare this model to the ThinkPad P53 from over a year ago since they have the same graphics. You can see that in some areas the Coire i9 comes out ahead and in others the Xeon comes out ahead.

Conclusion

The ThinkPad P17 as I've said a few times is a beast. My only problems with it are unavoidable such as the fact that it's massive and that battery life is not good. It's also super expensive but that's more a result of the fact that it uses such high-end parts.

In fact the P17 actually offers four times as many CPU and GPU configurations as its predecessors and thanks to the new design it can handle higher wattage GPUs. That can be up to 90 watts in the P15 or up to 110 watts in the P17.

I mention that for a reason. The 15.6-inch ThinkPad P15 is definitely going to be more manageable but if you need the most power you still have to go for the P17. Like I said earlier you really have to need desktop performance but for some reason be unable to go all-in on a desktop workstation.

Also to be clear Lenovo's ThinkPad P-series has been around for a while and there's nothing wild that's changing. It's got the latest specs the 17-inch model is the most powerful and so on.

The bottom line is that this thing is as powerful as a portable PC can get. If you want to check it out on Lenovo.com you can find it here.

The stock of Nomad Foods (NYSE:NOMD 30-year Financials) shows every sign of being modestly overvalued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $27.92 per share and the market cap of $4.9 billion Nomad Foods stock is estimated to be modestly overvalued. GF Value for Nomad Foods is shown in the chart below.





Nomad Foods Stock Is Estimated To Be Modestly Overvalued

Because Nomad Foods is relatively overvalued the long-term return of its stock is likely to be lower than its business growth which averaged 7.3% over the past three years and is estimated to grow 1.74% annually over the next three to five years.

Link: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.

Since investing in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss investors must carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Nomad Foods has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.24 which ranks worse than 66% of the companies in the industry of Consumer Packaged Goods. Based on this GuruFocus ranks Nomad Foods's financial strength as 4 out of 10 suggesting poor balance sheet. This is the debt and cash of Nomad Foods over the past years:

One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Nomad Foods is 7.3% which ranks better than 68% of the companies in the industry of Consumer Packaged Goods. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 15.2% which ranks better than 74% of the companies in the industry of Consumer Packaged Goods.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months Nomad Foods's return on invested capital is 6.33 and its cost of capital is 4.01. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Nomad Foods is shown below:

""Anya's wearing custom Vera Wang"" her stylist for the evening Law Roach told InStyle over the phone. The lace-trimmed minidress toes the line between edgy and elegant and according to Roach it was inspired by the glamour of vintage nightgowns: ""Her look feels very high-end nighttime dressing gown. It almost feels like an underpinning but the silhouette of it is very much a cocktail dress.""

Her method? Beet-juiced color-changing sutures.

Taylor’s research earned her a spot among the 300 finalists in the 80th Regeneron Science Talent Search a nationwide contest for high school seniors put on by Society for Science.

“I wanted to conduct research. I didn’t think I was going to get this far” Taylor told The Gazette’s Grace King. “This was really a chance for me to branch out and use my creativity.

“I love my project and to find out that it was working and to get the results I did I was over the moon.”

Taylor’s interest in surgical sutures began a few years prior after being given a set for Christmas King reported. (Literally an actual box of them — she was interested in becoming a surgeon at the time.)

The impetus for her color-changing sutures came from learning about “smart sutures” which can warn of infection via changes in a wound’s electrical resistance Smithsonian Magazine reports. When the sutures’ conductive surface detects a change it sends a warning to a smartphone or computer.

Which is all well and good in the U.S. but as Smithsonian notes may not be practical for patients in developing countries where up to 11% of surgical wounds develop infections according to the WHO. And among women who give birth via c-section in Africa up to 20% can suffer infections Smithsonian reports.

Taylor saw a chance to make a difference.

“I’ve done a lot of racial equity work in my community I’ve been a guest speaker at several conferences” Taylor told Smithsonian. “So when I was presented with this opportunity to do research I couldn’t help but go at it with an equity lens.”

The seventeen-year-old spent months of Fridays doing research under the tutelage of her chemistry teacher Carolyn Walling at Iowa City West High School. Taylor’s eventual solution was to take advantage of the natural pH levels of the skin.

Skin pH levels typically hover around 5 but an infection can cause pH to spike. When it does Taylor’s color-changing sutures dyed with beet juice go from red to purple.

“I found that beets changed color at the perfect pH point” Taylor told Smithsonian around a pH of 9. “That’s perfect for an infected wound. And so I was like ‘Oh okay. So beets is where it’s at.'”

Because changes in pH happen early in infection Taylor hopes the color-changing sutures can help spot infections early when antibiotics can treat them instead of more invasive measures.

Iowa City high school senior Dasia Taylor invented color-changing sutures that can catch infections quick. Her efforts earned her a spot in the top 300 of the 80th Regeneron Science Talent Search. Society for Science

Figuring out the correct material to use for the color-changing sutures proved the most challenging part The Gazette reported — a grinding process of trial-and-error. Taylor also needed to learn how to work in a sterile environment to test the sutures with bacteria provided by Iowa City West.

“I had to learn the proper technique of putting on a glove. I had never learned that before” Taylor told King.

Although she didn’t make the Science Talent Search’s top 3 Taylor has another important victory under her belt.

She entered her project into the Junior Sciences and Humanities Symposium a STEM competition sponsored by the Army Navy and Air Force in March of 2020 and immediately noticed she was the only black student in the room.

“Being in the room knowing stereotypes were flying and to be able to prove them wrong and win first place was phenomenal” Taylor told King.

“My mom and I talk about it all the time. I often find myself in white-dominated spaces. That’s definitely one for the books.”

But the product of his work isn’t a cake or a pie.

Instead Cunning’s creation is Woodside Plantation a large gated community on Aiken’s Southside that represented an unprecedented step forward on the local development scene when the project to construct it began in the 1980s.

The site “was nothing but pine trees and streams and lakes and whatever and look at what we have now” said Cunning recently. Within Woodside’s confines are well over 2000 luxury homes along with four golf courses two country club-style facilities and miles of nature trails.

In addition the high-end neighborhood’s establishment led to the launches of such other major real estate ventures nearby as The Village at Woodside Hollow Creek Preserve and most recently Anderson Farms which made its debut last year under the Woodside Communities umbrella.

“I enjoy building things and having them built in the right way and there’s still a lot more to do” Cunning said. “I’m proud of the way everything turned out.”

While Cunning likes to call the late Earle Holley who co-founded the Palmetto Federal Savings Bank of South Carolina the father of Woodside his own role as Holley’s employee also was significant.

Back when the plans were being made for Woodside in the 1980s Cunning headed up Palmetto Service Corp. which was the real estate arm of Palmetto Federal.

“If Earle was the general then I was a lieutenant” he said.

Today Cunning is the president of Woodside-Aiken Realty and also serves as the broker-in-charge. His boss is Rick Steele who has been the driving development force in and around Woodside since the 1990s.

The best of Pat Cunning • Date and place of birth: August 1947 in the Aiken County Hospital in Aiken.

Cunning and his Woodside-Aiken Realty colleagues “handle resales in all of Aiken"" he said “with our major business being inside the gates of Woodside Plantation any of Rick’s property and commercial leasing and sales in The Village at Woodside.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2012 the year the first municipality in the region adopted what is sometimes called single-stream or comingling the recycling rate in Clark County was a record 27.5% the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. By 2019 the latest year for which data is available from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection the rate dropped below 20%.

The region’s exclusive waste-hauler Republic Services of Southern Nevada blames materials contamination — like when a milk carton spills onto clean cardboard or paper making those items unsuitable for recycling.

It says education is needed.

“Don’t be a ‘wish-cycler’ simply throwing an item in if you’re unsure it’s recyclable or not hoping it’ll get recycled” said Jeremy Walters company sustainability expert. “You’re creating more harm than good. This needs to change.”

Steve Kalish president and CEO of Waste Logistics Inc. told the newspaper the idea of residential recycling by mixing materials in one large cart was doomed.

In 2008 Kalish sat on the Clark County Recycling Advisory Committee which reviewed community support for and opposition to the recycling program. It also reviewed recycling rates and costs.

“Back then no one on the committee wanted to hear the reality that single-stream recycling wasn’t going to work” he told the Review-Journal.

Recycling rates represent the percentage of discarded materials that are diverted from the landfill.

North Las Vegas was the first city in Clark County to approve single-stream recycling for single-family homes followed by unincorporated county areas Henderson in 2013 and the city of Las Vegas in 2016. By 2018 all four areas had implemented the program.

Previously residents sorted recyclables into stackable red white and blue bins. Their trash was picked up twice a week while recyclables were collected every other week.

Under the current system trash and recycling bins are picked up curbside once a week eliminating a second trash pickup each week.

“People started throwing their trash into their recycling bin since they only had one trash pickup day” Kalish said.

Susan Brager a former Clark County commissioner who approved the comingling plan in 2013 said she hoped for a different outcome.

“I was against it at first but then the pilot program began in my neighborhood and I saw that it worked” she said. “I knew it would be hard to monitor but I was hopeful at the time.”

The Nevada Legislature in 1991 adopted a recycling goal of 25% said Rachel Lewison Southern Nevada recycling coordinator at the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection.

Most recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data shows that in 2019 Nevada had a 21.7% recycling rate more than 10% below the national average of 32.1%.

Walters said he is hopeful. He noted that since single-stream recycling was widely implemented the company has seen a 400% increase in participation.

“There’s always work to be done” he said. “But I believe we’re on the right track.”

Tara Pike solid waste and recycling manager at the University of Nevada Las Vegas said greater participation creates a greater risk of contaminated recyclables.

The contamination rate in southern Nevada stands at 30% well above the 17% national average according to a Recycling Partnership 2019 State of Curbside Survey.

Experts say several variables come into play contamination rates.

Walters noted the regional recycling program is less than a decade old and said tourists traveling to Las Vegas from other places with various recycling policies may be unfamiliar with local programs.

Patty Moen northern Nevada recycling coordinator at the state Division of Environmental Protection said people became confused after single-stream recycling was introduced.

“Throwing everything in your bin doesn’t mean the entire bin will get recycled and sorted through” she said.

Republic Services opened a $35 million recycling center in 2015 in North Las Vegas. The facility is the size of two football fields. It uses optical sorters magnetic drums and humans to pluck contaminants from a conveyer belt carrying more than 1 million pounds of trash a day.

Walters said workers have seen all kinds of items.

“There’s the bowling balls the car parts soccer balls mannequins firearms lamps animals and wigs to name a few of the strangest” he said.

A company recycling guide shows that magazines cardboard plastic and glass bottles and metal cans can be recycled. Polystyrene food containers garden hoses greasy pizza boxes and bottles with ketchup still in them cannot.

Brager told the Review-Journal she thinks residents have grown complacent over the years.

“We need to boost education in our community and give people a nudge about our program constantly if we want to see our rates increase” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vb3ZjLm9qcC5nb3YvZGlyZWN0b3J5LWNyaW1lLXZpY3RpbS1zZXJ2aWNlcy9zZWFyY2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Search | Directory of Crime Victim Services | Office for Victims of Crime,"Type of Victimization - Any - Adult Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse Arson Assault Bullying Burglary Child Abuse/Neglect Child Pornography Child Sexual Abuse Domestic Violence/Family Violence DUI/DWI Crashes Elder Abuse/Neglect Hate Crimes Identity Theft Fraud or Financial Crime Kidnapping Labor Trafficking Other Vehicular Victimization Robbery Sex Trafficking Sexual Assault Stalking/Harassment Survivors of Homicide Victims Teen Dating Violence Terrorism and Mass Violence

FedNow which will be fully implemented by 2023 will let individuals and companies transfer funds between accounts pay bills and send or receive money from friends or family. The services will be near-real time and be available any day or time of the year.

The instant payments are differentiated by the speed at which they can be doled out as compared to traditional payment methods. While some traditional methods appear to go through within seconds they actually end up taking several days to go through and actually become available for the user the report stated.

First Republic Bank Tri Counties Bank Silicon Valley Bank Pacific Coast Bankers’ Bank and First Foundation Bank will be the banks testing the program while CUs participating are Excite Credit Union Farmers Insurance Federal Credit Union and Star One Credit Union according to the report.

FedNow is set to be released in phases the report stated and the first release will come with fraud prevention tools the ability to join instantly as a receive-only participant request for payment capability and tools to support participants in the way they handle payment inquiries. And Reserve Banks will have a liquidity management tool on offer.

Like with other Federal Reserve services the FedNow program will be available for depository institutions eligible to hold accounts at its 12 Reserve Banks and 24 branches around the country. The goal of the program is to expand equitable access to the instant payment system to over 10000 depository institutions or their agents in the U.S. according to the report.

In Europe immediate gratification with payments is becoming more common with BNP Paribas announcing it will be partnering with Token to make account-to-account (A2A) payments possible.",,,,,,

Robert Lewandowski’s knee injury has put the Polish Hitman on the shelf and Müller can only be left to think about what things might have looked like if the duo was able to take the field as a tandem.

“We know that when we play together we are stronger” said Müller in an interview with ESPN. “He’s very good because I know what he wants to do so I know to how set it up for him. He knows that when I look up I try to find him. I always try to find the straightest way to the goal and normally that’s [by looking for] the striker. He knows I don’t play for the circus shot I play for scoring.”

The duo’s relationship is truly one-of-a-kind in the sport for today’s game. There are certainly other great tandems but there might not be two players who feed off of each more than Müller and Lewandowski.

How will the Bavarians do without their leading scorer against RB Leipzig? We’ll find out very shortly.",,,,,,,,,,,,

What it’s about: Just your typical collection of hydrocoptic marzlevanes fitted to an ambifacient lunar waneshaft. In 1944 British grad student John Hellins Quick wrote of a nonexistent machine in the pages of the Institution of Engineering and Technology’s Students’ Quarterly Journal using a ridiculous abundance of nonsense technobabble not seen outside late-season Star Trek: The Next Generation. Engineers the world over embraced the device—whose main winding “was of the normal lotus-o-deltoid type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots in the stator”—and the turboencabulator’s legend lives on more than 75 years later.

English view video Unauthorized Anthony Bourdain biography sparks controversy

Biggest controversy: Time magazine not renowned for their sense of humor got in on the joke in 1946 printing a straight-faced description of the turboencabulator that had readers baffled. Many people wrote in to complain that the magazine was using too much technical jargon for the layperson; others guessed the device was everything from a high-powered motor to a “wonderful machine for changing baby’s diapers.” One reader suggested “it sounds like a dictionary that has been struck by lightning.”

Thing we were happiest to learn: People have taken the joke very very far over the years. General Electric slipped a page on the turboencabulator into its 1962 handbook the rest of which contains specs for actual GE products. In 1977 a crew working with General Motos put in some unpaid overtime to make a fake training film about the turboenabulator basing their script on Quick’s original article from 1944. 11 year later Chrysler made its own spoof showing how the turboencabulator is serviced (the Wiki page links to both videos along with an introduction to Rockwell Automation’s Retro Encabulator). In 2016 nonprofit PATH posted an April Fools’ video describing the Micro Encabulator as a “game-changing global health technology featuring hydrocoptic miniaturization and advanced panametric fam alignment.”

Thing we were unhappiest to learn: Describing a made-up device with made-up words is more or less the pinnacle of engineer humor and there isn’t a lot of competition at least according to Wikipedia’s Tech Humour category which only lists three pages—this one FFF system (a joke about how impractical Imperial measurements can be namely the furlong firkin and fortnight) and List of Humorous Units of Measurement (which includes FFF) and sounds like a real knee-slapper.

Best link to elsewhere on Wikipedia: Isaac Asimov did for one scientific discipline what J.H. Quick did for mechanical engineering. Besides being a renowned author of science fiction and nonfiction Asimov had a doctorate in chemistry. While doing doctoral research he observed catechol dissolving the instant it contacted water. Asimov mused that if the substance were any more soluble it would dissolve before it touched the water. So he wrote a scientific paper about thiotimoline an imaginary molecule whose chemical bonds reached into the future and the past causing the material to dissolve in advance of contact with water. He published the article in Astounding Science Fiction on the condition that it run under a pseudonym worried that Columbia might think him less than serious in his pursuit of his doctorate. The magazine didn’t comply and the Columbia University faculty slipped a question about thiotimoline into Asimov’s dissertation defense acknowledging that they were in on the joke. He got his degree and thiotimoline made it into several of his innumerable short stories.

Further Down the Wormhole: G.E.’s Instrument Department which was responsible for the turboencabulator page in the 1962 handbook was located in Lynn Massachusetts. For a town of less than 100000 people Lynn has numerous claims to fame: Frederick Douglass lived there when he wrote his first groundbreaking memoir Narrative Of The Life Of Frederick Douglass An American Slave; General Electric was formed there when Lynn’s Thomson-Houston Electric Company merged with Schenectady’s Edison Electric; and it was home to the first iron works the first fire engine the first baseball game played under artificial light and the first roast beef sandwich. Besides Douglass past residents include 60 Minutes journalist Lesley Stahl Social Distortion singer Mike Ness and actress Verna Bloom who appeared in films as varied as Animal House High Plains Drifter and The Last Temptation of Christ. Among other distinctions Last Temptation is notable for being the Martin Scorsese film with the least amount of cursing. In sharp contrast to that is The Wolf Of Wall Street a film that ranks third on the all-time List of Films That Most Frequently Use the Word “Fuck”.

Going out clothes are back baby.

Dress sales are on the rise. Jeans are coming back. People are shopping for dress shirts. After over 12 months of stretchy pants sweatshirts and no shoes shoppers are ready to start looking good again.

As vaccinations rise nationwide and political leaders predict a return to normalcy by this summer retailers are beginning to see a shift away from at-home clothes.

It's part of a broader trend that some are calling ""hot vax summer.""

The rise of comfy clothes

When it started to become clear last spring just how widespread the coronavirus was becoming and how much it would disrupt daily life retailers took action.

By the end of March H&M Macy's Nordstrom Ross Stores and TJ Maxx canceled orders for new merchandise — by April Gap nixed orders for both summer and fall in an effort to cut costs. An October report from workers rights groups found that between April and June of last year retailers outright canceled or simply refused to pay for $16.2 billion worth of orders.

At the time these reactions portended just how long and intense the pandemic would be. And while ecommerce sales flourished throughout the year — online consumer spending in 2020 was up 42% from 2019 — those purchases were mostly confined to comfy clothes and athleisure. From March to July 2020 sales of shorts sweatpants and sports bras were on the rise despite overall apparel sales dropping 34%.

Which means that for more than 12 months the market for going-out tops sundresses and high heels has been dormant — until now.

Parallels to the Roaring 20s

On March 11 President Joe Biden made an announcement: July 4 2021 could officially become Independence Day from the coronavirus in the US. There was a ""good chance"" he said that we could all have small outdoor parties to celebrate the 4th of July.

The announcement is thrilling on several levels. Most importantly it means that months of suffering and death could finally be coming to an end and that schools and businesses that have been disrupted during the last year might finally reopen.

WASHINGTON April 2 (Reuters) – The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention on Friday issued new guidance to the cruise ship industry including the need for COVID-19 vaccinations a necessary step before passenger voyages can resume.

The new technical instructions the first update since October include increasing from weekly to daily reporting frequency of COVID-19 cases and illnesses and implementing routine testing of all crew based on a ship’s COVID-19 status and establishing a plan and timeline for vaccination of crew and port personnel.

“COVID-19 vaccination efforts will be critical in the safe resumption of passenger operations” the CDC said.

CDC said the next phase of the CDC’s conditional sail order will include simulated voyages to will allow crew and port personnel to practice new COVID-19 operational procedures with volunteers before sailing with passengers.

“CDC is committed to working with the cruise industry and seaport partners to resume cruising when it is safe to do so following the phased approach outlined” in October’s conditional sail order” the agency said.

It did not specify a date for the resumption of cruise operations from U.S. ports despite calls from the industry for planning for a phased resumption by the beginning of July. The CDC said it will issue additional guidance before it will allow cruises to resume.

The Cruise Lines International Association which represents Carnival Corp Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean Cruises and others had pleaded with CDC to issue new guidance saying in a March 24 statement the “lack of any action by the CDC has effectively banned all sailings in the largest cruise market in the world.” It did not immediately comment on Friday.

The group had said the prior conditional sail order issued in October was “outdated” and “does not reflect the industry’s proven advancements and success operating in other parts of the world nor the advent of vaccines and unfairly treats cruises differently. Cruise lines should be treated the same as other travel tourism hospitality and entertainment sectors.” (Reporting by David Shepardson Editing by Marguerita Choy)

The line will open up 999 free rooms for frontliners Emergency Services NHS Social Care Sector and Armed Forces.

Anthem of the Seas will be sailing like many others from the Port of Southampton from July 7 2021. Given the massive efforts by the emergency services NHS social care sector and armed forces over the last 12 months the line offers 999 free rooms to UK residents in these professions.

Ocean Getaways and the British Isles

Royal Caribbean will be offering guests two options for a cruise around the British Isles this summer. UK favorite Anthem of the Seas will be sailing on a 4-night ocean getaway on July 7 while July 15 will see 5-8-night cruises with several port calls in destinations such as Liverpool Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands Scotland and Belfast Northern Ireland.

These itineraries will be open for vaccinated guests only and on sale from April 7. Guests under the age of 18 will not need to be vaccinated but should show a negative test result. The cruise line has announced these measures are evaluated on an ongoing basis and might change considering the changing environment.

Pre-registration for guests eligible for one of the 999 free staterooms will open on April 13. To get one of the free sailings UK residents should show proof of an official Blue Light Card which is available to those working in the emergency services NHS social care sector and armed forces. Pre-registrations will be entered into a ballot to be drawn by the end of April.

Royal Caribbean Offering A Holiday

The offer from Royal Caribbean to give frontliners a vacation comes at the right time for many. Many NHS Social workers emergency services and armed services have been working straight without a break for many months and a cruise will come as a welcome relief:

Michael Bayley president and CEO Royal Caribbean International:

“The UK is a place we hold near and dear to our heart at Royal Caribbean. We miss our UK guests and are as eager as they are to get back to cruising from Southampton.” “We are delighted with the UK government’s recent announcements regarding cruising and excited to set sail again with a phenomenal ship and favorite such as Anthem of the Seas. After a tough year we all need a holiday but no one more so than the emergency services NHS social care sector and armed forces who will have the long-awaited opportunity to get away and relax with total peace of mind.”

About The Ship

Anthem of the Seas was built as part of the Quantum Class of ships and the second in her class. The 4180 passenger 168000 gross tons vessel is part of the third-largest class of ships worldwide.

With sister ship Quantum of the Seas sailing in Singapore and Quantum Plus Class Odyssey of the Seas sailing in Israel soon Royal Caribbean is making real headway into the resumption of cruising.

There have been 50000 guests to date aboard Quantum of the Seas as well as the recently announced plans for the highly anticipated Odyssey of the Seas to cruise from Haifa Israel cruises from The Bahamas with Adventure of the Seas Bermuda with Vision of the Seas and Cyprus with Jewel of the Seas.

Although Royal Caribbean has considerable experience making sailing safe for COVID-19 the company is not taking any chances.

Besides the vaccination mandate for guests over 18 years of age and a PCR test for those under 18 years of age there will be many health regulations onboard as well. Which measures will be implemented will depend on the UK government and the UK’s situation in July.

No matter the measures it is great to see a company like Royal Caribbean recognizing the work and dedication the frontliners have shown over the last year. Hopefully we can expect more companies to take the same steps!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbWFnbmV0aWNtZWRpYXR2LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0L2JhaGFtYXMtY3ViYW4tbmF0aW9uYWxzLWFwcHJlaGVuZGVkLWluLWJhaGFtaWFuLXdhdGVycy_SAWFodHRwczovL21hZ25ldGljbWVkaWF0di5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC9iYWhhbWFzLWN1YmFuLW5hdGlvbmFscy1hcHByZWhlbmRlZC1pbi1iYWhhbWlhbi13YXRlcnMvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BAHAMAS: Cuban Nationals apprehended in Bahamian waters,"Dana Malcolm

After resounding success in the Bahamas hit play ‘March On The Story of Us’ has been inundated with requests to take their show on the road and the first location they’ll be hitting is Providenciales Turks and Caicos with tickets on sale this weekend from May 3 to 5.

Magnetic Media spoke to Gea Pierre playwright who told us the TCI was a natural first choice for the cast and crew.

“We started ‘March On’ in November 2023 and it was really an opportunity for us to tell a story the story of the Bahamas and to encompass the nations that we have an amazing relationship with like the Turks and Caicos” she continued “We really got a lot of people calling [for the play] from [the TCI] so much so we really had to pay attention.”

The response to ‘March On’ at home and abroad was overwhelming.

“To say it went well is an understatement even before we opened we got calls from Canada from all over the US with people wanting us to come and perform.”

And take the show on the road they did! Gea and her team have launched “March On: The Tour” and will be in Providenciales to perform on May 10th and 11th. It’s the first of a number of stops which include Nassau and several US locations.

A ticket booth will be set up from today Friday May 3 in the foyer of IGA grocery store beginning at 1 p.m. Friday and then again all day on Saturday allowing residents to purchase with cash.

Online tickets are available for purchase with credit cards. Then the full team returns on Friday May 11 for the actual showing at 8 pm and their two showings on Saturday at 4pm and 8 pm. The venue is Brayton Hall Providenciales under the patronage of Washington Misick TCI Premier and First Lady Delthia Misick.

Describing the close familial relationships between the TCI and the Bahamas for many on the crew it will be like coming home Gea told us for others it will be a treat to visit for the first time the places that their grandparents described.

Tickets are only $60 for general seating and $75 for VIP seating.

Gea maintained that the team wanted to keep the show as accessible to residents as possible.

As for why you should come out and see the play other than the great price point:

“The way that people have responded to it is non stoplaughter people have been moved to tears because there’s some emotion. It does not only lend to Bahamians. It’s a family drama and anyone who’s ever been a part of a family is going to get something out of it and something moving.”",,,,,,

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’I’m the best decision your organization has ever made’"" Ross said.

But Ross wasn’t done.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

PATRIOTS' JEROD MAYO DOUBTS TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY QUARTERBACK FOR HIS OLD TEAM

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

Brady likely knew there were going to be some things said that he might not like but he seemed to want the subject of the jokes to stay with him not his former owner.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWFjY291bnRhbnQtamVmZnJleS1zLW1jY29ubmV5LW9uLWhpcy1zdG9ybXktZGFuaWVscy1jb3ZlcnVwLW5vdGVzLWktbWFkZS1hLWJvby1ib2_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump Accountant on His Stormy Daniels Coverup Notes: 'I Made a Boo-Boo',"Jurors who will determine Donald Trump’s fate got their first look at the damning paperwork tying the former president to his porn star hush-money coverup with testimony from the buffoon accountant who took notes of a meeting that set it in motion.

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvYW5nbG8tY2VvLW1lZXRzLXNhZnJpY2EtbWluZXMtbWluaXN0ZXItYWZ0ZXItYmhwcy10YWtlb3Zlci1wcm9wb3NhbC0yMDI0LTA1LTAzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anglo CEO meets S.Africa mines minister after BHP's takeover proposal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/anglo-ceo-meets-safrica-mines-minister-after-bhps-takeover-proposal-2024-05-03/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvYW5nbG8tY2VvLW1lZXRzLXNhZnJpY2EtbWluZXMtbWluaXN0ZXItYWZ0ZXItYmhwcy10YWtlb3Zlci1wcm9wb3NhbC0yMDI0LTA1LTAzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The 40-year-old singer gave birth to Noah via Zoom in January as none of her family could be present due to social distancing measures in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

And the mother-of-two has shared a sweet picture of the moment she and her husband Tim Weatherspoon introduced the newborn to his six-year-old sibling.

Alongside the snap of Kelly holding Noah in bed with her spouse and Titan leaning in with smiles beaming across their faces she wrote on Instagram: “Flashback Friday to the day I brought Noah home to meet his big brother TITAN!

The level of excitement was THROUGH the roof! And watching my family multiply has been my hearts joy! So grateful for my circle of support yo help me through it all too cause it’s definitely a shift but so worth it!

Kelly is coping well with being a mother-of-two and her house is full of love at the moment even if her laundry load is increasing with the realities of having a newborn again.

The ‘When Love Takes Over’ hitmaker said last week: “It’s very interesting you know I think the whole left side of my shirt right now actually if I’m being honest smells like spit up. And my son is absolutely in love with his baby brother and we’re just really happy. It’s really sweet. The house is very sweet and I love it.”

Kelly also revealed that her former Destiny’s Child bandmates Beyonce and Michelle Williams have met Noah and it was a special moment getting to introduce her baby son to her best friends.

She shared: “It was really amazing. I have pictures of course of them holding him and like just loving on him and hugging him and everything.

“I always say with Destiny’s Child the singing together and winning awards and everything like that is great but the friendship that we share still to this day … I can’t even tell you.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtOTQzNTg0OS9Bc2hsZXktVGlzZGFsZS1zaGFyZXMtc3dlZXQtc25hcC1odXNiYW5kLUNocmlzdG9waGVyLUZyZW5jaC1jcmFkbGluZy1uZXdib3JuLWRhdWdodGVyLmh0bWzSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTk0MzU4NDkvYW1wL0FzaGxleS1UaXNkYWxlLXNoYXJlcy1zd2VldC1zbmFwLWh1c2JhbmQtQ2hyaXN0b3BoZXItRnJlbmNoLWNyYWRsaW5nLW5ld2Jvcm4tZGF1Z2h0ZXIuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ashley Tisdale shares sweet snap of her husband Christopher French cradling their newborn daughter,"Ashley Tisdale shared a snap of her husband Christopher French to her Instagram account on Sunday afternoon.

Rain strengthening winds and colder air will arrive earlier in parts of northern Scotland where snow warnings are in place while some coastal areas of eastern England may expect snowfall.

Temperatures are expected to fall to a cool 7C (44.6F) or 8C (46.6F) by Monday.

There could be as much as 15cm of snow in higher areas by Easter Monday morning - with the Met Office's yellow warnings in place from 6pm on Sunday until midnight on Monday.

Talking about the warm weather on Easter Sunday Mr Partridge joked: ""You'll have to make sure your eggs don't melt if you're hiding them in the garden because it will be quite warm.""

London and the South East of England can expect a cloudy start to Sunday although it will be largely dry.

The cloud will gradually thin and break to give way to sunny and warm spells by the afternoon with some light winds with a maximum temperature 16C (60.8F) according to the Met Office before temperatures plunge to 8C (46.4F) on Monday.

Parts of Manchester will have a foggy start to the day before a sunny afternoon with temperatures rising to 12C fog also shrouding most of Wales before it quickly warms up through the morning due to clear skies and plenty of sunshine peaking at 14C (57.2F).

The Easter Sunday weather will be similar in Belfast with sunny spells and possible light rain developing later in the day with a maximum temperature of 12C (53.6F).

Sky News' weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: ""So far the Easter weekend has been fine and dry for many but by the end of Easter Sunday a cold front will spread across Scotland and southwards over the rest of the UK and Ireland through Sunday night.

""On Easter Monday the front will clear the south and then bitterly cold northerly Arctic winds will develop everywhere.

""It'll therefore be a cold day for early April with temperatures ranging from 3 to 6C (37.4 to 42.8F) for Scotland and up to 7 to 8C (44.6 to 46.4F) elsewhere.

""But the wind chill will make it feel more like below freezing for northern and eastern coastal areas and around 1 to 4C (33.8-39.2F) elsewhere.""

It comes as parts of the UK enjoyed a mini heatwave earlier in the week with the mercury reaching nearly 24C (75.2F) on Wednesday - a high unlikely to be repeated on Easter Sunday.

The sunny weather comes as the public have been urged to respect COVID-19 regulations and only meet friends and family outdoors now that restrictions have started to ease.

Around 51% of British households are planning to swap a traditional Easter roast for a barbeque or picnic this year a survey by Sainsbury's found.

But sticking to an indoor dinner looks more likely in Fife Strathclyde and the Highlands - areas expected to endure gale-force winds and snow showers as the country enters an ""Arctic trough"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmllL3N0eWxlL2NlbGVicml0eS9sYXVyYS13aGl0bW9yZS1zaGFyZXMtY3V0ZS1lYXN0ZXItc25hcC1vZi1oZXItY3VkZGxpbmctbmV3LWJhYnktZ2lybC80MDI3NTMwNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Laura Whitmore shares cute Easter snap of her cuddling new baby girl,"Laura Whitmore has shared a gorgeous Easter image of her and her baby girl

Laura is believed to have given birth about a week ago after she did not present her BBC radio show as usual on the Sunday before last.

And the Bray-born presenter and her husband a comedian and narrator on Love Island looked proud and relaxed with their newborn as they went for coffee in London on Thursday.

The couple got married in Dublin last November and shared their first photo of the wedding on New Year’s Day. Laura then confirmed they were due to have a baby.

Laura previously confirmed that she was expecting a baby girl. Photos of the couple with a baby seat were published by the Daily Mail.

Writing in her new book ‘No-one Can Change Your Life Except for You’ the ‘Love Island’ presenter says: “There’s a new chapter coming in my life in the form of a baby girl currently growing inside me.

“And that scares the s*it out of me. I once swallowed a fly and was freaked out that there was a live bug inside me. A little live human is a whole new level of freaking out. But I’m excited. Because there is a lot of good in the world there is a lot of potential and I want to bring up a child knowing that she has her own story to write.”

She adds: “She will be supported and loved but she is the heroine of her own life no-one else.”

The couple suffered a miscarriage in 2018 with Laura penning a deeply personal and moving piece about the experience for Hot Press magazine a year later.

Later on The Late Late Show she described how she had felt overwhelmed after sharing her story.

“It took me a long time. I didn’t talk about it for like a year or so and I also found out from my doctor that one in three women experience a miscarriage” she said. “I am sure a lot of miscarriages are not knowing or not telling as well and that really surprised me I didn’t know that figure.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay8zYW0vY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvbG92ZS1pc2xhbmRzLW1lZ2FuLWJhcnRvbi1oYW5zb24tMjM4NDgxMDDSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXJyb3IuY28udWsvM2FtL2NlbGVicml0eS1uZXdzL2xvdmUtaXNsYW5kcy1tZWdhbi1iYXJ0b24taGFuc29uLTIzODQ4MTAwLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Love Island's Megan Barton-Hanson posts very cheeky snap in underwear for Easter,"The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel

Love Island's Megan Barton-Hanson posts very cheeky snap in underwear for Easter

Megan Barton-Hanson has pulled out all the stops this Easter weekend.

The former Love Island babe 27 stripped down to some seriously sexy underwear in celebration of the sunny bank holiday weekend.

The blonde bombshell put her famous curves on display as she rocked a black lace underwear set complete with matching suspenders and stockings.

The reality TV siren looked sensational in the sizzling shot which saw her sport a classic red lip and a full face of glamorous makeup.

Megan’s latest Instagram offering certainly got tongues wagging as she posed alongside a bright pink sex toy which she discussed in the caption of the snap.

“ENIGMA is a modern adaptation on the traditional rabbit the Easter bunny has nothing on this bad boy” she wrote alongside it.

And it wasn’t long before fans flocked to the comments to share their thoughts on Megan’s revealing post as a handful of admirers labelled the former Love Island star a ‘goddess’.

“You are such a sexy woman you’re literally a goddess” gushed one follower.

“Wow! This is so liberating. Love the fact that you’re a strong independent woman and you’re so open about sex and women’s pleasure” another shared.

Meanwhile a third commented: “Gorgeous woman.”

It comes after Megan recently celebrated her 27th birthday.

But the reality TV star’s birthday bash ended in disaster as police came knocking on her door.

Megan was forced to hit back at claims she had a lockdown-breaking birthday party after the visit from police — as the star insisted her crew were there for a photoshoot.

Megan's representative told The Mirror: ""Whilst it was Megan’s birthday it wasn’t a party.

""She was actually doing a shoot and the other people in attendance were there in a professional capacity ie. photographer hair makeup videographer etc.

""The police left because it was a production rather than ‘letting a party continue'."""

Tapped by the U.S. Department of Justice as an experienced offshore tax bloodhound Paul joined the team charged with America’s legal response to the Panama Papers investigation. For years Paul worked in a cone of silence banned from reading the growing news articles related to the scandal so as not to taint her investigation.

In December 2018 the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced financial charges against four men. Months later Paul joined the New York-based law firm Eversheds Sutherland.

Last year former U.S. taxpayer Harald Joachim von der Goltz pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy to commit money laundering and other crimes. He was sentenced to four years in jail. His accountant Richard Gaffey pleaded guilty to eight felonies and was sentenced to more than three years behind bars. The case continues against former Mossack Fonseca employees Dirk Brauer and Ramses Owens.

How did you find yourself working on the Panama Papers case?

I worked as a prosecutor at the Southern District of New York for nearly nine and a half years. As I became more senior as a prosecutor I did more and more sophisticated white-collar cases investigations and prosecutions. I think it was 2013 when I started in the complex fraud and cybercrime unit and started to work on the offshore tax cases. I started off doing lots of the post-UBS cases. When I say post-UBS I mean investigating other Swiss banks for helping U.S. tax payers hide their money.

I started off working on a lot of those investigating some of the banks some of the bankers the asset managers and U.S. taxpayers as well. From there we began to expand those types of offshore investigations into other jurisdictions. There was a big case in the Cayman Islands and another one in Israel. All were in pursuit of the same goal which was to combat offshore tax evasion.

GIVE TO HELP US INVESTIGATE! Help us fight corruption injustice and inequality with just $25/month. Donate

Why were these cases becoming more important?

It was a very big priority for IRS criminal investigations. Offshore tax evasion is a huge problem and for many years starting with Switzerland it was impenetrable. That was really at the highest level. The Swiss government I think wanted to make it possible for U.S. taxpayers to hide their money in Switzerland. Frankly it was a big part of their economy. That was something that prosecutors here and the IRS wanted to combat. It started with the UBS case which really began to pierce the veil of secrecy. It was so successful there that we began to expand to other jurisdictions.

When did you first hear of Mossack Fonseca?

I hadn’t heard of them until the Panama Papers news stories broke.

What was the start of your involvement in this case?

I started working on the case basically from the minute you all broke the story. Obviously it was a big story. It was a natural fit for me to work on the case as someone who already had experience with offshore tax evasion investigations.

What I want to emphasize is that we were very careful about attorney-client privilege issues from the start. The investigation team didn’t read the news articles. What we did was put a filter team in place. They read the news articles and then redacted anything that might be potentially privileged and we read whatever was left.

It’s funny because we as the investigative team probably knew less about the case than a lot of folks in the world because we couldn’t read the news.

How many of you were on the team?

It was very big on the U.S. side. There were four prosecutors in addition to supervisory-level prosecutors. We worked with several components of the Department of Justice. We worked with the tax division the money laundering and asset recovery section and the fraud section. There were a lot of agents from the IRS on it as well as agents from Homeland Security and the FBI at various points.

Why were so many agencies needed?

There were lots of places to go in the investigation and lots of things to run down. You also had different types of crimes. Obviously we were looking at tax and wanted to involve the IRS. But we were also looking at money laundering and wanted to involve Homeland Security. There were possible FCPA [Foreign Corruption Practices Act] issues so it made sense to involve the fraud section and FBI.

How did you go from a huge amount of information to winnowing it down to just four people?

We were most interested in the U.S. taxpayers who had hidden the most money. Mr. von der Goltz was someone who was identified early on as having hid quite a bit of money with the assistance of Mossack Fonseca. We were also interested in his U.S.-based accountant Dick Gaffey. Because any time you have a U.S-based accountant involved that’s something we take seriously.

What was familiar to you in this case?

The familiar pattern was the use of these shell companies. Using a shell company to nominally hold a bank account that has an undeclared owner is a fact pattern that I have heard time and time again.

What were some of the factoids that made this unique?

These structures were a little more complicated than I was used to seeing because you not only had the shell company you also had these sham foundations that Mossack Fonseca would create for its clients. These sham foundations were the quote-unquote “owners” of the shell companies that nominally held the accounts. So that created another layer which made it even easier for people to hide their money.

Coupled with that was how it was really Mossack Fonseca’s M.O. [modus operandi] to create these structures for their clients. I thought that was striking just how pervasive it was.

What’s the process for peeling away those layers and structures?

It’s a really lengthy process. It’s not an easy thing to investigate especially when we were hemmed in a bit by attorney-client issues. We had to mine the IRS offshore voluntary disclosure program for taxpayers who might have dealt with Mossack Fonseca. We issued subpoenas to customers of Mossack Fonseca to get records of other accounts. We relied on the treaty process a lot to try to get offshore bank records. We went to banks who participated in the Swiss banks program who had certain cooperation obligations and got some information from them.

But it’s hard. It’s hard not only to pierce that veil but to prove intent. That’s one of the reasons it took so long.

Was there a eureka moment during your investigation?

We executed a search warrant on Dick Gaffey’s accounting firm and we found a lot of helpful material. We had already subpoenaed Mr. Gaffey and the firm. We didn’t feel like we had gotten all the documents that were out there in response to that subpoena. After we did the search warrant we realized we were correct and there was really a lot more.

What about the 100-year-old grandmother who von der Goltz claimed was the real owner of the shell companies?

That’s how Mr. von der Goltz set things up. He put her down as the beneficial owner of these accounts and these assets. But that really was a lie — she wasn’t. That was a key part of the scheme. I will say that I have seen that before. Putting down your elderly relatives as the real beneficial owner of your money — Mr. von der Goltz did not invent that practice.

What about Brauer and Owens?

I wouldn’t expect that to be over just because they haven’t been heard yet.

Is this kind of stuff still happening or are the facts from the Panama Papers case things of the past?

I think it’s still happening to a reasonable extent. I think there are still service providers out there like Mossack Fonseca who are engaged in similar activities.

[Editor’s note: Mossack Fonseca was shut down in 2018.]

What do you think has changed since you first investigated the Panama Papers case?

I see the new Anti-Money Laundering Act is a game changer in terms of how these investigations are covered. As part of that the Corporate Transparency Act is going to require certain companies to provide beneficial ownership information to FinCEN [the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]. That part is obviously important.

I think from an investigation standpoint the new mechanism about how to obtain foreign bank records is significant. Under the new AML Act if a foreign bank maintains a U.S. correspondent bank account a U.S. prosecutor can issue a subpoena requesting any records related to any account at the foreign bank including records maintained outside the US. That subpoena power is not limited to records related to the U.S. correspondent account which is the limitation that existed previously. While a foreign bank could move to modify or quash the subpoena there’s language in the new Act that prohibits the court from doing so on the sole ground of compliance with foreign bank secrecy or confidentiality laws.

Had this been in place when I was investigating the Panama Papers I think it would have made a significant difference. We were able to get foreign bank records through the treaty process. But getting those records would have been much easier and quicker under the new AML Act.

Most of the U.S. taxpayers … didn’t have a very high level of sophistication about how to hide their money. They rely on the middlemen or the enablers to give them the tools.

If you had a magic wand what would you have changed to make the investigation easier?

I think if we hadn’t had to contend with attorney-client privilege issues and had just read the news in full and followed every lead we found it would have been much easier. To not have to have a filter team would have made the investigation much more streamlined. But obviously we weren’t in that position and had to be careful.

The fact Mossack Fonseca was a law firm was the issue. I had wanted to make the argument in the case about whether it was really the provision of legal advice because this was advice on how to set up structures to hold money. There is an argument that that is not really legal advice at all — you’re acting as a service provider.

One of the things that we always wanted to tee up was this argument about when the privilege has been broken under a “widespread dissemination theory”’ The theory is that because of all the widespread reporting about the Panama Papers and because of the failure of any client to come forward and still claim privilege over the documents the privilege had been waived. I would expect those types of arguments to be made in the future by prosecutors.

How important is the role of enablers?

They play a critical role. Most of the U.S. taxpayers though certainly not all of them who I encountered when I was a prosecutor didn’t have a very high level of sophistication about how to hide their money. They rely on the middlemen or the enablers to give them the tools to do it.

Two Americans have been prosecuted and sentenced. Does that mean there weren’t many Americans involved?

It takes a lot to make a case like this and you’re not going to be able to make it against everyone. We also have to remember the offshore voluntary disclosure program through which people have the ability to come into that and not be prosecuted. You’re not going to see a prosecution of every U.S. taxpayer who dealt with Mossack Fonseca. I would also add that the investigation is not over. I’m no longer with the US Attorneys’ office but the investigation has not been closed.

In the video shared by a user with the name Brendan Edler a woman is seen arguing with a crew member.

The footage filmed discreetly from three rows back starts mid-argument.

The dispute revolves around a passenger who refused to comply with COVID-19 safety protocols by not wearing a mask.

“You’re saying I didn’t comply and put my mask on when you asked me to?” she asks another person who is not visible to the camera. “Are you seriously telling them that I didn’t put my mask on when you asked me to?”

“You! Are! A liar” she screams — but is quickly drowned out by boos and shouts of “Bye” from the passengers.

“Get off the plane” someone shouts. When the woman gets up to exit the crowd applauds. She throws them the middle finger before disembarking with a male companion.

“I hope you’re single buddy!” one of the men on the plane shouts.

AP Business Writer

Delta Air Lines canceled about 100 flights Sunday due to staff shortages and it opened up middle seats a month earlier than expected in order to carry more passengers.

The airline says it had over 1 million passengers during the past few days the highest number since before the coronavirus pandemic began last year.

“We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and the majority have been rebooked for the same travel day” the airline said Sunday in a statement.

Delta took steps to increase passenger capacity including opening middle seats on Sunday and Monday in an effort to accommodate passengers.

On Wednesday the airline announced that it would stop blocking off middle seats starting in May. The move was made last April to keep passengers farther apart a policy that Delta’s CEO had repeatedly cited as raising trust in the airline. The seats would be reopened as air travel recovers and more people become vaccinated against COVID-19 the airline said.

Delta said the middle seats were opened just for Sunday and Monday and its seat-blocking policy has not changed. Where needed seats could be unblocked in order to get customers to their destinations on the same day.

“Delta teams have been working through various factors including staffing large numbers of employee vaccinations and pilots returning to active status” the airline said in the statement. Some employees were having adverse side effects from being vaccinated.

On Sunday websites at three Delta hubs showed 33 canceled arriving or departing flights. There were 19 at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport another 11 at Detroit Metropolitan Airport and three more at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport.

Delta said Wednesday that nearly 65% of people who flew on Delta last year expect to have at least one dose of the new vaccines by May 1. That gave Delta the assurance to end seating limits it said.

The airline industry was divided over the utility of blocking middle seats to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 on a flight. Airlines including Delta Southwest Alaska and JetBlue limited seating for months while United Airlines never did and American did so only briefly.

Social-distancing is hard if not impossible on an airplane even with middle seats empty – a point that United CEO Scott Kirby made many times to explain his airline’s resistance to seat-blocking.

Air travel in the United States is recovering from pandemic lows. More than 1 million travelers have gone through U.S. airports for each of the last 20 days although March traffic remains down nearly half from the same month in 2019.

The numbers are rising heading into the crucial summer vacation season. Last summer was a catastrophe for the airlines contributing to Delta’s full-year loss of more than $12 billion. The airlines are eager to boost revenue as quickly as possible and that means selling more seats.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbWlsbGlvbnMtYWlybGluZS1taWxlcy1jcmVkaXRzLXRvLWV4cGlyZS1ob3ctdG8tc2F2ZdIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbWlsbGlvbnMtYWlybGluZS1taWxlcy1jcmVkaXRzLXRvLWV4cGlyZS1ob3ctdG8tc2F2ZS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of airline miles credits set to expire: How to save them,"The vaccine rollout is creating a post-pandemic travel boom and many people are finding the more than yearlong lockdown has left them with flight miles and credits on the verge of expiring.

Many travelers received flight credits either in the mail or electronically after canceling or postponing a trip from 2020 according to Kurt Knutsson The Cyber Guy. An estimated 20 million vouchers are available and “those are adding up to an estimated $10 billion in future airline credits now set to expire” he warned.

To prevent losing your airline credits and track the money owed to you from the airlines Knutsson offers some advice.

How to save your airline credits

1. Check the fine print of credits and vouchers

The expiration date is usually the day it was ticketed not the day you were set to fly.

2. Screenshot the credit from the airline site for your records

Save a picture of the credit so it's easily accessible for future use.

3. Add the expiration date to a calendar reminder

Save the date and set a reminder for 30 days before the credit is set to expire. You can add your screenshot to the calendar reminder as well.

Knutsson also shares a few resources for customers who are ready to start traveling again and want to save money as demand picks up.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWNvZGluZy1zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtMDUxNDExOTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Comprehensive SWOT analysis based on Stanley Black & Decker Inc's latest SEC 10-Q filing.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

facility exit and re-configuration costs of $10.0 million. In 2023 transfers and closures of targeted manufacturing sites including Fort Worth Texas

and Cheraw South Carolina as previously announced in March 2023 resulted in accelerated depreciation of production equipment of $17.0 million

and non-cash asset write-downs of $42.2 million (predominantly tooling raw materials and WIP).











3 Strategic Sourcing & Operational Excellence costs in 2023 primarily relate to third-party consultant fees to provide expertise in identifying and

quantifying opportunities to source in a more integrated manner and re-design in-plant operations following footprint rationalization developing

a detailed program and related governance and assisting the Company with the implementation of actions necessary to achieve the related objectives.











4 Acquisition & integration-related costs primarily relate to the MTD and Excel acquisitions including costs to integrate the organizations and

shared processes as well as harmonize key IT applications and infrastructure.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

Bitcoin payments continue to become more and more mainstream. Bakkt says the app has seen more than 500000 users participate in its trial program. While Starbucks is the first partnership for Bakkt's new digital wallet rollout the company will also partner with national companies like Best Buy GolfNow Choice Hotels and financial services company Fiserv in the near future according to the developers.

Now Starbucks is launching a three-pronged celebration as part of the its 25th anniversary in Japan centered around “the power of coffee and connection.”

The first phase includes a limited edition merch collection rife with timely branding and crowdsourced smile-centric marketing campaign coinciding with a video dubbed “#2525 (“ニコニコ” both “25” and Japanese slang for “smile”) Replay” that explores the company’s Japanese legacy.

Next the company will roll out other measures that promise to foster community across all of Japan’s 47 prefectures perhaps hinting at campaigns that align with local chains. Starbucks Japan’s final 25th anniversary endeavor will include a push to demonstrate the eco-conscious actions the company is taking “towards a sustainable future.”

For now the company is prepping a variety of Starbucks-themed merch that ties into the anniversary celebration. This ranges from tumblers mugs and reusable cups to aprons and an adorable teddy bear all printed with a thematic logo and green accents that draw from the familiar Starbucks staff uniform. Starbucks Japan is no stranger to collectible merch: it frequently launches regional exclusives and even collaborates with famous brands like BEAMS and fragment design.

“As Starbucks first international market outside of North America Japan has played a pivotal role in expanding Starbucks mission and values around the world through the power of coffee and connection” said Kevin Johnson Starbucks President and CEO. “I’m proud of the remarkable achievements of our partners and look forward to the next 25 years of leadership and growth in the Japan market.”

With her hands on her hips and chin raised high the Fearless Girl squarely faces the Charging Bull another famous Wall Street statue that represents the supposed pinnacle of corporate grit and success: the American Dream. When the Fearless Girl was first installed the night before International Women’s Day it was quickly lauded on social media as the symbol of modern–day feminism. Now four years later the statue has once again been remodeled to mark the international holiday.

The Fearless Girl has since been moved in front of the New York Stock Exchange where she used to be surrounded by shards of broken glass to symbolize the “many glass ceilings women have shattered.” For SSGA the installation of the Fearless Girl was ultimately an act of self–promotion under the guise of a political message. In 2017 they utilized the statue to market their exchange–traded fund called SHE an index fund that invests in companies with gender–diverse leadership. Ironically SSGA later faced backlash for the lack of diversity on their own leadership boards and their settlement of a lawsuit that showed signs of the company systematically underpaying their female and Black employees.

Apart from these discrepancies the Fearless Girl ultimately represents the hollowness of the feminism it promotes. The statue serves as a visualization of how women 'breaking the glass ceiling' is perceived as inherently feminist. Climbing up the corporate ladder attaining high positions of leadership in finance companies and being your own boss is viewed as the epitome of female empowerment. While having women in positions of power is important who does it come at the expense of? Does it 'trickle down' to all those who are victims of misogyny and the patriarchy? Which groups are excluded from the conversation of mainstream feminism and its goals that only seek to benefit the most privileged?

Akin to the lukewarm messaging of SSGA’s own gender diversity initiatives glass–ceiling feminism is seen as more acceptable because it doesn’t seek to dismantle what feminist writer bell hooks describes as the “imperialist white–supremacist capitalist patriarchy.” At its core glass–ceiling feminism doesn’t challenge the status quo—it sustains it. In the name of equality women are told to merely “lean in"" to the capitalist patriarchy to achieve individualistic financial success.

Excluded from the conversation is any analysis of race class gender sexuality and other forms of marginalization. This phenomenon however is unfortunately not new in white feminist discourse. The racism of notable suffragists such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton illustrates how white supremacy permeates political movements even ones that tout equality. Despite companies and celebrities often leveraging feminist language they can also be complicit in harming and marginalizing other women.

For example Miki Agrawal co–founder of the period underwear company THINX worked against the very feminist values that her company claimed to support. Reports were filed against her for the exploitation of workers with low pay and substandard benefits antagonism towards salary negotiations toxic workplace culture and multiple reports of sexual harassment. The long list of Agrawal’s heinous behavior was disclosed by dozens of her own employees—mostly women.

All of this underscores the necessity of intersectionality a term coined by lawyer and civil rights advocate Kimberlé Crenshaw. Crenshaw describes intersectionality as “a lens a prism for seeing the way in which various forms of inequality often operate together and exacerbate each other.”





Glass–ceiling feminism ultimately fails to account for the privileges that make it possible to break through the glass ceiling of corporate America. Companies' calls for diversity and inclusion are hollow if there are no efforts to dismantle the societal structures that exclude and marginalize these groups in the first place. Feminism means actively rejecting misogyny and patriarchy and listening to and centering the experiences of BIPOC women trans women disabled women and other marginalized communities in the feminist movement. More than just shattering the glass ceiling feminism is a movement towards gender equity and our collective liberation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGx0b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9idXNpbmVzcy9zb21lLXN0LWxvdWlzLWNvdW50eS10YXhwYXllcnMtc2F5LXRoZXktcmUtZ2V0dGluZy1zb2NrZWQtd2l0aC1sYXRlLWZlZXMtYmVjYXVzZS1vZi9hcnRpY2xlXzQyZWJlYWQ4LTlkMjItNTJiOC1iZDc0LTA5ODYzNzlhZjNlMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some St. Louis County taxpayers say they're getting socked with late fees because of mail delays,"CLAYTON — Some St. Louis County residents who have been charged hundreds of dollars in penalties for late property tax payments are blaming U.S. Postal Service delivery problems for causing their checks to arrive late.

Given widely publicized and continuing problems with mail service they may have a case local officials said Friday.

In response to those constituents state Sen. Jill Schupp D-Creve Coeur and Rep. Ian Mackey D-Richmond Heights said they are exploring the possibility of state remedies. Meanwhile St. Louis County Council members Tim Fitch R-3rd District Lisa Clancy D-5th District and Kelli Dunaway D-2nd District said they are asking county government whether late fees can be waived.

The elected officials say they have heard from residents who mailed their tax payments to the St. Louis County Collector of Revenue in late December but were subsequently hit with substantial penalties because the mail was postmarked and arrived after the Jan. 1 deadline.

State law directs tax collectors to collect late fees on payments that are postmarked after deadline.

But amid widespread reports of a mail backlog during COVID-19 — caused in part by a surge in mail-in ballots during the November election record levels of remote correspondence and commerce and staff shortages at the U.S. Postal Service — lawmakers say there is reason to investigate whether some taxpayers are being fined for delays that were out of their control.

“We never want to unfairly penalize or tax someone when they have followed the rules to pay what is owed” Schupp said.

Amy White of Chesterfield said her husband dropped their tax payment early Dec. 31 in a mail box with a stamp that noted the date similar to how they’ve mailed payments over the last 25 years. But in March they received a county letter asking for more than $500 in late payment fees and interest because the envelope wasn’t postmarked until Jan. 2.

“I can understand that fees are supposed to be a motivation for taxpayers to pay on time but to split hairs over a couple days especially when it could have been an issue with the post office means you’re paying an excessive fee even though you’re paying on time” she said.

“It’s a very significant penalty” she said. “It’s not $20 bucks.”

In a statement the St. Louis County Collector of Revenue’s office confirmed instances of mailed tax payments that were postmarked after Jan. 1 after fielding complaints from taxpayers who insisted that they mailed the payments ahead of the deadline.

But it was unclear Friday just how many of the late tax payments were affected by mail delays.

The county confirmed it recorded 4829 more delinquent tax bills in the month of January than it did in January 2020 but neither the collector’s office or Postal Service were able to provide estimates of how many payments were postmarked after Jan. 1.

Representatives of revenue collectors for the city of St. Louis and St. Charles County said they had not recorded an unusual number of complaints of mail delays noting that there are instances every year in which some people charged late fees argue that their mail was delayed or lost. Tax collectors throughout the region including St. Louis County offer varying ways to pay bills and warn taxpayers that they are responsible for mailing payments early enough to avoid potential delays.

‘Challenging time’

A spokeswoman for the St. Louis District of the Postal Service did not respond to questions about mail service within St. Louis County in the last week of 2020 but provided a written statement that said the service experienced nationwide delays amid employee shortages and a record volume of mail and shipping orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The statement said: “We acknowledge the last few months have been a challenging time for the Postal Service and for our customers. We have processed and delivered mail for the American people under some of the most difficult circumstances we’ve faced in the past century.”

The statement included an apology for “any inconvenience” customers experienced.

Fitch who represents parts of west St. Louis County provided the Post-Dispatch emails of complaints from a business owner whose Dec. 31 mail was postmarked Jan. 2 and a Des Peres resident whose mail had no postmark at all. They were among half a dozen complaints his office received he said.

“I would think with all of the delays we’ve seen — I’ve got people who still haven’t got the Christmas card I sent — that the right right thing would be to take the taxpayers’ word that they mailed it and waive the fees” Fitch said.

Clancy whose district includes a stretch of central St. Louis County from Clayton to Affton said her office has also heard from a handful of residents with similar complaints and that she’s exploring whether it’s possible to extend a grace period to account for Postal Service delays.

Mackey a state representative whose district includes parts of Clayton and Ladue said he’s heard from two constituents with complaints but that he’s concerned there are others who don’t know where to look for help.

“I would imagine there are plenty of folks that are a week or two away from getting their notice or contacting us” he said.

Schupp said she is exploring legislation that could offer taxpayers hit with late fees because of Postal Service delays a credit for 2021 tax bills equal to what they paid in late fees this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3d2FsbHN0LmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXJlcG9ydC8yMDIxLzA0LzAzL3RoaXMtaXMtaG93LWVhY2gtc3RhdGUtZ290LWl0cy1zaGFwZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Is How Each State Got Its Shape,"This Is How Each State Got Its Shape chokkicx / Getty Images

Each of the 50 states that comprise the United States of America has its own shape. How their shapes were determined provides insight into how the United States became a nation like no other.

24/7 Tempo has taken a look at how each state got its shape. We reviewed materials such as Mark Stein’s book “How the States Got Their Shapes” to find out how each state’s contours fit into the grand puzzle that is the United States of America.

According to Stein the most important influences that determined the shapes of the states were the American Revolution the construction of railroads the proposal for the Erie Canal and the issue of slavery.

The American Revolution helped to define the shapes of the original 13 colonies. The outlines of the earliest states were often shaped by geographic boundaries such as rivers. These are the oldest historic towns in every state.

The original 13 colonies vary in shape and size. This did not please Thomas Jefferson who suggested that Congress create future states equal in size based upon latitude and longitude coordinates.

The construction of cross-country railroads and the Erie Canal helped dictate the contours of states where those modes of transport traversed.

The issue of slavery also helped shape states in the territory that was included in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. The Missouri Compromise of 1818 solidified the practice of determining state boundaries in the region based on where slavery was legal.

The two largest contiguous states California and Texas determined their own borders because of the political power they wielded and the concern that they might secede from the U.S. if a territorial dispute arose. As it turned out Texas did end up seceding from the Union. Here’s how your state was founded.

In March 1663 King Charles II of England created the Carolina colony out of the larger colony of Virginia and placed the southern limit of the new colony at the 31st parallel now Alabama’s southern boundary with Florida. Georgia was created out of the Carolina colony and Alabama would emerge from Georgia. Alabama got access to the Gulf of Mexico in 1804 the year after the Louisiana Purchase. That was when the U.S. announced that the area between the Mississippi River and the Perdido River in what was part of what had been called West Florida — and was owned by Spain — was claimed by the United States. That area that bordered the Gulf of Mexico would become part of southern Alabama.

Arkansas’ boundary between Tennessee and Mississippi was established after independence from England in 1795. Arkansas’ boundary with Louisiana was also established when the Louisiana Purchase was divided in 1804 between the District of Orleans and the District of Louisiana. The 1819 treaty with Spain established Arkansas’ western boundary after the Louisiana Purchase and the border between Arkansas and Texas was set as running north from the Sabine River in Louisiana to the south bank of the Red River.

There was some sentiment among Californians to set the eastern boundary east of Salt Lake City but others believed the federal government would not allow a state of that size. The northeast corner of the state was determined as where the 42nd parallel meets the 120th meridian which includes the Sierra Mountains.

Five years later Idaho’s panhandle became part of the newly-designated Washington Territory. When Oregon became a state in 1859 it had the same borders as it does today giving Idaho much of its western border. After gold was discovered in Idaho in 1860 miners began moving east to the area. Concerned about the growing mining country Washington Territory managed to create the Idaho Territory in 1863 and its western border was established along the 117th Meridian.

Pope wanted to keep Chicago in Illinois to strengthen links with eastern states and said a planned canal connecting the Illinois River to Lake Michigan could bring commercial opportunities to Illinois. In 1825 the Erie Canal opened linking Lake Erie and all the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and New York. Congress accepted Pope’s amendment changing Illinois’ destiny forever. Moving the borders farther north would also diminish the state’s connection with slave states.

The northern section of its eastern border runs along the Bois de Sioux River then goes due south and meets up with the Big Sioux River. Its southern border was determined by the northern border of Nebraska which was set at the 43rd parallel to the Missouri River. The dividing line of the Dakotas is set at the northern tip of the Coteau des Prairies plateau. South Dakota’s western edge was set at the 104th meridian back when it was part of the Dakota Territories.

> Famous landmarks: Graceland Landlocked Tennessee borders eight states. At one time the Mississippi River was its western border. But the river has meandered causing confusion with neighboring states Missouri and Arkansas. The Supreme Court has ruled that the western border of Tennessee can’t be shifted because of geographic changes caused by river movements. As for the southern border in 1818 Georgia and Tennessee appointed University of Georgia professor James Camak and Tennessee mathematician James Gaines to survey the border of their respective states. When Congress voted to make Tennessee a state in 1796 it set the boundary between Georgia and Tennessee at 35 degrees north latitude. Camak and Gaines put the border about a mile south of 35 degrees north. That border continues west to the Mississippi River. To the east is North Carolina from which northeast Tennessee separated in the 18th century. Its northern border was created during the colonial era when the British Crown declared that the border between North Carolina and Virginia would be 36 degrees 30 minutes north latitude. That line continued west when Kentucky and Tennessee were established.

A treaty with Spain mandated that Texas’ eastern border traces the path of the Sabine River until the 32nd parallel then due north to the Red River west to the 100th meridian then north again. Texas’ southern boundary was set along the Rio Grande after the land was acquired through the Treaty of Velasco in 1836 after Texas won the war for its independence. After nine years of independence Texas began the process of becoming a U.S. state. It got its distinctive shape after the Compromise of 1850 when it sold some of its northwestern land area in exchange for the U.S. taking on its massive debt load.

Mormon settlers moved there from New York years before to try to leave the relatively new U.S. The Mormons wanted to form their own state called Deseret but Congress shrunk the land and named it Utah. From 1850 to 1861 the Utah Territory included all of present-day Utah as well as parts of Nevada Wyoming and Colorado. After silver was discovered in Nevada it became its own state. The same happened when gold was discovered in Colorado and in Wyoming. Utah’s border with Wyoming was established along the 111th meridian giving Utah its distinctive shape and the borders it now has to this day.

In 1792 nine counties called the Kentucky District of Virginia broke away from Virginia and became their own state. In 1863 the western counties of Virginia split to become the state of West Virginia. The Potomac River divides Virginia and Maryland. The borders between the two were determined in colonial times by various charters agreements and several Supreme Court rulings. Virginia also has territory on the southern part of the Delmarva peninsula because of aggressive claims by Surveyor General of Virginia Edmund Scarborough in the late 17th century. The Virginia-North Carolina border was delineated in 1665 as the 36° 30″ parallel of latitude and was resolved in two major joint survey efforts in 1728 and 1749. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east of Virginia.

Washington was reshaped to its current borders in 1863 when the Idaho Territory was established though it would have to wait more than 25 more years as a territory before gaining statehood.

It was all about boxing robots going after each other in both official and underground fights throwing punches left and right as their handlers were gunning for the ultimate title.

World Robot Boxing is how the official competition was called and it had just one king: Zeus a monster of a machine more powerful than anything else out there.Zeus is also the name of a robot toy of sorts and it too has been designed for fighting. Moorebot is the company behind it the same group that is responsible for the Scout we talked about not long ago.Zeus is described as “a fighting robot specifically designed for robot competitions.” It moves with the aid of 2 metal-geared servo motors each capable of delivering 25 kg of force while providing the robot with enough punch to obliterate the competition. The battery pack (two 2500 mAh pieces) that powers it allows it to throw punches left and right for up to 50 minutes.The robot is operated via a Bluetooth remote controller and it can be programmed to perform a series of moves through a specially-designed user interface.Now there are countless other similar machines out in the world and they provide hours of fun for both children and adults. But this Zeus just like the one in the movie plays in a league of its own. All the hardware that went into it makes it quite expensive to own and Moorebot lists the thing at no less than $4500.We’re not sure how many of them were made since around 2018 when Zeus was introduced but now its maker lists the robot as being out of stock",,,,,,,,,,,,

Before the 2020 MLB season the Mariners had embarked on a $30-million T-Mobile Park update that touched on virtually every part of the ballpark; click on the link for all the details. Alas the 2020 season was scrapped before the Mariners could unveil the changes to the public; they’ve been on display for the most part this season.

Like every other MLB team the Mariners are stressing grab-and-go prepackaged food at most concessions stands. However the team has worked with concessionaire Centerplate and third-party vendors to keep speciality stands open including Ivar’s and Kidd Valley Caffé Vita coffee Din Tai Fung and Paseo. Hiroshi’s Sushi now features made-to-order poke bowls in addition to a selection of handmade sushi. Added to The Natural’s vegetarian and gluten-free options this season is the Beyond Burger plant-based patty that “looks cooks and satisfies like beef.” Lil Woody’s and Ballard Pizza have expanded to two new locations. Both will be available on the Terrace Club Level.

In addition the team has lowered concessions prices on ballpark staples and beer. Rolling Roof Refreshment Stands now offer hot dogs nachos popcorn peanuts sodas water and red ropes from $2-$4. The Value Beer Menu is also expanded: The selection of specially priced 12-ounce beers is expanding to over 10 locations and 12 varieties. Fans can purchase cans of select domestic beers for $5 and select local craft beers for $6. In general however you’ll find more of an emphasis on canned beer and less on drought beers at T-Mobile Park.

And like every other MLB team the Mariners are hewing to the MLB operation guidelines calling for cashless concessions and reverse ATMs mobile ticketing enhanced cleaning protocols pod-based seating and social distancing. As did other MLB teams the Mariners received Global Biorisk Advisory Council (GBAC) STAR Facility certification for T-Mobile Park and implemented an extensive cleaning protocol that includes electrostatic sprayers distributing disinfecting solution targeted toward COVID-19 the use of UV-C light to eliminate the threat of bacteria viruses mold spores and allergy-inducing microorganisms and disinfection/cleaning verification via Glo Germ an evidence-based surface disinfection and cleaning verification program that uses fluorescent markers.

Richie a former college basketball player at UCLA and Clemson decided to let the Pac-12 Conference know that at its tournament in early March.

The Pac-12 currently does not have a Black head men’s basketball coach in its conference so Richie along with two other coaches from Sacramento California decided to head to Las Vegas and peacefully shed light on the inequity.

They traveled to Vegas checked into hotels on the Vegas strip for the duration of the tournament and arrived at the T-Mobile Arena early in order to peacefully greet the coaches and players – many of whom Richie knows – as they reached the arena. They held up picket signs in support of Black coaches being given opportunities.

Richie said he even attempted to check in with arena security beforehand to alert them of his peaceful intentions and to be directed to the proper place to protest. However the security personnel at T-Mobile Arena were not so accommodating. Richie was told to leave and was escorted back to his hotel room to discard his picket signs before being let back into the arena.

“ ‘Look man I’m not trying to go to jail I’m not trying to get shot’ ” Richie said he told arena security. “ ‘I’d like to peacefully protest for two minutes while the team walks by then I’ll be on my way. I’m only going to say positive things to the players and the coaching staff.’

“It was presented to me” Richie continued “ ‘Look you need to leave right now and never bring the picket sign back or we’re going to evict you and cite you for trespassing.’ ”

Richie decided to take the guards’ advice and live to fight another day.

That day is now. Richie has decided to continue his protest this weekend at the women’s Final Four in San Antonio. This time he exchanged the picket signs for T-shirts hoping to avoid any further confrontation with security.

“I put down the picket sign and I put on T-shirts” Richie told me. “The T-shirts say ‘Black Head Coaches Matter.’ Now I can walk in and people can still see it and people can still think about it. I can still tweet it and I don’t have to worry about a police officer putting his hands on me or pulling his gun on me because it’s a peaceful protest but it’s a shirt and it’s nonthreatening so there’s no way someone could ask me to leave with my shirt on.”

Why is Richie doing this?

“The reason I started this it goes back to George Floyd” he said referring to the killing of Floyd while in custody of the Minneapolis police last year and the resulting social unrest that followed. He said he was inspired to get involved in social initiatives such as voter registration and that led him to focus on his own profession.

“In the Pac-12 right now there is zero percent head coaches of color 42% of the assistant coaches are coaches of color but 63.8% of the players are players of color … People have to take stances and it makes people uncomfortable but in the end that’s how you’re going to evoke change asking people to think differently and think outside of the box” Richie continued.

“The biggest misnomer is … I want to be clear I’m not saying [white] coaches are not good that they’re not deserving that they should be fired or that they should not be hired. I want to be clear on that because that’s the easy way to misconstrue what I’m saying. I’m not saying that at all. I’m saying across the country Pac-12 as well the hiring process needs to be more equitable and transparent.”

Richie has been working with like-minded organizations such as 12 Inches Over created by Rider University assistant basketball coach Geoff Arnold and Arizona State University social sciences professor Scott Brooks and the Black Coaches Association.

Another new and formidable organization Richie has been working with to address issues of inequality in sports is ABIS (Advancement of Blacks in Sports). ABIS was formed in September 2020 by New York City grassroots basketball legend Gary Charles. Like Richie he was inspired in the aftermath of Floyd’s killing.

“When I was watching the George Floyd video I literally thought that I was watching a live lynching” Charles told me this week. “And I realized that a lot of us many times get upset and we do a lot of talking but it’s time to stop talking and walk the walk. It did something to my soul. If it didn’t do something to you then you just aren’t human. So I felt that I needed to reach out to coaches and get us together and make some changes.”

“That’s why we created the ‘Watch List’ because we wanted to do away with the myth that we don’t exist that we’re not out there. So we said ‘Hey we got a cheat sheet here are our superheroes.’ ” FELICIA Hall Allen Advancement of Blacks in Sports vice chair of programs marketing and outreach

Charles reached out to all those he knew in the basketball community including prominent members of the grassroots and youth basketball community. He was able to enlist a who’s who of college basketball coaches including Leonard Hamilton Dawn Staley C. Vivian Stringer Cuonzo Martin Dave Leitao Nikki Fargas and others.

In short order membership was expanded beyond basketball into all sports including baseball led by former MLB player and manager Bo Porter who is now MLB director of coaching development. Now ABIS membership includes influential people of all walks of life: sports figures coaches college administrators professors lawyers and the like. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump human rights activist and writer Richard Lapchick hip-hop legend Chuck D and seven-time NBA All-Star Tracy McGrady are among those who have attached their names and efforts to the organization.

“We’re asking for justice we’re asking for fairness” Charles said when asked about ABIS’ purpose. “ABIS wants to be the voice for racial equity in sports. We’re not asking to take over. We’re just saying that we deserve to have a seat at the table also.”

For a new organization ABIS has had its hand in social justice issues both in and out of sports. It was very active in get-out-the-vote campaigns for the 2020 presidential election and the 2021 Georgia runoff elections. ABIS has worked behind the scenes to promote the incorporation of name image and likeness rights for college student-athletes and has been a united voice when unexpected social issues have arisen such as calling for the dismissal of Creighton head coach Greg McDermott after he said “I can’t have anybody leave the plantation” while addressing his team. ABIS along with former East Tennessee State head coach Travis Williams also helped create a historically Black college all-star game that will be played during Final Four weekend starting next year.

Still ABIS has been most active in its advocacy and promotion of Black coaches in college basketball.

“We have to be unapologetic about creating an opportunity for [talent] and elevating our own” said Felicia Hall Allen ABIS vice chair of programs marketing and outreach and president and CEO of FHA Associates a motivational speaking and sports management company. She has represented multiple women’s college basketball coaches and Staley recently credited Allen for helping turn South Carolina’s season around after speaking to the team. Staley’s Gamecocks will play in Friday’s Final Four.

“That’s why [ABIS] created the ‘Watch List’ because we wanted to do away with the myth that we don’t exist that we’re not out there. So we said ‘Hey we got a cheat sheet here are our superheroes’ ” Allen said.

ABIS created a “Watch List” a list of the top mid-major Black men’s and women’s head coaches and a list of the top Black men’s and women’s NCAA Division I assistant coaches and provided the lists to athletic directors and executive search firms. This of course will help eliminate the excuse that many athletic directors and search firms are not aware of the pool of qualified Black candidates or that such a pool does not exist.

“It’s one thing to boldly advocate and another just to talk” Allen said. “And that’s what Dr. Lapchick said: ‘I’ve been putting out these [The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport] reports every year but the progress [in terms of the percentage of Black coaches who are given head-coaching opportunities] has been at a glacial pace.’ ABIS is in place because we want to see results. Dr. Lapchick has been measuring it for a long time but now we’re starting to see some results.”

Some results came early in this year’s hiring process. Boston College hired former College of Charleston head coach Earl Grant and Minnesota and Penn State hired first-time head coaches Ben Johnson and Micah Shrewsberry respectively. Indiana hired NBA lifer Mike Woodson Fordham hired longtime Villanova assistant coach Kyle Neptune and Wichita State removed the interim tag from Isaac Brown. There have also been other Black coaching hires this year but like Kobe Bryant said the “job’s not finished.”

In the current climate there is optimism that progress within the head-coaching profession will continue.

“This is an issue that’s not just unique to sports that’s not just unique to college sports” Lori Martin told me.

Lori Martin is a professor in the African and African American Studies program and the Department of Sociology at Louisiana State University. She also heads the racial equity research group and is chair of the name image and likeness group for ABIS.

“In American society race matters and gender matters. So that means that you oftentimes have predominantly white men in power and they are hiring people who look like them or who are in their social networks. So you keep creating this system of exclusion. And then you have a period like following the killing of George Floyd where some people who never had to think about race are suddenly thinking about race. And so they start thinking differently about what their athletic departments look like and they may be getting pressure from various groups to try to look more like the players or more like the broader community. So then they start reaching out to people who they wouldn’t traditionally reach out to. So whereas maybe they would not have reached out to a group like ABIS which to be fair didn’t exist prior to September 2020 now they’re looking to these groups and saying ‘What can you do how can you help us? We want to do better.’ ”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzQvMy8yMjM2NTc1My93b3ctd2lkZW9wZW53ZXN0LWludGVybmV0LWNhYmxlLWRhdGEtY2FwLXBpenphLWV4Y3VzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A cable company that prided itself on no data caps says you're getting data caps because pizza,"What’s a monthly data usage plan?

The iPhone 12 uses an aluminum chassis and it has a 6.1-inch OLED 2532 x 1170 resolution display. It still sports a huge notch that houses its front-facing camera and face recognition software. The display is protected by a new material called Ceramic Shield which adds nano-ceramic crystals inside the glass. This is supposed to offer better protection against drops compared to previous iPhone models.

The OnePlus 8T includes a 6.55-inch Fluid AMOLED display with a 2400 x 1080 resolution. It throws in a 120Hz refresh rate for a smoother performance while playing games. It has a punch hole on the top left corner for its front-facing camera. You can also access an in-display fingerprint sensor. It includes a frosted glass back and metal on the sides.

The iPhone 12 comes in Black White Product Red Green and Blue colors. There are just two color choices for the OnePlus 8T: Lunar Silver and Aquamarine Green. The iPhone 12 has an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance. There’s no such rating for the regular unlocked OnePlus 8T. However the version that’s being sold by T-Mobile under the OnePlus 8T Plus name does have an IP68 rating.

Hardware

Inside the OnePlus 8T has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor included in the earlier OnePlus 8 phone. The company is releasing two models; one with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and another with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The iPhone 12 on the other hand includes the new A14 Bionic processor with a six-core CPU and a four-core GPU. It has 4GB of RAM and it’s available in 64 128 and 256GB storage options. Neither phone offers expandable storage and neither has a headphone jack.

The regular unlocked OnePlus 8T supports sub-6GHz 5G networks. The T-Mobile exclusive OnePlus 8T Plus adds support for the carrier’s normal 600MHz 5G network and its more recent nationwide 2.5GHz network. The iPhone 12 also supports sub-6GHz 5G but the US versions are the only ones to throw in support for millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G networks.

The OnePlus 8T has a big 4500mAh battery. In the box it throws in a Warp Charge 65 USB-C charger. It will charge up this big battery to 100% in just 39 minutes. The iPhone 12 has a smaller 2815mAh battery. It also supports a new accessory format called MagSafe. It’s used for a new class of accessories that uses magnets that attach to the rear of the iPhone 12 models. That means accessories like cases wireless chargers and more all connect magnetically to the back of the iPhone 12 series.

The new Apple wireless chargers can boost wireless charging by up to 15W. The phones still support the more widely used Qi wireless charging standard. However they only charge the Phone 12 models up to 7.5W. The OnePlus 8T sadly does not support wireless charging at all.

Camera

The OnePlus 8T has four rear cameras sensors. They include a 48MP main sensor and a 16MP ultra-wide camera. The phone also throws in a 5MP macro camera and a 2MP monochrome sensor. In our review of the OnePlus 8T we stated that the images that come from this quad-camera setup were somewhat disappointing including mixed results with night mode shots. The phone also has a 16MP front-facing camera.

The iPhone 12 includes just two rear cameras: a 12MP wide sensor and a 12MP ultra-wide camera. It also has a 12MP front-facing camera. In our review of the phone we stated that photos taken with the iPhone 12 ” look quite good with nice dynamic range and overall sharpness.” The phone also supports HDR and Dolby Vision HDR video recording at up to 30fps. The phone will even allow users to edit their Dolby Vision HDR video clips on the phone.

Software

David Imel / Android Authority

The OnePlus 8T comes with Android 11 out of the box along with the company’s Oxygen 11 skin. This new version of OxygenOS makes the phone look and act much less like a near-stock Android phone compared to previous OnePlus handsets. That includes adding a new OnePlus Sans font a new Always On Display along with improvements to Dark Mode and Zen Mode. OnePlus has promised at least two major Android OS updates for the OnePlus 8T along with an extra year for security updates. Read more: Everything you need to know about Oxygen OS 11

The iPhone 12 ships with iOS 14. It includes new features like supporting widgets on the phone’s home screen along with the App Library that helps to better organize a user’s phone apps. It also adds picture-in-picture support for watching videos or conducting FaceTime calls while continuing to use another app on the phone. Apple has an excellent track record of supporting previous iPhones with new OS updates for years and we don’t think this will change with the iPhone 12.

Price OnePlus 8T: 8GB/128GB — £549/42999 Rs 12GB/256GB — £649/$749/45999 Rs

iPhone 12 64GB – $799/£799/€909 128GB -$849/£849/€959 256GB – $949/£949/€1079

The OnePlus 8T is now available to purchase. The US only has the 12GB/256GB version available for $749. Other parts of the world can purchase the 8GB/128GB version for £549 in the UK which is $709 in the US.

The iPhone 12 is now on sale as well. Pricing for the iPhone 12 starts at $749 for the 64GB version.

OnePlus 8T Better than the OnePlus 8 but still not as good as the OnePlus 8 Pro The latest flagship from OnePlus features some relatively subtle upgrades over the OnePlus 8. However it does feature a huge new feature: Warp Charge 65 which will allow the 8T to charge faster than any other OnePlus phone. See price at OnePlus See price at OnePlus See price at OnePlus

OnePlus 8T vs iPhone 12: Which should you buy?

OnePlus 8T

In our review of the OnePlus 8T we did note a number of its solid features. Those include its larger 120Hz display its support for the fast 65W battery charger and having Android 11 ship out of the box with the Oxygen 11 skin. Having a phone that costs $50 less than the iPhone 12 but one that offers twice as much storage as its lower price rival is something to consider. However it’s disappointing that only the T-Mobile OnePlus 8T Plus model has an IP68 rating. Want to check out some other options? These are the best Android phones you can buy today

The iPhone 12 on the other hand has the OnePlus 8T beat in some areas. One is that the iPhone supports wireless charging which is something that the OnePlus 8T really should have included. The new A14 Bionic processor also beats the Snapdragon 865 processor at least in benchmarking tests. Photos that were taken with the iPhone 12 also seem to be superior to ones taken with the OnePlus 8T.

In our mind the OnePlus 8T should be a solid pick over Apple’s phone for people who can ignore some of its camera issues. That’s our look at the OnePlus 8T vs iPhone 12.

Rockstar Games has not released a new title in the iconic open-world series since Grand Theft Auto V. With the latest improvements in the world of gaming fans were hoping for the next title in the series alongside the launch of the new-gen consoles. While that did not happen they did not have to go home empty-handed. Rockstar revealed that it has a Grand Theft Auto V Remaster in the works.

Rockstar Games is really optimistic about the GTA V Remaster and it has plenty of reasons to be so. It has almost been eight years since the release of GTA V and the game still has a massive fan following.

Globally the title has shipped over 140 million copies. It is safe to say that this title has been one of the biggest ones ever from the house of Rockstar Games. So much so that the title is currently in its third generation of players.

“Remastering has always been a part of the strategy. We’ve done differently than the competition – we don’t just port titles over we actually take the time to do the very best job we can making the title different for the new release for the new technology that we’re launching it on.

“So we improve the technology we upgrade the visuals and we make performance enhancements. And that’s why I think our remastered titles typically do so well.”

The company has done a great job remastering the Mafia series. From what we have seen of the GTA V remaster so far we do not have much doubt regarding its success. Like Strauss says

I’m sure that most of you reading this are aware that couch co-op games are a bit of a rarity these days with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One basically finding any excuse to not have couch co-op. In this time of lockdowns and social breakdown a game such as It Takes Two is a nice breath of fresh air where I and my partner can just sit down for a few hours and enjoy some time together that said this game is messed up in ways that I feel like I’ll need a little bit of therapy for afterward. I never thought I’d ever be disturbed by a stuffed toy begging for its life as we drag it to its slow and painful death but that’s Hazelight Studios for you fun at the cost of sanity.

Game Name: It Takes Two

Platform(s): PlayStation 4 Xbox One PlayStation 5 (reviewed) Xbox Series X and Series S Microsoft Windows

Publisher(s): Electronic Arts EA Originals

Developer(s): Hazelight Studios

Release Date: March 26th 2021

Price: £34.99/ $39.99

If you’re familiar with Hazelight Studios from their previous games A Way Out and Brothers – A Tale of Two Sons you’ll know that they are a talented studio that takes the idea of a co-op game and make it the centerpiece of their story telling and gameplay design. They’re one of the few studios that I can think of that understands that a co-op game takes an entirely different design philosophy to pull off well. Where Brothers was the start of their path and A Way Out improved their original design philosophy It Takes Two feels like the culmination of everything they’ve learned all poured into a great game that’s varied and imaginative enough to carry two people through to the end.

The story of It Takes Two features around the relationship of May and Cody and how they have grown apart over the years which has ultimately lead to them to seek out a divorce. The start of the game shows our protagonists breaking the news to their young daughter Rose who takes the news as well as you could expect. Badly. She hides away in the shed and wishes that her parents could stay together clutched in her hands are her handmade dolls that represent her mother and father. After a tear falls on both dolls while making the wish Cody and May awaken to find themselves trapped in the bodies of these dolls.

Confused as to what is happening the couple is then intruded upon by a talking book by the name of Dr. Hakim a relationship-therapy book that Rose apparently bought “at no small fee.” Dr. Hakim informs the couple that the only way out is to “fix” their relationship but the two opt to ignore the magical book and decide to try and reach their daughter to break the spell. Along their journey May and Cody learn the values of cooperation and rediscover their lost love so far so Disney.

I’ve seen people describe It Takes Two as a great game to play with the family but to be honest I’m not sure what the target audience of this game really is. It’s not really a family game because of the copious amounts of language and aforementioned brutal murders of stuffed animals to progress the plot but the overall design and presentation of the game is along the lines of a very child-friendly dreamland world. Maybe that’s the point to show the stark contrast between how a childlike world treats the matter of adult relationships while the “real” people now dragged into this world do not act or think like this kind of whimsy world expects. I’m sure if you look hard enough you’ll see an ulterior motive behind It Takes Two’s story but I must admit I was too busy having fun to look.

It’s hard to outline the gameplay of It Takes Two as each level has it’s own set of tools to get the players through the level. One section will have you using a hammerhead and some nails for traversal while the other will have you flying a plane made out of twigs and underwear while your partner plays Mortal Kombat against a squirrel on the wing of the same plane trust me it makes sense in context. The only real gameplay tool that carries over from level to level is your basic movement skills which comprise of dashing double jumping and small elements of traversal such as rail grinding rope swinging and wall jumping that are more or less supporting elements rather than the meat of your gameplay.

Using your basic traversal tools and the level-based ones you come across you and your partner must solve puzzles that require both of you to progress. It Takes Two approaches co-op-based puzzles similar to how Portal 2 did where you will have one half of the tool needed to traverse and your partner will have the other half. For example in the early levels May will have a hammerhead that she can use to swing off nails and smash objects whereas Cody will get a set of nails that he can throw into walls to get May somewhere or to hold a platform into place.

This sort of co-op naturally lends itself to teamwork as the players NEED to work together to progress a lot of co-op games like to pit the players against each other whether they intended to or not and I find that style of co-op can take the fun out of it. It Takes Two isn’t free of competitive aspects though as there are little mini-games sprinkled throughout where you play against your partner in little challenges. This breaks up the puzzle gameplay a little and with 25 of these minigames if I remember correctly that range from chess to tug of war there’s variety to be had.

The puzzles themselves are imaginative and fun to figure out but I didn’t find any of them to be particularly challenging. There wasn’t a point where either myself or my partner felt stuck or needed to think about it so if you’re looking for a challenging time I doubt you’ll get that here. Pretty much once you know how the tools work you can breeze through most of the levels with the only real challenge that we had during our playtime being the toolbox boss fight but that was more to do with weird camera placement rather than any actual challenge. That said this game is about preventing a divorce rather than creating one so it’s likely that the lack of challenge was on purpose so that even people who aren’t familiar with games can get some fun out of this this is a couples game after all.

On the visual side of things It Takes Two is a very pretty game that is just one big explosion of colour and imagination with relatively mundane locations such as a garden shed or a greenhouse being turned into something straight out of a child’s imagination. The most interesting thing about the design of It Takes Two is that it’s the same engine as A Way Out and when you see the human characters at the beginning you can see the similarities between the two games but when you get shrunk into the doll’s world then the world takes on a new aesthetic with a mix of both the realistic and fantastical it’s quite the sight.

You will spend pretty much the whole game in split-screen with Cody always being on the left and May always being on the right. I looked for a setting to see if it was possible to switch the screens around but I couldn’t find anything. There are times where the cameras will come together either for cutscenes or certain gameplay sections but about 90% of your time will be spent with the split camera. I personally prefer this type of co-op camera to the type you often see in other games such as the Lego games where the camera stays centered and moving around angles it to a certain player or section. This does come with it’s own problems though for example at times the player characters will be tiny on the screen and when it comes to sections where you need to platform precisely or time your jumps to avoid danger it can make things harder for you because you are essentially using only half of your screen.

It Takes Two is also quite lengthy for a co-op game clocking in around 8 – 10 hours of gameplay and potentially more if you take your time with the mini-games and puzzles so I hope you and your partner have time to spend. Normally I would say that a co-op game needs to be on the short side because not only does it need to keep you entertained it needs to keep the other person entertained as well and when it comes to puzzle games throw in the inevitable frustration of when the other person just isn’t getting the puzzle to add to the reasons why you don’t want a co-op to be too long. It Takes Two doesn’t suffer from these issues due to the aforementioned puzzle simplicity and variety of gameplay even if you weren’t enjoying a certain section of the game it’s more than likely that you’ll enjoy the next so that feeling of discovery and something new is always driving you forward.

The levels themselves are full of little interactive elements that don’t progress the story or even have a real purpose outside of “they’re fun” it’s a design philosophy you’d find in Mario games and it adds that little sprinkle of charm that makes It Takes Two fun to play with someone else as you’ll come across several of these “come look at this” moments organically rather than having a button prompt that shoves it into your face.

The voice cast also does a pretty good job as well with the main characters Cody and May voiced by Joseph Balderrama and Annabelle Dowler doing a great job of portraying these characters. Joseph also pulls a double shift in this game as he also voices the Book of Love Dr. Hakim. The only complaint I would level against the game would mostly be that sometimes the characters don’t know when to shut up. Pretty much every action is accompanied by some sort of commentary that can get on your nerves after a few hours of hearing it again and again and again. Having your characters animated and active is great and all but there is a value in sitting back at times and letting what is on screen do the talking.

Overall It Takes Two is a charming co-op game that is the perfect distraction for you and your partner for a while and I find it to be one of the most well-put-together co-op games I’ve played in a while. Of course your enjoyment of this game will vary depending on who you play it with but you can largely reduce that risk because even if you don’t want to play couch co-op and you just want to play online only one person needs to buy the game while the other can download the free “Friend’s Pass” and play with you. If you’re a fan of co-op It Takes Two is simply a must-have game.

One of the low-hanging fruits that Capillary immediately addressed was switching to a different storage volume type on

As a digital business born on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Capillary approached the AWS team to discuss how to boost scalability and elasticity while optimizing costs. This led to an intense workshop during which Capillary and AWS teams spent 5 hours a day for more than a week doing a deep dive into each component of Capillary’s cloud architecture to identify areas for improvement. By late 2020 the company had notched 30 percent savings on its monthly infrastructure bill and modernized its architecture to improve scalability in an automated fashion.One of the low-hanging fruits that Capillary immediately addressed was switching to a different storage volume type on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). Many of the company’s workloads were attached to higher throughput storage volumes on Amazon EBS but the teams found redundancies during the deep dive. Capillary was able to cut storage costs by about 40 percent by switching to more cost-effective volumes while still maintaining the high-performance levels the business required.

Unlocking Value with Managed Services





Database administration typically a major IT cost center for businesses was the first target for conversion to a managed services model. The company stores and processes 200–250 TB of data and database maintenance was a time-consuming task for its engineers. To address this Capillary migrated from self-managed MySQL database clusters—which it has used since its founding—to

To unlock further savings on the AWS Cloud Capillary has taken up more managed services on AWS. “For several years we had the notion that managed services are costlier and that we could do a better job but the last year and a half has been eye-opening in that regard” says Piyush Goel vice president of Engineering at Capillary Technologies. “We are realizing the value of managed services on AWS the scale they provide and the amount of engineering effort that we save.”Database administration typically a major IT cost center for businesses was the first target for conversion to a managed services model. The company stores and processes 200–250 TB of data and database maintenance was a time-consuming task for its engineers. To address this Capillary migrated from self-managed MySQL database clusters—which it has used since its founding—to Amazon Aurora . “With Amazon Aurora we’re spending just one-third of the time we spent on our previous databases and we no longer have to worry about recovery and failover which are completely automated” says Goel. Engineers now spend their time writing code and looking at new ways to automate performance monitoring as their infrastructure scales.

Faster Smoother Deployments





In addition Capillary’s customers no longer experience brief periods of downtime associated with deployment. In most cases Capillary is exceeding its customer service level agreement of 99.5 percent uptime and it now achieves 99.9 percent availability thanks to containerization on AWS. “This improvement in customer satisfaction gives the sales team the confidence to target multinational clients” Goel says.

A fully containerized backend has also helped Capillary reduce both the cost and human intervention required in scaling. The company uses Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) as a managed service to provision and run “dockerized” applications. As a result deployment time for delivering new features has decreased to 20 minutes from 50–60 minutes in its previous setup.In addition Capillary’s customers no longer experience brief periods of downtime associated with deployment.

Realizing Multiple Benefits with Containers

On the backend the implementation of containers has empowered immutable deployments. This ensures consistency and reliability in software delivery resulting in higher-quality releases. In the past Capillary’s engineers could only roll out 1–2 releases every week but now they have the capability to deploy multiple releases every day. This accelerates time-to-market for customer-facing app enhancements.



The company is on a journey to move completely to a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) model which Goel says has brought a lot more engineering discipline to his teams. “Because containers can scale up and be deployed in a rolling pattern this shift is an organic first step to a fully developed CI/CD approach.”



Reducing the Cost of Machine Learning Inferencing





With this service Capillary benefits from an always-on model for inferencing that automatically scales up and down according to demand. This reduces the cost of inferencing by avoiding overprovisioning of memory-heavy GPU compute resources. “We can host multiple ML models on the same Amazon Elastic Inference unit and we optimized the cost even further with multiple units on the same host machine which keeps CPU utilization low” Goel says.

As part of its analytics offering to customers Capillary has built a 10-stage data processing pipeline using Amazon Elastic Inference . The company streams video and audio data from retail sites and analyzes the data via machine-learning (ML) models to yield insights on consumers. ML models on the TensorFlow platform have been optimized to run on Amazon Elastic Inference.With this service Capillary benefits from an always-on model for inferencing that automatically scales up and down according to demand.

Investing in R&D to Launch New Products

With the savings realized on AWS Capillary is reinvesting in its business mainly in research and development for new products. Examples include a real-time notification platform that streams customer data into Capillary clients’ data lakes and integration with social platforms such as LINE.



Looking back Capillary recognizes the value of the collaborative approach to problem-solving it has developed with AWS. “AWS solutions architects sales and support teams have worked closely with us to understand our app architecture in great detail” says Goel. “They keep us updated on how we can leverage particular components of our existing architecture and consistently provide personalized and relevant suggestions.”

It does sound quite a lot but there are several plausible explanations that may show it as being normal.



One of the bigger factors is reading too much into the % displayed in the car or the app. Even though the actual state of battery charge can remain largely fixed the displayed % can be adjusted up and down due to a variety of factors.



You mention that you charged late afternoon after a drive. The battery was likely to have been in a state whereby the displayed % closely resembled the true state of the battery. So charging to 80% would likely give you close to 80% usable battery when the battery was warm. However as the battery cooled this 80% was really less than this usable hence seeing less than 80% indicated.



If you charged up in ideal conditions but viewed in sub optimal conditions battery cold etc then you could well have seen a big drop in %.



80% charge nice warm day immediately after a drive then viewing on a cold morning before warming the car up 5% or more is easily explainable (seen in likes of TeslaFi but in normal app can be partially confirmed by temporarily sliding the charge % to 100% and seeing if maximum allowed is 100% or less).



The remaining losses could also have easily explainable reasons such as frequent checking of app (every time you open the app it wakes the car) only seeing whole integer % values cabin overheat protection normal car losses etc etc.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwteS1sci1yd2QtY2FuY2VsZWQtb3duZXJzLWNvbXByb21pc2Uv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVzbGFyYXRpLmNvbS90ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC15LWxyLXJ3ZC1jYW5jZWxlZC1vd25lcnMtY29tcHJvbWlzZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Tesla Model Y owner waited two years for a car that never came. He compromised.,"By

Don’t shoot the messenger” was a phrase I used quite frequently a few months ago. After digging for some time on what was going on with Tesla’s Model Y Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive variant I decided to do my duty as a journalist and find answers. After calling around to several Tesla showrooms without much luck the answer ultimately dropped in my lap after someone who was a frequent reader of the site told me that they had been contacted to revise their order. “Tesla won’t be making the LR RWD Model Y” a sales advisor told the man leaving two years of time in the rearview mirror and $2500 sitting in limbo over the entire period.

Upon this email I decided to call around and see what I could dig up. Ultimately I found out that the Model Y’s LR RWD variant was not going to be made so I wrote an article about it and it was met with plenty of disbelief.

“This is poorly sourced.” “Sales advisors don’t know anything.” “Tesla hasn’t made a statement I wouldn’t believe this article.” A few hours later my direct message inbox on Twitter was full of Model Y LR RWD reservation holders who said that they didn’t believe Tesla was canceling the variant. A few weeks later I started to see more and more people begin to consider changing their order away from the LR RWD that they had waited for and toward the AWD versions of the car. Eventually Elon Musk finally confirmed that the product line was becoming too complex and that the Model Y’s little-known configuration was dead in its tracks.

We have too much product complexity already — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 22 2021

It was tough even as someone who didn’t have a reservation for the car there almost seemed to be a sub-group of Tesla supporters who were just as passionate about this car as they were the company in general. I respected that so many people wanted answers and to this day I am still somewhat frustrated with Tesla because they left so many people in the dark about what their plans were. It might have been up in the air but even a small amount of communication in the form of an email would have been sufficient.

Over the few months where I got in touch with so many LR RWD reservation holders I became close to a few of them. I talked to them regularly and promised them I would do my best to find more concrete proof one way or another. I didn’t think anything would really change I thought that my article was correct which is why I published it (even though several people asked me to redact the article simply because they didn’t want to believe the car they had been waiting for for two years wasn’t coming.)

One person I spoke to regularly was a guy named Mike. He’s from Dallas and he was kind enough to describe his entire story with the LR RWD saga and he was sure to tell me about the delivery of his LR AWD which he took delivery of in the past week.

This is a preview from our weekly newsletter. Each week I go ‘Beyond the News’ and handcraft a special edition that includes my thoughts on the biggest stories why it matters and how it could impact the future.

“I reserved a Blue LR RWD Model Y with Induction wheels & black interior in early 2019. Put down $2500 and locked in $6k for FSD” Mike told me. He was very excited for his new Tesla because he had been waiting a long time. The Model S and Model X were out of his price range and his kids didn’t make the Model 3 a suitable option.

“Finally had the perfect SUV – the Model Y but my budget was being stretched. Never spent so much for a car in my life. But SR wouldn’t have been enough for me as my family often travels. So LR RWD seemed like the perfect middle ground – more than enough power than my previous SUVs don’t need AWD in Dallas yet it would be great for traveling. But once Performance and LR AWD were starting to be produced (months early) the only thing that posted on Tesla website was “LR RWD is not scheduled for production at this time”. Everyone who had preorders eventually got filled (even 7-seaters) but LR RWD preorders just sat there.”

And he sat there.

And sat there.

And sat there. For two years with no answers.

Desperate for answers Mike did anything in his power to find an update on the car.

“I set news alerts for “LR RWD” tweeted Elon asked a showroom emailed the official order team in Fremont even asked questions during the Quarterly Meetings” Mike explained. “No information and it was very frustrating. Tesla is a great company but seriously lacks in the communication department.”

Ultimately my article was when Mike started to question what was going on. Elon then confirmed the car wasn’t going to be made and this is when he decided to do something about it. “I reached out to my local showroom on migrating orders – and this is also what was frustrating they still didn’t have any official communication. Some of the people said ‘We can move you over to LR AWD but you’ll have to pay $10k for FSD.’ Others said ‘We might be able to move you over and keep your FSD at $6k but no guarantees.'”

Several reports indicated that Tesla would honor the FSD pricing that was set at the time of ordering the car usually $6000 for the LR RWD reservation holders. Some had to pay the full $10000 price which is where FSD sits currently. “I’ve read of others online canceling their orders and replacing them and having to pay the $10k pricing. I finally took things into my own hands and contacted the HQ Ordering Support in Fremont. I probably had 5+ calls with them and their communication issues are the same as others – they don’t get back to you via email or phone and every time you call you have to repeat everything and explain to THEM how they need to keep the FSD price. Finally got a hold of a supervisor and he got me taken care of. Switched to LR AWD kept the $6k pricing.”

Mike took delivery of his new Model Y in late March. It is the same color that he wanted and he is happy he waited. “Overall I’m glad I waited 1 year after launch to take delivery of my Model Y. With COVID I’ve driven a lot less so getting a new car wasn’t a huge priority. I heard horror stories of early deliveries so I inspected the car thoroughly. 2 years after my initial order I just took delivery – and the condition was great! No gaps no paint issues no defects – literally perfect (and believe me I did the whole checklist).”

The long limbo that Tesla left some owners in is a tough situation for everyone involved. It is tough for the company because it may not have known until Musk ultimately dropped the bomb on Twitter. It’s tough for the reservation holders because they sat there for two years without answers. And it’s tough for the journalists who dig for answers for the owners because Tesla never really communicates about anything ever since its PR department was dissolved.

Mike is just happy it’s over with.

“Overall I’m happy with the car and still fighting for the Tesla cause” he says. “I would just recommend Tesla improves their communications (ordering and service) with customers.”

A big thanks to our long-time supporters and new subscribers! Thank you.

I use this newsletter to share my thoughts on what is going on in the Tesla world. If you want to talk to me directly you can email me or reach me on Twitter. I don’t bite be sure to reach out!

But this is 2021 after all. No one seems surprised by much.

What started this round of social media sparring was a tweet on Saturday by Jace Craft-Miller who picked up his Carbonized Gray Mustang Mach-E First Edition on March 29.

The 29-year-old sales project manager from Cleveland Ohio tweeted ""All these Tesla fanbois reach out saying how much they hate the Mach-E ... blah blah.""

And Rodriguez who was featured in the Free Press in early March replied ""I've had them message me death threats over my joy with the Mach-E.""

Rodriguez 41 a U.S. Army veteran who served two tours in Iraq and specialized in explosive ordnance disposal is now a military contractor living in Saint Marys Georgia.

The fiery debate among Ford and Tesla owners reflects the intensity surrounding a growing all-electric market dominated by Tesla. CEO Elon Musk is widely credited as an innovative leader who helped transform public perception of the vehicles.

As a result Tesla has been a darling of Wall Street with a market value that dwarfs all competitors and far exceeds the Detroit Three combined. Tesla cars which some drivers compare to spaceships are especially popular in California and China.

The Mach-E has been portrayed as the first serious competitor to Tesla in terms of sleek design speed and handling.

Unsettled

When reading the threats from Tesla fans Rodriguez said he didn't think to take screenshots before reporting the content to Facebook and Twitter.

""As messages were coming in I was just hitting report"" he told the Free Press on Saturday.

Rodriguez was so unsettled at 11:30 p.m. one night that he reached out to Mike Levine Ford North America product communications manager who himself had been targeted with relentless and harsh criticism online after defending Mach-E owners on Twitter.

Meanwhile the posts submitted for review appear to have been removed.

Rodriguez said he was especially alarmed by comments on the Tesla Owners Worldwide private Facebook page which listed 87500 members on Saturday. A member had posted a story about his favorable Mach-E reviews and it unleashed a torrent of what he perceived to be disturbing attacks.

""One was like 'I hope the car loses control and crashes.' Or 'The car is going to catch fire when you're driving it'"" he said. ""I took that as a threat. For you to have any kind of ill will on anybody why would you say that? Then someone privately messaged me 'You're full of s*** and I know what your Tesla looks like. If I see it …' That private message on Facebook was more threatening.""

Someone in the Tesla Facebook group tagged Rodriguez alerting him to comments.

""Before I knew it about 65% of the comments were just bashing me"" he said. ""Part of me wants to get rid of my Tesla just not to have the association. A couple here and there OK. But folks are commenting and saying disgusting things. 'You let big oil buy you?' and 'How much are people paying you?' If that's what's associated with being a Tesla owner why do I want to be part of that group? It's not cool.""

In response to the death threat tweet on Saturday Levine replied ""So sorry to hear this. Horrifying. Hope you reported those.""

A request for comment from Tesla on Sunday was not immediately answered.

A mission

Rodriguez flew to San Diego California to pick up his new SUV and drive it cross-country to the east coast in February. With a 2020 Tesla Model X in his garage the electric vehicle advocate was curious to see how the high-profile all-electric vehicles compared. He shot video and posted it on YouTube. He has been active on social media engaging with auto aficionados.

That has displeased Tesla fans.

""Some Tesla owners are fanatics of the brand and of Elon Musk"" said veteran analyst John McElroy ""Autoline After Hours"" host. ""In their minds they're on a messianic mission to save the planet. Anyone who is not with them is against them.""

Tesla fans have insisted online that Ford must be paying regular people to post nice things on social media about the Mach-E which has garnered a number of honors including 2021 North American Utility Vehicle of the Year award in January selected by some 50 international jurors.

When Karl Brauer executive analyst at the car listing site iSeeCars.com learned of the comments targeting Rodriguez he said ""Why am I not surprised?""

""I’d like to think this represents an extremely small minority of fanatical Tesla owners"" Brauer said. ""It’s hard to believe it’s a genuine risk for Mach-E owners but we sadly live in a world where every threat of violence has to be taken seriously.""

The auto industry has had vicious conflict between brands in the past Brauer said.

""There are stories of Japanese car owners in the Detroit area facing the same issue back in the '70s and '80s. It speaks to the evolution of the industry when a Ford owner can face any form of threat in the U.S."" he said. ""Nobody threatens an opponent who is seen as a nonissue.""

The aggressive response is revealing Brauer said. ""If Tesla owners are trying to show courage and confidence in the presence of a rival they’re doing it wrong.""

While Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in March that ""Mustang Mach-E Steals Major Tesla Sales"" Tesla is still considered a global leader in all-electric vehicles.

Tesla was founded in 2003. Ford was founded in 1903.

On Friday Tesla stock closed at $667.93 per share with a market value of $635 billion. Ford stock closed at $12.75 per share with a market value of $47.56 billion. By comparison crosstown rival General Motors closed at $57.46 with a market value of $83.28 billion.

As Tesla works to get its mammoth new factory in Germany up and running by the summer disturbing delicate reptile habitats may be the least of Elon Musk's worries.

After sparring with locals over everything from water supply to deforestation there may be an even larger threat looming: Germany's largest union.

Tesla hasn't made many friends of labor activists in the US and the 2.2-million-strong IG Metall isn't likely to go down without a fight experts told Insider. A prolonged battle over contracts with the group — which wields considerable political influence and social capital — could derail Tesla's ambitious plans for the European market.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

A standoff over contracts

Virtually every major carmaker operating in Germany is a member of an employers' association and IG Metall — which represents metalworkers in the auto industry and other sectors — negotiates industry-wide contracts with the group instead of bargaining with each company individually. That system gives the country's unions considerably more negotiating power than their US counterparts which vote to unionize plant by plant.

But there's a catch — joining the association isn't required by law it's only customary. And Tesla has made every indication it's not interested in following that deep-rooted norm.

The carmaker has caught heat for union-busting tactics in the US — the National Labor Relations Board ruled in March that Musk must delete an anti-union tweet and reinstate a fired employee who was part of an organizing drive — and it has signaled it's not keen on working with unions in Germany either.

Tesla ignored a letter from IG Metall inviting a dialogue last year. And it went to great lengths to pacify disgruntled union members at Tesla Grohmann Automation an engineering firm it acquired in 2016 without entering the industry's collective agreement. Instead the carmaker fended off a strike by giving workers a deal that was comparable to the industry-wide wage (plus stock options).

It could try to pull the same play at Gigafactory Berlin.

The stakes are high for IG Metall

But IG Metall likely wants to avoid that scenario at all costs Stephen Silvia a professor at American University whose research focuses on comparative labor relations told Insider.

Allowing a massive non-union plant to build cars in Germany would set the dangerous precedent that companies don't need to engage in collective bargaining he said. It would also mean thousands of members would potentially go without the contractually enforced job security wages and benefits the rest of the industry enjoys.

Moreover IG Metall stands to lose bargaining power with other automakers if it can't get Tesla to play ball said Arthur Wheaton an automotive industry expert at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. It's especially crucial that IG Metall preserve all the sway it can at a time when carmakers are pivoting to EV production which Wheaton said requires roughly 30% fewer workers than traditional auto manufacturing.

""It's all about labor density"" he said. ""Every plant that opens that's not unionized hurts [IG Metall's] power.""

The union can make life difficult for Tesla

Given the stakes IG Metall is likely to employ a whole menu of strategies to bring Tesla to its side. And there's no guarantee that any of it will bear fruit. Amazon for example has for years resisted calls from Germany's service-sector union Verdi to recognize collective bargaining agreements.

Silvia who has spoken to the union about its plans anticipates a public relations campaign and protests to exert political and social pressure on Tesla to ""be a good corporate citizen.""

""It's very difficult to force a completely unwilling company"" Silvia said. ""They'll just have to make [Tesla's] life as uncomfortable as possible.""

IG Metall could also organize rolling strikes though there are restrictions on how long they can last and when they can occur. Grey-area ""guerilla actions"" — like slowing down work at a Tesla supplier where IG Metall might have members — may also be in the union's playbook Silvia said.

IG Metall may also try to influence Tesla's leadership from within. The carmaker will be required by law to allow Gigafactory Berlin employees to form a works council — a group that represents the interests of the factory's workforce — and IG Metall could make sure it's stacked with members according to Silvia.

Wheaton however thinks IG Metall's main weapon for putting the squeeze on Tesla is blocking the completion of the factory altogether. IG Metall could work with environmentalist groups to slow down construction he said.

Since beginning work on Gigafactory Berlin in early 2020 Tesla has faced setbacks from environmental activists and regulators over issues like deforestation water usage and the well-being of wildlife surrounding the construction site. And it has encountered delays over procedural problems having to do with work permits and deposits.

The stakes are high for Tesla too

The carmaker likely wants to avoid any more stumbles as it looks to get the plant which forms the cornerstone of its European strategy online by July. Tesla aims to eventually build 500000 European-market cars per year and produce its next-generation battery cells at the facility and a protracted struggle with IG Metall could impede those plans.

Getting the factory up to speed as quickly and as smoothly as possible is critical for Tesla as it works to scale production worldwide and defend its market share from a growing number of EV-making rivals most notably German automaker Volkswagen.

Tesla did not return Insider's request for comment on whether it is open to joining the collective wage agreement.

Tesla is ""just another company"" to IG Metall. Patrick Pleul/Getty Images

IG Metall for its part said it's approaching Tesla as it would any other manufacturer looking to open up a facility in Germany. Union representatives did not respond to Insider's request for an interview but the chairman of IG Metall Berlin Jan Otto told Insider in an emailed statement that he doesn't ""feel any frustration towards Tesla and the new Gigafactory in Grünheide.""

""It is our job to organize people and negotiate collective agreements once we have reached more than 60/70% of the workers. In the past we have organized thousands of workers in new and old companies"" Otto continued. ""Tesla is a big player but for us it is just another company.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy80OTg1NTMvdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtMy12cy1jYW1yeS1jb3N0LW93bmVyc2hpcC_SAVBodHRwczovL2luc2lkZWV2cy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvNDk4NTUzL3Rlc2xhLW1vZGVsLTMtdnMtY2FtcnktY29zdC1vd25lcnNoaXAvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Model 3 Vs Toyota Camry: 5-Year Cost Of Ownership Compared,"Is it cheaper to own a Toyota Camry or a Tesla Model 3 over five years? The only way to find out is to crunch the numbers.

Electric cars are expensive. In fact while range anxiety and a lack of charging infrastructure in some areas are primary reasons many people don't buy electric cars arguably the number one reason is the high starting price. Sticker shock can turn people away from virtually any product.

The Tesla Model 3 is one of the least expensive long-range EVs on the market today with a starting price of $37990. Notice we didn't say ""just"" $37990. That's because $40000 is a lot of money especially for a smaller car. However interestingly according to Kelley Blue Book the average purchase price of a passenger vehicle in the US in 2020 was $37876.

This means people are paying $40000 for a new car and not a new car that's necessarily going to save them a ton of money on fuel or maintenance. With that said if a buyer is comparing the base Model 3's ~$40K price to a car like the sub-$30000 Toyota Camry which is a very highly rated gas car that's also available as a hybrid there's a good chance they'll ""save money"" by picking the cheaper car.

If only buyers actually looked at a car's total cost of ownership they may quickly learn that the car with the cheaper upfront price may not always be the one that's cheaper to own over time.

With data reported to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Reyes can tell it’s not just a smell in the air. It’s pollution. The plant in West Dallas is the largest industrial sulfur dioxide polluter in the whole county according to the state of Texas 2019 official emissions inventory.The data are compiled and released by TCEQ every year but are not widely distributed or mapped out.Paul Quinn College’s Urban Research Initiative made that data a lot easier to read and much more accessible with a tool mapping polluters in North Texas counties. From that they’ve recently released lists of top polluters in all of Dallas-Fort Worth per county and per pollutant. You can see them all here . The report also explains what effects different pollutants have on a person's health.Some of the top polluters in Dallas County include the Mountain Creek Steam Electric Station the Sunnyvale Manufacturing Plant Luminant Generation Co. the West Dallas GAF factory and Texas Instruments.“It’s that next degree of knowledge to equip neighborhoods to say ‘OK this isn’t just some place that smells"" Evelyn Mayo a fellow at Paul Quinn College said. ""This is a hazard to your health and therefore it’s your right to make your own stink about it.” Mayo is also chair of the Dallas-based environmental advocacy group Downwinders at Risk. The group was involved in ridding the Floral Farms neighborhood of Shingle Mountain Downwinders also partnered with Paul Quinn College to create a study called ""Poisoned by ZIP Code."" According to the study the city's worst air pollution is in the West Dallas ZIP code 75212.Their role in these fights is to bring the numbers and support people facing environmental injustices.She said it can be hard to find information about a facility if you don’t know how to navigate TCEQ’s website. “So this entire process is hopefully just to cut down the red tape in a way that residents feel ‘OK I can just file a complaint every day because it smells bad every day.’” Those complaints pile up in the public record which can help balance the scales in a permit fight.In a legal sense it’s hard to draw a cause and effect relationship between industry and health.“It could be this or it could be your genes or it could be something that we just don’t know because we’re not constantly taking measurements of what’s happening around you” she said.In creating policies she said it’s about common sense. The information speaks for itself. Mayo said “If it’s all stacking up in the same areas which we’ve observed it tends to be then I think you have a policy question that doesn’t need to meet that legal standard.”The emissions inventory list is a way to monitor pollution until they have enough air monitors in enough places to get real-time data about environmental issues.The top polluters in DFW are called the “Dirty 30” in the report. It includes three cement plants in Ellis County’s Midlothian often called the “Cement Capital of Texas.” After Laura Hunt and her family moved from Oklahoma to Midlothian a half-hour drive from Dallas in 2015 her daughter began getting sick.“She just had recurrent pneumonia. She stopped eating stopped growing her lung function decreased to half normal” Hunt a pediatrician said. She always thought it had something to do with the three main cement plants in town: Ash Grove Holcim and Martin Marietta. No. 1 on that Dirty 30 list is the Holcim cement plant.If Holcim had any worries about being knocked down a few spots on the list those were squashed this week with the approval of a permit by TCEQ. The cement plant will soon be able increase carbon monoxide emissions by about 40-50% and start burning 100% petroleum coke as their flexible fuel which could triple the amount of particulate matter and add heavy metals into the air. Hunt formed the group Midlothian Breathe in an attempt to fight the Holcim permit.Although Hunt and the others didn’t get what they wanted she said they now have the infrastructure to fight something like this more efficiently in the future. For now they’re focused on getting more data to use as ammo in these fights.Three compressor stations in Arlington made it in the top ten list of Tarrant County polluters. These stations maintain the flow and pressure of natural gas in the pipelines.Ranjana Bhandari the executive director of environmental advocacy group Liveable Arlington said a horrible smell like car exhaust pours out of these stations. Visiting one of the stations Bhandari said she could taste the pollution. “There were times you couldn’t smell anything. There were times you could taste it. But you always came back feeling like you had the flu” Bhandari said adding that the feeling would last for around three days. “It’s that bad.""She said they've received a lot of reports of people feeling sick and attributing it to the compressor stations. Between their experiences and the data from Paul Quinn College's report local activists like Bhandari will have more fuel to fight environmental injustices in their communities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1sb2NhbG5ld3MuY29tL3R4L3NvdXRoLXRleGFzLWVsLXBhc28vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA0LzAyL3Bvd2VyLXBsYXllcnMtLXJlcC0tYW5naWUtY2hlbi1idXR0b24t0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Power Players: Rep. Angie Chen Button,"Power Players features state lawmakers rising through the ranks or making a notable mark on the 87th Texas legislative session. Each week Capital Tonight will feature an elected official to give you a chance to get to know the person behind the powerful position.

AUSTIN Texas — She likes to say she is living “the American dream Texas-style.” Before calling Texas home Rep. Angie Chen Button R-Richardson was bored and raised in Taiwan. She told the story of how in Taiwan her family of seven lived in a 300-square foot space.

“I always say I was a poor and a lonely student. I came to this great state this great country and the community gave me so much. You got all the opportunities in the world to pursue” Rep. Button told Spectrum News 1.

She immigrated to the United States to attend graduate school and study public finance and management services at the University of Texas at Dallas.

“It’s pretty similar to Taiwan except for here it’s a little bit drier” she said.

Graduate school is where she met her then-classmate and now-husband Darcy Button. They have a son and two grandchildren. Button’s husband is the inspiration for the one movie she can watch over and over again: “My Fair Lady.”

“We joke about that. He's my Professor Higgins” she said.

Her other favorite film is about an old adage for life featuring her American hero.

“You got to overcome all the barriers in life” she said holding a picture of actor John Wayne in her Capitol office. “Being persistent to pursue whatever you want to pursue you got to have the true grit.”

The Republican representative has served House District 112 since 2009 all in part because former State Senator Florence Shapiro called her up and suggested she run.

“She wanted me to run then I laughed I said ‘I appreciate this kind invitation but are you sure people in this region are ready to vote for Asian-American woman with funny English?’ and she laughed she said ‘Yes and you're going to win’” Button said.

The certified public accountant former employee of Texas Instruments and former member of the Dallas Area Rapid Transit Board celebrates the vibrancy and diversity of her district which includes portions of Garland Richardson Rowlett Sachse and Dallas.

“Garland downtown we have a revitalized the entire area. It is so wonderful” she said when asked what is the gem of her district. “Then on the Richardson side the Eisemann Center which have a lot of real good shows.”

Her favorite restaurant is Jeng Chi in Richardson.

“We go over there all the time” Button said. “You've probably figured out I was going to say the Chinese food.”

This legislative session Button is chair of the International Relations and Economic Development Committee and a member of the newly-formed Early Childhood Caucus an issue she believes is vital to recovery amid the pandemic.

“Childcare is such an important issue. It's more than a family issue is more than education issue is also a workforce issue. And also definitely economic recovery issue” she said.

Button is a state representative fighting for economic prosperity thankful she’s living the dream.",,,,,,,,,

In reality the app was just not that secure.

As governments scrambled to lock down their populations after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared last March some countries had plans underway to reopen. By June Jamaica became one of the first countries to open its borders.

Tourism represents about one-fifth of Jamaica’s economy. In 2019 alone four million travelers visited Jamaica bringing thousands of jobs to its three million residents. But as COVID-19 stretched into the summer Jamaica’s economy was in free fall and tourism was its only way back — even if that meant at the expense of public health.

The Jamaican government contracted with Amber Group a technology company headquartered in Kingston to build a border entry system allowing residents and travelers back onto the island. The system was named JamCOVID and was rolled out as an app and a website to allow visitors to get screened before they arrive. To cross the border travelers had to upload a negative COVID-19 test result to JamCOVID before boarding their flight from high-risk countries including the United States.

Amber Group’s CEO Dushyant Savadia boasted that his company developed JamCOVID in “three days” and that it effectively donated the system to the Jamaican government which in turn pays Amber Group for additional features and customizations. The rollout appeared to be a success and Amber Group later secured contracts to roll out its border entry system to at least four other Caribbean islands.

But last month TechCrunch revealed that JamCOVID exposed immigration documents passport numbers and COVID-19 lab test results on close to half a million travelers — including many Americans — who visited the island over the past year. Amber Group had set the access to the JamCOVID cloud server to public allowing anyone to access its data from their web browser.

Whether the data exposure was caused by human error or negligence it was an embarrassing mistake for a technology company — and by extension the Jamaican government — to make.

And that might have been the end of it. Instead the government’s response became the story.

A trio of security lapses

By the end of the first wave of coronavirus contact-tracing apps were still in their infancy and few governments had plans in place to screen travelers as they arrived at their borders. It was a scramble for governments to build or acquire technology to understand the spread of the virus.

Jamaica was one of a handful of countries using location data to monitor travelers prompting rights groups to raise concerns about privacy and data protection.

As part of an investigation into a broad range of these COVID-19 apps and services TechCrunch found that JamCOVID was storing data on an exposed passwordless server.

This wasn’t the first time TechCrunch found security flaws or exposed data through our reporting. It also was not the first pandemic-related security scare. Israeli spyware maker NSO Group left real location data on an unprotected server that it used for demonstrating its new contact-tracing system. Norway was one of the first countries with a contact-tracing app but pulled it after the country’s privacy authority found the continuous tracking of citizens’ location was a privacy risk.

Just as we have with any other story we contacted who we thought was the server’s owner. We alerted Jamaica’s Ministry of Health to the data exposure on the weekend of February 13. But after we provided specific details of the exposure to ministry spokesperson Stephen Davidson we did not hear back. Two days later the data was still exposed.

After we spoke to two American travelers whose data was spilling from the server we narrowed down the owner of the server to Amber Group. We contacted its chief executive Savadia on February 16 who acknowledged the email but did not comment and the server was secured about an hour later.

We ran our story that afternoon. After we published the Jamaican government issued a statement claiming the lapse was “discovered on February 16” and was “immediately rectified” neither of which were true.

Instead the government responded by launching a criminal investigation into whether there was any “unauthorized” access to the unprotected data that led to our first story which we perceived to be a thinly veiled threat directed at this publication. The government said it had contacted its overseas law enforcement partners.

When reached a spokesperson for the FBI declined to say whether the Jamaican government had contacted the agency.

Things didn’t get much better for JamCOVID. In the days that followed the first story the government engaged a cloud consultant Escala 24×7 to assess JamCOVID’s security. The results were not disclosed but the company said it was confident there was “no current vulnerability” in JamCOVID. Amber Group also said that the lapse was a “completely isolated occurrence.”

A week went by and TechCrunch alerted Amber Group to two more security lapses. After the attention from the first report a security researcher who saw the news of the first lapse found exposed private keys and passwords for JamCOVID’s servers and databases hidden on its website and a third lapse that spilled quarantine orders for more than half a million travelers.

Amber Group and the government claimed it faced “cyberattacks hacking and mischievous players.” In reality the app was just not that secure.

Politically inconvenient

The security lapses come at a politically inconvenient time for the Jamaican government as it attempts to launch a national identification system or NIDS for the second time. NIDS will store biographic data on Jamaican nationals including their biometrics such as their fingerprints.

The repeat effort comes two years after the government’s first law was struck down by Jamaica’s High Court as unconstitutional.

Critics have cited the JamCOVID security lapses as a reason to drop the proposed national database. A coalition of privacy and rights groups cited the recent issues with JamCOVID for why a national database is “potentially dangerous for Jamaicans’ privacy and security.” A spokesperson for Jamaica’s opposition party told local media that there “wasn’t much confidence in NIDS in the first place.”

It’s been more than a month since we published the first story and there are many unanswered questions including how Amber Group secured the contract to build and run JamCOVID how the cloud server became exposed and if security testing was conducted before its launch.

TechCrunch emailed both the Jamaican prime minister’s office and Matthew Samuda a minister in Jamaica’s Ministry of National Security to ask how much if anything the government donated or paid to Amber Group to run JamCOVID and what security requirements if any were agreed upon for JamCOVID. We did not get a response.

Amber Group also has not said how much it has earned from its government contracts. Amber Group’s Savadia declined to disclose the value of the contracts to one local newspaper. Savadia did not respond to our emails with questions about its contracts.

Following the second security lapse Jamaica’s opposition party demanded that the prime minister release the contracts that govern the agreement between the government and Amber Group. Prime Minister Andrew Holness said at a press conference that the public “should know” about government contracts but warned “legal hurdles” may prevent disclosure such as for national security reasons or when “sensitive trade and commercial information” might be disclosed.

That came days after local newspaper The Jamaica Gleaner had a request to obtain contracts revealing the salaries of state officials denied by the government under a legal clause that prevents the disclosure of an individual’s private affairs. Critics argue that taxpayers have a right to know how much government officials are paid from public funds.

Jamaica’s opposition party also asked what was done to notify victims.

Government minister Samuda initially downplayed the security lapse claiming just 700 people were affected. We scoured social media for proof but found nothing. To date we’ve found no evidence that the Jamaican government ever informed travelers of the security incident — either the hundreds of thousands of affected travelers whose information was exposed or the 700 people that the government claimed it notified but has not publicly released.

TechCrunch emailed the minister to request a copy of the notice that the government allegedly sent to victims but we did not receive a response. We also asked Amber Group and Jamaica’s prime minister’s office for comment. We did not hear back.

Many of the victims of the security lapse are from the United States. Neither of the two Americans we spoke to in our first report were notified of the breach.

Spokespeople for the attorneys general of New York and Florida whose residents’ information was exposed told TechCrunch that they had not heard from either the Jamaican government or the contractor despite state laws requiring data breaches to be disclosed.

The reopening of Jamaica’s borders came at a cost. The island saw more than a hundred new cases of COVID-19 in the month that followed the majority arriving from the United States. From June to August the number of new coronavirus cases went from tens to dozens to hundreds each day.

To date Jamaica has reported over 39500 cases and 600 deaths caused by the pandemic.

Prime Minister Holness reflected on the decision to reopen its borders last month while in parliament to announce the country’s annual budget. He said the country’s economic decline last was “driven by a massive 70% contraction in our tourist industry.” More than 525000 travelers — both residents and tourists — have arrived in Jamaica since the borders opened Holness said a figure slightly more than the number of travelers’ records found on the exposed JamCOVID server in February.

Holness defended reopening the country’s borders.

“Had we not done this the fallout in tourism revenues would have been 100% instead of 75% there would be no recovery in employment our balance of payment deficit would have worsened overall government revenues would have been threatened and there would be no argument to be made about spending more” he said.

Both the Jamaican government and Amber Group benefited from opening the country’s borders. The government wanted to revive its falling economy and Amber Group enriched its business with fresh government contracts. But neither paid enough attention to cybersecurity and victims of their negligence deserve to know why.

EVA Air has operated speed dating flights Thai Airways has operated flights over 99 holy sites and a Facebook group has chartered an A380 just for fun.

About a week ago I wrote about how Emirates is about to operate an A380 flight to nowhere with a unique angle. However perhaps what’s equally interesting is that the flight isn’t anywhere close to selling out and the airline is now throwing in a further incentive for people to book.

EK2021 an Emirates A380 flight to nowhere

On Saturday April 10 2021 an Emirates Airbus A380 will operate a flight to nowhere to celebrate the UAE’s progress with its vaccination program as well as to highlight Emirates’ progress in vaccinating its staff. The idea here is that the flight will carry only fully vaccinated crew and passengers.

EK2021 will depart Dubai International Airport at 12PM and will return at 2:30PM. The roughly 2hr30min flight will fly over various parts of the United Arab Emirates.

This flight will specifically be operated by Emirates’ newest A380 which features its premium economy cabin as well as its updated first business and economy cabins. Passengers can expect the full A380 experience on this flight including entertainment food drinks and more.

Emirates’ newest A380 business class will be available on this flight

Emirates is also using this flight to showcase its safety measures like biometric and contactless technology at check-in and during boarding.

The UAE is one of the leading countries in the world when it comes to vaccinating residents. As of now over 8.5 million vaccine shots have been administered in the country which have been received by over half of the UAE’s population.

How expensive are tickets?

Even if you’re willing to travel to the UAE unfortunately tickets aren’t available to everyone. Tickets for EK2021 are initially only available to UAE citizens and residents who have completed the two week period after their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Tickets can’t be purchased online but rather have to be purchased either by Emirates’ cell center or at a sales office in the UAE.

Pricing for tickets is as follows:

Economy tickets cost 1000 AED (~272 USD)

Business tickets cost 2000 AED (~544 USD)

Interestingly first and premium economy tickets aren’t being sold. I’ll be curious to see if some economy passengers are seated in premium economy and some business class passengers are seated in first class or if those cabins will just remain empty.

It sounds like there will be no showering over the UAE on this flight

All fares collected for this flight will be donated to the Emirates Airline Foundation which is the airline’s charity organization that supports projects around the world.

Passengers will be required to bring their UAE ID or passports as well as vaccination certificate. On top of that all customers will be provided pre-departure rapid COVID-19 testing free of charge and mask wearing is still required at the airport and on the plane (it’s not entirely clear if the COVID-19 testing is optional or mandatory).

The plane operating this flight will feature Emirates’ new premium economy

Tickets for this flight don’t seem to be selling well

In the past when airlines have put special flights to nowhere on sale they’ve typically sold out in no time. That doesn’t seem to be the case for this Emirates flight. How do we know?

Emirates has announced on Twitter that flights are still on sale and on top of that is now offering all passengers on the flight business class lounge access on the ground plus 20% off at duty free.

All passengers flying on EK2021 will have access to our Business Class lounge at @DXB and will receive 20% off their @DubaiDutyFree purchase*.



* Offer excludes gold electronics and select brands. — Emirates Airline (@emirates) April 4 2021

As I stated when I first posted about this about a week ago this is no doubt a cool concept for avgeeks but I’m not fully sure I get the logic here and that goes beyond the (reasonable) environmental concerns that people have.

For one all passengers will be vaccinated yet all typical coronavirus precautions will still be in place. Airlines have spent the past year convincing us that flying is safe even for non-vaccinated travelers so what exactly is supposed to make this flight different in that regard? Why should we care if other people on the plane are vaccinated or not if flying is safe even for the unvaccinated?

Don’t get me wrong it’s totally reasonable that there are no mask exceptions being made for this flight but then I also don’t get the point of using the flight to showcase how everyone is vaccinated and what the future of travel will look like.

And is the pre-flight COVID-19 testing intended to make passengers feel more comfortable or what? Wouldn’t that be better offered on a flight where not everyone is vaccinated where there’s a higher risk of people both having and spreading coronavirus?

Bottom line

Emirates will be operating a one-off A380 flight to nowhere on April 10 intended to celebrate the vaccination progress for both the country and the airline. Tickets are on sale in economy and business class and all fares collected go to charity.

While tickets went on sale about a week ago it seems like they haven’t been very popular as Emirates is now throwing in more incentives to book.

What do you make of Emirates’ A380 flight to nowhere?",,,

What Happened: One of the most surprising names in the new Ark space ETF was Deere & Company (NYSE: DE). The farm equipment maker is the 13th largest holding in the new ETF representing $10.8 million and 3.1% of the fund’s assets as of Thursday.

The inclusion shows Ark is not only including pure space companies. The fund also will hold companies that could benefit from the growth of space.

“Aerospace beneficiary companies are companies whose operations stand to benefit from aerospace activities including agriculture internet access global positioning system construction imaging drones air taxes and electric aviation vehicles” according to Ark Funds.

Why It’s Important: Since the 1990s John Deere has worked on using GPS technology to improve precision agriculture.

In 2018 John Deere partnered with NASA to improve its self-driving tractors. The company tapped into NASA’s global network of ground stations.

Most self-driving tractors cultivating the majority of American farmland rely on NASA technology. The NASA model for commercial software can help predict yields and classify land types using satellite imagery.

“This innovation resulted in perhaps one of NASA’s most important contributions to modern society — highly accurate GPS navigation anywhere on Earth including crop fields” the Food Institute said on the GPS improvements brought from NASA software.

The link between space and agriculture companies appears here to stay: In December 2020 NASA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture extended a long-standing partnership on space-based assets.

Ark Funds sees Deere & Company and other agricultural-related names such as top holding Trimble Inc (NASDAQ: TRMB) as winners in the growth of satellites and GPS.

DE Price Action: Shares of Deere & Company ended the week up 0.29% at $372.12.

The announcement comes one day after U.S. President Joe Biden called for the game to be moved out of Atlanta. The All-Star Game was scheduled for July 13 at Truist Park home of the Atlanta Braves.

The decision to pull the July 13 game from Atlanta’s Truist Park amounts to the first economic backlash against Georgia for the voting law that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp quickly signed into law March 25.

Kemp has insisted the law’s critics have mischaracterized what it does yet GOP lawmakers adopted the changes largely in response to false claims of fraud in the 2020 elections by former President Donald Trump and his supporters. The law includes new restrictions on voting by mail and greater legislative control over how elections are run.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred made the decision to move the All-Star events and the amateur draft from Atlanta after discussions with individual players and the Players Alliance an organization of Black players formed after the death of George Floyd last year the commissioner said in a statement. A new ballpark for the events wasn’t immediately revealed.

Manfred said he also spoke with the Major League Baseball Players Association which at the time of the commissioner's decision said it had still not taken a stance.

“I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year’s All-Star Game and MLB draft” Manfred said. “Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box.”

Kemp called it a “knee-jerk decision” that means “cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life sports included. If the left doesn’t agree with you facts and the truth do not matter.”

“This attack on our state is the direct result of repeated lies from (President) Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams about a bill that expands access to the ballot box and ensures the integrity of our elections"" Kemp said in a statement referring to the Democratic candidate whom he narrowly defeated in the 2018 election. ""I will not back down. Georgians will not be bullied.”

Georgia state House Speaker David Ralston a powerful Republican who backed the voting law changes said the baseball league’s decision “robs Georgians of a special celebration of our national pastime free of politics.”

Like other Republicans in the state Ralston vowed to stand behind the new law which adds strict identification requirements for voting absentee by mail limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to hand out food or water to voters waiting in line among many other provisions.

Georgia Republicans say changes were needed to maintain voter confidence in the election system. Democrats and voting rights groups say the law will disproportionately affect communities of color. On Wednesday two of Georgia's most prominent business leaders sided with the law's opponents.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian labeled the law “unacceptable” while Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey called the legislation a “step backward.”

The Atlanta Braves issued a statement Friday saying the team is disappointed by Manfred's decision.

“We are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city” the team said. “The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion.""

Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts who is to guide the National League All-Star team applauded MLB for moving the game from Georgia.

“I think in a world now where people want and need to be heard — and in this particular case people of color — for Major League Baseball to listen and do something about it to be proactive it sets a tone” said Roberts the son of a Black father and Japanese mother.

Abrams who has championed voting rights since her loss to Kemp blasted the new voting law. The Democrat is being closely watched to see if she seeks a rematch against Kemp in 2022.

“Georgia Republicans must renounce the terrible damage they have caused to our voting system and the harm they have inflicted on our economy” Abrams said.

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms a Democrat said she supports MLB's decision. Atlanta will no doubt share in the economic loss though the Braves' home stadium is now located outside the city in suburban Cobb County.

“Unfortunately the removal of the MLB All-Star Game from Georgia is likely the first of many dominoes to fall until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed” Bottoms said in a statement.

Some Democrats from the Georgia county where the game was to be held said they oppose MLB's move. Lisa Cupid the Black chairwoman of the Cobb County Commission said she urged the league to stay rather than harm hotels and other businesses still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.

State Rep. Teri Anulewicz a Democrat whose district includes the stadium added: “I don’t know who Major League Baseball feels they are punishing. The governor from his statement has made clear he doesn’t feel he is being punished.”

The relocation of high-profile sports events from cities in response to social issues has a long history in the U.S.

The NFL originally awarded the 1993 Super Bowl to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe Arizona but decided in March 1991 to move it to Pasadena California after the state failed to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day an official holiday. Arizona became the last state to adopt an MLK Holiday when voters approved it in November 1992.

The NBA first scheduled its 2017 All-Star Game at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte North Carolina then shifted it in July 2016 because of its objections to a North Carolina law that limited anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. The law was partially repealed in 2017 and the 2019 All-Star Game was held in Charlotte.

NCAA officials decided in 2001 to ban awarding championship sites in advance to states that displayed the Confederate flag but did not alter events whose sites were determined by seeding or ranking. That was expanded last June to prevent any NCAA championship event from being played where the flag had a prominent presence. Mississippi's governor signed a law less than two weeks later to retire the flag.

Manfred said despite the change of venue MLB still plans to use the All-Star Game this year to honor Hank Aaron the Braves’ Hall of Famer and former career home run champion who died on Jan. 22 at age 86.

Houston Astros manager Dusty Baker a former teammate of Aaron's applauded the move and said the late outfielder ""always had the rights of the people in the forefront of his mind and in his heart.”

“This is what Hank would have liked even if it was his town” Baker told reporters.

Major League Baseball’s decision to move its All-Star Game from Georgia in response to a new restrictive voting law is likely to cost the state tens of millions of dollars.

The “estimated lost economic impact” from the relocation is more than $100 million according to a statement from Holly Quinlan president and CEO of Cobb Travel and Tourism.

This comes as the tourism industry one of the hardest hit during the Covid-19 pandemic is still struggling to rebound.

“In the initial stages of the pandemic many Cobb [County] hotels saw single digit occupancy numbers” Quinlan said. “The 8000-plus MLB contracted hotel room nights that will not actualize as a result of the MLB All-Star Game relocation will have a negative impact on Cobb’s hospitality industry and other local businesses further delaying recovery.”

MLB announced Friday that this season’s All-Star Game and draft will not be held in Atlanta in response to the recently passed law in the state that critics say would make it harder to vote.

The Atlanta Braves said the franchise is “deeply disappointed” by the decision to move the game

“This was neither our decision nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city” according to a statement from the team. “Unfortunately businesses employees and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision.”

Several leaders of Georgia-based companies have also criticized the law including Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.

The legislation which was signed last week by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp imposes voter identification requirements for absentee ballots empowers state officials to take over local elections boards limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters to give them food and water as they wait in line.

Immediately after MLB announced the move state Republicans behind the law blamed some of its leading Democratic critics – including Stacey Abrams a Georgia Democrat and voting rights advocate.

Kemp on Saturday continued to blame President Joe Biden and Abrams for the recent backlash he received from companies in the state and said he “will not be backing down from this fight.”

“Cancel culture and partisan activists are coming for your business” Kemp said at a press conference. “Major League Baseball Coca-Cola and Delta may be scared of Stacey Abrams Joe Biden and the left but I am not.”

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms a Democrat told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield that MLB’s decision “is really probably the first of many boycotts of our state to come.”

""I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year's All-Star Game and MLB Draft.""

Manfred said the new host city and details about events will be announced ""shortly.""

At a press conference on Saturday Gov. Brian Kemp slammed MLB's decision saying ""I will not be backing down from this fight.""

""MLB caved to fear and lies from liberal activists"" Kemp said. ""They ignored the facts of our new election integrity law and they ignored the consequences of their decision on our community.""

Kemp blamed Democrats including President Joe Biden and former Georgia Rep. Stacey Abrams for MLB's decision.

""Major League Baseball Coca-Cola and Delta may be scared of Stacey Abrams Joe Biden and the left but I am not and we are not"" said Kemp echoing his sentiments made in a statement issued Friday that MLB's ""knee-jerk reaction"" was because ""cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life sports included.""

The Atlanta Braves said in a statement that the team was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision and that ""this was neither our decision nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city. The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to have the discussion.""

The new law passed by the Georgia House and Senate and signed by Kemp on March 25 has generated controversy due to several limits it puts on voting in the state. The bill passed along party lines with Republicans vocally supporting it and Democrats calling it voter suppression.

Republicans contend it will streamline elections and increase confidence in the process following outrage from Republicans and former President Donald Trump over his defeat in the presidential election and Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock winning runoff elections in January.

Critics see it differently contending it's meant to suppress the votes of historically disenfranchised communities namely Black voters.

The chief executives of Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola forcefully condemned the bill on Wednesday a change from prior public stances. After the bill passed Delta's CEO praised aspects of it while a Coca-Cola executive said the corporation was ""disappointed in the outcome."" Neither corporation publicly opposed the bill before it was signed into law despite mounting pressure from a coalition of voting rights and civil liberties groups.

Biden has condemned the new law in and voiced support for moving the All-Star Game out of Atlanta in an interview with ESPN.

""I think today's professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly"" Biden said. ""I would strongly support them doing that. People look to them. They're leaders.""

Ossoff has said he disagreed with Biden over moving the game and Warnock issued a statement calling MLB's decision an ""unfortunate consequence"" resulting from ""politicians seeking to retain power at the expense of Georgians' voices.""

""It is my hope"" Warnock added ""that businesses athletes and entertainers can protest this law not by leaving Georgia but by coming here and fighting voter suppression head on and hand-in-hand with the community.""

Abrams who's led the charge for increased access to voting in Georgia posted a video to Twitter on Wednesday asking for companies not to boycott the state.

""I understand the passion of those calling for boycotts of Georgia following the passage of SB 202"" she said in the video. ""Boycotts have been an important tool throughout our history to achieve social change. But here's the thing: Black Latino AAPI and Native American voters whose votes are the most suppressed under SB 202 are also the most likely to be hurt by potential boycotts of Georgia. To our friends across the country please do not boycott us.""

Former President Barack Obama on Friday tweeted his congratulations to MLB for ""taking a stand.""

Kemp and Georgia House Speaker David Ralston criticized Abrams for MLB moving the game even though she doesn't support the boycott.

""Republicans who passed and defended Senate Bill 202 did so knowing the economic risks to our state. They prioritized making it harder for people of color to vote over the economic well-being of all Georgians"" Abrams said in a statement following the announcement of the All-Star Game leaving Atlanta. ""Like many Georgians I am disappointed that the MLB is relocating the All-Star game; however I commend the players owners and League commissioner for speaking out.""

MLB reiterated its support for voting access in its statement and called attention to the voter initiatives it undertook last season.

""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box"" Manfred's statement continued. ""In 2020 MLB became the first professional sports league to join the non-partisan Civic Alliance to help build a future in which everyone participates in shaping the United States.""

""We proudly used our platform to encourage baseball fans and communities throughout our country to perform their civic duty and actively participate in the voting process"" Manfred continued. ""Fair access to voting continues to have our game's unwavering support.""

Freddie Freeman the Braves' top player and the National League MVP in 2020 said Thursday before the team's season opener that he'd prefer the league kept the game in Atlanta and used it as a way to call attention to the law and the importance of access to voting.

""I think it'd be better to keep it and use a platform"" Freeman told reporters. ""What's happened in the last couple of months has already gone through so why not use what we already have here as a platform in the city and state that it has been passed through?""

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms a Democrat who called the elections bill both ""ridiculous"" and ""unnecessary"" predicted more fallout.

""Just as elections have consequences so do the actions of those who are elected. Unfortunately the removal of the @MLB All Star game from GA is likely the 1st of many dominoes to fall until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed"" she tweeted.

On the same day MLB pulled this year's All-Star Game out of Atlanta Milwaukee made a pitch to host the game with Mayor Tom Barrett writing a letter to Manfred that read in part: ""As you review alternative sites for the game I ask you to consider Milwaukee. It is a particularly appropriate location to honor Hank Aaron who is a revered and beloved former Milwaukeean. He started and concluded his Major League career with teams here.""

The All-Star Game was last held in Milwaukee in 2002 at what was then known as Miller Park.

""We are finalizing a new host city"" Manfred said in his statement ""and details about these events will be announced shortly.""

The popular Twitch streamer and YouTube streamer Ninja has gained even more interactions than LeBron James himself and is reported as one of the top earning streamers of today. There's a lot of things that fans know about him but to the general audience it's hard to understand who Richard Tyler Blevins or Ninja really is.

Before going into things that most people don't know there's always the initial question to get people interested and that question is ""how much is Ninja worth?"" The answer to this question as reported by EssentiallySports is that he is estimated to be worth $15-20 million!

Here are 5 facts you probably didn't know about Ninja:

1. Ninja first game was 'Halo 3'

According to Win.gg Ninja initially started with a classic game that most professional FPS gamers have probably dipped into ""Halo 3"". This could even be referred to as the start of his career as a professional gamer back in 2009.

2. Ninja's previous work

According to the Richard Tyler Blevins LinkedIn page he used to work at Noodles & Company back in May 2008 up to September 2011 for 3 years and 5 months. The title on his LinkedIn page says he was the Cashier/Saute/Prep/Bus/Garnish.

3. Ninja hates Tfue?

An article by Looper shows the long feud between the two gamers. Things reportedly got up to the point that Tfue even challenged Ninja to a MMA fight. Although there's really no report as to what happened then it can be seen that both of the gamers were strongly against each other.

4. What GPU does Ninja use?

Although the Twitch streamer might have upgraded his hardware over the years an article by PatchesSoft notes that Ninja uses a EVGA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti XC Ultra Gaming. With the Nvidia RTX 3090 already out it is still unknown as to whether or not Ninja is using the latest GPUs.

5. Ninja sings his song?

Ninja has a YouTube video where he actually sings his own raps which was described by some as ""cringey"" but still a lot of his followers thought it was hilarious. Being one of the most popular streamers as of the moment doing wacky things don't really get hidden from his fans.

Ninja estimated monthly income

There is a lot more to know about Ninja but so far here are the details that not a lot of people might not know about the 29 year old streamer. Despite being quite controversial as of late the streamer is still able to rake in an estimate of $500000 to $700000 a month.

Of course it's hard to factor in the sponsorship deals that he gets with the companies that he is representing as of the moment. An accurate estimation of just how much Ninja is worth as of the moment is kind of hard to give since he could be worth more or less than the estimate.

The push to diversify banking from within the industry

The racial reckoning in America calling for diversity has touched every industry including banking.

According to a report from the Committee for Better Banks -- a bank workers' advocacy group -- Black and Latino employees have a significantly smaller chance of holding an executive position in corporate banks in comparison to their white counterparts.

""I heard lots of stories of workers of color who said 'I've applied for 15 jobs 20 jobs never got an interview I always had good performance reviews by my manager ... but never got an interview'"" Nick Weiner the lead author of the CBB report told ABC News.

The report finds that Black and Latino employees at 13 major U.S. banks have a less than 25% chance of being promoted or hired for a senior management or executive position in comparison to their white colleagues. Black and Latinos also have a very high likelihood of being in an entry-level position with limited mobility such as bank teller and call center employees in comparison to their white colleges the report also found.

The study gave the financial industry a ""C"" grade for diversity. African American and Latino representation were given a ""D"" and Asian representation a ""C.""

A lack of diversity in corporate America is nothing new but the impact is even more widespread in banking. African Americans and Hispanics are less likely than their white counterparts to receive home mortgages personal loans and are more likely to lack trust in banking and lack banking access and resources.

Reese Giddins the president of Greenwood Bank who worked in corporate banking for several years before helping to start minority-focused and owned bank Greenwood said the lack of diversity may contribute to the lack of trust in financial institutions from minorities.

""When you don't have people that look like you that can't understand you and can't help you it's hard to build that trust. With Greenwood we're trying to rebuild that trust in our community along with the recirculation of the dollars into the community as well as bringing in that talent"" Giddins told ABC News.

Many banks including those studied in the CBB report released statements following the death of George Floyd promising to diversify and provide racial equity.

However further steps to diversify the industry are needed said Wells Fargo employee Ted Laurel.

""I would say that we would need more change beyond just adding more ranks of minorities into our leadership ... A two-prong approach would definitely help moving the employees up from the bottom that we already have and then also recruiting more diverse talent especially from those minority colleges"" Laurel said.

A number of banks including US Bank and Wells Fargo were given an ""F"" grade in the report. According to the report authors these banks declined to provide its researchers with data on ""the total number of employees within race groups at the company.""

A spokesperson from Wells Fargo told ABC News the company has work to do with improving diversity but is making strides.

""Wells Fargo is committed to doing the work to ensure we provide our employees with an inclusive and respectful workplace where diverse talent flourishes. While we have more work to do we have taken steps that include creating a diverse segments representation and inclusion group reporting directly to the CEO that is accountable for progress and execution of new and existing programs conducting diversity-focused talent reviews and sponsorship programs to help promote underrepresented groups assessing senior leaders on increasing diverse representation at leadership levels and requiring unconscious bias training for all managers. We are committed to sharing results"" Well Fargo told ABC News via a statement.

""In 2020 we broadly disclosed our EEO-1 data for the first time and we intend to publish our 2019 and 2020 Consolidated EEO-1 gender/race employment data in the summer of 2021 as part of our updated ESG reporting process. Wells Fargo values diversity and inclusion not just as a business imperative but because it's the right thing to do"" Wells Fargo senior vice president Kate Pulley also said in a statement to ABC News.

Wells Fargo has also recently hired Kleber Santos in November of 2020 to lead Diverse Segments Representation & Inclusion to improve internal diversity and equity.

US Bank employee Marcus Dodson said transparency is needed to fully see how the issue is being resolved.

""What I would like to see is transparency ... a focus on diversity. From what I've seen we've had these trainings that we take online. I would say that there hasn't been a focus on minority hiring minority issues or having difficult conversations"" Dodson said

US Bank declined ABC News' request for an interview but released the following statement:

""The findings in this report are not accurate and do not reflect information we've released publicly including in our 2020 Environmental Social and Governance Report which is available on our website"" US Bank vice president Lee Henderson said in a statement.

According to its Social and Governance report US Bank has committed to $100 million annually in access to capital for Black business owners and provided $1 million to Black-led community development financial institutions.

Greenwood which Giddins says officially will launch this summer has recently announced Wells Fargo as one of their top investors.

However Reese is hoping the partnership from their investors which he said also includes Mastercard Bank of America and Chase leads to more than just financial gains.

""What we're focused on and really trying to create is trust back in the community the opportunity to affect Black and Latin[o] businesses. That's really our focus. And that's really what we're trying to get to out of these partnerships that we have…I'd like to see more sponsorship of classrooms and inner cities to essentially help individuals who want careers in banking. I'd like to see more processes in place for folks that work the phone but that have the skill set to move up"" Giddins says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vd2Vuc2Jvcm90aW1lcy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvY29tbXVuaXR5LzIwMjEvMDQvdS1zLWJhbmtzLWxpdHRsZS1yZWNlaXZlcy1qdW5pb3ItYWNoaWV2ZW1lbnRzLXRvcC1uYXRpb25hbC12b2x1bnRlZXItaG9ub3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Bank's Little receives Junior Achievement's top national volunteer honor,"David Little an executive vice president at U.S. Bank was recently chosen from more than 151000 volunteers nationwide as one of eight recipients of the Junior Achievement’s most prestigious national award for volunteerism the Gold Leadership Award.

FedNow which will be fully implemented by 2023 will let individuals and companies transfer funds between accounts pay bills and send or receive money from friends or family. The services will be near-real time and be available any day or time of the year.

The instant payments are differentiated by the speed at which they can be doled out as compared to traditional payment methods. While some traditional methods appear to go through within seconds they actually end up taking several days to go through and actually become available for the user the report stated.

First Republic Bank Tri Counties Bank Silicon Valley Bank Pacific Coast Bankers’ Bank and First Foundation Bank will be the banks testing the program while CUs participating are Excite Credit Union Farmers Insurance Federal Credit Union and Star One Credit Union according to the report.

FedNow is set to be released in phases the report stated and the first release will come with fraud prevention tools the ability to join instantly as a receive-only participant request for payment capability and tools to support participants in the way they handle payment inquiries. And Reserve Banks will have a liquidity management tool on offer.

Like with other Federal Reserve services the FedNow program will be available for depository institutions eligible to hold accounts at its 12 Reserve Banks and 24 branches around the country. The goal of the program is to expand equitable access to the instant payment system to over 10000 depository institutions or their agents in the U.S. according to the report.

In Europe immediate gratification with payments is becoming more common with BNP Paribas announcing it will be partnering with Token to make account-to-account (A2A) payments possible."

But apparently that didn’t entirely happen.

Uber will now pay an additional $1.1 million to a blind woman who says said she missed work missed her birthday celebration missed Christmas Eve church services and was left out in the dark in the rain and other such humiliations because Uber drivers refused to carry her and her dog on 14 different occasions — a number of which happened after Uber finalized its 2016 settlement.

“Uber allowed drivers who discriminated against disabled riders to continue driving without discipline” an arbitrator concluded this week (via The San Francisco Chronicle).

This line from the arbitrator’s report is also worth considering: “When Uber did conduct an investigation its investigators were trained in some instances to coach drivers to find non-discriminatory reasons for ride denials sometimes even to ‘advocate’ to keep drivers on the platform despite discrimination complaints.”

Lisa Irving the woman isn’t suddenly a millionaire by the way. The arbitrator awarded her $324000 in damages with the rest ($805313) going to legal costs including attorney fees. She spoke to the Chronicle about her dog and her memories including one where a driver did pick her up then got vocally angry about having a dog in the car and threatened to leave them on the side of the road. She says she was rejected at least 60 times.

Uber now has a dedicated support form for issues with service animals. “Was a service animal denied?” is the very first question.

As relaxed COVID-19 restrictions allow more people to hit the town a drop in the number of ride-hailing drivers in Las Vegas has frustrated visitors and residents trying to get a ride via Uber or Lyft.

Many have taken to social media to complain about long waits for rides or cancellations because of the drop in drivers available.

“@Uber and @lyft what happened to y’all bros?” Twitter user CurtiMart posted March 26. “I’m having to call a cab because you guys are basically non existent in Las Vegas now? Sad day.”

State data shows the number of active ride-hailing drivers across Nevada is less than half of what it was a year ago. As of March 30 there were 13723 active ride-hailing drivers across the state compared with the 36482 reported by the state on March 13 2020.

February’s number shows little changed month to month as there were 13759 active transportation network drivers reported by the state with 7751 Uber drivers and 6068 Lyft operators. That is a 62 percent decline compared with February 2020’s active-driver total of 36608.

The only comparable drop occurred in July 2018 when the number of active drivers in the state fell from over 80000 to just under 40000 after Uber amended its policy to require annual background checks on drivers.

“It’s common across the country right now that drivers are not actively participating that were (pre-pandemic)” said David Newton Nevada Transportation Authority commissioner.

There is no concrete evidence available but Newton suspects the drop could be tied to some drivers opting to receive unemployment benefits.

“The unemployment benefits may actually outstrip what they could earn as a driver right now with tourism numbers where they are” Newton said.

“I don’t know for certain but that definitely seems logical.”

Lyft said a big factor is that drivers can’t charge surge pricing even as demand increases because the state disallows the practice in times of emergency.

A company representative said “dynamic pricing” helps incentivize drivers to go to areas with increased demand. But since Nevada is under a state of emergency because of the pandemic that isn’t an option.

“We’re seeing big increases in demand for rides as vaccines roll out and people get ready to start moving again” a Lyft spokesperson said in a statement. “We are working hard to meet demand; however due to Nevada’s State of Emergency and regulation preventing transportation networking companies from incentivizing drivers there’s an impact on rider experience and driver earnings.”

Senate Bill 279 which was introduced March 18 in the Legislature would take away the Transportation Authority’s ability to set a maximum fare that ride-hailing companies can charge in an emergency with the heightened fees set to go directly to the drivers if passed.

Representatives from Uber did not respond to request for comment on the driver shortage.

In downtown Las Vegas the city opened a parking garage to cater to Uber drivers picking up and dropping off passengers. But city spokeswoman Natasha Shahani said that only about 250 drivers have signed up to use the garage since it opened ahead of St. Patrick’s Day weekend.

Circa Resort’s Garage Mahal reported seeing an uptick in customers complaining about wait times and cancellations for Uber and Lyft pickups. That frustration sometimes turns to blaming Circa’s staff.

“Lately in Garage Mahal especially on peak days Friday Saturday Sunday and Monday upon checkout time there’s higher wait times due to shortage of cabs and Ubers” said Danny Suy valet lead for Circa. “We try to accommodate the guests by going into the streets to find cabs calling the cab companies. When using Uber the wait times are longer (than usual) and the guests get frustrated at our team where we have no control over cabs or the Ubers and the wait times.”

In the Thursday ruling mediators found that Uber drivers must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or else the company is liable.

That’s the case even though most drivers operate as independent contractors the ruling said.

Arbitrators awarded Lisa Irving between $4000 and $75000 in damages for each incident of discrimination depending on the severity of the bias for a direct payment of $324000. She was also awarded more than $800000 for legal costs.

In one of the most severe incidents a driver stole Irving’s phone and filed a false police report against her according to the ruling.

In another a driver tried to kick her “out of his car at least fifteen times at one point pulling over to demand she get out in a dangerous area making her feel helpless by his

intimidation and threats” the legal document said.

Irving also lost her job after twice being denied rides and missing work arbitrators said.

“I felt demeaned humiliated devalued embarrassed angered frustrated and violated” she said in a video statement.

Irving’s lawyers filed a petition to confirm the reward in San Francisco Superior Court on Thursday a release stated.

They said they believed the award was the largest given to a blind passenger for ADA violations.

An Uber spokesperson told CNN Business they disagreed with the award.

“We are proud Uber’s technology has helped people who are blind obtain rides and regret Ms. Irving’s experience” the spokesperson said.

“Drivers using the Uber app are expected to serve riders with service animals and comply with accessibility and other laws and we regularly provide education to drivers on that responsibility.

Lisa Irving a San Francisco resident won the judgement in a binding arbitration ruling after Uber drivers repeatedly refused her service over her Golden Retriever service dog named Bernie.

Uber strongly disagrees with the ruling after the arbitrator rejected the company's argument that its drivers are independent contractors and it is not responsible for their conduct.

The case went to arbitration rather than a civil court because all Uber users agree to binding arbitration to settle disputes as part of Uber's terms of service.

Lisa Irving (left) won a $1.1M binding arbitration ruling after Uber drivers repeatedly refused her service over her Golden Retriever service dog named Bernie (right)

'I'm sorry it came to this' Irving told the San Francisco Chronicle about the case. 'I would have preferred that my civil rights be respected. But it sends a strong message that this is not acceptable and (entities that discriminate) will be held accountable for their actions until they change.'

In arbitration filings Irving told how Uber drivers repeatedly left her stranded ruining a birthday celebration and causing her to miss a Christmas Eve church service.

The incidents also caused her to miss appointments for her work as a liaison to people with mental health challenges she said.

'It was telling me I don't belong; that I don't have a right to live my life on my own terms and do the same things any other individual would have the autonomy to decide to do' Irving said.

The Americans With Disabilities Act has strict prohibitions against refusing service to blind individuals who make use of guide dogs.

The arbitrator awarded Irving $324000 in damages plus legal expenses of $805313.

Uber said that it disagreed with the ruling saying that its drivers are not employees.

'We are proud Uber's technology has helped people who are blind locate and obtain rides' Uber told the Chronicle.

'Drivers using the Uber app are expected to serve riders with service animals and comply with accessibility and other laws and we regularly provide education to drivers on that responsibility.'

Uber said it prohibits discrimination and requires its drivers to transport service animals and comply with all accessibility laws.

Irving's attorney said that it did not matter whether Uber drivers are gig workers or formal employees of the company.

'The arbitrator said it's irrelevant whether they are independent contractors or employees — Uber is on the hook under the ADA' attorney Cat Cabalo told the Chronicle.

'They are providing a transportation service to the public. The ADA has very strict requirements on allowing service dogs to travel with people they assist.'"

BOARDMAN Ohio – Peaberry’s Café will move to the shopping center where it started nearly three decades ago.

The coffee shop and restaurant is shooting for a June 1 grand opening at its new location in The Shops at Boardman Park according to co-owner Chris Pendleton. Work is getting underway at the new location which is the site of the former Panera at the front of the shopping plaza near Old Navy.

Peaberry’s first opened in 1993 in The Shops at Boardman Park in the location that is now Ulta Beauty Store and Hair Salon. The restaurant later moved to 4350 Boardman Canfield Road in Canfield Township.

Current owners Pendleton and his wife Amy bought the restaurant from the Cole family in 2017. They closed it March 14.

The new location in The Shops at Boardman Park is better than the old one Pendleton said mainly because of accessibility.

“There is no traffic light [at the old location on U.S. route 224] and with the sheer volume of traffic if you’re going in the other direction it’s hard to turn” he said. The Dunkin location across the street is more convenient to morning commuters headed east and seeking coffee he pointed out.

Access will be easier at the Boardman location Pendleton said and the shopping center already has a lot of foot traffic.

The old building also had physical limitations “that made it too difficult to update and led to a less than perfect experience for customers” he said. Pendleton also said his lease was due to end this year on the old site and he got a good lease arrangement on the new location.

Although the old location was also a restaurant-coffee shop Pendeleton plans to spend up to $200000 to renovate and rearrange the floor plan to make it flow better for workers and customers. The kitchen will also need to be changed because Peaberry’s does more scratch cooking he said.

The seating capacity of the new site will be 85 which is about the same as the old location. Pendleton said there will also be patio seating.

Running a restaurant was “a retirement dream” for Pendleton and his wife. He was a manager for CSX Transportation and worked at the railroad’s Lordstown facility.

“We moved our retirement up [to buy Peaberry’s]” he said. His wife is a teacher but her family owned a restaurant and she “grew up in it” Pendleton said.

After moving eight times in a 24-year span the Pendletons are happy to reinforce their roots in Boardman where they live now. Moving Peaberry’s to The Shops at Boardman Park is part of that effort.

Plus Pendleton said he likes the nostalgia of it.

“I’m a traditional kind of guy” he said. “I like being in the same plaza where it started.”

Later this spring Napa Grocery will open in the former Peaberry’s location in Canfield. Napa Grocery is a locally owned gourmet market that specializes in prepared foods pizza sandwiches specialty groceries and wine in a cafe setting.

Why Trust Us?

After swearing off makeup in 2016 Alicia Keys now sees it as a form of expression.

She shared her 10-minute makeup routine in a video with Allure.

She calls it a “light and easy” “get ready real fast” routine.

In 2016 Alicia Keys very publicly swore off makeup because she felt she was becoming “addicted” to it. In other words she didn’t feel comfortable without it on. That moment encouraged women everywhere to embrace their natural beauty but since then the has realized that makeup can absolutely be a form of expression.

“I’m not a slave to makeup. I’m not a slave to NOT wearing makeup either” she told Allure in 2017. “I get to choose at [any] given moment. That’s my right.”

Now the 40-year-old has found a welcome balance in her beauty regimen and she recently shared the “light and easy” routine in a video with Allure. This is how Alicia Keys “get[s] ready real fast” when she chooses to wear makeup.

She starts by prepping her skin.

Keys gets her skin ready for makeup by first cleansing and then misting with her own Keys Soul Care . “Skincare to me is like a ritual. It’s a really special time with yourself to just kind of give yourself some love” she said. She sprays the mist “as many times as I want” and it leaves her with a hydrated fresh-faced glow. (Not to mention it smells incredible.)

Then she goes in with her  which contains ceramides hyaluronic acid and bakuchiol a plant-based retinol alternative. While applying it Keys says she likes “hitting my face” to promote blood circulation.

Then she adds a pop of color.

Keys doesn’t “want to fuss” with makeup. She prefers to keep it “low key” which is why is ideal. With an orange shade and her fingertips she applies a small amount to her cheeks under the eyes and along her hairline “to give the illusion that we’ve been in the sun all weekend.”

Next is not-so-typical eyeliner.

Using the Diorshow Stylo Waterproof Eyeliner in matte blue Keys lightly lines her top waterline just halfway in from the outer corner. “It still looks super natural” she said. That’s why she prefers to stay away from dark black liners and instead goes for blue brown and even green. “These kinda colors I find that they do a little trick to your eyes” she explained.

Lastly she applies mascara.

The go-to is Chanel Le Volume de Chanel Waterproof in brun. She applies it as heavily or as lightly as she’s feeling in the mood for that day. “To me that’s what beauty is. Beauty is complementing your mood. It’s an accessory for you to express” she said. “However you wanna do it is right.”

At the end of the video Keys encouraged viewers to take the extra time to establish a regular self-care routine whether it includes makeup or not. “Taking care of yourself gives you a really beautiful boost of self-confidence” she said. “I love the practice of getting used to loving on myself.”

Why Trust Us?

Lizzo is not shy that's a fact. Whether it be about her body her political views or even ripping off a nipple cover (yes really) she's shared it on social. Which is why it's a little surprising that until a recent interview with The New York Times she hadn't shared much about her beauty routine.

You would never guess by looking at her but it turns out the 32-year-old singer actually had to go through ""skin rehab"" as she described in NYT because her skin started freaking out after not washing her makeup off before bed one too many times. That interview was in the fall of 2019 and judging by her most recent images from the Grammys it looks like she got all of her skin troubles worked out.

Here's exactly what her strict skincare regimen entails now including products she uses at home as well as the ones her makeup artist swears by to get her glowing before a big red carpet moment. It's probably safe to assume she's no longer going to bed with her makeup on either.

She wakes her skin up with spring water.

But not anything fancy—just good old H2O. ""Water is really important for face and hair. I go to the bathroom and believe or not hit myself with some Evian spray to the face"" she told the NYT.

She dermaplanes her face before the red carpet.

Lizzo's makeup artist Alexx Mayo shared that he used the on the singer before the 2021 Grammys. In a post on his Instagram he shared that ""it’s best way to get rid of any dead skin cells and peach fuzz for the smoothest foundation application.""

She’s a believer in Sunday Riley skincare.

Lizzo shared with NYT that she went to Mayo with her skin dilemma and said ""I really have to get serious about my skincare"" and he recommended the Sunday Riley skincare line. Which products in particular? All of them! ""I have the whole Sunday Riley system now. I don’t mix systems"" she told NYT. ""I would mix if I felt like it but if it works for me I don’t mess with it.""

But she uses Charlotte Tilbury for red carpet prep.

For the 2021 Grammys Mayo shared that he used a slew of Charlotte Tilbury skincare products to prep the singer's skin. The lineup included the     and .

She uses a face oil instead of highlighter.

She used to use a highlighter on her days off but now she says she doesn't need to because ""I’ve been using the  and I think that works better"" she told NYT."

To alleviate some of the pressure on delivery there are a few things that retailers can consider to ensure they’re doing everything in their power to get orders to customers quickly and efficiently.

Implement BOPIS and curbside pickup as an alternative to at-home delivery

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought buy-online/pick-up-in-store (BOPIS) and curbside pickup into the spotlight and consumers expect that these services will be offered for the long-term. In fact according to a CommerceHub consumer survey more than 75% of those who subscribe to multiple delivery services said they were still likely to opt for curbside delivery once the pandemic subsides.

Many large retailers have embraced these services and have worked hard to make them convenient contactless and safe for consumers. This past Valentine’s Day was the first time many small and local businesses began implementing in-store and curbside pickup to alleviate the pressure on delivery orders.

Offer perks and rewards for later delivery time slots

If curbside pickup and BOPIS aren’t viable options there are other ways to take the pressure off of delivery including offering perks or rewards for longer delivery times.

Retailers can offer incentives that ultimately help take the stress off of their supply chain while saving money by avoiding expedited shipping costs.

Get creative to ensure delivery

Collaborating on the last leg of delivery with gig economy drivers can help companies increase efficiency and improve the customer experience.

Retailers should be looking at implementing a delivery platform for retail items to help fulfill deliveries in the last-mile. Although this tactic may not replace the need for larger delivery resources retailers across the country should be looking at these options to help ensure orders can be delivered successfully.

Consider the upsides of drop shipping

Drop shipping is the ultimate resource when it comes to helping retailers and ecommerce businesses meet customer expectations. The digital nature of drop shipping allows sellers to optimize their supply chain by expanding product offerings while also ensuring that deliveries are made quickly. According to a study from the Institute of Supply Chain Management 75% of companies have experienced supply chain disruptions in some capacity related to Coronavirus-related transportation issues. Drop shipping is a key tool that retailers can utilize to help ease that risk.

Retailers can ensure that their business is set up for success by working with partners that have access to an on-demand supply chain vast distribution networks to support fulfillment closer to a customer’s location utilizing loyalty programs and implementing services based on convenience (local last-mile delivery options BOPIS and curbside pickup) all of which can result in the best experience for customers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbmFseXplLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0L3JldmVyc2UtbG9naXN0aWNzLWFpLXJldGFpbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reverse Logistics Company Uses AI to Find Value in Retail,"While “Retail Apocalypse” would no doubt make a great sequel to the iconic movie “Apocalypse Now” – with Martin Sheen reprising his role as Capt. Willard trying to navigate his way through the dangerous modern day Mekong of the American mall – the term actually refers to the collapse of brick-and-mortar stores. More than 100 retailer chains including iconic names like Sears and JC Penney have filed for bankruptcy since 2015.

While most fingers point at Amazon (AMZN) as the primary culprit behind the destruction of the American strip mall Main Street America the retail apocalypse is another example of evolve or die. Margins are tight so companies looking to survive are searching for ways to eke out value anywhere along the supply chain. One emerging avenue is through something called reverse logistics.

What is the Cost of Reverse Logistics?

One definition of reverse logistics is that it covers everything that happens to a widget after the sale. In most cases it simply refers to the processing of returned items from ugly Christmas sweaters to that cubic zirconia diamond engagement after you caught your future bride-to-be with your ex-best friend. In other words the reverse of buying is returning and it applies in both traditional retail and e-commerce. There’s even a Reverse Logistics Association (who knew?) that represents this sector of the industry supply chain.

Returns cost retailers $428 billion in 2020 alone representing more than 10% of all U.S. retail sales according to the National Retail Federation. The problem is even bigger for e-commerce where online returns more than doubled last year from 2019 – about 18% or $102 billion was sent back out of the $565 billion of stuff purchased online in 2020.

Of course there are other knock-on effects of returned merchandise such as the loss of state sales tax and more worthless crap ending up in landfills. And those costs don’t account for the reverse logistics machinery required to process manage and dispense all of that unwanted stuff back into the supply channel in some form or fashion.

Sounds like a problem in need of automation through machine-learning algorithms. Let’s talk about Optoro and its SmartDisposition technology.

Reverse Logistics Using AI

Founded in 2010 the Washington D.C.-based startup has raised $244.4 million which doesn’t include an undisclosed investment by a small artisanal Swedish meatball maker called IKEA. The international retailer also announced in December 2019 a partnership to implement Optoro’s returns optimization technology in 10 IKEA distribution centers 50 retail stores and the Customer Support Center in the United States. Other noteworthy investor names attached to Optoro include venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Revolution (the latter has participated in eight rounds if you include its growth-stage arm) investment firm and DGI darling Franklin Templeton (BEN) and the United Parcel Service (UPS) among others.

So what kind of reverse logistics platform can you build with a quarter of a billion dollars?

Optoro’s SmartDisposition platform “leverages machine learning alongside customizable business logic to understand demand for each returned unit and route it to its most profitable channel.” In other words the algorithms figure out if the item can just be re-shelved or shuffled off to an off-price retailer (the sort of place where Quasimodo might shop for swimwear). The widget could also land on Amazon or eBay as well as Optoro’s own eCommerce land for misfit toys called BULQ which features merchandise from companies like Groupon and Target. Another option is a tax-deductible thrift store donation.

A key component of the system is the company’s Dynamic Pricing Engine which “uses key data inputs alongside client-specific business goals to estimate SKU-level demand curves price elasticities and optimal market pricing.” The dynamic pricing algorithms reportedly analyze daily sales on every item then alter unit-level remarketing prices based on actual market demand. It looks something like this:

Optoro partnered with a San Francisco-based startup last year on the customer-facing end of the returns platform. Founded in 2014 Returnly has raised about $30 million in funding to date to develop tech focused on reverse logistics for eCommerce customers. The platform also employs machine-learning algorithms to make real-time returns policy decisions which the company claims saves its clients money on expenses associated with reverse logistics while building customer loyalty at the same time. Proprietary shopper data product type return score return value shipping variables and the merchant’s own business rules feed into Returnly’s algorithm.

Use Cases for Optoro’s Reverse Logistics Solutions

The real question of course is whether Optoro is returning value on returning merchandise. Let’s look at some use cases.

An undisclosed online marketplace for home remodeling and design employed Optoro to automate eCommerce returns routing goods directly from customers to Optoro’s B2B BULQ marketplace (a B2C version called BLINQ appears to be defunct even though it’s still mentioned on the website). Optoro says more than 91% of the retailer’s returns have been resold via Optoro’s proprietary resale channels and the program has increased net recovery (versus cost) by more than 150%. Further tweaks to the partnership over time have seen the exception rate for returns drop by more than 55%. The net recovery rate for the program also increased by 25% from year one to year two.

Optoro also has partnerships with companies like eBay and Groupon. For example the former program is called BULQ on eBay which allows sellers to purchase and resell liquidation lots on the eBay marketplace. Once the lot is purchased sellers pull product information from the lots and create individual listings to edit review and publish directly to their eBay store. Groupon has been a partner for about five years with Optoro handling the reverse logistics at the company’s Groupon Goods business which generates about $1 billion in annual sales.

There’s also an environmental angle to all of this that should please ESG-type investors. For instance Optoro claims its technology helped clients keep 96% of returned and excess inventory out of landfills in 2020:

IKEA in particular is all about projecting a do-gooder corporate persona. In 2019 for example the retailer resold 38 million products through its As-Is specialty shop with a goal of being fully “circular” by 3030 – meaning nothing goes to waste. Optoro figures to play an outsized role such as routing more than 3000 lbs of products from four IKEA stores to Goodwill in 2020. The program is expected to include all 50 U.S. IKEA mega-churches of retail in the future.

Conclusion

We first profiled Optoro almost exactly two years ago in our article about inventory management systems and the company seems to have created one of the leading solutions for reverse logistics since then. Other customers include Best Buy Staples and Bed Bath & Beyond among others. It appears to be a solid business model on the surface though we wonder how the potential softening of consumerism in the United States could affect the long-term health of this model.

Millennials are more interested in avocado toast than acquiring stuff to fill high-rent apartments that they share with three other people. The pandemic helped further unleash workers from their offices allowing many to be mobile and work in Mumbai if they want. The retail apocalypse may not entirely be Amazon’s fault as we (anecdotally at least) see something of a shift in consumption that no longer supports the Sears Roebuck catalog of yesteryear. However the $12.5 trillion Americans spent in 2020 (down $500 billion from the year before because of you-know-what) on durable and nondurable goods and services will only tick up if only due to population growth. But how those dollars are spent is changing and we’ll see if Optoro’s algorithms can keep up.

How do you get money?,"Biden signed $10B in mortgage help for homeowners. How do you get money?

The latest COVID relief package signed into law by President Joe Biden sets aside billions for homeowners struggling to make their mortgage payments and other bills related to owning a home.

Over 10 million Americans are currently behind on their mortgages and feeling ""housing insecurity"" according to census data. If you're in that group and have been piling up debt how do you claim some of the money?

It’s likely to take many months for the funds to get into the hands of those who need it largely because of the way it’s being disbursed experts warn.

How to qualify for the relief

The recent $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package that's now paying out stimulus checks of up to $1400 includes nearly $10 billion of direct financial assistance to help homeowners pay not only their mortgages but also taxes utilities insurance and homeowners association dues.

The money formally called the Homeowners Assistance Fund will be distributed to states based on a formula that takes into account unemployed residents as well as late mortgage payments and foreclosures says the National Council of State Housing Agencies.

You’re eligible for relief if you own your home and have a loan with a principal balance at or below the conforming loan limits set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the government-sponsored mortgage giants that buy or guarantee most U.S. home loans. The 2021 loan limit in most parts of the U.S. is $548250.

The money will be funneled to cash-strapped borrowers through state housing agencies. At least 60% of the state grants must go to homeowners with incomes that don't exceed either the local median income or the national median income whichever is higher.

Getting the money may take time

Russell Graves executive director of the National Foundation for Debt Management a multistate housing counseling agency says he doesn’t expect the funds to be made available until early 2022.

“There are so many other things going through these agencies: rental assistance different kinds of pandemic assistance” Graves says. “Frankly we have never put so much money toward housing in history. The numbers are staggering.”

Homeowners need help. The latest U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey shows 7.4% of adults — an estimated 10.1 million people — are not current on their rent or mortgage payments and have ""slight or no confidence"" they'll be able to pay next month’s rent or mortgage on time.

During the wait forbearance will be key

Graves recommends that homeowners in need call their lenders or servicers — the companies that manage loans and send out statements — to discuss options including beginning or extending forbearance.

Story continues

Forbearance allows you to postpone your mortgage payments without getting slammed with late fees or taking a hit to your credit score. (Haven't seen your score in a while? Today you can easily check your credit score for free.)

Those with federally backed loans — some 70% of the U.S. mortgage population — have been able to apply for forbearance in the pandemic. The deferred payments are typically tacked onto the end of the mortgage term. The enrollment window for forbearance was recently extended and now ends June 30.

If you're in the other 30% you don’t have the same flexibility Graves says. He suggests calling a housing counseling agency approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Congress has provided $100 million so those agencies can assist homeowners.

Refinancing may be your remedy

Another possible remedy for overwhelming housing expenses is to refinance your mortgage if you haven't already done so.

Mortgage rates remain historically low so the mortgage technology and data provider Black Knight recently reported that 11.1 million homeowners are still in a good position to refinance — and cut their monthly mortgage payments by an average $277.

But you'd have to determine whether you're likely to stay in the home long enough for the savings to more than pay off the new loan's closing costs which typically run anywhere from 2% to 5% of your loan amount.

If the math wouldn't work forbearance and Homeowners Assistance Fund money may provide the relief you need.

Hopes for a smooth mortgage aid process

Graves says the closest example to the new mortgage aid program was an Obama-era plan created in response to the Great Recession. The ""Hardest Hit Fund"" was designed to assist the states hit hardest by the subprime lending crisis.

The federal government funneled the funds through each state’s housing agency then too. But there were challenges.

""It was done by the states in fits and starts. There were a lot of states that got a very slow start and tripped over themselves because this was new"" Graves says.

He hopes the rollout will be smoother this time: ""Since this is similar there should be some institutional knowledge in each of these state housing finance agencies so they can take their original programs and tweak them to match the current environment.""

What if you need help immediately?

If your housing expenses are piling up and squeezing your budget there are some ways you can give yourself some financial breathing room right now long before any aid comes your way.

If you’ve been using credit cards for most of your purchases during the pandemic and are watching the interest charges escalate you could replace those pricey balances with a single debt consolidation loan at a lower interest rate.

Or try reducing your homeowners insurance premiums by shopping around for a better dea when your policy comes up for renewal. The same comparison shopping approach works well for saving on car insurance.

A release from the government seems to state the affirmative which indicated that the implementation of such a programme will mark a major milestone in the island’s health care system.

Health Planner in the Department of Health & Wellness Lauren James explains that the first phase of the NHI system will include an essential package of health services at the Primary care level geared at tackling non-communicable diseases.

“What this will attempt to do is have persons access healthcare when they need it without having to think about hey do I have money to pay for this do I have money to pay for that. So in that way persons can be more pro-active about their health by seeking care when they need it. In the first phase we are looking at a package of services where we are targeting more or less chronic diseases which have been affecting the country at large for example diabetes hypertension we have the screening for cancer and other care areas” he said.

National Health Insurance is a means to achieve universal health coverage in St. Lucia meaning all people have access to the health services they need when they need them without enduring any financial hardship or paying for health care out of pocket.

“What we envision is persons paying a premium every month or every year. They would access health care and not have to pay out of pocket. Normally as it stands right now I have an insurance package and I would have to pay for the service out of pocket and then claim from my insurance company. What we are looking for is to move away from that to have the insurance companies reimburse the providers so that is the method where you pay your premium and then whenever you need the care you access and don’t pay” James said.

The development of National Health Insurance is a component of the Health System Strengthening Project funded by the World Bank.

This raises several disparity issues in healthcare decision making in Uganda but also it presents an opportunity for us to review the triage emergency care system and other key decisions that affect the time to surgery in our hospitals.

The golden hour in medicine for which immediate appropriate care is required is very important. Many times this is the thin line between life or death or even surviving but life-long morbidity and complications.

From our research conducted in several East African hospitals from 2012 we present several opportunities to improve surgical outcomes in the East African region. The World Federation of Anaesthesiologists saw the importance of this work and I won their 2013 research award. The reports have been widely disseminated and presented in local and international meetings and in 2015 Anaesthesia was recognised by the World Health Assembly as an essential component of Universal Health Care planning.

The Lancet commission on surgery also made recommendations for Anaesthesiologists based on population in several countries reporting that five billion people worldwide lack access to safe surgery when needed. In East Africa safe Anaesthesia guidelines have recently been launched in Kenya and Tanzania. Particularly in Uganda we identified countrywide shortages in Anaesthesiologists essential drugs equipment and paucity of local protocols. While some steps have been taken to buy anaesthesia equipment high-flow oxygen is frequently lacking in several centres.

The presence of a strong Anaesthesiology and Critical Care team including access to an operational intensive care unit is vital in all referral hospitals to reduce the delays in care but also to ensure that the great work by the surgeons is not lost by a death on table during an ongoing complex surgery or during the immediate post-operative period.

It is also paramount that we strengthen all regional referral hospitals to provide appropriate intra-operative and post-operative care including adequate oxygen capacity and availability of emergency medications equipment and trained personnel.

While this baby has successfully come out of the surgery appropriate care during this immediate post-operative period is very critical.

We applaud the team at Soroti Hospital but we probably need more than just oxygen saturation. Could this child benefit from blood cultures or arterial blood gases or serum lactate tests these are essential things to monitor post-operatively.

Putting all politics aside could this surviving child be given the opportunity of appropriate emergency care just in-case the current stable post-operative state changes? Could the hospital management government and other public-private partners organise an emergency evacuation to a neonatal critical care unit? This decision to move after the surgery should not be made by Soroti nor Mulago Hospital management but rather ethically through an informed decision session with the parents of the baby.

May this surviving twin live to celebrate her first birthday and be a candle to light several other candles for Uganda and all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to develop clear systems of triage emergency care and referral.

Now is the time for us to set specific goals with timelines in order to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals so that all Ugandans can have an equal chance to live through a Universal Health Care system. We need a strong political commitment to implement these international goals here and ensure that all Ugandans can access safe surgery and safe anaesthesia

When Jordan Spieth is in his happy place there’s constant chatter nervous fan interaction eye rolls and aw-shucks head shaking.

Suffice to say all of these were on display during the third round of the Valero Texas Open as the former University of Texas star was smack dab in his favorite spot — leading a golf tournament in his home state.

Spieth dug himself out of some tricky scenarios as only he can weaving his way to a 31 on the back nine at TPC San Antonio’s Oaks Course and pushing into a tie for the lead with Matt Wallace at 12 under.

Valero Texas Open: Leaderboard | Yardage book

Perhaps his most magnificent escape came on No. 17 when he followed a 334-yard drive into a collection area by opening the face on a wedge and hitting a full flop shot to 30 inches. Spieth tapped in the short birdie putt and rolled his head as if to admit he’d just pulled a Houdini.

“So I guess my ball got onto the cart path and then ran to the end of it. You can miss that tee shot right if you want all day and it stays short of pin high and it’s a pretty easy up and down to that pin. So I was in a tough spot” he said of the escapade on the second-to-last hole. “Got a drop from the cart path and just ended up on some kind of hardpan stuff. I was looking to lay up way to the left and then walked up to the green and saw that that was just as difficult as going at the hole so I figured may as well go to the hole in case I pull the shot off.

“I think I told Wally it was like a one in 10 but it was maybe like a one in five. It’s kind of like a half-long bunker shot almost. For it to go the right distance is certainly fortunate but I was just trying to make four and got a bonus out of it.”

For the first time in what has seemed like forever — between a prolonged slump and the pandemic — the day’s biggest crowds were following Spieth all along the Greg Norman design chirping at nearly every shot and spurring him on.

After a warm reception in Austin for last week’s WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play Spieth is feeling the love not only of his home state but from Tour fans who haven’t seen him win since 2017’s Open Championship. And while winning a second green jacket would be the ultimate prize Spieth insisted he’s only looking at the next 24 hours.

“Winning here would be … I mean winning a PGA Tour event is a very very difficult thing to do and I’ve certainly been humbled in that process over the last few years. First I’m focused on this week always have been. I haven’t thought ahead whatsoever” Spieth said. “I thought the best prep for next week is to work yourself into contention and just kind of see where all facets of the game are under pressure. I got quite a bit of that today to test out and hopefully make some improvements for tomorrow.”

He’ll face stern competition from Wallace who matched his 67 on Saturday and also stands at 12 under and Charley Hoffman who fired a 65 and is just two back of the leaders.

But either way he’s simply happy to be in the hunt twitching and chortling as only he can showing his anxiety like no other player does.

“Trust me I feel the nerves even when you’re not playing well because sometimes you’re even more nervous because you don’t know where the damn ball’s going to go” Spieth said. “It’s nice feeling comfortable under pressure I think that’s the most important thing. You start doing it more often and you feel more comfortable under pressure and that’s kind of why we play the game at this level that’s what’s fun for us.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

En virtud de un acuerdo por valor de 420 millones de dólares la compañía estadounidense especializada en fabricación y venta de bicicletas estáticas para uso doméstico aumenta su capacidad productiva.

Precor se convierte en una división de Peloton y el actual presidente de Precor Rob Barker pasa a ser consejero delegado de Precor y director general de Peloton Commercial reportando directamente a William Lynch presidente de Peloton.

Peloton logró ventas récord durante 2020 pero las interrupciones en la cadena de suministro como consecuencia de la pandemia del coronavirus se tradujeron en problemas de suministro de material deportivo en todos los mercados en los que la compañía opera.

El fuerte impulso de las ventas generó problemas a la compañía provocando largos tiempos de espera por parte de los clientes. En este sentido la compra de Precor permitirá a Peloton mejorar sus tiempos de entrega en el mercado estadounidense.

En concreto Peloton ganará 58.000 metros cuadrados de la capacidad de producción de Precor en Whitsett (Carolina del Norte) y Woodinville (Washington).

Con esta adquisición la compañía planea “establecer la capacidad productiva en Estados Unidos impulsar las capacidades e investigación y desarrollo (I+D) y acelerar la penetración de Peloton en el mercado comercial”. La adquisición se anunció el pasado diciembre pero no se ha concretado hasta ahora.

William Lynch presidente de Peloton asegura que “es un hito importante para Peloton y nuestra comunidad global”. “Hemos pasado los últimos meses aprendiendo más sobre el incansable enfoque de Precor en la experiencia del cliente y ahora estamos aún más entusiasmados por dar la bienvenida a Peloton a este talentoso equipo” añade. “Estamos aún mejor posicionados para lograr nuestro objetivo de brindar la mejor experiencia en salud y estado físico conectado a más personas en todo el mundo” sentencia.

Peloton espera dar respuesta al incremento de la demanda con la compra de Precor

Los ingresos de la compañía en el segundo trimestre de su ejercicio fiscal de 2021 (finalizado en diciembre) fueron de 1.0648 millones de dólares importe que supone un crecimiento del 128%. Este resultado se ha producido por el crecimiento de su segmento Connected Fitness que ha supuesto unos ingresos de 8701 millones de dólares con crecimiento del 124% en comparación con el año anterior y un 82% de la facturación.

A finales de marzo el grupo estadounidense de equipamiento de home fitness dio nuevos pasos en su proceso de crecimiento con la compra de tres start ups especializadas en diferentes tecnologías: Aquido dedicada al desarrollo de asistentes de voz mediante inteligencia artificial; Atlas Wearables fabricante de relojes inteligentes para fitness y Otari un desarrollador de colchonetas para hacer ejercicios equipadas con pantallas para proveer comentarios en tiempo real.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpcmVjdG9yaW9jdWJhbm8uaW5mby9wYW5vcmFtYS9ldGVjc2EtdmVudGEtZGUtc2VydmljaW9zLXktcHJvZHVjdG9zLWVuLXVzZC1nYXJhbnRpemEtcmVhYmFzdGVjaW1pZW50by_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlvY3ViYW5vLmluZm8vcGFub3JhbWEvZXRlY3NhLXZlbnRhLWRlLXNlcnZpY2lvcy15LXByb2R1Y3Rvcy1lbi11c2QtZ2FyYW50aXphLXJlYWJhc3RlY2ltaWVudG8vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Etecsa: “venta de servicios y productos en USD garantiza reabastecimiento”,"Clientes de la Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba S.A. han reclamado el desabastecimiento de sus productos y que la poca disponibilidad se comercialice en dólares americanos.

Etecsa ha sumado un nuevo debate en Twitter cuando un cliente le ha manifestado que “es preocupante el total desabastecimiento en todos los sentidos y que lo poco que hay sea en dólares”.

“Otro año así no vamos a poder aguantar” concluyó el usuario.

La compañía de telecomunicaciones de Cuba ha intentado defenderse alegando que “la venta de servicios y productos en USD garantiza su reaprovisionamiento al ser mayormente importados”.

Además refiere se asegura el “abastecimiento de estos productos en la red de ventas y no se afectan las inversiones requeridas para el desarrollo de la infraestructura de telecomunicaciones”.

El intercambio no quedó en esa respuesta. El cliente expresó que “si venden en USD solo benefician a un grupito”.

“Un país socialista no puede ser así pero además de esto siguen sus puntos de venta desabastecidos venden muy pocos móviles y se acaban rápido no hay abastecimiento garantizado” comentó para echar por tierra los argumentos de Etecsa.

Otro usuario se sumó a la conversación indicando que “al final no se justifica el por qué no existe ni un sólo terminal en CUP a la venta. Pues nadie en este país cobra en USD”.

Uno de esos servicios de ventas en USD son las promociones internacionales que realiza la compañía hasta dos veces al mes.

Aunque se desconocen las cifras exactas del ingreso de divisas de Etecsa por ese concepto uno de los reclamos de los clientes es que coloquen estas ofertas en pesos cubanos y que las personas puedan aprovecharlas desde Cuba.

En este sentido la compañía ha afirmado que sus promociones de recarga internacional también funcionan en Cuba pero con tarjetas en Moneda Libremente Convertible (MLC).

Los interesados en usar esta opción tampoco podrían hacerlo de manera online deberán acudir a una oficina comercial para informarse al respecto.

Es decir aunque exista la posibilidad de recargar móviles en Cuba desde dentro de la isla el requisito de hacerlo a través de tarjetas MLC es otra vía más de entrada de divisas para Etecsa que no se traduce en abastecimiento de productos y nuevos servicios en pesos cubanos.

Recordemos que las tarjetas MLC son recargadas en su mayoría desde el exterior de Cuba a través del envío de remesas o transferencias de dinero a familiares en Cuba.

En agosto de 2020 la vicepresidenta de Operaciones de Red de Etecsa anunciaba que “como parte de la estrategia para aumentar significativamente los teléfonos en la banda de frecuencia de 4G se suma Etecsa a las ventas MLC lo que permitirá la evolución de teléfonos en los años siguientes para acompañar el salto a 4G”.

La propia compañía invitaba a consultar la web http://www.etecsa.cu o llamar a través del 118 para obtener más información al respecto.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYW5hY2lvbi5jb20uYXIvZWNvbm9taWEvbmVnb2Npb3MvYW55bWFya2V0LWVsLW51ZXZvLWh1Yi1kZS1tYXJrZXRwbGFjZXMtcXVlLWxsZWdvLXBhcmEtZXhwYW5kaXItbGFzLXZlbnRhcy1vbmxpbmUtbmlkMDMwNDIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anymarket el nuevo hub de marketplaces que llegó para expandir las ventas online,"Fundada en Brasil hace seis años por DB1 Group Anymarket desembarcó en la Argentina para expandir las ventas online de las empresas que debieron hacer frente a una nueva cantidad de usuarios que compran productos y servicios por Internet.

Si fue un personaje real ¿Quién fue Cagancho? ¿Un actor de comedias que actuó en el famoso Corral de la ciudad manchega? ¿Un torero que toreó en su plaza? ¿Cuándo vivió? ¿De dónde proviene esa frase? ¿Cómo se popularizó y por qué?

Sin duda no hace referencia al mítico caballo de rejoneo de ese nombre que tanta gloria dio a su propietario Pablo de Hermoso de Mendoza a finales del siglo pasado.

Descubrí que Cagancho fue un personaje real. Era el apodo familiar de Joaquín Rodríguez homónimo del diestro “Costillares” pero de segundo apellido Ortega nacido en Sevilla en el barrio de Triana el 17 de febrero de 1903. Gitano hijo de una cigarrera y un herrero y nieto de un cantaor de flamenco.

Respecto del apodo se han dado muchas y variadas versiones. Las malolientes de la prensa taurina catalana (entre otros escritos: “Porque vamos francamente / ese apodo impertinente/ es una ofensa al olfato / por lo nuevo y maloliente / no le cuadra dignamente / a un artista de boato.” ). Las de que sus antepasados herreros hacían ganchos para las romanas: “Ca gancho a dos reales”. La de que vendían ropa en mercadillos: “A real ca gancho”. Y la más extendida más amable y lírica de que se lo pusieron a su abuelo el cantaor en su juventud porque entonaba como un pájaro de Huelva el “cagancho” que canta de maravilla.

Primo de Francisco Vega de los Reyes Curro Puya el primer “Gitanillo de Triana” al que en 1931 vestido de ceniza y oro quitó la vida el toro Fandanguero en Madrid.

Aquel Cagancho gitano de ojos verdes se dedicó al arte del toreo debutando en público en 1923 en San Fernando (Cádiz) con novillos de Bohórquez. Un año después el 25 de julio de 1924 hizo la presentación oficial ante sus paisanos en la Real Maestranza de Sevilla en el transcurso de una modesta novillada nocturna. En Las Ventas lo hizo el 5 de agosto de 1926 con novillos del marqués de Villamarta cosechando un éxito rotundo. Tomó la alternativa el 17 de abril de 1927 en la plaza de Murcia siendo su padrino Rafael el Gallo con el Toro ""Orejillo"" de la ganadería de Carmen de Federico inaugurando ya el escándalo.

Entonces se escribió: “Ya es Cagancho matador / que el Gallo le dio cartel / y ya da en el redondel / el cañí como orador / el mitin mejor que aquél. / ¿Qué va a ser de este gitano?/ ¿será abismo cumbre o llano?/ Nadie lo sabe de fijo; / hoy por hoy es un arcano / mejor dicho: un acertijo.”

Confirmó la alternativa en Madrid el 22 de junio de ese año teniendo como padrino a Valencia II y de testigo a Lalanda con el toro ""Naranjo"" de María Montalvo. En esa temporada toreó 46 corridas en España con desigual fortuna y 10 en México. El día 7 de mayo de 1931 en el coso de la Villa y Corte nueve años después de que en ella muriera Granero caía herido de gravedad por un toro de Alipio Pérez-Tabernero que le infirió dos cornadas una en cada muslo no pudiendo volver a hacer el paseíllo hasta el día 2 de agosto en que reapareció en Cádiz. En la temporada de 1934 el 21 de octubre participó en la corrida oficial de inauguración de Las Ventas (Madrid) alternando con Belmonte y Lalanda obteniendo un gran triunfo y saliendo a hombros según nos cuenta Gregorio Corrochano en su crónica de ABC del 23 de octubre. En la de 1935 torea 30 corridas en España lidiando otras en América interrumpiendo la guerra su trayectoria taurina.

Y en las fiestas de Tomelloso de septiembre de 1933 como nos informa en este periódico (25 de marzo de 2021) Ángel Martín-Fontecha  el día 12 torearía nuestro Cagancho mano a mano con Manolo Bienvenida ganado de Domecq ofreciendo un espectáculo síntesis de su estilo: “dos avisos en su primer toro [y] terminó su actuación entre ovaciones y aplausos”. Por nuestra cuenta hemos encontrado que volvió a torear en la feria tomellosera de 1935 el 11 de septiembre toros de Santa Coloma en sustitución a El Estudiante alternando con Armillita y Curro Caro. En el primero a pesar de realizar una “faena valentona” cosechó pitos al matar de una estocada y tres descabellos resarciéndose en el cuarto al que muleteó “adornado” obteniendo ovación y oreja aunque resultaría eclipsado por la gran faena de Curro Caro al tercero que vio premiada con dos orejas rabo y vueltas. (La Libertad - Año XVII Número 4820 - 1935 septiembre 12 (12/09/1935) p. 4.)

Cagancho llegó a ser uno de los ídolos de la afición mejicana donde desde 1953 se quedó residiendo. Allí llegó a cortar ocho rabos entre los años 1932 y 1936. En la plaza del Toreo de México D.F. el 27 de diciembre de 1931 en corrida a beneficio de la Asociación de la Prensa toreó con Vicente Barrera Fermín Espinosa Armillita Chico y Alberto Balderas toros de Zotoluca. Se otorgaban la ""Medalla del Arte "" y la ""Medalla del Valor"". En el quinto toro hizo enloquecer al público con una faena tan sublime y pródiga en bellezas que luego de pinchar una vez y dejar un volapié de perfecta ejecución produjo el delirio; le concedieran las orejas y el rabo y por unánime aclamación la ""Medalla del Arte"". La del Valor fue para Vicente Barrera.

Santainés relata que lo vio torear en la Monumental de Barcelona el 7 de junio de 1942 donde hizo una magistral faena pero que un espectador comentó: “¡Qué buen toro le ha tocado a este torero!” a lo que Pepe Berard gran amigo de Cagancho respondió: “¡Que buen torero le ha tocado a ese toro!”.

Protagonizó varias películas: Pasión gitana (Díaz Morales 1945) Los amores de un torero (1945) ambas con Carmen Amaya y Ángel Garasa y trabajo en Santos el magnífico (Budd Boetticher 1955) junto a Antoni Quin.

Volvió a España casi a escondidas en los años 60. Decía que no quería que lo vieran viejo todas las mujeres que le amaron.

En México una vez retirado pasó apuros económicos. El presidente de la República López Mateos le nombró consejero de Gobierno para poder pagarle un sueldo a final de mes. En una reunión el consejero de Economía celoso por el trato de favor hacia el torero le preguntó en público: «Maestro ¿sabe usted inglés?» a lo que Cagancho respondió con total tranquilidad: ""Ni Dios lo permita"".

Falleció en la capital de Méjico el 1 de enero de 1984 a los 81 años víctima de un cancer de pulmón habiendo alternado con todas las figuras de las distintas épocas taurinas que se sucedieron durante su larga vida profesional desde Belmonte hasta Aparicio y Litri a quienes dio la alternativa.

Como otros toreros gitanos (Rafael Gómez “El Gallo” famoso por sus espantás Gitanillo de Triana Curro Romero Rafael de Paula) fue capaz en los ruedos de lo más alto y de lo más bajo. La superstición en un oficio como el del toreo en el que está en juego la vida ha influido enormemente en estos toreros artistas capaces de imprimir a su oficio la magia de su raza el sentimiento y la emoción irracionales lo más exquisito lo más genial y lo más heroico frente a lo más burdo lo más torpe y lo más cobarde.

Capaces unas veces de interpretar como escribiera Bergamín la más maravillosa “música callada su música para los ojos” o de provocar otras los más estridentes silbidos y las más sonoras y horrísonas broncas según las sensaciones que el toro les transmitía o creían percibir. Simplemente un “me miró mal” era suficiente para sembrar en ellos el pánico.

“Con suma facilidad pasaba de la sublimación de un arte exquisito al fracaso más grotesco de las cumbres más insospechadas al más profundo abismo” escribió de él Antonio Santainés Cirés.

Ya sabemos quién fue Cagancho pero ¿qué significa la frase y de dónde viene?

“Quedar como Cagancho en Almagro” es quedar fatal a la vista de todo el público porque así quedó Cagancho en agosto de 1927 el día 25 en la plaza de Almagro. Formaba terna con Antonio Márquez y Manuel del Pozo Rayito. Eran los toros de la ganadería de Pérez Tabernero. Como nos cuenta J. de la Morena en el tercero primero de los suyos salió a hacer un quite; el toro le desarmó haciendo volar la capa y el maestro salió corriendo hacia la barrera. Ahí empezó la bronca. Con la muleta estuvo distante y cobarde. A la mínima que el toro le miraba echaba a correr. Pinchó al toro en el cuello y después en el brazuelo pinchó nueve veces más y entró a descabellar cinco. Su segundo toro el sexto de la tarde en la suerte de varas mató a varios caballos. En el último tercio cuentan que sacó una muleta descomunal y comenzó a torear con el pico de la tela. En uno de los pases le largó un espadazo en el vientre y luego otro. El toro lo miró mal así que el torero tiró los trastos y repitió la suerte del tercer toro: corriendo hacia la barrera. Y una vez dentro como el toro se le acercase le pinchó de nuevo. El tercer aviso sonó mientras Cagancho seguía intentando matar al animal sin salir de la barrera. Lo hacía pinchándole en los costados en los brazuelos en cualquier lugar. Aquellos de los subalternos que se atrevían a saltar a la arena lo hacían con sus espadas debajo de las capas se acercaban al toro y le pinchaban también alevosamente en cualquier parte. Estaba el toro vivo y el ruedo ya comenzaba a llenarse de espectadores que habían saltado a la arena. Las gentes comenzaron a perseguir a Cagancho el cual intentó con la espada en la mano salir de la plaza. Se dice que un espectador le agarró del cuello y arrojándole en dirección contraria le gritó: ‑¡Al toro coño! ¡Cobarde!- Y allí estaba Cagancho en medio de un ruedo lleno de gente que le rodeaba para darle una paliza; mientras el toro vivo sangrando por sus mil heridas soltaba tornillazos llevándose a la gente por delante. Entonces cargó un destacamento de Caballería que se encontraba allí reforzando a la Guardia Civil. A caballo consiguieron despejar el anillo. Ocho guardias civiles rodearon a Cagancho y lo sacaron de la plaza entre una lluvia de todo tipo de objetos.

El fracaso de Cagancho en Almagro era se decía la bronca más gorda ocurrida jamás en un espectáculo público en España. La marcha del diestro fue seguida de disturbios en la plaza y en los alrededores que motivaron que las fuerzas del orden llegaran a cargar a caballo.

Almagro aquella tarde fue una batalla campal tan fuerte que quedó en la memoria de los españoles para los cuales «quedar como Cagancho en Almagro» pasó a ser el símbolo de un fracaso absoluto. Cagancho todavía vestido de luces refugiado en el salón de actos del Ayuntamiento de Almagro custodiado por la guardia civil para que el personal que estaba en la calle no lo matase se dice que comentaba: “Así es la vida. Yo quería quedar bien pero lo que no pue zé no pue zé.” Uno de sus subalternos se quejaba a la guardia civil. –“¿A usted le parece lógico que a éste [por Cagancho] lo quieran meter en la cárcel por no haber matado un toro y a nosotros nos quieran hacer lo mismo por matarlo?

Con bastante detalle pero con moderación el anónimo cronista del Diario ABC del día 26 de agosto de 1927 contaba que en el tercero ”Colorao bragao y recogido de cuernos ….Entre una bronca da un pinchazo echándose fuera descaradamente; otro igual; otro (Monumental bronca.) Otro cuarteando feamente; otro. (Gran escándalo.) Otra puñalada; cinco intentos de descabello por Cagancho. (Enorme bronca.) Guerrilla apuñala al toro a la primera.”

Y en el sexto “grande y con buenas defensas” escribe: “De salida siembra el pánico entre la torería. Cagancho huye y el público protesta ruidosamente…La faena de este torero incomprensible es un espectáculo lamentable. Huye ante el toro pincha como puede y donde puede agujereando al bicho por todas partes presa en todo momento de un pánico indescriptible. La bronca es ensordecedora. Suena un aviso y Cagancho harto de pinchar toma la barrera e intenta marcharse. El público le apostrofa. Rayito descabella y Cagancho es conducido a la cárcel en medio de una gritería inenarrable. No puede darse nada más vergonzoso.”

Y al día siguiente informaba que salieron de la cárcel tras pagar las multas de 500 y 250 pesetas que les impuso el Gobernador a él y a su cuadrilla ya que “Por evitar un perjuicio a la empresa de Almería capital donde torea hoy Gagancho el gobernador no quiso que estuviesen detenidos pues de lo contrario hubiesen estado más tiempo” Y concluía: “No se recuerda otro escándalo mayor que el de ayer y si a Cagancho no lo protege la Guardia Civil la multitud enfurecida por la frescura inaudita del diestro lo hubiera linchado. No obstante Cagancho recibió algunos golpes.”

El episodio de Almagro no fue único ni casualidad.

Ya en la tarde en que tomó la alternativa el 17 de abril de 1927 en la plaza de Murcia había inaugurado el escándalo. La reseña del día después en el periódico “Levante Agrario” entre otras cosas decía que “Cagancho de blanco y oro con alamares nos demostró que ni es torero ni tiene valor ni sabe torear. No hizo nada. En los quites… abroncado por el público. En el segundo toro dio media verónica superior pero nada más. A las 5’12 (hora oficial) fue hecho matador de toros. El toro se llamaba “Orejillo” era negro bragao y calcetero y ostentaba el número 205. Empieza el neófito con precauciones con ayudados por bajo movidos sin mandar nada (pitos) más pases huyendo en algunos y media pescuecera echándose fuera (bronca) acierta al segundo intento y hay una buena pita”. La lidia del sexto toro [que el cronista califica como “pera en dulce”] fue una continua pita a Cagancho con gritos de ¡Que se vaya! ¡Que se vaya! En los quites salía de estampía a la barrera y así las cosas tocan a matar y ¡la debacle! pases por bajo a dos metros de distancia perdiendo varias veces la muleta y arreando a la barrera. iSi esto es el día de su alternativa! más adelante ¿qué será? ¡la karaba! El toro era ideal embistiendo cada vez que movía la muleta y entrando franco sin tirar una cornada y el espada huyendo huyendo huyendo… Un pinchazo en el cuello saliendo de estampía y media pescuecera. Pasa el tiempo. Más pases. Dos intentos de descabello. Sigue pasando el tiempo y la presidencia durmiendo a los 13 minutos le dan el primer aviso (bronca de las grandes) dos intentos más y acierta.

Sale de la plaza custodiado por la policía entre una bronca ensordecedora escuchando el diestro todas las frases que en estos casos se dicen. En un automóvil va el torero custodiado con la secreta y rodeado de guardias de seguridad. No se atreve a tomar el tren en la estación y se va en auto protegido hasta la estación de Alcantarilla en donde toma el correo.”

Y en Caravaca (Murcia) el 1 de mayo siguiente ante una actuación desastrosa echándole los dos toros al corral de nuevo tuvo que salir protegido por la fuerza pública.

Se había dejado un toro vivo la tarde de su doctorado en Sevilla y los dos en la siguiente corrida aunque logró un éxito extraordinario en Toledo el 8 de mayo de 1927. En aquella ocasión realizó una faena “inenarrable” al sexto toro de La Coquilla cortándole las dos orejas. Según Corrochano ""...la muchedumbre se echó a la arena. Le estrujaron le quitaron las zapatillas se le llevaban a pedazos como un relicario. Intervinieron los guardias siempre los guardias para que no le maten de rabia o para que no le deshagan de entusiasmo y se le lleven a pedacitos como prenda de una tarde"".

Confirmó la alternativa en Madrid a los pocos días con muy buena acogida. Y es que explicaba a su entorno tras salir de alguna plaza a almohadillazos: ""De cada 100 tardes prefiero estar una vez bien y 99 mal que 99 regular y una mal"".

Junto al segundo Gitanillo de Triana y a Joaquín Albaicín formaban el cartel del arte la terna de los gitanos que tuvo su mayor éxito en Vista Alegre (Madrid) repitiendo en diversas plazas de España y Francia. En La Coruña los tres finos toreros con una corrida de Miura para provocar el morbo como reclamo en taquilla tuvieron un estrepitoso fracaso. Pasó lo que tenía que pasar. Clarito tituló su crónica: “Tres gitanos engañan a 8.000 gallegos"".

Pero Cagancho no solo provocó la ira de los aficionados en Almagro actuaciones parecidas ofreció en Calahorra y Zaragoza aquel mismo año de su alternativa. El cronista taurino aragonés de esta feria de 1927 según nos cuenta Mariano García en “El Heraldo” en el articulo “Y Cagancho montó el escándalo en Zaragoza” publicado el 17 de octubre de 2009 escribía: ayer en Zaragoza tras una actuación de miedo frescura e ignorancia incomprensibles toda la Guardia Civil de la provincia hubo de disponerse a custodiarle al terminar la corrida para que no fuese víctima de las iras de un núcleo cargado de razonada indignación. La ganadería era de Concha y Sierra y la actuación del mismo tenor que en Almagro. En el primero dio un pinchazo delantero y después una estocada atravesada. Descabelló al sexto intento. El quinto de Concha y Sierra era un berrendo buen mozo cobardón y con pinta y hechos de buey. Le propinó una estocada atravesada. Luego otra pescuecera Otro pinchazo ignominioso. Sonó el primer aviso. Otro pinchazo y dos intentos de descabello. Un pinchazo en el cuello cuando sonó el segundo aviso. Atizó otro pinchazo y otro y… Nueva intervención de los peones más pinchazos y… al corral.

Seguramente entre los improperios que le dedicaran se oiría aquella frase de “no le pinches más que la piel vale” porque parece que en estas ocasiones Cagancho les dejaba el cuero como un acerico.

Por su lado el decano del periodismo taurino catalán Antonio Santainés Cirés (1929-2014) en su artículo “Joaquín Rodríguez Cagancho: centenario de su nacimiento”. Anuario taurino 2003 nº 37. Asocoación de la Prensa de Madrid pp. 60-63) escribe:

“Continúa la mala racha. A Zaragoza va a las corridas del Pilar. El 17 de octubre [de 1927] torea con Antonio Marquez y Gitanillo de Triana. Los toros son de Concha y Sierra. Ya el día antes al terminar su revista Don Indalecio decía: "".... Y esperemos mañana. Torea Cagancho. El billete que hemos sacado para verle ¿Será un décimo premiado? ""¡Que va! Cagancho ha estado fatal. Y en el quinto oyó los avisos reglamentarios y el sonar de los cencerros. El gitano pasó a la enfermería pero al certificar el doctor Pérez Serrano que no estaba lastimado el presidente suspendió la lidia obligándole a salir al ruedo. Anochecido ya Cagancho pudo salir de la enfermería de la plaza vestido de paisano en un automóvil partiendo para Casetas para tomar el tren. A raíz de este suceso ""La Voz de Aragón"" de Zaragoza publicó una caricatura original de Teixi [Luis Teixidor Cortals] que representaba a un ratón en la cárcel consultando un reloj y comentando con extrañeza: ¡Las ocho y Cagancho sin venir!.” Chiste que con la expresión “Que raro las nueve y Cagancho sin venir” se ha atribuido a Xaudaró como publicado en Blanco y Negro en los años 30. (Joaquín Vidal Madrid - 02/01/1984 en EL PAIS). Reproducimos aquí el de Teixi tomado del artículo citado de Santainés.

También informa Manuel Ramírez en el ABC de Sevilla del día 14.7.1987 martes pág. 56 que en la feria de abril de 1929 en Sevilla Cagancho estaba anunciado para torear tres de las cinco tardes. La primera estuvo bastante mal. La segunda provocó tal escándalo que tuvo que salir de la plaza protegido por la fuerza pública. Ante tal situación el Gobernador Civil temiendo que al día siguiente se organizaran mayores desórdenes públicos ofició a la empresa prohibiéndole que toreara.

Muchas tardes como las anteriores debió vivir el torero. Muchas debió salir escoltado por la Guardia civil y muchas visitar los calabozos por estos motivos. De ahí el mencionado chiste gráfico y las coplas alusivas que se cantaban como la siguiente: “A la puerta de la cárcel no me vengas a cantar que está Cagancho dormido y lo vas a despertar”. Tal era la fama de que le echaran los toros al corral de dejarselos vivos que el cronista taurino “Clarito” (Cesar Jalón Aragón 1889-1985) en sus “Memorias de Clarito” (1972) cuenta que Cagancho desolado acababa de comunicarle que había muerto repentinamente el común amigo Sabino y como al apurar la taza de café apareciera éste Clarito estalló: ""Pero ¡maldita sea tu casta! ¿También a los amigos te los dejas vivos?""

Pero no se gana fama solamente por las malas tardes y Cagancho junto a muchas como las descritas las tuvo sublimes. Ya hemos hecho referencia a sus triunfos en Méjico y en España. Si una plaza da nombre a un torero esta es la de Las Ventas de Madrid y en ella cosechó Cagancho triunfos sonados. Parece ser que la de la presentación de novillero el 5 de agosto de 1926 junto a Gitanillo de Triana y Enrique Torres con novillos del marqués de Villamarta grandes con pitones y arrobas fue memorable con verónicas calificadas de “enormes” “inconmensurables” etc. Por cierto el crítico taurino de ABC (E.P.) mencionaba a Joaquín Rodríguez y se adscribía tácitamente a los críticos taurinos catalanes pues decía entre paréntesis de su sobrenombre que “el apodo de este torero no lo escribiré jamás por respeto al lector”. De su gran triunfo ha quedado en contraposición al gran fracaso en Almagro la frase que a veces se oye también de “Quedar como Cagancho en Las Ventas” para indicar que se ha quedado muy bien. El gran crítico taurino Gregorio Corrochano lo comparó en una de sus crónicas con una talla de Montañés. Escribe: ""El gitano negro va vestido de blanco. Pausadamente como un fantasma se acerca al toro. Con el palillo de la muleta y la espada hace una cruz y así se presenta a la multitud este hombre seco como un cartujo del color de la madera que eligiera para sus tallas el Montañés. Pasa el toro sin que el leño se mueva y hay en el tendido ruido de apoteosis. La izquierda mano huesuda o leñosa asoma obscura por la manga blanca salpicada de oro...."" y añade: ""Aquella mano del Montañés larga leñosa que asoma obscura por la manga blanca salpicada de oro hace unas cosas de torero de un sabor torero que empalaga."" Y termina su histórica crónica diciendo: ""Yo creo que Cagancho no sabe torear; pero cuando torea... Sentí un escalofrío y me crucé el abrigo.""

La fama de Cagancho la buena de las crónicas pasó a las letras. Federico García Lorca escribiría de él: «Joaquín Rodríguez “Cagancho”… monarca de gitanos» y Pedro Luis de Gálvez (1882- 1940) lo inmortalizó en uno de sus magníficos sonetos soneto que termina con estos dos tercetos:

“Juntos los pies erguido sonriente

Deja al bruto pasar e indiferente

Mira en un cuerno un alamar de oro.

Tiene el cañí la chaquetilla rota.

Es todo igual…La plaza se alborota.

¡Y envidia una mujer tiene del toro!”

Entre los múltiples homenajes en España y en Méjico el torero de Triana tiene en la calle Evangelista de la capital hispalense un azulejo en su honor con esta leyenda: “En el seno de una familia de cantaores vino al mundo en este extremo de Evangelista un genio del arte de torear Joaquín Rodríguez “Cagancho” quien llevó a los ruedos la magia de los duendes de la cava. Nació en 1903 y falleció el último día de 1983”. Y en Tarancón tiene una calle la calle Joaquín Rodríguez Cagancho que va desde la calle de Santa Quiteria hasta la Cuesta de Barajas. Allí toreó varias veces. En una de ellas le reglaron una medalla de la patrona la Virgen de Riánsares y toreando un toro un día de 1928 recibió una cornada en el pecho que podría haber sido mortal si esa medalla que siempre llevaba consigo no hubiera desviado el cuerno. Con ese motivo regaló a la Virgen un manto e hizo en otras ocasiones diversas donaciones. “De su bolsillo salió el dinero con el que se instalaron los primeros rayos X en el Hospital de Santa Emilia” y actuó varias veces en festivales para recaudar fondos para los pobres del pueblo y para su hospital.

Este fue Joaquín Rodriguez Cagancho el gitano de los ojos verdes capaz de enfervorizar al público en sus tardes de inspiración y de encolerizarle hasta extremo de querer lincharle en las que la astada pareja de baile no seguía sus pasos. Sí “Quedar como Cagancho en Almagro” es quedar fatal “Quedar como Cagancho en Las Ventas” es lo contrario. Yo me conformaría con quedar.

The 5G rollout in the

Since then many over the locations chosen for the poles.





A 5G pole on 19th Avenue between Gadsden and Jackson streets is one of 75 approved poles in Pensacola under city permits.

But since its approval nearly two years ago residents in the have been battling the city Verizon and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to stop it.

""The basis for it is they didn't do a proper historic review and one of the reasons my wife and I moved here four years ago was because of the historic nature of this neighborhood"" said resident John Herron. ""Putting this wireless infrastructure right next to historic homes we think is inappropriate.""

Herron is one of the Pensacola residents leading this fight.

With the city's hands tied due to a state law that prevents local governments from regulating communication services Herron along with several neighbors sent a petition to the FCC.

""We're hoping locally this pole in front of this historic 100-year-old home is removed - it doesn't belong there"" Herron said. ""Secondly we hope the petition has an expanded impact and serious historic reviews are done.""

On March 17th the FCC granted a pleading schedule which means it'll review the petition.

This is a rare win for Pensacola residents in this lengthy battle.

""I'm optimistic about it"" Herron said. ""We have a new administration and a new FCC Chair involved.""

In the notice the FCC says construction at the site may not commence until the matter is resolved but this has not happened.

A neighbor showed us a cellphone video taken on Thursday of an unidentifiable contractor continuing with work on the pole.

In the video the neighbor asks the worker which company they are with. The worker does not respond and gets back in his work truck and drives away.

We reached out to Verizon. They tell us they have paused construction at the site and any work being done there is not their crew or contractors.

They also sent Channel 3 the following statement:

We have partnered with the City of Pensacola to reduce the number of new poles built in the city. Verizon follows all local state and federal requirements for any installations for small cell and macro site installations. - Verizon spokesperson

Residents had the FCC order posted to the pole when the worker attempted to continue work.

Friday code enforcement for the city also posted the FCC order.

We called the FCC to ask if a wireless company could be fined for continuing work on the pole.

The FCC declined to comment and also would not speak on the status of the petition.

Viatri actualmente sin contrato con ningún equipo comentó: “No arreglé en el fútbol argentino por una elección de vida a mí me trataron muy bien en Uruguay mi familia quedó enamorada.

“Siempre sueño con volver a Peñarol me trataron muy bien tuvimos momentos muy lindos y el país me encantó; siempre está la ilusión. Yo me hice hincha de Peñarol así que me encantaría volver a vestir la camiseta” señaló el delantero que confesó que observa todos los partidos del equipo aurinegro.

Y sostuvo sobre Ignacio Ruglio actual presidente de Peñarol: “El Nacho es un fenómeno tanto con él como con Rodolfo Catino hemos hablado por mensaje durante todo este tiempo. Cuando Ruglio fue elegido como presidente de Peñarol yo tardé como un mes y medio en mandarle un mensaje porque todavía estaba el tema de que se podía incorporar jugadores y no me parecía porque como que me estaba ofreciendo no me pareció el momento y después sí lo felicité”.

El atacante también indicó: “Cuando Leo Ramos asumió en Danubio en agosto me llamó para ir; ahora yo estoy analizando algunas cosas que tengo hay que ver la idea es en un futuro irme a vivir a Uruguay”.

Por último Viatri señaló que no podría aceptar una oferta de Nacional: “Hay cosas que no se hacen en su momento cuando jugaba en la sexta o séptima de Boca vino River a buscarme y mi papá les dijo que no sin siquiera preguntarme a mí; después por ejemplo también jugué en Emelec un año y luego tuve la chance de ir a Barcelona de Guayaquil y no quise; por más que hagas las cosas bien o mal siempre hay alguien del club que te termina queriendo y sería faltarle el respeto a esa persona eso no va conmigo”.

Y elogió a su compatriota Gonzalo Bergessio actual delantero y capitán de Nacional: “Gonzalo es una bestia es muy vivo para jugar tiene mucha experiencia tiene un recorrido largo en el fútbol y está entrenado como un toro eso lo ayuda muchísimo. El fútbol uruguayo te lleva al choque y al roce continuamente y eso juega a su favor. Y está ahí siempre es ‘mosca de verano’ te molesta todo el tiempo”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsb2JzZXJ2YWRvci5jb20udXkvbm90YS92aWF0cmktbWUtaGljZS1oaW5jaGEtZGUtcGVuYXJvbC15LW1lLWd1c3RhcmlhLXZvbHZlci1hLXZlc3Rpci1lc2EtY2FtaXNldGEtLTIwMjE0NDEzMjI1NNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbG9ic2VydmFkb3IuY29tLnV5L25vdGEvdmlhdHJpLW1lLWhpY2UtaGluY2hhLWRlLXBlbmFyb2wteS1tZS1ndXN0YXJpYS12b2x2ZXItYS12ZXN0aXItZXNhLWNhbWlzZXRhLS0yMDIxNDQxMzIyNTQvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Viatri: ""Me hice hincha de Peñarol y me gustaría volver a vestir esa camiseta""","La boca llena de gol de Lucas Viatri en su pasaje por Peñarol Carlos Pazos

Lucas Viatri quedó libre de Colón de Santa Fe y está analizando ofertas para definir su futuro. Tomador de yerba uruguaya y nostálgico de su pasaje por Peñarol según contó al programa ‘Locos por el fútbol’ de FM Del Sol reconoció que quiere radicarse en Uruguay.

“No arreglé en el fútbol argentino por una elección de vida. Me trataron muy bien en Uruguay y mi familia quedó enamorada. Cuando tuvimos que volvernos mi señora y mi hijo de 14 años lloraban. Me sentí como el tuje” recordó.

“Como siempre estaba la chance de volver después de la pandemia tomamos la decisión de irnos a vivir a Uruguay. Sea a fin de año o el año que viene” dijo el delantero de 34 años quien militó en filas carboneras desde mediados de 2017 hasta diciembre de 2019.

“Dejé bastantes amigos y gente que nos ha tratado muy bien. Encontrar gente así y un país donde a mi hijo que en ese momento tenía 12 años lo mandaba en bicicleta al colegio es algo que en Buenos Aires no se puede. Vivíamos en la calle no en un barrio cerrado” destacó.

Recordó que lo llamó Leonardo Ramos cuando asumió en Danubio y contó que hoy está “analizando algunas cosas”. Se comunicó con Ignacio Ruglio para felicitarlo por haber ganado las elecciones pero tardó un mes y medio en escribirle para que no se interpretara como que se estaba ofreciendo. También mantiene contacto con el dirigente Rodolfo Catino.

“Siempre sueño con volver. Me trataron muy bien y vivimos momentos muy lindos viviendo en un país que me encantó. Me hice hincha de Peñarol y me gustaría volver a vestir esa camiseta” agregó y aseguró que no jugaría en Nacional porque “hay cosas que no se hacen”.

“En su momento cuando yo jugaba en la sexta de Boca con 16 años fue River a buscarme y mi papá sin preguntarme les dijo que no. Yo me enteré cuatro o cinco años después. Jugué en Emelec un año a préstamo y he tenido la chance de ir a Barcelona que es el clásico y he dicho que no. Por más que hagas las cosas mal o bien siempre hay alguien que te termina queriendo en un club y hacer algo así sería faltarle el respeto. Eso no va conmigo” aclaró.

Sobre su último pasaje por Peñarol dijo que le “hubiese gustado jugar más con Xisco como en su momento con el Toro Fernández”. “Él se había lesionado y otra vez me lesioné yo. El Mota Gargano también se había lesionado. Creo que si estábamos todos bien ganábamos tranquilamente ese torneo” aseguró.

Consultado por los dichos de Claudio Yacob quien dijo que el fútbol está “50 años atrasado respecto al argentino” opinó que “hay que jugar en el fútbol uruguayo”. “Tenés muchas cosas a favor y muchas en contra. Hay que ir a jugar a las canchas chicas aunque he visto que en este último año que no estuve han arreglado bastante los pisos” dijo.

“Hay muchos jugadores que no les gusta que les peguen y el uruguayo es vivo para marcar es mañoso y ventajero. Te tenés que acostumbrar. Cuando te va mal lo más fácil es decir ‘en este fútbol no se puede jugar’ pero hay que estar. Yo me he ido bastante dolido de los tobillos y ligué algún piñazo pero hay que aguantar. Es ida y vuelta pero siempre con respeto” concluyó.

They expressed their concern during their interaction with the Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri.

Misri who is on a visit to Shanghai inaugurated on Friday the Amrut Mahotsav festival marking the 75 years of India’s independence.

“Inaugurated India@75 #AmrutMahotsav in #Shanghai. A soulful rendition of #Upanishad & #Gita melodious Sitar/Tabla performance #Deshbhakti songs films on musical traditions of #Varanasi & #VaccineMaitri marked the occasion"" Misri tweeted.

He also interacted with a group of CEOs and representatives of the Indian businesses based in and around Shanghai the business hub of China.

Over 30 officials representing eight sectors such as textiles pharma electronics manufacturing chemicals and IT etc attended the meeting with Misri.

“Interacted with the Indian industry representatives based in Shanghai. Business leaders representing various sectors including #IT #Pharma #textiles #engineering Manufacturing #foodprocessing #banking etc participated in discussions” Misri said in another tweet.

In their interaction with Misri the CEOs stated they were experiencing difficulties in operations mostly on account of travel and visa restrictions being maintained by China as part of its Covid-19 measures official sources here told PTI.

Misri assured them the Indian Embassy will continue to engage with the Chinese government on the issues related to the travel restrictions the sources said.

Travel between India and China has been halted since Beijing imposed travel restrictions in November last year and suspended the visas and resident permits held by Indian citizens.

These restrictions left over 23000 Indian students and hundreds of Indian businessmen employees and their families stranded in India.

Currently there are no flights in operation between the two countries.

China has not yet indicated when it plans to permit travel despite numerous representations from the Indian Embassy here and the students who mostly study medicine in Chinese universities.

These universities maintain that they are holding online classes for the stranded students.

Last month China made it mandatory for travellers coming from India and 19 other countries to have been inoculated with Chinese Covid-19 vaccines to enter the country.

This created more confusion as Chinese vaccines are not available in India. While China has not included the students in the mandatory vaccine list the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Chinese authorities would “study” the issues related to students but no decision has been announced yet.

The Grateful Dead were a band who lived on the road. They must have more miles under their belt than most middle-aged truckers—but there was one spot they called home more often than any other The Greek Theatre in Berkley California. In this rarely heard clip we can take a trip back to Grateful Dead’s final performance at the legendary venue in 1989 all through the unique isolated guitar of Bob Weir. The band’s smiling assassin Weir’s guitar is that of legend.

One of the understated influencers of the time Bob Weir‘s noodling guitar has often been overlooked as one of the most pioneering songwriters and extroverted guitar players the world has ever seen. So what better way to celebrate the man than by revisiting him in his most favourite place—on the stage. It was where the Grateful Dead really came alive.

The Grateful Dead first took to the stage at the notorious venue in 1967 and would frequent there more often than not taking up residency for three nights at a time during each year of the eighties. The final show would see the band say goodbye to one of their many spiritual homes and has become the stuff of legend among the band’s avid fans known as Deadheads.

It feels fitting then that one way to look back at this iconic gig would be through Bob Weir’s laconic and laid-back isolated guitar parts. Brought to YouTube by cleantones the story of how it came to light goes: “Apparently Bobby was troubleshooting his guitar rig and had his guitar recorded separately for the three nights at the Greek by Don Pearson. This final performance was leaked in one way or another.” We’re very glad it did as it is one of the most insightful pieces we’ve heard in a long time.

Weir has always seemed at home on stage far from the sometimes cantankerous Jerry Garcia Weir nearly always had a beaming smile when playing with the Dead and it’s a notion that shines in his guitar playing—bright bouncing and utterly beguiling. With the ability to shred as well as anyone Weir’s real talent lies in his ability to adapt and generally ‘feel the vibe’. It may be an old trope for Grateful Dead to be described as ‘vibey’ in any way but if the vegan leather sandal fits.

When that kind of guitar playing is isolated it moves on from the perfect piece of an elaborate kaleidoscopic puzzle to an expression of the player. With the setlist below you can follow along with Weir’s guitar parts but we think it’s better to just sit back and let Weir’s tone take you on your own trip. Delicately moving from track to track Weir’s parts are far from the overwhelming wall of sound that can sometimes be scaled at Dead gigs instead it’s a relaxing float down a long and lazy river.

Listen to Bob Weir’s isolated guitar on The Grateful Dead’s final performance at the legendary Greek Theatre in 1989 below.

The money came with her name: she is the granddaughter of Roy Disney who with his brother Walt founded the Walt Disney Company in 1923. Disney 61 refuses to say how much she has but acknowledges she would have been a billionaire in her own right had she not realised in her 20s that it was her fortune that was making her miserable and decided to start giving it away.

She has been donating to good causes ever since – $72m (£52m) and counting mostly to groups helping women in prison women living with HIV and victims of domestic violence. But giving it away is no longer enough. She wants the tax collector to take more money not only from her but from “all of the absurdly rich people across the world”.

“We’ve long known that the world is hugely unequal” says Disney. “But now the pandemic has really shown it to all of us and no one in all conscience can continue to ignore it.” Disney is speaking over Zoom from San Francisco. Today she looks more hippy chic than heiress: her light-brown hair falls in long gentle curls and there is a discreet peace dove tattooed on the inside of her wrist.

“It is like when your kids have a bath and you pull the plug out and slowly all the little toys at the bottom are revealed” says Disney. “That is what has happened here: now we all know what is going on under the surface.” As well as killing more than 2.5 million people the pandemic and global lockdown response has plunged some 150 million more into “extreme poverty” according to the World Bank. The Washington-based institution described Covid-19 as “a heat-seeking missile speeding toward the most vulnerable in society”.

“Throughout the pandemic the poorest have been forced to continue going to work risking their lives while the rich stay at home” Disney says. “And those going to work in life-saving essential jobs are paying more [proportionally] in tax than the wealthy who are safe at home.”

Disney worries that society risks slipping back into a “Dickensian world” unless the really rich realise “we are all humans at the end of the day and we need to look after each other. You know these billionaires are modern-day miserly Ebenezer Scrooges. Because they are looking straight at Tiny Tim and saying: ‘No fuck you I won’t pay for your crutches’” she says. “It may sound extreme but they really are.”

Abigail Disney is part of a small but growing group among the super-rich calling for a wealth tax to help fund the recovery from the pandemic. The Patriotic Millionaires movement of which she is a longstanding member and key spokesperson started in 2010 with only a handful of signatures on a 163-word open letter including the musician Moby and Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream co-founder Ben Cohen. It has grown into a global organisation with more than 200 members including Chuck Collins heir to the Oscar Mayer hotdog fortune; Morris Pearl a former managing director at BlackRock; Danish-Iranian billionaire Djaffar Shalchi; and Sir Stephen Tindall the founder of New Zealand’s largest retailer the Warehouse Group. They describe themselves as “proud traitors to their class” united in their concern about the “destabilising concentration of wealth and power”.

These members argue that instead of leaving the super-rich to splash their billions on philanthropic vanity projects such as opera houses and museums higher taxes should be used to fund public services welfare and tackle growing inequality. Disney wants taxes on the super-rich to fund universal medical treatment and education in the US and throughout the world. This week she will help launch the UK and European chapter of Patriotic Millionaires pressuring world governments to “raise taxes on people like us. Immediately. Substantially. Permanently”.

Disney does not have a fixed idea of exactly how a wealth tax should work or at what rate it should be set; she just wants it to start now. “Yesterday is not soon enough” she says as her dog Forkie a morkie (a cross between a Maltese and Yorkshire terrier) crashes into her tablet. (Her other dogs are called Quincy and RBG after Ruth Bader Ginsburg; Disney was a fan of the late supreme court judge who she described as “the soul of social change”.)

Wealth is meant to feel like the magic answer right? But after a certain point it starts not being true

Of the wealth tax Disney says: “I think it should kick in at around $50m [£36m] and up. Something has to say: ‘OK you’re fine. Right now we need to figure out how to help all the people who aren’t fine and your money is going to pay for it.’”

An annual wealth tax of just 2% on those with more than $50m – as proposed by US senator Elizabeth Warren – would raise more than $4tn enough money to overhaul the entire US public education system. Warren amended her plan this month to call for a 3% “Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act” targeting people with more than $1bn to help pay for the economic pain the pandemic has caused. “The ultra-rich and powerful have rigged the rules in their favour so much that the top 0.1% pay a lower effective tax rate than the bottom 99%” Warren said. “And billionaire wealth is 40% higher than before the Covid crisis began.”

Disney says she “loves” Warren and dismisses arguments from those on the right who claim a wealth tax would drive the rich overseas. “It would not prevent anyone from wanting to live in the United States and would not prevent anyone from being wildly more wealthy than anyone ever needs to be.” In her ideal world there would be a cap on personal wealth but even she thinks that is too radical an idea to propose making into law. “I think there is such a thing as too much money” she says. “And I think that’s a billion. In fact I don’t really know how you couldn’t figure out how to live a very nice life on $999m. So anything over a billion feels to me like a mistake.” In Disney’s fantasy universe the world’s billionaires – there are now 2189 according to a report by Swiss investment bank UBS – would be declared “the winners of capitalism” but would not be able to make any more money.

The UBS study shows that billionaires (the top 0.000028%) “did extremely well” during the coronavirus pandemic growing their fortunes to a record high of $10.2tn (£7.8tn) more than three times the annual economic output of the UK. Elon Musk the maverick co-founder of electric car company Tesla who was the 35th richest in the world pre-Covid is now the second-richest person ever to have lived behind Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. Both men have fortunes of more than $180bn each – roughly twice the GDP of Kenya.

Disney realised she had too much money when she was studying first at Yale University and then for a PhD in English literature at New York’s Columbia University in the early 1980s. “Inheriting a fortune can fuck you up it really can” she says. “I spent my 20s and 30s trying to dig out from under the anxiety and guilt that came with it. People don’t like it when wealthy people talk about this because wealth is meant to feel like the magic answer to every question right? ‘If only I had XYZ money everything would be all right’ – and that is true for poor people.

“But after a certain point it starts not being true.” She falters slightly searching for the right words. “Money becomes its own preoccupation. I think of it as like a really fancy dog that you have to constantly be brushing. And so you get sucked into it. From the time I was 21 years old I spent far too much time with accountants lawyers and estate attorneys talking about and thinking about my money: where it was why it was there did it need to change and what the tax implications would be.”

Disney talks about how growing up she and her siblings (she has two brothers and a sister) never had to queue for anything. “You know if you never have to stand in line it makes you act differently” she says. “And you begin to wonder about everything. Are people more interested in what you have to say because of what you have? Are they letting you think you’re funnier than you really are? Having no one who will tell you the truth about yourself… I mean that really corrodes.”

It was around this time that Disney’s family morphed from very rich to uber-rich. Michael Eisner had taken over as chief executive of the Disney company which had been struggling for years after the deaths of Walt and Roy Oliver Disney in 1966 and 1971 respectively. Eisner turned its fortunes around by revitalising its animation division and buying up Marvel Pixar and Lucasfilm. Soon Disney was producing critically acclaimed and money-spinning films: Beauty And The Beast (the first animated film to be nominated for a best picture Oscar) and The Lion King. Disney’s share price soared throwing off huge dividends to Abigail’s father Roy Edward Disney a major shareholder. In 1994 alone Eisner was paid a record-breaking $203m.

Suddenly Abigail says her family changed. Her dad bought a private plane: not a small jet but a Boeing 737 with queen-size beds and an onboard shower. She rebelled by refusing to get on the plane and by starting to give her money away.

Disney lives most of the time in New York with her husband Pierre Hauser. They met at Yale and were married at Columbia University’s St Paul’s Chapel. Their joint charity the Daphne Foundation aims to end poverty in the city. A nameplate on Disney’s desk reads: “Feminist AF”. She also runs the documentary company Fork Films producing or providing funding for films about issues she believes in such as Pray The Devil Back To Hell about a female-led peace movement in Liberia; and Crip Camp about a summer camp for people with disabilities recently nominated for an Oscar. “I’m sort of like a deliberately terrible businesswoman” she says explaining that her loss-making projects are a way of giving money to creative people who need it.

If you’re making more than £200000 a year you should be paying more tax. It is not going to make you poor is it?

As she has grown more confident Disney has begun speaking up against pay inequality at the Walt Disney Company describing then-chief executive Bob Iger’s $65m paycheque in 2018 as “insane”. “If your CEO salary is 700 600 500 times your median workers’ pay there is nobody on earth – Jesus Christ himself isn’t worth 500 times his median workers’ pay” she said at the time. Iger now Disney’s executive chairman actually earned 1424 times the median Disney worker’s pay that year – almost triple Abigail’s guesstimate. He defended it as “a one-time grant” for his role in overseeing Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox and at a Vanity Fair event in 2019 acknowledged that the country needed to address inequality. “I think we have to figure out if there’s a tax plan that makes sense that transfers more wealth from a small set of individuals to a larger set of individuals” he said.

The Walt Disney Company’s lowest-paid staff began seeking Disney out as their potential saviour. One worker whose job was to dress up as Cinderella in the “magic happens” parades wrote that she couldn’t afford to pay her rent and was sleeping in her car. “It kills me” Disney says “because as a child I went there with my grandfather. Now I may have rose-tinted glasses when looking back but there was an almost reverence for him and he had such a rapport with the people who worked there. He would be horrified.” Disney says unskilled labourers like many of the thousands working at Disneyland and Disney World are effectively “endless unnamed interchangeable parts that can be replaced at any time”.

Her activism enraged her parents who worshipped at the shrine of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher’s neoliberal capitalism. Both her parents were alcoholics: Roy Edward died in 2009 and her mother Patricia in 2012. “My parents were quite conservative and so we were in conflict a lot” she says. “I have a brother and a sister who are very very supportive and are right there with me.”

Though Disney doesn’t fly by private jet she still leads a life of unquestioned luxury with a taste for expensive wines at exclusive restaurants (when they’re open) and designer shoes. She says her biggest extravagance is her home in Ireland a 15th-century castle that sleeps 26 people. Soon after we speak Disney Hauser and their dogs embark on a new adventure: driving across the US in a van joining the craze that has exploded in popularity during the pandemic. “Haven’t left the city yet but we are already sacked out and happy. #vanlife” she wrote on Instagram alongside a picture of her and Hauser glued to their phones in the back of the van.

The Patriotic Millionaires group has no membership card or secret handshake but members need assets of at least $5m or an annual income in excess of $1m to join. Founder Erica Payne a political strategist who worked on Bill Clinton’s inaugural committee has said that as well as being rich and progressive the members have another thing in common: they all “hate the name”.

“Every time we have a gathering we have 30 minutes set aside so they can bitch about it” she said last year. “And then at the conclusion of the 30 minutes I tell them we’re not going to change the name.” It was designed to attract attention particularly from those on the right in the US: “You’re patriotic and you’re a millionaire.”

Six British millionaires have so far signed up to the UK chapter demanding that the government urgently address inequality here. They describe “shocking” Office for National Statistics data showing that the richest 1% of Britons hold almost a quarter of the nation’s wealth at a time when poverty is rising. London recently overtook New York as home to the highest concentration of dollar millionaires in the world: about 875000 people or one in 10 while 2.5 million Londoners are classified as living in poverty.

The British members set out their purpose in July last year in an open letter under the banner Millionaires for Humanity with other signatories including the screenwriter and director Richard Curtis: “No we are not the ones caring for the sick in intensive care wards. We are not driving the ambulances that will bring the ill to hospitals. We are not restocking grocery store shelves or delivering food door to door. But we do have money lots of it. Money that is desperately needed now and will continue to be needed in the years ahead as our world recovers from this crisis.”

Among them is Gemma McGough 40 from Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire who made millions from the sale of a startup exploiting wireless technology. When I speak to her over video in her home office she is juggling running a new company with home-schooling three children.

McGough wants the government to tax her – and other high earners – at a rate as high as 75% to help the country’s pandemic-ravaged public finances. “The economy is so damaged from Covid I am happy to pay my share” she says. “If you’re making more than £150000 or £200000 a year you should be paying more. If you’re earning £200000 paying a higher rate of tax on earnings above that is not going to make you poor is it?”

Currently the highest tax rate in the UK is 45% on earnings above £150000. But many of the highest earners also use complex schemes to legally reduce the amount they pay. The chancellor Rishi Sunak used the budget to raise billions of pounds by freezing tax thresholds and thus dragging 1.3 million middle-income earners into higher tax brackets angering backbench MPs. Instead the group argues more should be taken from the super-rich. McGough and the other British Patriotic Millionaires would also like to see a big increase in inheritance tax and capital gains tax plus a new wealth tax.

Three prominent economists recently recommended the introduction of a one-off tax on anyone with more than £500000 in assets including property. The Wealth Tax Commission suggests a 1% tax on those individuals for five years could raise £260bn – enough to fund the NHS for a year. Such taxes are beginning to be introduced in Argentina Bolivia and Morocco to help pay for the recovery. In Norway about 500000 people pay an 0.85% charge on their assets above the value of about £125000. The prospect of such a tax in the UK is rich people’s second-biggest fear after the virus according to Knight Frank’s wealth report. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Sunak have both dismissed the suggestion.

McGough says she finds it hard to understand wealthy people fighting not to pay more tax. “It is an issue of morality: why are we comfortable with the wealthy continuing to get wealthier? If we allow it to go on ultimately there will be civil unrest” she says.

McGough whose mother was a cleaner and father a painter-decorator grew up poor: her family did not have a car until she was 10 and there was no central heating. She shone at school but her parents asked her to get a job to help with the rent rather than go to university. By chance her first job at 16 was in the soon-to-be booming world of radio frequency technologies. “It just really suited me” she says. “I went on to start a business doing it.” Back then her “motivator was to make money” because she desperately wanted to go travelling. Her first big trip was in an overland truck from Victoria Falls on the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia to South Africa.

McGough was so busy building her company which certified new RF technology products that she didn’t get a chance to think about how much money she was making – until advisers kept offering to help her lower her tax bill with creative accounting. “It is quite a toxic environment but you’re busy. It’s only afterwards that you realise it always seemed wrong. There should be pride in being a higher-rate taxpayer. Now my politics are very leftward leaning.”

She says rich people who are known to avoid tax should be seen as “social pariahs … a national disgrace not heroes”. Some of the wealthiest Britons are no longer based in the UK which allows them to make significant tax savings. Sir James Ratcliffe the UK’s richest person and a high-profile Brexiter last year quit Britain for tax-free Monaco. It has been estimated that the move will ultimately save him £4bn in tax payments. Other rich Britons who have moved to Monaco include the former Topshop boss Sir Philip Green and his wife Tina; the property billionaires Simon and David Reuben; John Hargreaves the founder and chairman of Matalan; and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton. In 2019 John Caudwell the billionaire founder of Phones4u vowed to join them in Monaco if Labour was elected and raised taxes.

Like Disney McGough says her parents “struggle” with her views. “They were very excited that I became such a success and very proud of that” she says. “But after I sold the business and became much more socialist they found it hard to understand the shift. When you are poorer the pursuit of money is important and it was seen that I had won the game of life. “Yes you have won but there are still people living on the streets people living in circumstances you can’t imagine across the world” she says. “You can’t consider yourself a winner when losing has such terrible outcomes.” McGough says her parents are slowly coming round. “They are happy that I’m doing what I want but they do find it odd.”

Gary Stevenson 34 is another member of the UK branch of Patriotic Millionaires. He made his first million when he was 24 betting on the outcome of Greece’s financial crisis in 2011. He was a senior economist at Citibank and placed a series of bets that would pay out if global inequality increased. The bets made him he claims the most profitable Citibank trader in the world that year earning it $35m. He made the same bet on yawning inequality in 2012: again it paid out.

“It put me in a weird space” he says wearing a grey hoodie in his minimalist kitchen in Limehouse close to the heart of the City of London. “I was making loads of money from the fact that the world economy is going to be fucked for ever. I rolled it around in my head for a year or two before deciding I had to quit.”

Stevenson says the decision was hard because making a lot of money had been all he wanted to do. “I was quite poor growing up – we lived in a small terrace house by the railway line in Ilford and as a family we couldn’t afford for me to go on school trips and stuff. You get judged on how much money you have so I went out and made it a lot of it.”

After he quit banking Stevenson went on to study economics at the University of Oxford to learn more about what could be done to redress global inequality. He didn’t find the answer among the spires. “It’s just a bunch of posh people in caps worried about continuing to be rich” he says. “Change isn’t going to come from there.” Stevenson believes increasing tax on the wealthy is the only answer. “The problem is that rich people save most of their income so it does not trickle back into the economy. Whereas ordinary people spend most of their income. Companies are only going to expand if they are spending.

I want to live in a world where everyone can help themselves and can get those high-paying jobs like I had

“Tax is the most important thing it’s the only way that poorer people can have a chance of catching up” he says. “I’m not talking about huge taxes on high earners like doctors or lawyers I’m talking about going after the families who have been keeping their money for ever. These families have hundreds of millions of pounds and money makes money so it’s just going up and up. I was paying 45% tax on my earnings but the Duke of Westminster was paying next to nothing on his billions of inheritance.” The heirs of the sixth Duke of Westminster paid no inheritance tax on the bulk of his £8.3bn family fortune after his death in 2016. His son Hugh Grosvenor 30 inherited the title and became one of the world’s richest people as the major shareholder of global property company Grosvenor Estates which owns swathes of properties in the West End Mayfair and Belgravia in London as well as estates in Cheshire Lancashire and Scotland.

Stevenson dismisses arguments that the Patriotic Millionaires could follow the example of people such as Bill Gates or MacKenzie Scott former wife of Jeff Bezos who gave away almost $6bn last year donating through philanthropy rather than higher taxes. He admits he could help his friends from comprehensive school back in Ilford who are working as teachers fashion designers and actors. But he says “helping them individually isn’t enough. I want to live in a world where everyone can help themselves. Where people from poor backgrounds can get those high-paying jobs like I had.”

Stevenson won’t say how much money he has now only that he has “enough to retire and not work again”. He hasn’t given much to charity but says he is using his money to push for economic change. The only way to do this he says will be if the majority of people are told how badly the decks are stacked against them “and they get really fucking angry about it. People don’t realise how rich the rich are and that the rich don’t pay much tax” he says. “People think I’m a billionaire people think I’m like Jay-Z. But I’ve got nothing compared to the truly rich.”

For her part Abigail Disney thinks low-paid workers are already very angry and that change will only come if the rich turn on each other. “My grandfather would never have paid himself over 1000 times what his median worker was being paid” she says. “There were no laws against him doing it it was just not an acceptable thing to do. He certainly wouldn’t have been put on the cover of magazines and told he was a genius.” Iger has graced the cover of Fortune and Time magazine. “This is who we are worshipping now” Disney says. “The norms have shifted and the country will follow the tone set by business – that’s always been the way in American life.”

Disney says more rich and powerful people are joining the movement in spirit if not always formally signing up. “People want to take society back to a fairer time before it’s too late” she says. “But the question is will they have the courage to go up against their own class? That’s the hardest thing in the world to do – for a liberal to criticise liberals for a businessman to criticise businessmen. I know from personal experience; I have made myself very unattractive to the wealthy. But we need them to start calling each other out.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vZGlzbmV5bGFuZC9hcnRpY2xlL0Rpc25leWxhbmQtdmlyYWwtZnJpZWQtcGlja2xlLWNvcm4tZG9nLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtMTYwNzMyODcucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disneyland's fried pickle corn dog is taking the internet by storm — and I tried it,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/disneyland/article/Disneyland-viral-fried-pickle-corn-dog-experience-16073287.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vZGlzbmV5bGFuZC9hcnRpY2xlL0Rpc25leWxhbmQtdmlyYWwtZnJpZWQtcGlja2xlLWNvcm4tZG9nLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtMTYwNzMyODcucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNub3Blcy5jb20vZmFjdC1jaGVjay9uby1mbHktem9uZS13ZHcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is There a 'No-Fly Zone' Over Walt Disney World?,"Claim: Airplanes are restricted from flying over Walt Disney World in Orlando Florida under a “no-fly” restriction issued by the Federal Aviation Administration. Rating: About this rating True

The Walt Disney World resort in Orlando Florida is one of just two U.S. theme parks awarded a “no-fly zone” designation. The other is Disneyland in Anaheim California.

Those federal government-designated protections grant the theme parks the same protection as the White House and NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) the permanent flight restrictions were issued on Oct. 27 2014 for unnamed “security reasons”. They require that no aircraft come within 3000 feet in altitude of the theme park for a radius of three miles. Any person who knowingly violates the rules may be subject to certain criminal penalties under a violation of national defense airspace and could face fines or imprisonment for up to one year. Pilots who do not adhere to the restriction may be intercepted and detained.

However the no-fly zone does not apply to aircraft operated by the Department of Defense law enforcement or air ambulance flight operations. Flights operated by Walt Disney World itself are also allowable under an approved waiver.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2FuaW1lc3VwZXJoZXJvLmNvbS9mb3J1bXMvdGhyZWFkcy93b3VsZC15b3UtY29uc2lkZXItdGhlLXJlcGxhY2VtZW50cy10by1iZS10aGUtZGlzbmV5LXZlcnNpb24tb2YtdGhlLWZhaXJseS1vZGQtcGFyZW50cy41NzkwMzE2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Would You Consider The Replacements To Be The Disney Version Of The Fairly Odd Parents?,"The Replacements was a Disney cartoon that ran for 2 seasons from July 28 2006 to March 30 2009. It's about 2 kids named Todd Daring and Riley Daring who get cellphones from Fleemco that give them the power to replace people they aren't satisfied with. Things go wrong for them though and they end up asking for things to go back to normal. They end up adopted by Agent K (a British super spy) and Dick Daring (a stuntman).



There have been comments on the show essentially being the Disney version of The Fairly Odd Parents. On the surface they have a similar premise on kids having access to some kind of magical object that gives them almost anything they want and they can't tell anyone about it. Both shows have a similar set of voice actors (like Grey DeLisle Griffin Daran Norris and Tara Strong) with Daran Norris voicing the bumbling dad of the family. It's worth noting that Jack Thomas the associate story editor for seasons 2-5 of Fairly Odd Parents was the show's executive producer (though he didn't create the show). Still I want to know what you think. Do you think The Replacements is the Disney version of the Fairly Odd Parents? Is that a good thing or a bad thing?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkd2luZm8uY29tL3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkL2FuaW1hbC1raW5nZG9tL3Jldmlldy1hbmltYWwta2luZ2RvbXMtbmV3LWV2ZXJlc3QtYmFzZS1jYW1wLW1hY2Fyb29uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,REVIEW: Animal Kingdom's New Everest Base Camp Macaroon,"A new snack has debuted at Disney’s Animal Kingdom and if you’re someone who can’t wait to have a Matterhorn Macaroon when Disneyland reopens you may just have something to tide you over.

Thirsty River Bar & Trek Snacks located at the foot of Expedition Everest is now offering the Everest Base Camp Macaroon for $5.99. Let’s address the obvious first: this snack is huge! It’s already earning brownie points (or in this case macaroon points) and we haven’t even taken a bite yet! The treat is described as being “Everest-sized” which is exactly right!

It’s a chocolate and coconut macaroon with a “snowcap” of white chocolate. It’s crowned with a snowfall of clear sanding sugar and the base is dipped in dark chocolate and rolled in green tea chocolate crumbs.

This snack tastes as good as it looks. If you like a great macaroon this will float your boat. It’s chewy and sweet while also letting the toasty taste of the coconut shine through. The addition of chocolate is just perfect and reminded me just a bit of Cocoa Krispies. Everyone loves Cocoa Krispies right?

The white chocolate snow cap and coarse sanding sugar provide additional texture and of course sweetness. And the green tea chocolate crumbles are mild and add a pop of color.

My overall thoughts? This is a must-eat. If you’re looking for a completely social media-worthy Disney treat with big flavor and value payoffs this is the one for you. It’s completely yummy.







When you approach Thirsty River Bar and Trek Snacks one line is for beverages and the other is for snacks. Look for the counter with the pretzel warmer and that’ll be the line for you.

One last word of warning: if you’re enjoying the Everest Base Camp Macaroon on even a slightly warm day the green tea chocolate crumbs will melt. I looked down at my jeans after enjoying one of the peaks of the treat and I had managed to get green tea crumbs all down the front of my left leg. Don’t ask me how I managed that because I have no earthly idea. Just keep an eye on those little babies.

Welcome to the Jam! NBA champion and global icon LeBron James goes on an epic adventure alongside timeless Tune Bugs Bunny with the animated/live-action event Space Jam: A New Legacy from director Malcolm D. Lee and an innovative filmmaking team including Ryan Coogler and Maverick Carter.

This transformational journey is a manic mashup of two worlds that reveals just how far some parents will go to connect with their kids. When LeBron and his young son Dom are trapped in a digital space by a rogue A.I. LeBron must get them home safe by leading Bugs Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the A.I.’s digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of professional basketball stars as you’ve never seen them before. It’s Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of his life that will redefine LeBron’s bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy convention supercharge their unique talents and surprise even “King” James by playing the game their own way.

James stars alongside Oscar nominee Don Cheadle (the “Avengers” films “Hotel Rwanda”) Khris Davis (“Judas and the Black Messiah” TV’s “Atlanta”) Sonequa Martin-Green (TV’s “The Walking Dead” “Star Trek: Discovery”) newcomer Cedric Joe Jeff Bergman (“Looney Tunes Cartoons”) and Eric Bauza (“Looney Tunes Cartoons”).

Lee (“Girls Trip” “Night School”) directs from a screenplay by Juel Taylor & Tony Rettenmaier & Keenan Coogler & Terence Nance. The film’s producers are Ryan Coogler LeBron James Maverick Carter and Duncan Henderson and the executive producers are Sev Ohanian Zinzi Coogler Allison Abbate Jesse Ehrman Jamal Henderson Spencer Beighley Justin Lin Terence Nance and Ivan Reitman.

The director’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Salvatore Totino (“Spider-Man: Homecoming”) animation producer Troy Nethercott (“Wonder Park”) production designers Kevin Ishioka (“The Mule”) Akin McKenzie (Netflix’s “When They See Us”) and Clint Wallace (upcoming “Eternals”) editor Bob Ducsay (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters” “Star Wars Episode VIII – The Last Jedi”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Rampage” “War for the Planet of the Apes”). The music is by Kris Bowers (“Greenbook” Netflix’s “Bridgerton”).

Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a Proximity/The SpringHill Company Production a Malcolm D. Lee Film “Space Jam: A New Legacy.” The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures. It will be released in theaters nationwide on July 16 2021 and will be available in the U.S. on HBO Max for 31 days from theatrical release.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8wNC9tZWRpYS9nb2R6aWxsYS12cy1rb25nLWJveC1vZmZpY2UvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBRGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDQvMDQvbWVkaWEvZ29kemlsbGEtdnMta29uZy1ib3gtb2ZmaWNl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Godzilla vs. Kong' is the biggest hit of the pandemic,"New York CNN Business —

The movie theater industry has been in desperate need of good news since the beginning of the pandemic. That good news finally came on Sunday thanks to a giant radioactive lizard and an oversized ape.

Warner Bros.’ monster mash “Godzilla vs. Kong” brought in the biggest opening weekend of the pandemic era so far.

The film which pits two of the most iconic movie monsters in film history against one another nabbed $48.5 million over the five-day holiday weekend in North America according to the studio. The film made $32.2 million for its three-day opening. (Warner Bros. like CNN is owned by WarnerMedia.)

That greatly exceeded industry expectations for the film’s opening which were projected to be closer to $20 million for five days — a hopeful signal to the beleaguered theater industry that moviegoing may be on the mend.

The top opening weekend of the pandemic so far was “Wonder Woman 1984” which made $16.7 million over its first three days in December according to Comscore (SCOR).

“It sure looks like moviegoing is coming back. I can’t think of a simpler way to say it” Shawn Robbins chief analyst of Boxoffice.com told CNN Business. “We’re not out of the woods yet but if I’m a theater owner this feels like new life and if I’m a movie studio this definitely gives me a a lot more confidence to release movies in theaters.”

A $48.5 million opening weekend in normal times would typically not be worth celebrating but movie theaters have been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic for more than a year. The industry had to shut down theaters around the world studios delayed blockbusters and audiences were hard to find even when marquees were turned back on.

The film’s totals are especially impressive considering that theaters are nowhere near full capacity and some aren’t even fully operational yet. Yet it appears that audiences are returning as vaccinations ramp up across the country. This weekend the US delivered more than 4 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine in a 24 hour period.

The opening of “Godzilla vs. Kong” is also a good sign that streaming which is Hollywood’s future can do good business alongside theatergoing which is a big part of Hollywood’s past.

Warner Bros. announced in December that all of its 2021 films would be released in theaters and to HBO Max simultaneously so “Godzilla vs. Kong” was available on WarnerMedia’s streaming service HBO Max and in theaters when it opened last week.

“To me streaming and moviegoing were never really true enemies because they’re two very different experiences” Robbins said. “For the past year people have been stuck at home and moviegoing has left our daily lives and not by choice. Now that choice is back and we’re seeing that people still want to go to the movies.”

Now Hollywood looks towards its most lucrative season.

The big films coming this summer include Universal’s next Fast & Furious film “F9” which is set for theaters in June and Disney and Marvel’s “Black Widow” which is set for theaters and Disney+ in July.

Ultimately time will tell if the successful box office roll out of “Godzilla vs. Kong” this weekend was a solitary event or the beginning of a big turnaround for cineplexes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNnbWFnb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BlcGUtbGUtcGV3LWF4ZWQtZnJvbS1zcGFjZS1qYW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Space Jam Sequel Drops Pepé Le Pew"" - New Trailer Out Now","After years of production long-time Looney Toons character Pepé Le Pew has been cut from Warner Bros. Space Jam: A New Legacy. The flick had originally filmed scenes with the character under director Terence Nance but after he was replaced on the project by Malcolm D. Lee it has been decided that the character and footage will no longer be used.

Looney Toons has come under fire in the past for being politically incorrect with their characters. The company has gradually made changes like removing Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd’s gun use last year. It was only a matter of time before Warner Bros. stepped up and made bigger changes surrounding their out-of-date characters and content.

Pepé Le Pew’s character has gained attention on social media recently. New York Times Columnist Charles M. Blow sounded off on Twitter about how the sexually inappropriate skunk adds to rape culture. Blow states that the character’s behaviour “helped teach boys that “no” didn’t really mean no that it was a part of “the game” the starting line of a power struggle. It taught overcoming a woman’s strenuous even physical objections was normal adorable funny. They didn’t even give the woman the ability to SPEAK.” Most people are commenting on Blow’s Tweet in agreement one person even stating that they use Pepé Le Pew to teach people what NOT to do as an Employment Lawyer.

THANK YOU. I’m an employment lawyer who uses Pepe to train managers on what “unwelcome” means. They get it instantly. — LawyerChyk 🇺🇸🇬🇷🏳️‍🌈 (@LawyerChyk) March 6 2021

The original scene that was cut from the script was described by deadline.com “Pepe was set to appear in a black-and-white Casablanca-like Rick’s Cafe sequence. Pepe playing a bartender starts hitting on a woman at the bar played by Santo. He begins kissing her arm which she pulls back then slamming Pepe into the chair next to hers. She then pours her drink on Pepe and slaps him hard sending him spinning in a stool which is then stopped by LeBron James’ hand. James and Bugs Bunny are looking for Lola and Pepe knows her whereabouts. Pepe then tells the guys that Penelope cat has filed a restraining order against him. James makes a remark in the script that Pepe can’t grab other Tunes without their consent.”

Greice Santo best known for her role on Jane the Virgin was the character alongside the animated animal in the footage. A spokesperson for Santo spoke out about the cut scene ““This was such a big deal for Greice to be in this movie. Even though Pepe is a cartoon character if anyone was going to slap a sexual harasser like him Greice wished it would be her. Now the scene is cut and she doesn’t have that power to influence the world through younger generations who’ll be watching Space Jam 2 to let younger girls and younger boys know that Pepe’s behavior is unacceptable.”

Whether the character should have been cut or not is up for debate but opinions across the board agree that Pepé Le Pew’s behaviour is intolerable. Space Jam: A New Legacy is set to release July 14 2021 hopefully as old fans we will see how Looney Toons has grown with us.

In the coming weeks the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) is expected to approve a pilot project to test an experimental nitrogen-removing septic system known as “layered soil treatment area” — or LSTA for short.

Proposed by a consortium of the town of Charlestown and the University of Rhode Island’s Laboratory of Soil Ecology and Microbiology and New England On-Site Wastewater Training Program the non-proprietary septic system would put nitrogen-removing technology within reach for more coastal homeowners.

Since 2008 the state has required that failing septic systems in the coastal zone be replaced with advanced nitrogen-removing wastewater treatment systems. The requirement also applies to new construction and to major rebuilds.

However despite the more-stringent regulations nitrogen pollution which causes algal blooms oxygen depletion and fish kills continues to be a problem.

A 2016 study funded by a $674000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency $20000 from the town and in-kind contributions from the Salt Ponds Coalition and Save The Bay showed that even with advanced treatment systems nitrate levels in groundwater in some Charlestown neighborhoods and in the town’s salt ponds remained high.

Now armed with a $250000 grant from the town the consortium is proposing to replace several failing conventional septics with LSTA systems which will be monitored for several years to determine their efficacy.

DEM supervising environmental engineer Mohamed Freij said the LSTA system which uses gravity and a single small pump has several advantages over conventional advanced treatment systems.

“The typical denitrification system relies on pumping and circulating the water in different tanks to do denitrification so there is a pumping process going on constantly” he said. “It takes power and there’s a vent and there’s a fan and there’s all kinds of stuff.”

As expensive as they are to install conventional denitrification systems can also be expensive to operate. In addition to regular maintenance they can add $50-$100 a month to a homeowner’s electric bill.

The LSTA process is simpler. The effluent first passes through a layer of sand and then moves down to a second layer which in addition to sand contains sawdust and mulch.

Freij explained that the second layer removes the nitrogen.

“When the nitrates hit that layer the bacteria strips the oxygen from the nitrates and the nitrogen gas escapes into the soil and you will have less nitrogen-loading to the water table” he said.

Consortium member Alissa Cox program director at URI’s New England On-Site Wastewater Training Program noted that the LSTA system is non-proprietary one of the reasons it costs thousands less than a conventional system.

“Nobody owns a patent to this” she said. “We don’t have to put R and D [research and development] dollars into this.”

Matt Dowling the town’s on-site wastewater manager noted that he has these systems budgeted at $20000 each for installation components engineering and design.

“They are highly effective and they’re simple and they’re passive and they’re cheap” the environmental scientist said.

The LSTA concept has been around for a while and was first proposed in Canada in the mid-1990s by University of Waterloo professor Will Robertson. The system is already approved for use in Connecticut and is currently being tested in Massachusetts by the Barnstable County Department of Health and the Environment and in Suffolk County N.Y.

Professor José Amador of URI’s Laboratory of Soil Ecology and Microbiology said it was time to begin testing LSTA systems here in Rhode Island.

“It’s going to be a while before we know everything we need to know about it and that’s why the project that the town of Charlestown wants to carry out and fund is really important” he said. “Because it’s a non-proprietary technology nobody’s going to make any money selling these things and so what’s the incentive other than universities and towns interested finding out how well they perform.”

Dowling said four experimental LSTA systems would be installed at homes with failing septics near Green Hill Pond.

“We did an analysis to find the most densely developed area of Charlestown meaning the most densely OWTS [on-site wastewater treatment system]-heavy portion of Charlestown within proximity to the most impacted salt pond which is Green Hill Pond and eastern Ninigret Pond” he said.

Eastern Ninigret Pond is closed to shellfishing.

Cox said she appreciates the simplicity of the LSTA treatment system.

“I’m interested in sustainable infrastructure related to wastewater treatment and so these LSTA systems provide a really exciting option in certain parts of the landscape … to provide a low-cost alternative to some of the more-expensive proprietary technology that we’re now relying on especially in coastal areas to reduce the nitrogen-loading that’s going into our watersheds and putting human and environmental health at risk” she said.

Freij said the LSTA system if approved for general use might encourage private companies to develop similar low-tech systems.

“I’m hoping this technology will kind of introduce this option that’s lower in price to encourage other technologies maybe to compete a little bit” he said.

Recycling Centers Can Take It All,"The city's two major brush centers are seeing lines of trucks haul in piles of limbs from dead trees and bushes that were killed off during February's record winter storm.

The storm's low temperatures broke records for five or six consecutive days. It was below freezing at San Antonio International Airport for a total of four days and 12 hours one hour shy of the record continuous cold spell of 1951 according to the National Weather Service.

As the city's residents shivered in homes without power the foliage around their homes and throughout the region withered. As skies cleared and the warmth returned trees bushes and other foliage were brown shriveled and in many cases dead.

Many residents started pruning back dead branches in mid-March after seeing no signs of new growth. Piles of dead brush at homes have steadily grown larger.

""Everybody lost so much of their landscaping that the tonnage and participation at our drop off centers (and) our brush recycling centers has really skyrocketed"" said Marcus Lee a spokesman for the city's solid waste management department.

Business is brisk at the Bitters Brush Recycling Center at 1800 Wurzbach Parkway and at the Nelson Gardens Brush Recycling Center at 8963 Nelson Road. The hours of operation early this summer are from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays-Sundays.

Jack Morgan | Texas Public Radio Sabal Palm showing damage

He said loads are weighed and people are charged 25 cents for each 20 pounds of debris they bring in.

Lee said residents who haul in brush to the city's brush recycling centers must make sure those loads are covered as required by city code or risk a fine. He also said residents should bring a photo I.D. and a CPS Energy bill as proof of local residency.

He said residents who need further assistance can call 3-1-1 for an out-of-cycle brush pickup from their homes. There is a charge of $50 for up to four cubic yards and then a $25 charge for each additional four cubic yards.

He said if the debris is largely dead leaves residents can also call 3-1-1 and schedule a leaf collection. He said the first two leaf pickups are free but subsequent requests cost $20.

Lee said residents should rake leaves into brown leaf disposal bags especially designed for such a purpose. He said the city will not take leaves in plastic bags. He added that those marked as biodegradable in fact do not decompose.

Lee said residents can also reduce piles of brush by trimming them into limbs of three feet or less and place them in their green organics cart. He said those carts should not be overstuffed and the lids must be able to close.

Brian Kirkpatrick | Texas Public Radio Nurseries are seeing brisk business as customers shop for new plants.

He said those carts will be picked up on the regular scheduled days but he asked for patience because of all the dead brush being placed curbside.

""We will get to it. If the route is behind give it to five in the afternoon before you report it to 3-1-1 as a missed collection we may just be a little bit behind"" he said.

He said residents also have the option of waiting for one of the city's two major curbside brush pickup days. He said residents will find a tag on their doors when their neighborhood is scheduled.

He said all the debris coming into brush recycling sites is turned into either coarsely ground mulch or finely ground mulch. Residents can have the coarse mulch for free or pay a small fee for 20 pounds of fine mulch. Both varieties help landscaping retain moisture during San Antonio's long hot summer months.

All those dead plants has led to a planting boom too. Local nurseries like Rainbow Gardens set some sales records in March.

While some people are hardly working others are designing the next generation of space vehicles.

Since space expansion doesn’t seem to be slowing down some people have made it their day job to design the next generation of space vehicles. One of those people is Joshua Cotter  a freelance designer out of Hollywood CA. Looking on his ArtStation page you’ll quickly find that he has a passion for space and the likes including robotics and even weaponry.The vehicle in question here is dubbed the D25 Modular Rover. Just as the name would suggest this other worldly vehicle is supposed to meet more than one need a huge plus for when being utilized on an off-world base with limited space for multiple vehicles.To make things easier to understand let me begin by saying there are three main components to the D25. The first and most important is the platform. Like that of a cargo truck chassis this component seems to include the entire drivetrain for the rover and probably the entire propulsion system.The designer makes no mention of how this vehicle is meant to be powered but seeing how things are moving these days I'd bet my bottom dollar that it’s going to be electric. After all the base does look large enough to include everything from in-wheel motors to battery packs. The front of the chassis includes only one set of wheels as this section will be subject to the cabin crew module which is much lighter than the module placed on the rear.The cab module is absolutely nothing more that the brains of the operations. Here crew members are completely protected from the harsh elements of space through means of a separate structure from the rest of the rover. If it’s a monocoque build all the better. The cabin module is also part of the modular components list and depending on the job at hand it can be changed with an appropriate cabin.At the rear of the chassis you’ll notice two set of wheels. Why? Well the main function expressed in this design is that of a waste transport. Yes it’s a garbage truck. The largest component aside from the chassis is the waste transportation module on the rear.Just to make things clear the D25 Modular Rover is a vehicle that’s meant to collect and transport any kind of waste that may be produced by human operations or simply to clear an area of debris so that human expansion can occur.Go ahead and laugh but when you think about it vehicles like these will be a must whenever human exploration begins to turn into human expansion. Even exploration produces waste. What you think all those rovers that mankind has already sent to Mars have made it home?As far as any other components regarding suspension possible interior options or even how waste is removed and disposed of is not mentioned. At this stage in development it makes no sense to bother with such design aspects.One thing you may notice however is that NASA SpaceX and even Tesla seem to be in on this project. Well for the time being they aren’t. These brands are there just for show. That’s not to say that one day they very well could be on the side of a vehicle much like the D25.For now it’s just a design that’s meant to give you a taste of what some people do for a living and how their work is influencing the very future of mankind.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9iZXR0ZXItZm9vZC13YXN0ZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXdpbGwtZ2l2ZS1pbmRpYS1ib3RoLW51dHJpdGlvbmFsLWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudGFsLXNlY3VyaXR5L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgxODc2MjgxLmNtc9IBmQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9iZXR0ZXItZm9vZC13YXN0ZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXdpbGwtZ2l2ZS1pbmRpYS1ib3RoLW51dHJpdGlvbmFsLWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudGFsLXNlY3VyaXR5L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MTg3NjI4MS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Better food waste management will give India both nutritional and environmental security’,"Congratulations!

teaches civil and environmental engineering at Princeton University. Speaking toat she discusses her research on what links food waste  urban hunger and sustainable energy in Indian cities:I look at sustainable cities from the perspective of civic provisional systems — that includes food shelter water energy mobility waste management  open spaces and green infrastructure. Our data sets help cities track their progress in development and energy access as well as greenhouse gas emissions and thereby climate actions. We research these provisioning systems and their impacts on environment health social inequality and resilience or security.Human existence is increasingly urban — already more than half of India lives in urban locations. If you look at agglomerations using night lights we are far more urban than commonly understood. By 2050 almost 70% of humanity will be living in cities. Cities also generate 90% of the world’s GDP. They have a global impact even though they occupy only three and a half percent of Earth’s land surface. Particularly through the sectors I mentioned which we compare across India and the US cities are affecting the planet both environmentally as well as how we live in terms of our social and economic inequality. And food systems are especially relevant in this regard.We’ve found a significant amount of food insecurity in India’s cities. In 2019 we studied Delhi Chandigarh Puducherry  Goa Ahmedabad Chennai and so on. A great deal of attention is paid to rural food insecurity in India but even in these cities we found protein and carbohydrate deficiencies based on the National Sample Survey’s consumer expenditure data. In some places 40% of the population was under the threshold — this is where inequality really hits hard. The lower socioeconomic strata in such urban areas was clearly facing considerable food insecurity. And Covid-19 has only exacerbated that. In India we must acknowledge such urban food insecurity. In the US too food insecurity has grown in cities — while American cities are more homogenous there are notable differences among racial and ethnic groups in terms of what is being consumed. What our research also found is that if we do better food waste management we could have both food security and environmental sustainability in our cities. The management of food waste is therefore key.Most food waste in India actually takes place upstream or between farm to city — the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) quantifies that about 40% food waste in India takes place often because most small-scale farmers don’t have adequate food storage or cold chain facilities. Food waste is also caused by pestilence and rotting. Households themselves don’t throw away much edible food which is in contrast to the US where over 40% food is wasted by consumers. In India food waste is mostly pre-consumer — in the US it is post-consumer. The urban nutritional shortfalls we saw were mostly income-related caused by high urban poverty. Even if people were earning better wages in cities rents and other expenses were higher for those who have migrated. However better food waste management would mean less price volatility and thereby reduced food insecurity.If food decomposes anaerobically it uses up oxygen and releases methane which has greenhouse gas impacts. Further in India our agricultural sector markedly over-fertilises crops. With less food waste we can minimise such excessive use of fertilisers which has huge environmental impacts through nitrogen release that contributes to air and groundwater pollution. We also have crop burning which further increases air pollution. All these agricultural issues can be solved by tackling food waste more effectively.Researchers studied waste in neighbourhoods across Delhi — it came to about a kilogram per household each day. This is much smaller than the US — but of that household waste more than half was food waste. These are food scraps and not something that can really be eaten but this gives us valuable opportunities. One of the most important is generating biogas from such food waste. If cities segregate their food waste they can convert it to energy which would really benefit India where it can be a cooking fuel and even substitute imports of LPG. There are scientific ways of separating such food scraps to generate biogas. This can be done in a decentralised way — neighbourhoods can set up small waste management plants. Food scraps have huge potential to create sustainability in our cities"

The accident happened as the sub was working on sea-floor installations in the Motovskiy Bay not far from Russia’s maritime border to Norway.

After the accident AS-31 was transported to Zvezdochka a part of the Russian state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation and Russia’s largest ship repair center located in Severodvinsk on the coast of the White Sea.

In March this year specialists at the yard completed the task of extracting the deep-diving submarine’s nuclear reactor core.

Losharik was supposed to originally undergo restorations in 2020 however the reconstruction was postponed and rescheduled for 2021. According to state-affiliated news agency TASS the operation lasted approximately one month and happened without problems. A source speaking to TASS who claims to have close connections to the Russian Defense Ministry states that Losharik is now starting to undergo restoration after the fire and modernization.

Losharik is constructed from seven spherical titanium hulls. The front five hulls are interconnected while the last two are paired up and hold AS-31’s nuclear reactor and machinery. According to TASS’s source the deep-diving submarine’s titanium hull suffered practically no damages. The nuclear reactor itself powering the submarine will not be replaced and are ready to work with the new uranium fuel elements in place.

The submarine which was first laid down in 1988 but was only launched in 2003 due to financial issues could be utilized for deep-sea operations down to depths of six kilometers.

Based on project 19831’s objectives under which Losharik operates AC-31’s tasks include providing light for surrounding landscapes exploration missions and manipulating various external products such as installing sensors and cutting underwater cables according to Lenta.

Particularly the latter has raised concerns regarding Russia’s potential for using AS-31 for submarine cable interference against adversaries.

Forbes has previously emphasized the capability of Russian submarines to damage underwater cables running from the United States to mainland Europe. Navy Lookout has also emphasized the vulnerability of “the world’s communications backbone” with regards to the threat of Russian submarine interference which became all the more advanced and recurrent after the Cold War.

Losharik’s renovation and modernization might once again strengthen Russia’s underwater warfare grip.

The push to diversify banking from within the industry

The racial reckoning in America calling for diversity has touched every industry including banking.

According to a report from the Committee for Better Banks -- a bank workers' advocacy group -- Black and Latino employees have a significantly smaller chance of holding an executive position in corporate banks in comparison to their white counterparts.

""I heard lots of stories of workers of color who said 'I've applied for 15 jobs 20 jobs never got an interview I always had good performance reviews by my manager ... but never got an interview'"" Nick Weiner the lead author of the CBB report told ABC News.

The report finds that Black and Latino employees at 13 major U.S. banks have a less than 25% chance of being promoted or hired for a senior management or executive position in comparison to their white colleagues. Black and Latinos also have a very high likelihood of being in an entry-level position with limited mobility such as bank teller and call center employees in comparison to their white colleges the report also found.

The study gave the financial industry a ""C"" grade for diversity. African American and Latino representation were given a ""D"" and Asian representation a ""C.""

A lack of diversity in corporate America is nothing new but the impact is even more widespread in banking. African Americans and Hispanics are less likely than their white counterparts to receive home mortgages personal loans and are more likely to lack trust in banking and lack banking access and resources.

Reese Giddins the president of Greenwood Bank who worked in corporate banking for several years before helping to start minority-focused and owned bank Greenwood said the lack of diversity may contribute to the lack of trust in financial institutions from minorities.

""When you don't have people that look like you that can't understand you and can't help you it's hard to build that trust. With Greenwood we're trying to rebuild that trust in our community along with the recirculation of the dollars into the community as well as bringing in that talent"" Giddins told ABC News.

Many banks including those studied in the CBB report released statements following the death of George Floyd promising to diversify and provide racial equity.

However further steps to diversify the industry are needed said Wells Fargo employee Ted Laurel.

""I would say that we would need more change beyond just adding more ranks of minorities into our leadership ... A two-prong approach would definitely help moving the employees up from the bottom that we already have and then also recruiting more diverse talent especially from those minority colleges"" Laurel said.

A number of banks including US Bank and Wells Fargo were given an ""F"" grade in the report. According to the report authors these banks declined to provide its researchers with data on ""the total number of employees within race groups at the company.""

A spokesperson from Wells Fargo told ABC News the company has work to do with improving diversity but is making strides.

""Wells Fargo is committed to doing the work to ensure we provide our employees with an inclusive and respectful workplace where diverse talent flourishes. While we have more work to do we have taken steps that include creating a diverse segments representation and inclusion group reporting directly to the CEO that is accountable for progress and execution of new and existing programs conducting diversity-focused talent reviews and sponsorship programs to help promote underrepresented groups assessing senior leaders on increasing diverse representation at leadership levels and requiring unconscious bias training for all managers. We are committed to sharing results"" Well Fargo told ABC News via a statement.

""In 2020 we broadly disclosed our EEO-1 data for the first time and we intend to publish our 2019 and 2020 Consolidated EEO-1 gender/race employment data in the summer of 2021 as part of our updated ESG reporting process. Wells Fargo values diversity and inclusion not just as a business imperative but because it's the right thing to do"" Wells Fargo senior vice president Kate Pulley also said in a statement to ABC News.

Wells Fargo has also recently hired Kleber Santos in November of 2020 to lead Diverse Segments Representation & Inclusion to improve internal diversity and equity.

US Bank employee Marcus Dodson said transparency is needed to fully see how the issue is being resolved.

""What I would like to see is transparency ... a focus on diversity. From what I've seen we've had these trainings that we take online. I would say that there hasn't been a focus on minority hiring minority issues or having difficult conversations"" Dodson said

US Bank declined ABC News' request for an interview but released the following statement:

""The findings in this report are not accurate and do not reflect information we've released publicly including in our 2020 Environmental Social and Governance Report which is available on our website"" US Bank vice president Lee Henderson said in a statement.

According to its Social and Governance report US Bank has committed to $100 million annually in access to capital for Black business owners and provided $1 million to Black-led community development financial institutions.

Greenwood which Giddins says officially will launch this summer has recently announced Wells Fargo as one of their top investors.

However Reese is hoping the partnership from their investors which he said also includes Mastercard Bank of America and Chase leads to more than just financial gains.

""What we're focused on and really trying to create is trust back in the community the opportunity to affect Black and Latin[o] businesses. That's really our focus. And that's really what we're trying to get to out of these partnerships that we have…I'd like to see more sponsorship of classrooms and inner cities to essentially help individuals who want careers in banking. I'd like to see more processes in place for folks that work the phone but that have the skill set to move up"" Giddins says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2RlbnRvbnJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N1bmFnby1iZWxsLXNob3dzLW9mZi1iaXJkcy1leWUtdmlldy1vZi1jaXR5LWluLW9wZW4taG91c2UvYXJ0aWNsZV9hOGE1YmFkNS1kYTJkLTU5OGQtOTk1Mi0xMThkYzc1Y2ExNTUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sunago Bell shows off bird's-eye view of city in open house,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The 76ers are getting back to normalcy.

For the first time this season a limited number of fans sat courtside during the Sixers’ game against the Minnesota Timberwolves Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center.

All fans sitting courtside were required to take an on-site rapid COVID test prior to entry. After presenting a negative test they received a wrist band and entered through a separate designated entrance.

Fans sitting within 30 feet of the arena floor may only eat or drink in the building’s Center City Club. No food or beverages will be permitted in the courtside seats. Facemasks must also be worn at all times except for eating and drinking in the Center City Club.

The Sixers started having around 3000 ticketed fans at the arena on March 14 when they played the San Antonio Spurs. The Sixers prevailed that night 134-99 in what was their first home game after the All-Star break. Saturday marked their fifth game with ticketed fans in the stands.

Iggy Brazdeikis is excited to join Sixers

The Sixers introduced Iggy Brazdeikis one of their newest players to the media on Saturday.

The second-year small forward was acquired from the New York Knicks on March 25 in a three-team deal that enabled the Sixers to get George Hill from the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Brazdeikis spent a chunk of his time with the Knicks’ NBA G League affiliate the Westchester Knicks averaging 20.9 points 8.1 rebounds and 3.3 assists in a combined 36 games over two seasons.

In regards to the NBA the 6-foot-6 221-pounder has only made a combined 13 appearances with the Knicks with four coming this season. He’s averaged 1.5 points and 4.6 minutes in those 13 appearances.

“It’s been all kind of crazy” he said of the trade process. “Everything happened really fast. Biggest thing is I’m really excited to be here grateful for this opportunity to be a part of this organization this winning organization.

“Everyone’s been great so far everything’s been smooth getting workouts in and stuff just getting used to the whole place.”

Brazdeikis who was born in Lithuania arrived in the Philadelphia area the day after the trade. He’s been working out with player development staff members at the Sixers’ practice facility in Camden while the team was on the road trip. He met his new teammates during Saturday’s shootaround. Hill and new two-way player Mason Jones were also in attendance.

Hill gets up shots

Hill did not participate in any team workouts at the shootaround.

The 34-year-old point guard had surgery on his right thumb on Feb. 2 and is still doing rehab. The Sixers don’t want to rush him back.

“No contact” Doc Rivers said of George. “He shot the ball. He shoots the ball great. But there’s no timetable or anything like that yet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvNzZlcnMvbmV3cy9zaXhlcnMtbGltaXRlZC1mYW5zLWNvdXJ0c2lkZS10aW1iZXJ3b2x2ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sixers Will Have Limited Fans Courtside vs. Timberwolves,"The Sixers will have fans moving closer to the court on Saturday.

A little over a year since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the NBA along with the rest of the United States of America the country is slowly but surely getting back to normal. In Philadelphia the sports teams have been granted permission to start allowing some fans to enter arenas and stadiums so they can enjoy live sports again.

At the beginning of the year the Philadelphia 76ers played their games at the Wells Fargo Center with nothing but team personnel local media and arena employees spectating the game.

However last month the state of Pennsylvania eased its restrictions and the city of Philly matched it which allowed a little over 3000 Sixers fans to enter the Wells Fargo Center for the first time since early March of last season.

Now the Sixers are able to move onto their next phase of getting everything back to normal as they will allow a limited number of fans to sit in courtside seats on Saturday night as they take on the Minnesota Timberwolves.

According to The Philadelphia Inquirer's Keith Pompey an undisclosed amount of fans will be permitted to take a rapid on-site COVID-19 test before entering the Wells Fargo Center if they are sitting near courtside.

Typically the arena only requires temperature checks and filled-out questionnaires before entering but the Sixers and the NBA will have to ensure the closest fans are not COVID positive to be safe before they sit near the players.

After fans register a negative test they will be given a wristband before entering the arena through a separate designated entrance. Attending a Sixers game still isn't the same these days but at least everything is improving and moving in the right direction as the country works to get things back to normal.

Located along the banks of the Pamlico River Pamlico Plantation offers residents a chance to soak up the sun on the water or land in a private secluded setting.

The neighborhood was developed by the Weyerhaeuser Corporation on property along the Pamlico River. The developers originally intended for the community to be marketed as a sailing community and a large majority of sailboats are docked at the marina. The land was chosen for the dense cover of trees and the community continues to preserve the wildlife and greenery originally found on the land. The development is adjacent to Goose Creek State Park meaning stunning vistas and outdoor activities are never far from the homes.

Pamlico Plantation consists of 80 townhomes and 200 other single family home sites within the confines of a private and gated community. Of these 200 sites some are vacant lots. Townhomes in the neighborhood have between two and three bedrooms while single family homes vary more in terms of size.

“There’s such a brain trust of knowledge here. We have all sorts of interesting people and it’s just fascinating what stories they bring to the neighborhood. It’s a very friendly accepting community”said Gennell Monagham a resident and member of the volunteer marketing committee. “Even though we haven’t had an opportunity to have indoor activities because of COVID the neighborhood is really great for outdoor activities.”

Every property comes with a dedicated boat slip at the Pamlico Plantation Marina. In addition to marina residents can enjoy amenities such as pickleball and tennis courts a large community pool a children’s play area and a fully functioning library with a large selection of books magazines and movies available to rent.

Several of these homes and properties are currently available for purchase. 14 undeveloped lots are on the market with an average listing price of $49979. Two homes are for sale with an average listing price of $291500. No townhomes in the development are currently available for rent or purchase.

“We have a very diverse population from people who are retired and have moved from other areas across the country. We do have families with young children who work locally and a lot of people who work in the medical field” Monagham said.

Pamlico Plantation fosters this sense of community through their available clubs and volunteer opportunities. Current clubs include those that focus on books hunting knitting and crocheting bridge and Mah Jongg and two men’s breakfast groups. There is also a Committee Relations Committee that focuses on welcoming newcomers and sponsors various social activities for residents.",,,,,,,,,,,,

When the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses started last April so many of Southern Bancorp’s customers didn’t qualify for the relief money that the Arkansas bank’s chief executive Darrin Williams turned to donors to raise money for $1000 grants so it wouldn’t have to turn applicants away empty-handed.

The bank made 128 such grants giving more than 100 of them to businesses run by women or minority owners. One let a nail salon owner buy plexiglass so she could reopen. Another allowed a small cafe to buy safety gear for its staff. A day care used the money for the new sanitizing equipment it needed.

Roy's belief that he was no longer fit to coach is the hugest shock for most of the UNC community including former Tar Heel players like Brice Johnson and Kenny Williams.

CHAPEL HILL N.C. (WTVD) -- As the Final Four tips off the college basketball world is still processing the retirement of Hall of Fame coach Roy Williams -- including former players who say even two days later they still can't believe it.

""I thought he would coach forever"" said Brice Johnson a former Tar Heel. ""The way he treats the guys. Being around the guys for so long ... he just loved being around everyone.""

Thirty-three years as a Division I college basketball coach 903 wins and three NCAA championships -- all impressive -- but former players said none of that compares to the impact he's had on their lives off the court.

""When you look for a college coach coming out of high school you look for a guy that would instill some of the things that your parents do because you're leaving home"" Johnson said. ""I think Coach Williams was really an extension of my father just off the fact that he cared more so of Brice the person than Brice the player.""

Kenny Williams like Johnson played all four years for Williams. Kenny Williams said he was shocked to hear the news about Roy Williams' retirement. He even drove from Richmond on Thursday to see his former coach and attend his final news conference.

""I still remember to this day it was the day before my first game"" Kenny Williams said. ""I was dealing with some family stuff and I had gotten emotional. This was right after practice. He pulled me to the side and we talked for 45 minutes to an hour just about it. I was able to vent and he just talked me through it.""

What stuck out to him most was the reason why Roy Williams was retiring -- his belief that he's no longer the right man for the job.

""It's almost like you want to take him and shake him and be like 'Coach yes you are you're the man for this job'"" Kenny Williams said. ""It's tough because me personally I was going to do whatever he asked to the best of my ability even if he asked me to run through a brick wall. For him to not be able to connect with the kids to the point where he felt like it was time for him to step down it's tough for me because I know how great he is. I know how much it means to him. I know how many sleepless nights he's had just trying to get through them more.""

In his final news conference Roy Williams talked about a moment during Kenny Williams' last game where he kissed him on the forehead. It's one of his favorite pictures and one he keeps on his desk.

""Looking back on it to be one of the players to have an impact like that on a Hall-of-Fame coach it means a lot to me"" Kenny Williams said. ""I was super emotional when I came out of the game ... I think it signifies our relationship is so much more than just basketball. It's off the court that really meant the most to me.""

Kenny Williams said it was freshman year when he realized he made the right choice coming to North Carolina and being coached by Roy Williams.

""I came in as a shooter and I hadn't hit a three my whole freshman year"" Kenny Williams recalled. ""He told me one day 'You know Kenny when you hit your first one nobody is going to be as happy as me.' You go back and you watch the video and it's kind of funny. I shoot the three and all of the coaches are leaning to the side and it goes in and Coach -- this is when his knees were pretty bad -- he's almost at halfcourt just super excited. That was really my confirmation that this is where I'm supposed to be. This is the place I'm supposed to be at because he said what he said to me and it was months later and it showed that he meant it.""

Johnson said words from his college coach have resonated with him.

""Me and (former UNC player) Joel James loved this quote: 'Rome wasn't built in a day but it was worked on every day'"" Johnson said. ""That's definitely my favorite quote from Coach because everything doesn't just happen overnight. You have to continue to work on things every single day to make life better. That's how life works and that's how basketball works so you just have to keep working every day.""

Williams cultivated a family atmosphere at UNC Johnson said.

""When he brings guys in he brings them in as family"" Johnson said. ""We're all his sons an extension of his own family. Carolina basketball has been a family even back when he was coaching under Coach (Dean) Smith. He really did a great job of continuing with that aspect of it. This is a huge family and we all treat each other just like that.""

As the search for UNC's next coach continues former players hope to keep that family tradition alive -- and hire a Tar Heel.

""We have built so much on the Carolina Family that I'd like to keep it that way"" Kenny Williams said. ""We've got plenty of candidates but I think personally if (assistant) Coach (Hubert) Davis were to get the job I'd be super ecstatic just because of what he's meant to me in my four years ... there are three people that I group in together in terms of their love for Carolina and it's Coach Williams Coach Davis and (Director of Player Development Eric) Hoots. If he were able to get the job I'd be super excited for him.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmxvY2t0b24uY29tL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvc2FyYWgtZG93bmV5LXRvLWxlYWQtbG9ja3RvbnMtdXMtZXhlY3V0aXZlLXJpc2stY2xhaW1zLWFuZC1ibG9ja2NoYWlu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sarah Downey to lead Lockton's US Executive Risk Claims and Blockchain Advisory,"Sarah Downey one of the leading D&O and executive risk claims and coverage expert has joined Lockton to lead Executive Risk Claims.

Traffic inside Las Vegas casinos is picking up again but it’s not all driven by young travelers with pent-up demand.

Casino operators say customers 65 and over have started to return spurred by the growing availability of COVID-19 vaccines across the country.

“As more of the older end of the customer spectrum receives vaccines and becomes more comfortable with leaving their houses … that for sure means they’ll start to step out and go back to their favorite casinos again” said gaming consultant Josh Swissman of The Strategy Organization.

‘Starting to trickle back in’

Bob Bransdon a 68-year-old Las Vegas local said he used to visit casinos with his wife about once a week. Then the shutdowns came.

The two spent months away from casinos while they were closed and continued to avoid the properties after their June reopenings out of caution. They weren’t alone: The pandemic had led to a sharp decline in casino visitation from the 65-plus age group which is more susceptible to severe illness tied to COVID-19.

That could be turning around. Bransdon who started visiting casinos again in August said he has noticed an uptick in the 65-and-older crowd especially in the afternoons. He said the numbers aren’t what they were before the pandemic but there is “no shortage of people there.”

Some casino operators have noticed the uptick too. Several executives discussed the trend in recent weeks during the latest round of casino companies’ earnings calls.

“We’re beginning to see that part of the database that 65 and older if you will database starting to trickle back in” Golden Entertainment Chairman and CEO Blake Sartini said during a March 11 call. “We see that as a great catalyst going forward.”

The heads of other Las Vegas casino operators — including Red Rock Resorts Inc. Boyd Gaming Corp. and Penn National Gaming Inc. — also have said they have started to notice that this age group is rebounding.

“I think up until very recently that the 65-year-plus demographic has been fairly shy about coming back to the facility” Frank Fertitta III CEO of Red Rock Resorts said during a February call with investors. “If the vaccine has continued ramp-up and rollout we are cautiously optimistic that we’re starting to see the 65-plus demographic slowly return back to our facility.”

One of the major driving forces behind this demographic’s return has been the rollout of vaccinations. As of Friday 22.4 percent of American adults had been fully vaccinated according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of those vaccinations have gone toward those in older age groups with 53.5 percent of Americans 65 and older fully vaccinated.

Jo Ann Woodward 72 has not yet received a vaccine but that hasn’t stopped the Phoenix resident from making her regular Las Vegas trips.

Woodward has made two solo trips to Las Vegas during the pandemic and plans to return in April. By that time she hopes to be vaccinated — she’s waiting to receive a Johnson & Johnson vaccine so she can have a “one and done” shot — and she expects more friends will be ready to join her once they’ve all had shots in arms.

“They think that now that they’ve had the vaccine they’re immune (from the virus) and they can go wherever they want” she said. “I probably will have more people that want to go with me when I’m vaccinated.”

More confidence to venture outside the home paired with pent-up demand is good news for casinos according to Stifel analyst Steve Wieczynski.

“We expect a significant amount of pent-up demand from the (55 and older) demographic as vaccinations kick in and the country slowly goes back to normal” he said in a Feb. 25 note.

Spokespeople for the two of the six largest casino operators in Las Vegas — Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp. — did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for Boyd MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment Inc. declined to comment and a Red Rock spokesman referred to comments made by executives during the latest earnings calls.

A lucrative customer

The fact that any age group is coming back to Las Vegas is “huge” said gaming consultant Debi Nutton but the 65-plus demographic can be especially lucrative.

“Your kids are off to college; you’ve established yourself in your career” she said of the age group. “They have more discretionary income.”

According to a 2019 report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority baby boomers spent more than millennials in nearly every category including food and drink transportation shopping and sightseeing. They also spent far more on gambling budgeting an average of $838.20 per trip compared with millennials’ $350.47.

“You’re talking about a majority of the (casinos’) customer base” said Clyde Barrow a gaming industry expert and professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. “Certainly for the core (gambling customer) the table games and the slot machines. Maybe not so much for the clubs and the concerts the pool parties and those things.”

Those spending habits should carry forward in 2021. Management at Red Rock Resorts said they believe older customers have plenty of discretionary spending after months of lockdowns and limited entertainment options.

“They seem to be in pretty good shape from a financial standpoint because they just haven’t been spending their money. There’s a lot of disposable income there” said Lorenzo Fertitta vice chairman of Red Rock’s board during the company’s earnings call. “They’re anxious to come back.”

This crowd also could help solve one of the greatest challenges Las Vegas resorts have faced since the onset of the pandemic: filling rooms midweek.

Midweek occupancy rates aren’t expected to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon — conventions probably will need to make a full comeback before that can happen — but UNLV Assistant Professor of Hospitality Amanda Belarmino said as far as midweek leisure travel goes older customers lead the pack.

Their return is “highly significant for Las Vegas” she said. “They’re retired. They have that flexibility to travel midweek.”

Convergence of young and old

Virginia Valentine president of the Nevada Resort Association said the state’s resorts are “excited” to welcome back more guests as vaccines roll out and people feel more comfortable traveling.

“Those guests 65 years and older have had earlier access to the vaccine and we would anticipate their return as they feel more comfortable venturing out and resuming activities they enjoy” she said. “Our members value this customer segment and we’re happy to have them back.”

Boyd Gaming which has started to see its older core customers return expects the trend to broaden in the second and third quarters according to a March 11 note from J.P. Morgan based on conversations with Boyd CEO Keith Smith and CFO Josh Hirsberg.

The operators’ challenge will be figuring out how to attract older gamblers while also keeping their newer younger gamblers interested in returning. It’ll be easier said than done especially as other entertainment options such as clubs and shows reopen and vie for the attention of younger crowds.

“Most operators believe that as events movie theaters restaurants open up that younger customer could be fleeting” Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon said.

But online offerings could help gaming companies earn the loyalty of these newer younger customers even as other entertainment venues open their doors Beynon said.

“Given the convergence of land and digital — with online and land-based (betting) — these customers may appreciate that a little bit more” he said. “They’ll spend money online betting on a sports game but then maybe go to the land-based property that’s tied in with that asset.”

An image of “Ann-Margret” from “Viva Las Vegas” and a scooter from “Vegas! The Show” are shown at the David Saxe Production offices in Las Vegas. (David Saxe)

At some point in the conversation Ann-Margret casually drops the initials. “E.P.”

As in “We were friends for a long time E.P. and I. We met on the movie we had several things in common including a love for Las Vegas. We dated and we just had a great time together.”

E.P. would be Elvis Presley and the movie was “Viva Las Vegas” the 1964 classic that solidified the city’s image as place to set yer soul on fire. The scene where the duo blaze through “C’mon Everybody” with the “University of Nevada” lettering in the background was set at what is today UNLV’s Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art.

It is appropriate then that Ann-Margret heads up the list of inductees for the upcoming 17th Annual UNLV College of Fine Arts Hall of Fame event set for April 13 at the university’s outdoor Valerie Pida Plaza. The event was rescheduled from last year because of pandemic public-gathering restrictions.

Ann-Margret joins the writer and cultural critic Dave Hickey Harrah’s headlining magician Mac King and Luxor headlining comedian Carrot Top (legal name Scott Thompson) as fellow inductees. Trumpet great and singer Brian Newman will receive the inaugural Las Vegas Newcomer Award. Newman has made an impact in town as bandleader and performer for Lady Gaga and as the front man for the “After Dark” late-night hang at NoMad Restaurant.

Also being recognized with the Koep Dean’s Medal are Justin Favela UNLV alumnus and mixed media and installation artist; and Candy Schneider vice president of education and outreach for The Smith Center for the Performing Arts. Stage director and educator Giovanna Sardelli (daughter of esteemed Vegas singer Nelson Sardelli) and mixed-media artist Sush Machida will be recognized as Alumni of the Year.

The Hall of Fame was founded in 2003 to honor past and present residents of Southern Nevada who have made a significant impact in the areas of visual arts performing arts and/or architecture. Past inductees include Tony Curtis Phyllis McGuire Robert Goulet The Killers Wayne Newton Liberace Clint Holmes Penn & Teller Lance Burton and Siegfried & Roy.

Ann-Margret is no question a deserving member of that list of dignitaries especially at UNLV. “Viva Las Vegas” was directed by UNLV College of Fine Arts Hall of Fame inaugural inductee and film-studies guest speaker George Sidney. Ann-Margret was cast in the film about four years after opening in Las Vegas as a performer at the since-imploded Dunes.

“I started in 1960. I was a toddler very young” she said with a laugh. “I had been at Northwestern for about a year and three gentlemen and I created a band called the Suttletones and were hired by the Dunes lounge. We were on at like 5 in the afternoon until 8 o’clock at night. Nobody came to see us perform. They were in there to drink and talk.”

Tony Bennett and Al Hirt with whom Ann-Margret would later record were headlining the showroom at the time.

Ann-Margret wend on to forge a successful stage career in Vegas with her Dunes shows leading to a stint opening for George Burns at the Sahara. She headlined Las Vegas Hilton and Caesars Palace along with the Dunes. She has also been nominated for two Oscars (for 1971’s “Carnal Knowledge” and 1975’s “Tommy”) along with five Golden Globe awards two Grammys and an Emmy.

The headliner also developed a fondness for motorcycles starting with the Honda 150 she cruised in “Viva Las Vegas.” That scene was the inspiration for a number in “Vegas! The Show” at Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood the Honda swapped out for a Vespa.

Ann-Margret had graduated to a Harley-Davidson and rode one to the the opening of the Harley-Davidson Cafe on the Strip in 1999. As she says “I love my motorcycles and the big noise they make.”

The entertainer has no real “feel” for today’s Las Vegas having spent many years away from the city.

“It has been so long I really don’t know what it’s like now” she said. “But I have very fond memories so many good friends there. I have good warm fabulous feelings about Las Vegas. Performing there helped me put three children through college.”

The classic film too is a fond memory as is “E.P.”

“What can I say?” Ann-Margret said. “Yes certainly admired and respected him. We were a lot alike and made a great movie together.”

When was the last time she saw “Viva Las Vegas?” Not recently.

“When it came out in 1964” Ann-Margret said with a laugh. “I never see my movies more than once. I like to keep it it that way in my memories.”

CLASS 2A

Eden Prairie 6 Maple Grove 5 (OT)

Eden Prairie's Carter Batchelder scored with 1:02 left in overtime to complete a hat trick and put the Eagles into the Class 2A state championship game.

CLASS 1A

Dodge County 4 Little Falls 1

Talk about a magnificent seven.

Dodge County junior forward Brody Lamb who wears No. 7 on his back put his team there as well. He tallied a hat trick — his seventh this season — as the Wildcats defeated Little Falls 4-1 in a Class 1A tournament semifinal.

Lamb the state's top scorer padded his lead with goals 49 50 and 51 sending first-time state tournament entrant Dodge County to Saturday's championship game. The Wildcats (19-3-1) face No. 2 seed Gentry Academy (18-0) at 6 p.m.

""I didn't really think honestly that we would make it this far"" Lamb said. ""But anything can happen. It's going to be fun.""

Gentry Academy 5 East Grand Forks 3

A little levity is never a bad thing. Especially for a team staring down adversity — and potentially a loss — for the first time.

Barrett Hall's laughter-inducing attempt at a between-the-legs shot in the third period Friday just might have been the play of the game for Gentry Academy. The effort seemed to cut the tension on the Stars' bench and free up the state's only unbeaten untied team to rally to defeat East Grand Forks what was by far its most competitive game of the season.

""I didn't even mean to try to do that the puck just hit off my back foot and I tried to get my stick on it"" Hall said about his trick-shot misfire after he scored twice in Gentry Academy's 5-3 victory over East Grand Forks in a Class 1A semifinal at Xcel Energy Center.

The Eagles had dropped two consecutive Class 2A state championship games and three since 2016. In 2019 Eden Prairie fell to rival Edina in overtime.

The Eagles were owed a little late-game magic.

They found it this weekend.

One night after winning a 6-5 thriller in overtime over Maple Grove Eden Prairie did it again Saturday.

The Eagles outlasted Lakeville South 2-1 in double overtime with Jackson Blake burying a shot off a rebound that came out in front off a sharp-angle shot to give Eden Prairie its third state title.

The goal brought tears on the Xcel Energy Center ice again for Eden Prairie. Only this time they were tears of joy. A few past state tournament demons may have been exorcised right then and there.

“It was pretty special because being in the championship three years in a row and four out of five years and not coming up short we knew we were doing the right things” Eagles coach Lee Smith said. “But somehow we just needed to figure out how to finish the deal. And now no one could say that we didn’t.”

That it was Blake who potted the winner was fitting. He made the choice to return from the United State Hockey League in January to make a go at a state title. Seniors Mason Langenbrunner and Luke Mittelstadt made similar decisions to play for their high school team to try to win a state tournament that there was no guarantee would even take place.

“It’s nice to see that they were rewarded” Smith said.

Eden Prairie got the scoring started in the first period when Carter Batchelder — who scored the overtime winner for the Eagles in Friday’s semis — received a drop pass from Drew Holt and buried a shot from the circle.

The Eagles buzzed for the first period and beyond controlling the game until they went on a power play early in the second period. The Cougars’ penalty kill unit stifled Eden Prairie’s power play and even generated a few chances of its own.

That sparked Lakeville South. The Cougars who were seeking to become the first undefeated Class 2A state champ since crosstown rival Lakeville North did so in 2015 rallied from behind in their state quarterfinal against Moorhead then again in the semifinal against Wayzata. The Cardiac Cats were at it again Saturday in St. Paul.

“We have had slow starts” Cougars coach Janne Kivihalme said “but they build up.”

With just a few minutes left in the period Lakeville South finally cashed in. Tanner Ludtke who ironically took that early second period penalty drove toward the net then slid the puck across the crease to a wide open Cam Boche who buried the equalizer.

Eden Prairie (21-1-2) continued to hold the shots advantage from there but both teams generated scoring chances. Smith said the Cougars wore Eden Prairie down.

Boche hit a pipe with roughly two minutes to play. No one could net the winner in regulation. Cody Ticen was awesome in net for Lakeville South as was Zach Hayes for the top-seeded Eagles.

Overtime became a battle of attrition. Lakeville South (20-1-2) leans so heavily on its top line. The Eagles had just played an overtime thriller the night prior. Both squads looked tired but refused to relent in the biggest moment of their hockey careers — as you might expect with two squads of this caliber.

“For a 2-1 game it was probably pretty entertaining” Smith surmised.

Lakeville South was looking to make history while Eden Prairie hoped to avoid repeating it.

The latter occurred when Blake buried the winner. Smith was glad the walk-off was a good goal. Citing Ticen’s dominance Eden Prairie had taken the approach of just trying to throw it low on net.

“Throw it off the pad and hope” Smith said.

Hope for a better outcome than years past. Hope that a bounce finally went the Eagles’ way. Hope that this was finally their year.

It was indeed. Eden Prairie took on a challenging schedule and emerged with just one loss.

The Eagles survived Minnetonka in their section final via an overtime victory.

Eden Prairie’s path at the X was a gantlet — St. Thomas Academy Maple Grove and Lakeville South were all state championship-quality teams.

“There was nothing easy about that title” Smith said. “We were very resilient and very disciplined.”

The schedule won’t get any easier next season. Smith said the Eagles’ title defense will start against Hill-Murray the 2020 state champ.

As the Eagles celebrated their title Saturday countless Cougars sat on the ice a product likely born as much out of exhaustion as disappointment.

The senior trio of Boche Ludtke and Cade Ahrenholz represented one of the best lines in the state and lifted the Cougars to knew heights. This Lakeville South team was great and it too deserved a title. Things just don’t always work out that way.

“We played a good game. We had our chances in the first and second overtime and we had our chances to finish it but the bounces didn’t go in and they got that bounce at the end” Kivihalme said. “But I’m really proud of how the guys competed the entire game. … I think our senior group we’ve had our last three years they’ve set an example of what it takes to be a Lakeville South hockey player by their work ethic and determination”

In the midst of their celebration a handful of Eagles players skated over to provide pats on the shoulders and words to express their respect to the Cougars — a fitting ending to a fantastic hockey game.

If anyone can relate to having your heart broken in downtown St. Paul it’s Eden Prairie.

Just not this time. Thankfully for the sake of Smith. Another championship game loss he said “would’ve ripped my heart out.”

“Not for me personally … but it would’ve been for the kids” he said. “It’s really about these kids and wanting them to enjoy the experience and that’s how they come back to Eden Prairie because they know that we’ll treat them well and we’ll have fun we’re going to compete hard and play good teams and they’re going to get better.”

And maybe when the chips finally fall their way as they did this weekend they’ll win a championship too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1zaHNsLm9yZy9hYm91dC9uZXdzL3RvdXJuYW1lbnQtbmV3cy9sYWtldmlsbGUtc291dGhzLWNhZGUtYWhyZW5ob2x6LXNlbGVjdGVkLWNsYXNzLWFhLWhlcmItYnJvb2tzLWF3YXJk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lakeville South's Cade Ahrenholz selected Class AA Herb Brooks Award winner | News | MSHSL,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.mshsl.org/about/news/tournament-news/lakeville-souths-cade-ahrenholz-selected-class-aa-herb-brooks-award on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1zaHNsLm9yZy9hYm91dC9uZXdzL3RvdXJuYW1lbnQtbmV3cy9sYWtldmlsbGUtc291dGhzLWNhZGUtYWhyZW5ob2x6LXNlbGVjdGVkLWNsYXNzLWFhLWhlcmItYnJvb2tzLWF3YXJk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydGluZ25ld3MuY29tL3VzL25obC9uZXdzL21pbm5lc290YS1ib3lzLWhvY2tleS1zdGF0ZS10b3VybmFtZW50LTIwMjEtcHJldmlldy1zY2hlZHVsZS1saXZlLXN0cmVhbS10b3AtcGxheWVycy10by13YXRjaC9tbDV6ZTZpYjNvZjFoMmxlcTltdDJwZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnesota Boys' Hockey State Tournament 2021: Preview schedule live stream top players to watch,"Things are a little different these days in sports but one thing remains consistent — Minnesota's annual Boys' Hockey State Tournament.

Edina returned to the winner’s circle after a one-year hiatus following a 2-1 victory over Andover in the Class AA girls hockey championship game on Saturday April 3 at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. The Hornets used an efficient offense to solve Andover’s season-long defensive mastery of opponents to win the big-school crown for the fourth time in the past five seasons and gain a measure of revenge for losing its stranglehold on the crown a year ago at the hands of Andover.

Senior defender Lily Hendrikson scored the game-winner early in the second period and the No 2-seeded Hornets (22-0-0) used a stifling defense of its own in keeping the top-seeded Huskies (22-1-0) from a successful title defense and an unblemished season. In 2020 Edina was the top seed and Andover was No. 2 but the Huskies prevailed in a 5-3 victory.

Entering the state tournament Andover had surrendered just seven goals all season. Only one opponent had scored two goals against the Huskies’ smothering defense and that was Elk River/Zimmerman in Andover’s 8-2 victory in the Section 7AA semifinals.

It is the fourth Class AA championship in five seasons for Edina head coach Sami Reber a former Hornets’ standout.

Three goals were scored in a 3 ½-minute span in the second period. Edina scored the last of the spree in building a 2-1 lead after two periods of play. The Hornets’ advantage occurred with 11:15 left in the period on a nifty backhander by senior defender Lily Hendrikson. After being behind the goal as the play unfolded she zipped in front and quickly handled the carom from just beyond the crease.

Just more than 90 seconds earlier senior forward Gabby Krause lifted Andover into a 1-all deadlock. She was camped out in front of the crease when she corralled a pass. Calmly she tapped the puck to her forehand and easily stuffed it past Edina sophomore goalie Uma Corniea. She finished with 30 saves to preserve the victory.

Edina opened the scoring early in the second period when junior forward Berit Lindborg let loose with a shot from the top of the circle after the Hornets had won the faceoff.

The stock of Xylem (NYSE:XYL 30-year Financials) shows every sign of being significantly overvalued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $104.64 per share and the market cap of $18.9 billion Xylem stock is believed to be significantly overvalued. GF Value for Xylem is shown in the chart below.





Xylem Stock Is Believed To Be Significantly Overvalued

Because Xylem is significantly overvalued the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth which averaged 1.1% over the past three years and is estimated to grow 1.98% annually over the next three to five years.

Investing in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company. Xylem has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.60 which is in the middle range of the companies in Industrial Products industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Xylem at 5 out of 10 which indicates that the financial strength of Xylem is fair. This is the debt and cash of Xylem over the past years:

Companies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors who may want to purchase shares. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Xylem has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months the company had a revenue of $4.9 billion and earnings of $1.4 a share. Its operating margin is 10.25% which ranks better than 70% of the companies in Industrial Products industry. Overall the profitability of Xylem is ranked 8 out of 10 which indicates strong profitability. This is the revenue and net income of Xylem over the past years:

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Xylem is 1.1% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Industrial Products industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -7.8% which ranks worse than 74% of the companies in Industrial Products industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Xylem's return on invested capital is 7.43 and its cost of capital is 7.48. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Xylem is shown below:
